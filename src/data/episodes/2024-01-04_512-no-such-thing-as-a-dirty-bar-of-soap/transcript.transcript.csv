00:00:02,00:00:05,"- Hey everyone, welcome to the very first episode"
00:00:05,00:00:08,of Fish in the Year 2024.
00:00:08,00:00:09,This is gonna be a really big year for us.
00:00:09,00:00:11,We're incredibly excited.
00:00:11,00:00:12,It's our 10 year anniversary.
00:00:12,00:00:14,10 years of fish this March.
00:00:14,00:00:18,"That's over 500 episodes, 29,000 facts."
00:00:18,00:00:23,"Actually, so far 29,597 facts, to be exact."
00:00:23,00:00:25,We know that because Andy keeps a spreadsheet.
00:00:25,00:00:27,So thanks to everyone who's been tuning in all this time.
00:00:27,00:00:29,I hope you had a great holiday break.
00:00:29,00:00:31,Hope you had a great New Year's.
00:00:31,00:00:32,We got a great episode for you today.
00:00:32,00:00:34,James is away on holiday at the moment.
00:00:34,00:00:38,"So in his place, we have another James, a Reese James."
00:00:38,00:00:39,I'm sure you're all aware of Reese James.
00:00:39,00:00:41,He's an amazing stand-up comedian.
00:00:41,00:00:44,He's appeared on multiple TV shows and radio shows.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"Most predominantly I would say as a regular or mock the week,"
00:00:47,00:00:49,where for years he was a panelist.
00:00:49,00:00:51,"And actually, if you go to Reese's Instagram account,"
00:00:51,00:00:54,"which is @ReeceJamesy, so that's Reese James,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"but with a Y at the end,"
00:00:56,00:00:58,you'll find the funniest Instagram account out there
00:00:58,00:00:59,in my personal opinion.
00:00:59,00:01:01,It's the reason I basically stayed on Instagram
00:01:01,00:01:02,for a long time.
00:01:02,00:01:04,He's uploaded all of his single one-liners
00:01:04,00:01:06,that he's delivered on the show mock the week
00:01:06,00:01:07,from over the years.
00:01:07,00:01:09,"And honestly, you will be in tears laughing."
00:01:09,00:01:12,"So get that into your life, follow him there."
00:01:12,00:01:14,"And if you want more long-form stuff by him,"
00:01:14,00:01:15,you can go to his YouTube account
00:01:15,00:01:17,where you'll find an entire radio show
00:01:17,00:01:18,that's been uploaded there.
00:01:18,00:01:21,And that's called Reese Search.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"As in Reese's name, but mixed with research, Reese Search."
00:01:24,00:01:27,And to describe that show the best way would be to say
00:01:27,00:01:29,"it's answering all of life's big questions,"
00:01:29,00:01:32,but done in a sort of brass-eye mold.
00:01:32,00:01:34,It's incredibly funny and you must check it out.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"But in the meantime, don't go anywhere"
00:01:36,00:01:39,'cause you can enjoy him here on No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"So here we go, on with the show."
00:01:54,00:01:57,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:57,00:02:00,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:00,00:02:02,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:02:04,00:02:08,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Reese James."
00:02:08,00:02:10,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:10,00:02:12,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:12,00:02:15,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:15,00:02:19,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Reese."
00:02:19,00:02:23,- Soap is the best way to move a building.
00:02:23,00:02:24,How do you feel about that?
00:02:24,00:02:27,- That was so dramatically presented.
00:02:27,00:02:28,I really enjoyed it.
00:02:28,00:02:30,"- And I actually had other options,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,I had other options of ways to introduce that headline.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"I went with that basic, really simple one."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"But I was gonna say something like,"
00:02:36,00:02:41,"washing, removing stains, moving buildings."
00:02:41,00:02:43,Just three of the hats soap wears.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"That's what I was gonna go with,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"but it's the first fact, keep it simple."
00:02:47,00:02:49,"But just so you know, I had that in the locker."
00:02:49,00:02:50,"- No, no, no, absolutely."
00:02:50,00:02:51,I think you played it right though.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:53,00:02:54,"- Yeah, so what's the story here then?"
00:02:54,00:02:56,"- So in Nova Scotia, at last,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,I felt very local news this story.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"So, and there was like a local news video about it."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"But basically, an old Victorian building"
00:03:05,00:03:09,that was mostly used as a hotel for about a hundred years.
00:03:09,00:03:10,It was gonna get knocked down.
00:03:10,00:03:12,Then a company bought it because they wanted to attach it
00:03:12,00:03:15,"to a planned apartment block, sort of 30 feet away."
00:03:15,00:03:19,"And instead of moving it the traditional way with rollers,"
00:03:19,00:03:22,"they used 700 bars of ivory soap,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,because that's the softest soap.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"And therefore, the slippiest."
00:03:24,00:03:25,- All right.
00:03:25,00:03:26,- And they did that successfully
00:03:26,00:03:28,to then get it onto new foundations.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"And then once that is complete,"
00:03:29,00:03:32,they are going to move the whole thing back.
00:03:32,00:03:32,- What?
00:03:32,00:03:33,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:03:33,00:03:34,- Why?
00:03:34,00:03:35,"- That's the end, I don't know."
00:03:35,00:03:36,"They're gonna move, 'cause basically it's now,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,"it's like a protected landmark of this old building, I think."
00:03:38,00:03:41,"And so, they were gonna restore the whole thing"
00:03:41,00:03:42,"and put it back to where it was,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,which to me just suggests you wanted to move it with soap.
00:03:44,00:03:45,You didn't need to move this.
00:03:45,00:03:47,"- Yeah, if it's protected,"
00:03:47,00:03:51,"but we've also proved beyond doubt that it's mobile,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,it doesn't matter where it is as long as we're protecting it.
00:03:53,00:03:54,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:54,00:03:55,- Taking it on the road.
00:03:55,00:03:56,(all laughing)
00:03:56,00:03:59,- I found it amazing how little soap you need to move.
00:03:59,00:04:01,"I mean, I looked at the photo, this is a big building."
00:04:01,00:04:04,"700 bars of soap, it's obviously lots of bars of soap,"
00:04:04,00:04:05,but it's not that many windows.
00:04:05,00:04:06,"- Surface area wise, it doesn't feel like a lot."
00:04:06,00:04:07,- Right.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- Well, they didn't even use 700 bars."
00:04:09,00:04:10,"- Oh, really?"
00:04:10,00:04:11,"- Yeah, they took some home, didn't they?"
00:04:11,00:04:12,"I think some of the builders took,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,there was 20 to 40 bars left.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"So they used most of it, they estimated quite well."
00:04:17,00:04:18,"- Yeah, no, but I mean--"
00:04:18,00:04:19,- At last.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"- Oh my gosh, I'm gonna hear that a lot."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"- The crazy thing is, this is not the first time"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"that soap's been used to move buildings,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,but it's clearly an essential ingredient
00:04:29,00:04:31,"as part of the process of what they're doing,"
00:04:31,00:04:32,"and it was as they were getting ready to move it,"
00:04:32,00:04:35,"that's they went, we don't have any soap."
00:04:35,00:04:36,So it's not even like they bought it
00:04:36,00:04:38,in industrial bulk amounts.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"What ended up happening was the guy who was in charge of it,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"his wife, Leanne, had to run to 15 shops"
00:04:43,00:04:47,"around the area, and by using 970 something bucks,"
00:04:47,00:04:50,the equivalent of 700 parts of soap.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"- When you put it like that,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,"it suddenly sounds quite taskmaster, doesn't it?"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"It's like there's a panning there of like, oh my God."
00:04:56,00:04:58,"- And he wasn't, this guy, Sheldon Rushden,"
00:04:58,00:05:02,"the lead builder guy, said, I think he said at first,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,"he thought, I'll just ask my wife"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"if we can use some of our soap from home,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"and it was only when she said,"
00:05:08,00:05:09,"we're absolutely not doing that,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,I'm not giving up our personal supply
00:05:11,00:05:13,"that she offered to drive around,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"which made me think, how many bars of soap"
00:05:15,00:05:16,are you stoppiling in your house?
00:05:16,00:05:17,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:05:17,00:05:19,"- But also, how precious are you"
00:05:19,00:05:22,about where the soap is your personal supply or not?
00:05:22,00:05:23,- Exactly.
00:05:23,00:05:24,"- Sorry, surely, if it was like,"
00:05:24,00:05:25,"yeah, you can use some of our old soap,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,but use some of the budget to get us some new soap.
00:05:28,00:05:29,Surely the same thing.
00:05:29,00:05:31,"- You're right, as you've written diary entries"
00:05:31,00:05:32,"on the wrapping. - Yeah, it's got sentimental value,"
00:05:32,00:05:33,her own personal or soap.
00:05:33,00:05:35,"- I think once you're mixing work with pleasure,"
00:05:35,00:05:36,it's sort of...
00:05:36,00:05:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:38,00:05:41,"- And it's, we are not meant,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,"we're not actually sponsored by Ivory Soap this week,"
00:05:43,00:05:46,"but it is very, very soft apparently, and that's great."
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- So, and if you do use the offer code fish,"
00:05:48,00:05:50,you are gonna get 20% off all of it.
00:05:50,00:05:52,"- You'll get nothing, you'll get absolutely nothing."
00:05:52,00:05:53,You'll get a weird look.
00:05:53,00:05:56,"But, so what the basic method you use"
00:05:56,00:05:58,"to move the building is,"
00:05:58,00:05:59,"so you dig under the building, don't you,"
00:05:59,00:06:02,"and then you put steel beams under the building,"
00:06:02,00:06:05,then you lift the whole thing up by one inch
00:06:05,00:06:07,"on hydraulic jacks, just jack it up one inch,"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"and you slide the soap underneath it on trays,"
00:06:10,00:06:13,"and then I think you lower, then you lower an inch,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,"and it just kind of squishes the soap,"
00:06:15,00:06:17,but it's incredibly soapy now.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"- Yeah, so you leave it overnight to squish the soap, right?"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"You sit it on the soap overnight,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,which I feel like the building's heavy enough
00:06:22,00:06:25,that you only need to sit it on the soap for 10 minutes.
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- These guys are experts, haven't they?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,- They know what they're doing.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"- And then what, you're trying to create"
00:06:28,00:06:31,a sort of slip and slide aspect to it.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"I bet they can just push it,"
00:06:32,00:06:33,"and it's just about the weight you push it,"
00:06:33,00:06:34,where it's like curling.
00:06:34,00:06:36,And then it just doesn't land in the bit
00:06:36,00:06:38,"you want the building to be, and eventually it's like,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"nah, I squished it too hard, it's gone in the sea!"
00:06:41,00:06:43,- It's a thousand of them with brooms created.
00:06:43,00:06:45,- Have any of you curled?
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Never.
00:06:46,00:06:48,"- I've curled, I've curled, I've curled."
00:06:48,00:06:50,"Sorry, but I curl."
00:06:50,00:06:53,I was trained by the British Olympic curling duo
00:06:53,00:06:55,for the Winter Olympics just gone.
00:06:55,00:06:55,"- Yeah, clung?"
00:06:55,00:06:57,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, old big time."
00:06:57,00:07:00,"Whose names are, and then just insert them,"
00:07:00,00:07:00,if you want to.
00:07:00,00:07:03,(laughing)
00:07:03,00:07:04,They were lovely.
00:07:04,00:07:07,- Why were you hoping to be the third member of the team?
00:07:07,00:07:11,"- Yeah, I did, I think, four team GBs, like YouTube thing,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,"I went and had to do four Winter Olympic sports,"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"because in the Summer Olympic podcast,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"I had said, as a joke,"
00:07:17,00:07:20,I reckon I could master any Olympic sport in a day.
00:07:20,00:07:21,- Right.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"- And I was just, you know, I was being hyperbolic,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"and then suddenly their next series I said, go on then,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,and I mastered none of them in several days.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"One of them's curling though, which was the easiest,"
00:07:29,00:07:30,"but it's like insane at first,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"because also they're not very technical with their language,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"so they literally just call it grippy shoe and slippy shoe,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,and you have one of these.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"- Oh, that's like bowling."
00:07:37,00:07:38,"- Yeah, right, right, right."
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- You're basically in the slippy, yeah, yeah."
00:07:40,00:07:41,"- So you have, they gave me like this thing"
00:07:41,00:07:44,that goes under your shin as you slide along at first.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"It's basically like a little ice skate, but it just rests."
00:07:47,00:07:48,"I think you just have that at first,"
00:07:48,00:07:51,and then you're supposed to just slide on your actual shin.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"But they give you that at first,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"that's like barriers in bowling, I reckon."
00:07:54,00:07:57,Or like the thing you push the ball down to make in.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"- I see, I see."
00:07:58,00:07:59,How did you do?
00:07:59,00:08:00,"- Pretty badly, I think."
00:08:00,00:08:02,But it was better than when I had to do speed skating
00:08:02,00:08:05,and smashed open my chin on the last shot of the whole thing.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"- Oh, wow."
00:08:06,00:08:08,"- Yeah, that was much worse."
00:08:08,00:08:10,- They should have given you a little ski
00:08:10,00:08:12,for the bottom of your chin.
00:08:12,00:08:14,Like you'll need a curling for that situation.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"- We just come in today dressed fully in skis, by the way."
00:08:17,00:08:19,"Head to toe, skis for every limb."
00:08:19,00:08:21,"- Well, the only issue with the idea with this building"
00:08:21,00:08:23,being the curling system is you could probably get it
00:08:23,00:08:24,"into place with one big push,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,but then you might have a rival building behind you
00:08:26,00:08:29,knock you out using the same system.
00:08:29,00:08:33,"- You know, the Titanic was put on soap."
00:08:33,00:08:36,I think we've said before that the Titanic was put on soap
00:08:36,00:08:38,"to go down the slipway, to get in like the whale blubber"
00:08:38,00:08:39,and all that sort of stuff.
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- Yeah, it was tallow and oil and soap,"
00:08:41,00:08:44,and it was 20 tons of it that was used.
00:08:44,00:08:45,"It was kind of amazing, but obviously."
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- That's more than 700 bars, isn't it?"
00:08:47,00:08:48,- Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- But I did, so I was just reading a bit more about that."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"I'd never read this before,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,"that workers, they would go to the slipway afterwards"
00:08:52,00:08:55,and try and gather up any spare soap that was left over.
00:08:55,00:08:56,"- Oh, to use themselves."
00:08:56,00:08:57,- Interesting.
00:08:57,00:09:00,- But it was also covered in sort of oil and--
00:09:00,00:09:01,"- You could probably wash it, right?"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"You could probably rush away that,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,and then you've got the soap sitting underneath.
00:09:05,00:09:05,- I guess so.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- Yeah, I don't think soap gets,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,'cause you can just wash off the upper layer.
00:09:09,00:09:10,- There is a big debate online
00:09:10,00:09:12,about whether you can get soap dirty.
00:09:12,00:09:14,(laughing)
00:09:14,00:09:15,- Welcome to the show.
00:09:15,00:09:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:09:16,00:09:19,- This is the kind of controversy we try on the way.
00:09:19,00:09:20,"- Of course you can, of course you can."
00:09:20,00:09:22,I'm willing to weigh in on this debate.
00:09:22,00:09:24,"Of course you can get soap, are you mad?"
00:09:24,00:09:25,Of course you can get soap dirty.
00:09:25,00:09:26,"- I believe, of course you can get soap dirty,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,but it doesn't stop it cleaning you.
00:09:28,00:09:29,So it doesn't matter.
00:09:29,00:09:30,- Interesting.
00:09:30,00:09:31,"- If you're soap's dirty,"
00:09:31,00:09:31,it doesn't make a difference.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"- Yeah, the level of dirty,"
00:09:32,00:09:35,it would have to be for the dirt on it to make you dirtier.
00:09:35,00:09:36,- Yeah.
00:09:36,00:09:38,- That way the cleanliness of the soap being applied to you
00:09:38,00:09:40,is so dirty.
00:09:40,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:42,- But you're at that point right off that bar of soap.
00:09:42,00:09:43,"- Sometimes in horrible pubs,"
00:09:43,00:09:47,there will be a bar of soap at the sinks.
00:09:47,00:09:47,"And you look at it and you think,"
00:09:47,00:09:49,"oh, I'm actually, I'm not sure."
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- Well, this is a thing."
00:09:50,00:09:52,"There was a report that was done,"
00:09:52,00:09:54,a sort of a research project to look into
00:09:54,00:09:58,how clean actually are in bathrooms like pubs and stuff.
00:09:58,00:09:59,How clean is the soap that you're getting?
00:09:59,00:10:01,And they've worked out that some of the dispensers
00:10:01,00:10:03,"are left for so long,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,"where they're not maintained and they get cracks in it,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"that you can go to the toilet, wash your hands with the soap"
00:10:08,00:10:10,"and leave with dirtier hands,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,"then you arrived with,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"yeah, because they found 15 types of bacteria"
00:10:13,00:10:16,that were sitting on these dispensers
00:10:16,00:10:18,that would make it onto your hand as part of the soap.
00:10:18,00:10:19,- Right.
00:10:19,00:10:20,"- And, yeah."
00:10:20,00:10:22,"- Yeah, same pull handles in the toilet,"
00:10:22,00:10:25,"when you think, I know what people are doing in here."
00:10:25,00:10:28,- I'm gonna make a call on this toilet thing
00:10:28,00:10:30,and say it doesn't make your hands dirtier
00:10:30,00:10:31,than after you wash them.
00:10:31,00:10:33,'Cause it doesn't matter if there's bacteria
00:10:33,00:10:33,"on the soap dispenser,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,"on the soap dispenser, it does matter."
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- Well, yeah."
00:10:36,00:10:37,- Don't even see it.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"But on the soap dispenser,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,isn't the point of soap that it gets onto your hands
00:10:40,00:10:43,and then it makes the water and the dirt on your hands
00:10:43,00:10:45,more slippery and so it gets them off
00:10:45,00:10:47,and it doesn't matter if there's bacteria on the dispenser.
00:10:47,00:10:48,"- Yes, it does."
00:10:48,00:10:49,- The soap immediately gets all of that off.
00:10:49,00:10:50,"So, which is why it doesn't matter"
00:10:50,00:10:52,if a bar of soap is dirty.
00:10:52,00:10:53,"- No, but that's the amazing thing about soap"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"and it's why it's so incredible that we,"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"you know, as a species discovered it millennia ago,"
00:10:59,00:11:02,it not only makes the dirt and stuff on your hands slippery
00:11:02,00:11:05,"to slide off, but it also has this structure"
00:11:05,00:11:08,which tears open bacteria and viruses.
00:11:08,00:11:09,It's amazing.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- Yeah.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"- Like it's, okay, I just, so I want to read this"
00:11:12,00:11:13,'cause I don't want to get it wrong.
00:11:13,00:11:16,Each molecule of soap has a head which bonds with water
00:11:16,00:11:18,"and then a tail which hates water, right?"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"So, and sort of it's hydrophobic, you know,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,and tries to avoid it at all costs.
00:11:22,00:11:23,- That's horrible identity crisis.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"- I know, I know, I know."
00:11:24,00:11:25,- It must.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- It's poor molecule.
00:11:26,00:11:29,- And so the tail seeks oils and fats and things.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"And basically, bacteria and viruses,"
00:11:31,00:11:34,"they're surrounded by a lipid membrane, a fatty membrane."
00:11:34,00:11:36,"And when they touch soap, the soap kind of envelops it"
00:11:36,00:11:38,"and also the soap molecule tails,"
00:11:38,00:11:40,"which are trying to avoid water,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,realize there is a fatty layer on that bacterium
00:11:42,00:11:45,"and burrow into it, they sort of wedge themselves in"
00:11:45,00:11:47,and that reps the bacterium apart.
00:11:47,00:11:49,So that's the other thing that's going on
00:11:49,00:11:50,as well as making things slippier.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Yeah.
00:11:51,00:11:52,- It's just amazing.
00:11:52,00:11:53,- It's incredible.
00:11:53,00:11:54,- And it smells nice.
00:11:54,00:11:55,- It smells nice.
00:11:55,00:11:56,- Lest we forget.
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Naturally.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- That was the main comment of the builders
00:11:58,00:12:00,after they moved that building.
00:12:00,00:12:00,- And it smelled nice.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- Honestly, they said they went away smelling great."
00:12:02,00:12:03,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:09,"- Do you know though, what is better out of,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,"I feel like I've presented this in a really obvious way now,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,out of antibacterial soap and just a bar of soap.
00:12:13,00:12:15,- Anti-bacterial.
00:12:15,00:12:16,"- Dan, you idiot."
00:12:16,00:12:19,"I mean, I even said it, so the answer was clear."
00:12:19,00:12:21,"No, there's a serious worry that people are converting"
00:12:21,00:12:24,to antibacterial soap a lot and hand soap.
00:12:24,00:12:26,"And there's a guy called Professor Lithko,"
00:12:26,00:12:28,who works at Monash University in Australia.
00:12:28,00:12:31,And he says that he thinks they should all be banned
00:12:31,00:12:34,antimicrobial soaps because they're not better
00:12:34,00:12:36,"than just a bar of soap, even though we,"
00:12:36,00:12:37,"I mean, we've got them all over our house now."
00:12:37,00:12:39,There's a COVID hangover.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Not better than a bar of soap.
00:12:40,00:12:42,"Hand soap is why you don't use water,"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"are significantly less good because, you know,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,"when you get a hand sanitizer, that's a lot less good."
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- Yeah, is it?"
00:12:49,00:12:50,"- Yeah, 'cause the water doesn't,"
00:12:50,00:12:54,you need the water to scrub away and wash off that layer.
00:12:54,00:12:57,And he says that they're causing a huge amount
00:12:57,00:13:02,of antibiotic resistance because we're shoving
00:13:02,00:13:04,this antibacterial soap at our hands
00:13:04,00:13:05,and all the bacteria is becoming kind of superbugs
00:13:05,00:13:06,on our hands.
00:13:06,00:13:07,- Yes.
00:13:07,00:13:08,- And he explains. - They're attracting.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- Exactly, we're all gonna have"
00:13:10,00:13:12,just these superbugs living on us.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"So really, and this really surprised me,"
00:13:14,00:13:18,"it's not about the antimicrobial chemical properties,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,"really, as much as it is about the scrub."
00:13:20,00:13:22,"But actually, the key is, as long as you scrub"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"your hands really hard with the water, it scrapes them off."
00:13:25,00:13:26,- And with the soap?
00:13:26,00:13:27,- And with the soap.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"- It does, all right, but soap is the thing, really."
00:13:28,00:13:30,"- But yes, there's definitely something psychological"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"about the smell and presentation, though, right,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,"of how clean you feel, 'cause natural soaps don't feel,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,"they obviously are better, and you could make soap"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"out of just oil and lard, basically, can't you?"
00:13:41,00:13:42,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:42,00:13:44,"- You know, I find rubbing oil on my body,"
00:13:44,00:13:45,"I don't feel, and lard,"
00:13:45,00:13:46,"- It's lime, isn't it?"
00:13:46,00:13:47,- It's being massively clean.
00:13:47,00:13:48,"And they're saying it's like that,"
00:13:48,00:13:51,and the scrub of that is what actually makes you clean.
00:13:51,00:13:52,- Why am I getting so turned on?
00:13:52,00:13:53,- I need it.
00:13:53,00:13:54,(laughing)
00:13:54,00:13:58,"- Well, I shouldn't be rubbing myself, but you need,"
00:13:58,00:14:01,"I need, it has to have a scent, or I won't feel."
00:14:01,00:14:02,- It does it.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"- Well, also, I've not used a bar of soap for years,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,and I find a bar of soap disgusting.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- Haven't you, I always only use bars."
00:14:09,00:14:11,"- Never a bar, never a bar."
00:14:11,00:14:12,Come on.
00:14:12,00:14:12,- I don't mind a bar of soap.
00:14:12,00:14:13,- Are you a cartoon?
00:14:13,00:14:14,Are you all cartoon?
00:14:14,00:14:15,(laughing)
00:14:15,00:14:16,- What do you do?
00:14:16,00:14:20,"- I don't use, in our house, we have the, yeah,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,we have liquid soap as opposed to a bar of soap.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"- Yeah, we pump a little pump,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,and I like a shower or gel type situation.
00:14:26,00:14:27,- I've never heard of pump soap.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"I'm familiar with the concept,"
00:14:28,00:14:31,"but you should just feel very guilty,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"because of course, you are single-handedly destroying"
00:14:33,00:14:35,the world with all of your plastics.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- No palm oil, always say no palm oil, please."
00:14:36,00:14:38,"What, it's the issue of plastic?"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"- Yeah, plastic, is it around?"
00:14:40,00:14:41,"- Right, who are you saying it to?"
00:14:41,00:14:43,Are you saying your personal soap?
00:14:43,00:14:44,"- No palm oil, please."
00:14:44,00:14:47,"- To my bottom, sorry, I don't make that clear."
00:14:47,00:14:50,(laughing)
00:14:51,00:14:54,"Most soaps, again, I actually haven't bought bar in ages."
00:14:54,00:14:58,Aren't they covered in quite a plastic-y kind of wrapping?
00:14:58,00:14:59,"- Yes, Dan, but--"
00:14:59,00:14:59,"- Paper, but--"
00:14:59,00:15:00,- Is it paper these days?
00:15:00,00:15:01,(laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- Okay, there's a, right, there is a spectrum,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"what we see is a spectrum is here,"
00:15:05,00:15:08,"from Anna, who is this only old-fashioned bar of soap"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"that have to be cut from the mother block,"
00:15:09,00:15:13,and then wrapped in cruise-proof paper.
00:15:13,00:15:15,(laughing)
00:15:15,00:15:18,"Up to Dan, who has like those auto dispensers"
00:15:18,00:15:20,at every doorway in his house.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:21,00:15:24,"- So, the other board, this is such a good thing to say,"
00:15:24,00:15:27,"but actually, if you use bar soap,"
00:15:27,00:15:28,it's got a slightly lower carbon footprint
00:15:28,00:15:30,"than the travel emissions,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,"'cause you're not, you know, with liquid soap,"
00:15:31,00:15:34,you're mostly transporting the water.
00:15:34,00:15:36,"- Yeah, but what about, okay,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,but what about the satisfaction of a foam burst?
00:15:38,00:15:39,You ever used a foam burst?
00:15:39,00:15:41,"I've, okay, briefly obsessed with foam bursts."
00:15:41,00:15:42,- What is a foam burst?
00:15:42,00:15:43,- It's just a soap that is literally designed
00:15:43,00:15:46,"to become extra foamy when you're lathering,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,"and so, you know, you feel, it's exciting."
00:15:48,00:15:51,"- It's very exciting, where to start or end your day."
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Just, feels like you're not engaging"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"with the ethical issues here,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,where you get very much set and foam based.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"- Listen, and I'm happy with this girl record,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,I couldn't give a fuck about the ethical issues at all.
00:16:00,00:16:02,(laughing)
00:16:02,00:16:05,I flew here.
00:16:05,00:16:07,(laughing)
00:16:07,00:16:10,(upbeat music)
00:16:10,00:16:15,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,and that is Andy.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- My fact is that the 19th century author,"
00:16:18,00:16:23,"Thomas Hardy, had two funerals at the same time."
00:16:23,00:16:24,"- Did you say 19th century author,"
00:16:24,00:16:26,so we didn't confuse him with the 21st century actor?
00:16:26,00:16:27,'Cause he's still alive.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"- This is Tom Hardy, Thomas Hardy,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"who wrote, I'm confusing it already,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"Jude the Obscure, Tess of the Durbovilles,"
00:16:34,00:16:35,Mayor of Castor Bridge.
00:16:35,00:16:37,- We don't need the full bibliography.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"- About 900 poems, he was a big deal."
00:16:39,00:16:40,- He was.
00:16:40,00:16:41,"- He was mega famous, actually."
00:16:41,00:16:43,"And that was sort of what led to this problem, basically."
00:16:43,00:16:46,He was meant to be buried in Dorset
00:16:46,00:16:49,"in his native Stinsford with his first wife, right?"
00:16:49,00:16:51,And it was all ready to go.
00:16:51,00:16:54,"There was a space on the tombstone for him,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,"his name to be added, you know?"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"And then he died, and then his friends,"
00:16:59,00:17:03,"including James Barry of Peter Pan fame,"
00:17:03,00:17:04,"and Sidney Cockrell,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,"who slightly less well-treated by history,"
00:17:07,00:17:08,"but you know, I'm sure a big deal at the time."
00:17:08,00:17:10,"They went to his home basically on his death,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,"and they said, we think he should be buried"
00:17:12,00:17:13,in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"He's a huge, huge deal."
00:17:16,00:17:20,"And they kind of bullied Thomas Hardy's second wife,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Florence, into going along with it, you know?"
00:17:22,00:17:22,- Right.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"- She sort of said, well, okay, fine."
00:17:24,00:17:29,"So they struck a deal whereby he went to Poets Corner,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,and his heart went to Stinsford.
00:17:31,00:17:35,And they both had a funeral at 2 p.m.
00:17:35,00:17:38,"on the 16th of January, 1928, and that was the..."
00:17:38,00:17:40,"- I mean, real Sophie's choice for his second wife."
00:17:40,00:17:42,"Sorry, you're either gonna be buried in Poets Corner,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"which is not where he's supposed to be,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,"or with your other wife, your previous wife."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"And, oh no, we'll just take your heart to your previous wife."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"- I know, it's really..."
00:17:51,00:17:51,- Where's your mother?
00:17:51,00:17:53,Where the fuck are you coming in all of this?
00:17:53,00:17:53,You can take a look.
00:17:53,00:17:54,- Where am I ending up?
00:17:54,00:17:55,- What?
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:56,00:17:57,- It's true.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"And also, like, well, I think reading into it more,"
00:18:00,00:18:02,"I think his family was there as well,"
00:18:02,00:18:03,so that was kind of...
00:18:03,00:18:04,- Stinsford.
00:18:04,00:18:05,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:18:05,00:18:06,"Yeah, no, not Poets Corner."
00:18:06,00:18:09,(all laughing)
00:18:09,00:18:11,"And so, because his wife, his first wife,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,"they didn't particularly get on too well,"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"like, deep into the marriage."
00:18:14,00:18:16,"To begin with, they did, but there was a lot of..."
00:18:16,00:18:17,"- No, it was a..."
00:18:17,00:18:18,- There's a painful marriage
00:18:18,00:18:20,according to a lot of the friends
00:18:20,00:18:21,and close relatives and so on.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"- And her, herself, and him, himself."
00:18:24,00:18:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:25,00:18:28,So why did he want to be there?
00:18:28,00:18:29,"- Well, the family, I guess."
00:18:29,00:18:31,She just happened to be there.
00:18:31,00:18:31,- Right.
00:18:31,00:18:33,- I didn't know he felt huge regret
00:18:33,00:18:36,"about what a dick he was to her, it was said."
00:18:36,00:18:37,He treated her quite bad.
00:18:37,00:18:39,She kept a book.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Yes.
00:18:40,00:18:41,- That's the weirdest title I've ever heard.
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- Yeah, so he found after she died,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"and they did have this difficult relationship, didn't they?"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"And she's a very interesting, weird character."
00:18:49,00:18:51,"But he found in the attic, after she died,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"a diary that she'd written, basically called something like,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"""What I Think of My Husband."""
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- Yeah, that's it."
00:18:56,00:18:57,- And just loads of bitching about him.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And he did, and he feels so awful."
00:19:00,00:19:02,And he felt really guilty reading that.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"And I think he burned it, so we don't know."
00:19:03,00:19:04,"- Immediately, yeah."
00:19:04,00:19:06,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:19:06,00:19:07,- I feel so bad about it.
00:19:07,00:19:08,"Okay, let's just pop that in the fire."
00:19:08,00:19:10,- He burned it on the gaslight.
00:19:10,00:19:11,(laughing)
00:19:11,00:19:13,- I think that's Every Husband's Nightmare.
00:19:13,00:19:14,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:14,00:19:14,"- It's fine to go for it, yeah."
00:19:14,00:19:16,"- It's titled that, oh my God."
00:19:16,00:19:19,"- It's not a dream for every wife, I'm gonna tell you."
00:19:19,00:19:20,"- You're not picking up a book called,"
00:19:20,00:19:21,"""What I Think of My Husband"""
00:19:21,00:19:23,"and expecting a positive review, are you?"
00:19:23,00:19:24,- He's great!
00:19:24,00:19:25,- End of book.
00:19:25,00:19:26,- Oh dear.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"- Always helps, he was listened."
00:19:28,00:19:29,- She lived in the attic.
00:19:29,00:19:31,She just moved into the attic after a while.
00:19:31,00:19:34,A while after their relationship started to go really wrong.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"She was kind of the, she was the sane woman in the attic."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"- Well, I mean, sources differ on the sanity level, right?"
00:19:40,00:19:42,"- And then he remarried, he married Florence,"
00:19:42,00:19:44,who was 39 years his junior.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"There's a big difference, though."
00:19:46,00:19:50,"- The list of, not even guests at the funeral of Thomas Hardy,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,but the Paul Bearers.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"You had, just before mentioned, James Barry,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,J.M. Barry was one of the Paul Bearers.
00:19:56,00:19:58,You had George Bernard Shaw.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"You had the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,as one of the Paul Bearers.
00:20:03,00:20:05,"And then, you know, various other names"
00:20:05,00:20:06,that were obviously massive.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"- Two Prime Ministers being Paul Bearers,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,but one of them wasn't Prime Minister yet.
00:20:09,00:20:11,"- That's right, leader of the opposition at the time."
00:20:11,00:20:14,"- Ramsay McDonald, who was then the first Labour Prime Minister."
00:20:14,00:20:15,Rudyard Kipling.
00:20:15,00:20:15,"- And Kipling, yeah."
00:20:15,00:20:16,- Paul's the Paul Bearer.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"- I mean, I guess, is this that surprising?"
00:20:18,00:20:19,"Like, if Richard Ellsman dies,"
00:20:19,00:20:21,I wouldn't be massively surprised
00:20:21,00:20:23,"if like Sebastian Folks, Ian McEwan."
00:20:23,00:20:24,"- Yeah, but this is the equivalent"
00:20:24,00:20:27,of Richard Sunak and Keir Starmer also turning up.
00:20:27,00:20:28,- I don't think you get a lot of volunteers
00:20:28,00:20:30,to carry that coffin.
00:20:30,00:20:31,He's a big lad.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"- Oh yeah, your Paul Bearer list would be very long,"
00:20:33,00:20:34,wouldn't it?
00:20:34,00:20:35,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:37,- Paul McEwan's idea was 'cause he had 10.
00:20:37,00:20:38,- Did he?
00:20:38,00:20:38,- Which feels like a lot.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:40,- Normally you can fit six.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"- Yeah, good point."
00:20:41,00:20:42,- You know.
00:20:42,00:20:43,- Very squeezed in.
00:20:43,00:20:43,"- I know, I know."
00:20:43,00:20:45,- I think he was definitely quite puny as a baby.
00:20:45,00:20:47,"And his mother gave birth and they went,"
00:20:47,00:20:49,"well, we'll set that aside 'cause it's not alive"
00:20:49,00:20:51,and we'll retrieve the mother.
00:20:51,00:20:54,And they put him to one side thinking that he wasn't alive.
00:20:54,00:20:54,"And then the midwife,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"who probably wasn't doing a job particularly well,"
00:20:56,00:20:57,"said after a few minutes,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,"oh, hang on a second, this baby's alive."
00:20:59,00:21:00,We should keep it going.
00:21:00,00:21:01,- Good grief.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"- And he was very,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,"and for the first few weeks,"
00:21:03,00:21:04,everyone assumed that he would die.
00:21:04,00:21:08,"And he was quite a weakling, I think, when he was younger."
00:21:08,00:21:10,- Are you guys any fans of his stuff?
00:21:10,00:21:11,- Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:12,"- Yeah, I read 'Test of the Doverbills' at school"
00:21:12,00:21:16,"and it was the first, as it were, literature book"
00:21:16,00:21:17,"that I'd write up until then,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,I was reading 'Spin Off Indiana Jones Novelizations'
00:21:19,00:21:21,and it blew my mind.
00:21:21,00:21:22,I thought it was fantastic.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- Yeah.
00:21:23,00:21:25,- And he wrote my favorite poem.
00:21:25,00:21:26,- Which one?
00:21:26,00:21:27,"- 'The Darkling Thrush', amazing poem."
00:21:27,00:21:29,If you wanna read it.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"- Well, he considered himself a poet"
00:21:30,00:21:31,"more than an author, didn't he?"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"Despite these, like, similar--"
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- He was much more successful as an author, right?"
00:21:34,00:21:35,"That's just like, yeah."
00:21:35,00:21:38,- He was extremely successful as a poet as well.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"And the last 30 years of his life,"
00:21:39,00:21:41,"he only wrote poetry, didn't he?"
00:21:41,00:21:42,- Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"- Well, he had success, but this, to me,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"is like, Ant and Deck considering themselves musicians."
00:21:46,00:21:49,"But they've been successful in the charts,"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"but you wouldn't say the famous, he had a repertoire."
00:21:53,00:21:55,"- Musicians, Ant and Deck, have died."
00:21:55,00:21:56,It's not what's gonna be--
00:21:56,00:21:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:56,00:21:57,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"- But this, to me, is just like, you know,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,his Twitter bio would just be one of those ones
00:22:01,00:22:02,that's just like a list.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"Poet, author, son, father, husband, twice."
00:22:05,00:22:08,"- For anyone who's listening who's not a fan,"
00:22:08,00:22:09,"they're basically, the books are,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,"they're amazing, but they're also incredibly gloomy."
00:22:12,00:22:15,"As in, they feature all sorts of, you know,"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"terribly unhappy people, you know,"
00:22:17,00:22:21,making poor decisions and getting on badly with each other.
00:22:21,00:22:22,That's--
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- Although, I think that he has a reputation."
00:22:24,00:22:28,Far from the running crowd is not a gloomy book.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Everyone always says such sad books,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,"but yeah, don't read ""Judy Obscure,"" if you like."
00:22:31,00:22:33,"- So ""Judy Obscure,"" the Guardian, a few years ago,"
00:22:33,00:22:35,they produced this fantastic infographic
00:22:35,00:22:38,on what each book contains in terms of various traumas.
00:22:38,00:22:41,"Right, so ""Judy Obscure"" was by a long shot, the winner,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,"but it features, they just listed,"
00:22:43,00:22:44,"like, in little bullet points, what it features."
00:22:44,00:22:46,"An unhappy relationship, a death,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"another unhappy relationship, another unhappy relationship,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"grinding poverty, suicide, murder, murder."
00:22:51,00:22:54,That's one child who kills two others and then himself.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"Miscarriage, alcoholism, another death,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"and animal genitalia-related injury,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,"which I had forgotten about,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,"but which does feature in ""Judy Obscure."""
00:23:01,00:23:02,"- Does it, what happens? - Which bit is that?"
00:23:02,00:23:04,"- Jude, he meets his wife, Arabella,"
00:23:04,00:23:09,"when she throws a pig's-pizzle, a pig's penis at him,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,and it wallops him on the bones.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"- It's like, when you said animal-related"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"genital injury, I would never have guessed that."
00:23:17,00:23:19,I was going to something biting something.
00:23:19,00:23:21,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:21,00:23:23,- But I never would have thought
00:23:23,00:23:25,it was the animal's genital that was in--
00:23:25,00:23:26,- It was doing the injury.
00:23:26,00:23:29,It caused it to be a different part of his body.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"- No, yeah, dismembered pig dick was not."
00:23:31,00:23:32,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Which is what I saw coming."
00:23:32,00:23:35,- On my bingo card for 1894.
00:23:35,00:23:38,(all laughing)
00:23:38,00:23:41,"- I, so, got the training today to King's Cross,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"and I had a bit of time on my hands,"
00:23:43,00:23:47,and I went to see something pretty incredible.
00:23:47,00:23:48,- The tree? - Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:50,I went to see the hardy tree.
00:23:50,00:23:51,- What's that?
00:23:51,00:23:53,"- The hardy tree is Old St. Pancras Church,"
00:23:53,00:23:56,"which is just up the road from St. Pancras Station,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"international, and it's a church"
00:23:58,00:24:00,"where you have a graveyard there,"
00:24:00,00:24:04,"and when hardy, prior to becoming a full-time writer,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"I think maybe he was dabbling in writing at that point,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,"but he was an architect beforehand,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"and he used to work in London,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,"and he worked for a company which was called Blumfield,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,and one of the things that Blumfield needed to do
00:24:15,00:24:18,was they needed to move a lot of the graves
00:24:18,00:24:20,that were in the area to make room for a new rail track.
00:24:20,00:24:23,"It was the mainland, midland Grand Railway,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,"and so they had to exhume bodies,"
00:24:25,00:24:27,and it was something like thousands of bodies
00:24:27,00:24:28,"that they had to exhume,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"and they had all these leftover tombstones,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,and hardy did this thing where there's
00:24:33,00:24:35,"about a hundred of them of these tombstones,"
00:24:35,00:24:38,"they are all sort of layered in towards the tree,"
00:24:38,00:24:41,and it's so hard to describe.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- They like circle the tree.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"- Is the tree, 'cause the tree fell down, isn't it?"
00:24:43,00:24:46,- The tree fell down in 2022.
00:24:46,00:24:46,"- Oh, has it fallen?"
00:24:46,00:24:49,"I saw it years ago, but it was like the roots"
00:24:49,00:24:51,were like growing over the tombstones.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"It's almost like, give the illusion"
00:24:53,00:24:54,that the tombstones were sinking
00:24:54,00:24:56,"because roots were starting to grow over the top of them,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,they were getting shorter and shorter.
00:24:57,00:24:59,"- Yeah, so a storm. - But I didn't know it fell down,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,so what is it?
00:25:00,00:25:02,"- A storm took it out, but they've left,"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"there's a big fence around it at the moment,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,they're working out what to do
00:25:05,00:25:06,"and which way to restore it,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"but yeah, that is literally a bit of art/architecture"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"by Thomas Hardy, as you say,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"you saw it when it's full place,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"and God, just generally, by the way,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,what an extraordinary cemetery that is
00:25:17,00:25:19,with such notable people.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Mary Wollstonecraft is buried there,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"who was the mother of Mary Shelley,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,and there's this story which all academics
00:25:24,00:25:25,"think is almost definitely true,"
00:25:25,00:25:26,"it's one of those ones where it's like,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,"""There might be a tiny grain of untruth."""
00:25:28,00:25:30,It's where she used to go and sit and read
00:25:30,00:25:32,"her mother's books against the tombstone,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,and it's where her and Percy Shelley first had sex
00:25:35,00:25:37,"on the tombstone, literally."
00:25:37,00:25:38,- That's the kind of thing they would have done.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"- Yeah, but so. - Dofts, man."
00:25:40,00:25:43,(all laughing)
00:25:43,00:25:44,- I don't think that's fair.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"- I'll highly recommend it, though."
00:25:46,00:25:48,(all laughing)
00:25:48,00:25:49,"- Of course, you would,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,and you recommend all sorts of stuff.
00:25:51,00:25:53,- I'll be going to the cemetery.
00:25:53,00:25:55,- Dansex Advice podcast.
00:25:55,00:25:57,It's gonna go down like a live balloon.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"- But also, incidentally,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,"one of the people who were buried underneath,"
00:26:00,00:26:04,"supposedly, all those tombstones is the writer"
00:26:04,00:26:07,"who wrote The Vampire, who was part of that weekend"
00:26:07,00:26:08,"with Mary Shelley. - Oh, God."
00:26:08,00:26:10,"- Poladori. - Yeah, Poladori."
00:26:10,00:26:10,"- Poladori, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:10,00:26:13,"- Can I shatter your allusions, though,"
00:26:13,00:26:16,about that lovely concentric circle gravestones and tree?
00:26:16,00:26:19,Tree has nothing to do with him.
00:26:19,00:26:20,- What?
00:26:20,00:26:22,"- Yeah, everyone calls it the hardy tree."
00:26:22,00:26:23,There's no evidence.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"It was planted in his life, like,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,by him when he was an architect.
00:26:26,00:26:27,There's no evidence.
00:26:27,00:26:28,"It was, they think it was planted"
00:26:28,00:26:30,about 50 years after he died.
00:26:30,00:26:31,It only started being referenced in the--
00:26:31,00:26:33,"- Oh, so he just made the circles--"
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- He made the circles, I thought."
00:26:34,00:26:36,"- He, all we know, I'm pretty sure,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,is that he was indeed employed
00:26:38,00:26:39,'cause he was low down in the architect's firm.
00:26:39,00:26:40,"So the architect said,"
00:26:40,00:26:41,"""Could you dig up all these bodies?"""
00:26:41,00:26:43,So he did dig up the bodies.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"And he, in fact, he remembered later in his life"
00:26:47,00:26:48,"when they were digging up the bodies,"
00:26:48,00:26:51,opening one grave that had two heads and one body.
00:26:51,00:26:52,And that was a fun--
00:26:52,00:26:54,- Wow. - One memory for him.
00:26:54,00:26:55,And he said some of them were just skeletons
00:26:55,00:26:56,loose in the ground.
00:26:56,00:26:57,"Some of them, like, crumpled apart."
00:26:57,00:26:59,- He was digging them up personally.
00:26:59,00:27:00,"- He was there overseeing it,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,and other people under him were digging them up.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- Two heads, one body."
00:27:03,00:27:03,- Yeah.
00:27:03,00:27:05,We don't know he made the stone circle.
00:27:05,00:27:06,We just know he dug up the body.
00:27:06,00:27:07,- It sounds like he just littered some gravestones.
00:27:07,00:27:08,- He just dug up the--
00:27:08,00:27:09,- The story is losing the bodies in fact.
00:27:09,00:27:11,- A tree grew and turned them into a perfect circle.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"It's, like, a naturally, like, a natural phenomenon."
00:27:13,00:27:16,"Some poor person, probably a woman,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,"came after us and said,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,"""Hey, it would look nice if we did this."""
00:27:18,00:27:19,"And then everyone's gone,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"""Oh, it was Tom Hardy, didn't it?"""
00:27:21,00:27:23,"- That's classic, Tom."
00:27:23,00:27:24,- Yeah.
00:27:24,00:27:24,"- Can I, guys?"
00:27:24,00:27:25,- How interesting.
00:27:25,00:27:26,- Can I give you guys a quiz?
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- Oh, yeah. - Sure."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"- Okay, so we all know Tom's Hardy,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,and we all know about Kiss Me Hardy.
00:27:32,00:27:33,- Yeah.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"- And we all know about Tom Hardy, the actor."
00:27:34,00:27:35,- Yeah.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"- So, which Tom Hardy--"
00:27:38,00:27:39,"I've renamed these headlines,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"so they'll all say Tom Hardy,"
00:27:41,00:27:42,"so that's not a clue, right?"
00:27:42,00:27:43,Which Tom Hardy are these about?
00:27:43,00:27:45,- Yeah. - Okay?
00:27:45,00:27:49,Goldfish removed from Tom Hardy pond to protect nutes.
00:27:49,00:27:51,- Which Hardy is that about?
00:27:51,00:27:52,- The actor.
00:27:52,00:27:53,- Author.
00:27:53,00:27:54,- Author. - Author.
00:27:54,00:27:54,- You're both right.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"Sorry, Dan."
00:27:55,00:27:57,- I was a bit loose calling him Tom.
00:27:57,00:27:59,- I've changed the headlines.
00:27:59,00:27:59,"I've changed the headlines,"
00:27:59,00:28:00,"so they all say Tom Hardy,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,so that's not to avoid being a clue.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"- I see, sorry. - Because people only say"
00:28:03,00:28:05,Tom was or Tom. - Yeah.
00:28:05,00:28:07,- Tom Hardy fuels James Bond rumours.
00:28:07,00:28:09,(all laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:10,"- Well, no, actually, yeah."
00:28:10,00:28:13,Let's go back to when the first James Bond was written.
00:28:13,00:28:15,Let's do the dates a lot.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"- Fleming was a port bearer at the order, too,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,so I'm locking that in.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- Author.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- No, I'm so sorry, Dan."
00:28:20,00:28:22,That's about the actor Tom Hardy.
00:28:22,00:28:23,Last one.
00:28:23,00:28:26,Tom Hardy wins Jiu Jitsu contest in Milton Keynes.
00:28:26,00:28:27,(all laughing)
00:28:27,00:28:28,- I don't think it's any of them.
00:28:28,00:28:29,That's just a different bloke.
00:28:29,00:28:31,"- No, it's the actor."
00:28:31,00:28:33,"He, last year, he just turned up in Milton Keynes."
00:28:33,00:28:36,The Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Open Championship
00:28:36,00:28:38,held at a school in Milton Keynes
00:28:38,00:28:40,and kicked everyone's ass.
00:28:40,00:28:41,He won.
00:28:41,00:28:41,He was champion in his--
00:28:41,00:28:43,"- Held at a school, but it was adults."
00:28:43,00:28:44,(all laughing)
00:28:44,00:28:45,"- He was turned up and going,"
00:28:45,00:28:46,"""This should be important to God."""
00:28:46,00:28:47,- He absolutely went through year eight
00:28:47,00:28:49,like a dose of salt.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"No, he has a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu"
00:28:51,00:28:54,and just destroyed everyone.
00:28:54,00:28:56,Cause it's quite intimidating if you turn up
00:28:56,00:28:57,"and see Tom Hardy, you know,"
00:28:57,00:28:57,"- Yeah, no shit."
00:28:57,00:28:59,- being mad at Max.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Are you allowed to just wander in?
00:29:00,00:29:02,Surely you have to have entered in advance.
00:29:02,00:29:04,- He did enter in advance.
00:29:04,00:29:05,- He registered.
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- Oh, he registered, okay."
00:29:06,00:29:08,"- He just registered like a normal person, you know."
00:29:08,00:29:10,- And I bet someone who's worked at that school
00:29:10,00:29:12,"who was organising the whole thing,"
00:29:12,00:29:13,"read it and went, ""It won't be that Tom Hardy."""
00:29:13,00:29:15,(all laughing)
00:29:15,00:29:18,"- He was like, ""Fuck, yeah."""
00:29:18,00:29:19,- Terrifying.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- Do you know, I just want to bring up"
00:29:21,00:29:25,"the second wife very quickly, Florence Dugdale."
00:29:25,00:29:26,So that was her name.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"She was an author herself, published author."
00:29:29,00:29:33,"And there was, as you say, huge age gap."
00:29:33,00:29:34,"Apparently they got on really well though,"
00:29:34,00:29:35,according to friends who also said
00:29:35,00:29:39,that the first wife and Thomas didn't get on.
00:29:39,00:29:42,She wrote a biography of him and he didn't burn it.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"It was called ""The Early Life."""
00:29:44,00:29:46,- Is that 'cause he died?
00:29:46,00:29:48,"- No, it's 'cause it turns out he actually wrote it"
00:29:48,00:29:51,mostly himself and it was published under her name.
00:29:51,00:29:53,- Oh my God.
00:29:53,00:29:54,- That's the sort of thing you do
00:29:54,00:29:55,"if your first wife released a book saying,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,"""You're a piece of shit."""
00:29:57,00:30:00,"And then you go, ""Hmm, how can I protect my reputation here?"""
00:30:00,00:30:02,(all laughing)
00:30:02,00:30:04,- Isn't that astonishing?
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- That's really, and has that survived?"
00:30:06,00:30:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:06,00:30:07,- Because a lot of stuff didn't.
00:30:07,00:30:08,A lot of stuff was burnt.
00:30:08,00:30:10,A lot of his correspondence was burned
00:30:10,00:30:11,"almost immediately after his death,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"which has really vexed a lot of biographers, obviously,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,because so much burning of books
00:30:16,00:30:17,"went on back in the day, didn't it?"
00:30:17,00:30:19,Like they were constantly burning books.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"So he burned most of his own diaries, I think,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,as well as burning his wife's diaries.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"She burned, like his second wife,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,"burned the courtship letters between him and his first,"
00:30:28,00:30:28,"or I think maybe his first,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,and everyone was burning letters and books
00:30:30,00:30:31,left around center.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Why don't we do this anymore?
00:30:32,00:30:33,- I do.
00:30:33,00:30:34,(all laughing)
00:30:34,00:30:35,"I do, I'm so fine."
00:30:35,00:30:36,"So many letters on this and I'm like,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"""All of your wife's diaries."""
00:30:38,00:30:39,But maybe they'll go in the fire.
00:30:39,00:30:42,- There you were criticizing my carbon footprint.
00:30:42,00:30:43,(all laughing)
00:30:43,00:30:45,- Burning every book he's ever read.
00:30:45,00:30:47,(all laughing)
00:30:47,00:30:48,"Paul Bearers, obviously,"
00:30:48,00:30:49,"celebrity Paul Bearers, very cool."
00:30:49,00:30:50,- Oh yeah.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"- There's a modern version of it, I'd say,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,"of having lots of, well, not famous people being Paul Bearers,"
00:30:55,00:30:58,"but something cool to do, which is Tupac."
00:30:58,00:31:00,"You know, there's about Tupac in ""Tupac's Dead."""
00:31:00,00:31:03,Then Tupac's gang members smoked his ashes.
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Oh! - No way!
00:31:04,00:31:07,"- Yeah, as was requested in a Tupac lyric,"
00:31:07,00:31:10,"he said in the lyric, ""When I die, smoke my ashes,"" basically,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,in slightly different words that I won't use.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:13,00:31:14,- I've got a question.
00:31:14,00:31:15,- Yeah?
00:31:15,00:31:17,- How can you smoke them if they're already ashes?
00:31:17,00:31:18,"- Well, exactly. - You know what I mean?"
00:31:18,00:31:19,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:19,00:31:20,"- Like, he wasn't made of tobacco."
00:31:20,00:31:22,"- Well, I did say smoke his remains,"
00:31:22,00:31:23,but I'm doubting there's like an arm.
00:31:23,00:31:24,(all laughing)
00:31:24,00:31:26,- Did they smoke the ashes?
00:31:26,00:31:28,"- You did a very big fire pipe to get an arm into, wouldn't you?"
00:31:28,00:31:29,- Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:30,"- No, what was ashes?"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"I don't know, I guess they're just..."
00:31:32,00:31:33,"- You just shove it in with, like,"
00:31:33,00:31:34,"- Mix it in with some tobacco, love."
00:31:34,00:31:36,"- Mix it in, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:36,00:31:38,"- And all the things. - And other things, yeah."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"- Yeah, I don't think it was tobacco."
00:31:40,00:31:43,(upbeat music)
00:31:43,00:31:48,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:31:48,00:31:49,and that is my fact.
00:31:49,00:31:54,My fact this week is that the UK literally have fashion police.
00:31:54,00:31:57,Quite literally.
00:31:57,00:31:58,- That speaks a guy who's just been arrested
00:31:58,00:32:00,for that choice of hoodie.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"- So it turns out that one of the things,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,there's a lot of things that happen
00:32:05,00:32:07,"within police work with forensics,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,and a very important bit of it
00:32:09,00:32:12,"is trying to identify when a body might,"
00:32:12,00:32:13,"you know, if you find a body,"
00:32:13,00:32:14,how long has it been there?
00:32:14,00:32:16,Diagnosing all that stuff.
00:32:16,00:32:17,And one of the things that might help you with that
00:32:17,00:32:19,is the clothing that the person is wearing.
00:32:19,00:32:22,"And so there's this fashion historian called Amber Bouchard,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"and she basically goes around,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,"and she worked for Beyond Retro,"
00:32:26,00:32:27,and she was a fashion historian.
00:32:27,00:32:30,"She liked to find where products were coming from,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,at what point they were using certain materials and so on.
00:32:32,00:32:36,And there was a police forensic investigator
00:32:36,00:32:38,who saw what she was doing after hearing her
00:32:38,00:32:39,"on a Radio 4 show and thought,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"""I wonder if that's gonna be interesting for me"
00:32:41,00:32:44,"""in terms of trying to diagnose how all the body is,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"""or just give us a bit more detail."""
00:32:46,00:32:47,So that's what she does.
00:32:47,00:32:49,She goes around for the UK police.
00:32:49,00:32:50,"She'll go to a murder scene,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,and she'll look at the exact fabric that they're wearing.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"And obviously, as we know, like, you know,"
00:32:55,00:32:56,"if you were gonna die today,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,you might be wearing old clothes from--
00:32:59,00:33:00,"- I was gonna say, me and Andy gonna look like"
00:33:00,00:33:01,"we're from the '50s,"
00:33:01,00:33:04,because we just have never bought new clothes for ourselves.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:33:06,00:33:07,"That's the issue, right?"
00:33:07,00:33:10,- But I suppose it just plays into a bigger picture
00:33:10,00:33:10,of what they're doing.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"So there's one story, which is a bit upsetting,"
00:33:13,00:33:14,but an old lady passed away
00:33:14,00:33:17,"and they found a body that was wrapped up in a bra,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,and she was able to look at the bra
00:33:19,00:33:21,and work out exactly when the bra was from
00:33:21,00:33:22,"to be able to say,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"""So it must have been this year that the body was in there."""
00:33:25,00:33:26,"And she does it, by the way."
00:33:26,00:33:29,"There's a lot of amazing archives of clothing,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,and one big one is M&S have a massive archive of clothing
00:33:32,00:33:35,"that she can look through and find the history of items,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,'cause a lot of Brits are gonna be dying in M&S clothing.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Sorry, just a quick--"
00:33:40,00:33:42,"- I hope to one day, I hope to."
00:33:42,00:33:43,(laughing)
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Actually, I don't mind when the day comes,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,as long as I'm in my trusty M&S.
00:33:45,00:33:46,"- That's what people say, isn't it?"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"Yeah, it's like, people often,"
00:33:48,00:33:49,"how they wanna die, they often say,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,"""In my sleep, or in my M&S cookbook."""
00:33:51,00:33:52,(laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:53,He does fine with me.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"- Yeah, and we should add that this is also not a sponsor"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"that we're doing right now, yeah."
00:33:57,00:33:59,- I reckon there's certain items of clothing
00:33:59,00:34:00,where I could tell you when that person dies.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:34:01,00:34:04,"- Buried in a Von Dutch cap, I'm going 2001."
00:34:04,00:34:06,"Straight away, Liv's strong band."
00:34:06,00:34:08,"Come on, you're getting a five-year period."
00:34:08,00:34:09,"- Yeah, okay."
00:34:09,00:34:12,"- What about the cycles of fashion, though, every 30 years?"
00:34:12,00:34:14,"It could always be the B, like, you know,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,it was last year or 31 years ago.
00:34:16,00:34:16,"- So it has to be, yeah,"
00:34:16,00:34:18,so it has to be something that hasn't yet come back.
00:34:18,00:34:19,"- Okay, so you know--"
00:34:19,00:34:20,"- Yes, right."
00:34:20,00:34:21,"- Oh, it's not retro."
00:34:21,00:34:24,"It's like, white guy, dead in a Wu Tang 36 chambers top."
00:34:24,00:34:25,- Sure.
00:34:25,00:34:25,"- '97, '98."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:34:27,00:34:28,"- So, well, I've always won flares."
00:34:28,00:34:31,"Sometimes, I would have confused the hell out of police,"
00:34:31,00:34:32,"at other times, it's perfectly acceptable."
00:34:32,00:34:33,- I don't know what phase we're at now.
00:34:33,00:34:34,Are we in a flares phase?
00:34:34,00:34:35,"- Yeah, we are, actually."
00:34:35,00:34:36,"- We are. - Oh, there we go."
00:34:36,00:34:36,"- I think often she just goes,"
00:34:36,00:34:38,"""Wow, what we have here is a time traveler."""
00:34:38,00:34:40,(all laugh)
00:34:40,00:34:42,- I recruited a bit of help by this.
00:34:42,00:34:44,I wrote to an expert.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"Val McDermid, the author, a.k.a. Queen of Crime."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"- Holy shit, that's a clang."
00:34:49,00:34:53,We thought the old curling team had a clang earlier.
00:34:53,00:34:54,- Unnamed curling team.
00:34:54,00:34:55,(all laugh)
00:34:55,00:34:58,"- No, I just, I know her very slightly,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,and I just asked her about this kind of stuff.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"She's written a book, as well as all her novels."
00:35:01,00:35:03,She's written a book about forensics.
00:35:03,00:35:04,"- Oh, all right."
00:35:04,00:35:08,- And she said that natural fabrics decay when you're buried.
00:35:08,00:35:09,"As in buried in the woods, you know,"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"that kind of thing, if you've been killed."
00:35:11,00:35:12,"But labels are usually man-made fibers,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,"so they survive, right?"
00:35:14,00:35:15,So they can provide a clue
00:35:15,00:35:17,if it's foreign label or a designer label or whatever.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"So she says, ""If you're planning a murder,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"""go for mass produced cotton and snip those labels"
00:35:21,00:35:23,"""when it comes to dressing your corpse."""
00:35:23,00:35:24,(all laugh)
00:35:24,00:35:25,"- It's nice, very helpful."
00:35:25,00:35:26,- Yeah. - All right.
00:35:26,00:35:27,"- Thank you, Val. - Yeah."
00:35:27,00:35:28,"- That's good, 'cause you can tell"
00:35:28,00:35:30,"how big the person was,"
00:35:30,00:35:31,"even if the whole body's disintegrated, right?"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"You can still be like, ""Size eight, size 14."""
00:35:35,00:35:37,"- This does feel like this story feels most like,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,"you know, Netflix are on the phone buying the rights"
00:35:39,00:35:42,"to this series, surely, of like the person"
00:35:42,00:35:44,who solves crimes based on labels you're wearing.
00:35:44,00:35:45,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah."
00:35:45,00:35:46,"- Sorry, I thought you meant buying the rights"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"to this podcast, which is so far."
00:35:48,00:35:49,(all laugh)
00:35:49,00:35:51,"- They are available. - They are available, yeah."
00:35:51,00:35:52,- And she's cool.
00:35:52,00:35:53,"Amber, if you see a photo of her,"
00:35:53,00:35:57,"she dresses like someone from Beyond Retro would, right?"
00:35:57,00:35:59,Like she's got like old school clothing.
00:35:59,00:36:00,She looks like she could be
00:36:00,00:36:01,in a sort of Agatha Christie view.
00:36:01,00:36:03,- She'd be a vintage detective.
00:36:03,00:36:04,What could we call it?
00:36:04,00:36:05,"- What, the series?"
00:36:05,00:36:06,"- Yeah, series called--"
00:36:06,00:36:07,"- ""Drop Dead Gorgeous."""
00:36:07,00:36:08,"- ""Drop Dead Gorgeous."""
00:36:08,00:36:10,"- Yes. - ""Dressed to Kill."""
00:36:10,00:36:10,"- Brilliant. - Oh, yes."
00:36:10,00:36:12,"- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah."
00:36:12,00:36:13,"- All right, we've got two films."
00:36:13,00:36:15,(all laugh)
00:36:15,00:36:16,- Have you heard about this thing
00:36:16,00:36:18,of the principle of interchange
00:36:18,00:36:20,or the principle of transference?
00:36:20,00:36:22,So one of the fathers of forensics
00:36:22,00:36:24,"was a Frenchman called Edmund Lockhart in Leon,"
00:36:24,00:36:27,and his basic theory is that any two objects interacting
00:36:27,00:36:28,will leave a trace.
00:36:28,00:36:30,"So when you commit a crime,"
00:36:30,00:36:34,"you will leave something behind that wasn't there before,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,"like a bullet in a person,"
00:36:36,00:36:37,and you will take away something
00:36:37,00:36:38,"that was there originally, right?"
00:36:38,00:36:40,So that's just like the founding principle.
00:36:40,00:36:43,So all you have to do is work hard to find those.
00:36:43,00:36:44,"- Well, so that you'll take away"
00:36:44,00:36:45,like a bit of dust or something.
00:36:45,00:36:46,It's not like you're always--
00:36:46,00:36:47,"- Exactly, yeah, or a fiber on your shirt."
00:36:47,00:36:48,"- No, it's super near. - Whatever."
00:36:48,00:36:49,"- Yeah, no."
00:36:49,00:36:50,- It's always gone off the finger.
00:36:50,00:36:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:51,00:36:54,"But this, now we are so good"
00:36:54,00:36:55,that that sometimes makes things difficult
00:36:55,00:36:56,for forensics people.
00:36:56,00:36:58,"So for example, if I hug Rhys,"
00:36:58,00:36:59,"and then I am murdered,"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"Rhys will have my DNA,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"or sorry, my body's tested,"
00:37:04,00:37:07,"it'll have DNA from Rhys's clothes on it,"
00:37:07,00:37:08,despite the fact he had nothing to do with it.
00:37:08,00:37:11,So that suddenly means that he might have to be questioned
00:37:11,00:37:12,or involved or whatever it is.
00:37:12,00:37:14,So that's the extent to which forensics
00:37:14,00:37:15,is advanced these days.
00:37:15,00:37:16,It's so good now.
00:37:16,00:37:18,You can recreate so much stuff.
00:37:18,00:37:20,"- Yeah, so surely it's got to the point where it's so good."
00:37:20,00:37:22,Now the list of suspects is way too big
00:37:22,00:37:24,and makes this way harder.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"So it's defeated, it's sort of eaten itself."
00:37:26,00:37:28,"- It's sort of, yeah, like those detective clothes,"
00:37:28,00:37:29,"room things, it's only like,"
00:37:29,00:37:31,"it's 5,000 people going to the room."
00:37:31,00:37:32,"- Yeah, probably all of them are just like,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"""Oh, you need it."""
00:37:34,00:37:36,(all laughing)
00:37:36,00:37:38,- It's obviously they've got good methods
00:37:38,00:37:39,to winnow it down.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"- Yeah, sure."
00:37:40,00:37:41,- And you'd probably be released with that charge
00:37:41,00:37:41,"after a day or two, Rhys, but--"
00:37:41,00:37:43,"- I don't know, I'll give up a voice."
00:37:43,00:37:44,(all laughing)
00:37:44,00:37:45,I've got those sort of eyes.
00:37:45,00:37:46,- The motive's there.
00:37:46,00:37:49,"You've spent two hours with him now, so,"
00:37:49,00:37:51,we'd all understand.
00:37:51,00:37:51,- I would be cool.
00:37:51,00:37:53,"I mean, I've got, I've read about how cat hair"
00:37:53,00:37:55,"is like one of the main things, right?"
00:37:55,00:37:57,Like murderers who have cats.
00:37:57,00:38:00,"Getting caught quite quickly, because if anyone,"
00:38:00,00:38:01,"if any of you've got a cat, you know,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,that you basically constantly have cat hair on you.
00:38:03,00:38:03,"- Right, right."
00:38:03,00:38:05,"- And so everywhere you go, you're just,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,you're molting like a cat and cat hair is coming off.
00:38:07,00:38:08,- But then--
00:38:08,00:38:09,"- And I have a ginger cat, so, you know,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"that's just the most visible one, basically."
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- But do police now go around, someone's murdered?"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"Are they now going around everyone's house,"
00:38:15,00:38:16,"testing not only other people in the house,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,but their cats as well?
00:38:18,00:38:19,"You're getting off the door, say."
00:38:19,00:38:20,"- Maybe, maybe that's a double match."
00:38:20,00:38:22,You've got you and your cat.
00:38:22,00:38:25,"- Right, we're looking for a British short hair."
00:38:25,00:38:28,"Great fair, yeah."
00:38:28,00:38:30,- Do you know you can catch people by different prints
00:38:30,00:38:33,"that aren't fingerprints, various other prints."
00:38:33,00:38:33,- Tongue?
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- So, tongue prints are the thing you could,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,"'cause that's individual, although I'm not sure"
00:38:37,00:38:40,how many people lick the murder scene before leaving.
00:38:40,00:38:41,"- Oh, you said tongue, I thought I heard time,"
00:38:41,00:38:43,which time prints would be as well?
00:38:43,00:38:44,- Time prints.
00:38:44,00:38:46,"- Time print, do you leave a time print?"
00:38:46,00:38:49,"- Yeah, if you, your mobile phone leaves a signal."
00:38:49,00:38:52,"- Oh, yeah, of course. - That's a lot of modern"
00:38:52,00:38:54,detective work. - Is that a time print?
00:38:54,00:38:55,Did he leave a time print?
00:38:55,00:38:55,"- Well, I thought that's what Rie said"
00:38:55,00:38:56,and I was just trying to help.
00:38:56,00:38:58,"- It's cool, I like the sound of, yes."
00:38:58,00:38:59,"- And if you punch in and out,"
00:38:59,00:39:02,"like you would at a work factory, for every murder,"
00:39:02,00:39:03,"you'd let some of the time stand,"
00:39:03,00:39:05,"but you know, there's no way they have to check"
00:39:05,00:39:08,"into a building to find a record, you know what I mean."
00:39:08,00:39:10,- There's the comments book on the way out.
00:39:10,00:39:12,(all laughing)
00:39:12,00:39:16,"- Died lovely, really easy to kill, thank you."
00:39:16,00:39:19,"- He had the two star review, that's terrible."
00:39:19,00:39:22,"- That's a real crime, crime goes, there's a lovely hotel."
00:39:22,00:39:26,"- None of this is, is what I said."
00:39:26,00:39:28,"- Prints. - Prints, glove prints."
00:39:28,00:39:30,"So-- - Wow, what?"
00:39:30,00:39:31,"That's the whole point of gloves, isn't it?"
00:39:31,00:39:33,"- Yeah, that's brilliant, this context."
00:39:33,00:39:35,"- No, right, first of all, you hugged Andy on the way in"
00:39:35,00:39:38,"and you're wearing gloves, none of this can work, Rie's."
00:39:38,00:39:40,"So, yeah, people can take glove prints"
00:39:40,00:39:42,"and because people think what you guys think,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"which is that wearing gloves, I'm safe,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"they leave a lot more, they're much more cavalier"
00:39:46,00:39:47,than they are with fingerprints.
00:39:47,00:39:49,But now there are various police forces
00:39:49,00:39:51,"that have made databases of glove prints,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,so if they can match it to another glove print
00:39:53,00:39:55,"found at a different place,"
00:39:55,00:39:56,then they'll know that it's the same person.
00:39:56,00:39:58,- Just fibres that come off the gloves or?
00:39:58,00:40:00,"- Yeah, from the fibres that come off the glove"
00:40:00,00:40:02,"and the pattern that the glove makes on,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,"you know, it'll make an imprint and even--"
00:40:04,00:40:05,- That's so clever.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"- And it's even, it doesn't matter if it's the same"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"brand of glove that I'm wearing compared to you, Andy,"
00:40:09,00:40:11,because I'll be doing different things with my glove
00:40:11,00:40:12,to what you're doing with your glove
00:40:12,00:40:14,and so it'll wear in a different way.
00:40:14,00:40:15,"- Stop it, how interesting."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"- It's absolutely nuts, what can be done."
00:40:17,00:40:20,"- Ear prints, someone was caught in France"
00:40:20,00:40:23,by their ear prints 'cause they'd been listening up
00:40:23,00:40:25,against the keyholes of lots of student halls doors.
00:40:25,00:40:27,- Wow.
00:40:27,00:40:29,- That's incredible.
00:40:29,00:40:30,- That's amazing.
00:40:30,00:40:32,"- 'Cause that, yeah, footprint or shoe prints,"
00:40:32,00:40:34,"I imagine, as well, would be a thing."
00:40:34,00:40:35,"You would see a size 12 Adidas,"
00:40:35,00:40:38,"you might have certain muds and stuff that you can,"
00:40:38,00:40:41,"yeah, but ear print, that's like, yeah, eyebrow print"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"or, that's so neat."
00:40:43,00:40:45,- Can we say you can get a bum print?
00:40:45,00:40:47,"- What do you mean get a, what, do you sit on a photograph?"
00:40:47,00:40:50,"- But don't you, you have a bum print."
00:40:50,00:40:51,"I just wonder, I mean, I just wonder"
00:40:51,00:40:52,if that's what's been used.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"- Sorry, everyone's-"
00:40:53,00:40:54,"- Well, you're sorry, you're not trying to,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,"you mean if you put, if you the murderer"
00:40:56,00:40:59,"would put their bear off or something at the scene,"
00:40:59,00:41:02,"they could go, oh, we know who the bum that is."
00:41:02,00:41:03,- Exactly.
00:41:03,00:41:04,- It's a classic calling card for a lot of people.
00:41:04,00:41:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:05,00:41:07,It's the police line up for those.
00:41:07,00:41:08,"- Yeah, turn around."
00:41:08,00:41:09,- An amazing sight.
00:41:09,00:41:11,(laughing)
00:41:11,00:41:14,"Can bum number two move around then, please?"
00:41:14,00:41:16,(laughing)
00:41:16,00:41:18,"Have you, this is a very cool thing."
00:41:18,00:41:20,Have you had a forensic ecology?
00:41:20,00:41:21,- Forensic ecology.
00:41:21,00:41:23,"- This is a, I read an interview"
00:41:23,00:41:24,with a woman called Rosie Everett.
00:41:24,00:41:26,She uses materials found in the natural world
00:41:26,00:41:26,"to solve crimes, right?"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"So, specifically micro fossils."
00:41:30,00:41:31,- Oh.
00:41:31,00:41:32,- There are these things called diatoms.
00:41:32,00:41:34,"We've spoken about them, I think ages ago."
00:41:34,00:41:37,"Basically, they're microscopic single cell algae"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"and she can use these, the presence of these"
00:41:39,00:41:42,to come up with a profile of the soil in an area
00:41:42,00:41:43,which can then solve a crime.
00:41:43,00:41:45,"So, there was, there's a castle"
00:41:45,00:41:47,"in Cheshire called Beast and Castle, right?"
00:41:47,00:41:48,Which is a protected area.
00:41:48,00:41:52,"And there were some metal detectorists,"
00:41:52,00:41:56,"night hawks, dirt sharks who'd gone and nicked"
00:41:56,00:42:00,at like bronze age artifacts from the soil around there.
00:42:00,00:42:01,"And when they caught, they just say,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,"oh, we found them somewhere else."
00:42:03,00:42:05,"Can't prove anything, you know."
00:42:05,00:42:08,"Except for Rosie Everett, who came up with the,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,a profile of the soil based on the microscopic algae
00:42:10,00:42:14,found there and proved that's the soil
00:42:14,00:42:15,they've been taken from.
00:42:15,00:42:15,- Oh.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"- What, looked at the objects and went,"
00:42:17,00:42:18,"hey, this soil's the same."
00:42:18,00:42:20,"- Yeah, there was a bit of soil found on the bronze age"
00:42:20,00:42:21,artifacts they'd nicked from there.
00:42:21,00:42:22,And there was a bit of soil around the castle.
00:42:22,00:42:24,"Like, just so difficult."
00:42:24,00:42:25,- Wasn't one of the ways they caught Ian Huntley
00:42:25,00:42:27,from nettle disturbance.
00:42:27,00:42:28,- Really?
00:42:28,00:42:30,"- So nettles, he trampled nettles"
00:42:30,00:42:32,that meant that they were now growing outwards
00:42:32,00:42:33,in a way they don't naturally.
00:42:33,00:42:34,That sort of proved that he was there
00:42:34,00:42:36,in the woods at that time or something.
00:42:36,00:42:38,"- Well, so it's next generation nettles"
00:42:38,00:42:40,still affected by the previous?
00:42:40,00:42:41,"- Yeah, it's like months later they had grown"
00:42:41,00:42:43,"in a certain like, 'cause they would've been,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,and then they went out instead of up.
00:42:45,00:42:45,- Yeah.
00:42:45,00:42:46,- Or something like that.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"They was like, yeah."
00:42:47,00:42:48,- That's incredible.
00:42:48,00:42:49,- That's mad.
00:42:49,00:42:50,"And slightly less, I'll just quickly tell you,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,a slightly less technologically advanced one
00:42:52,00:42:55,of this guy I read about who got caught
00:42:55,00:42:58,doing a crime after he got the crime scene
00:42:58,00:43:02,very in a lot of detail tattooed on his chest.
00:43:02,00:43:03,"- Oh, gosh."
00:43:03,00:43:03,(laughing)
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- So he literally, it was like,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,he'd like murdered someone outside a liquor store
00:43:07,00:43:08,or something.
00:43:08,00:43:09,And so he got the liquor store like a painting
00:43:09,00:43:11,on his chest with him doing the murder.
00:43:11,00:43:12,"- No, no."
00:43:12,00:43:14,"- And above it he says the name of his gang,"
00:43:14,00:43:17,"which was Rivera, he said Rivera kills above it."
00:43:17,00:43:19,And it was like a revenge killing.
00:43:19,00:43:20,And he had that on his chest.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"And one day the police were just like,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,flicking through a book of gang tattoos apparently.
00:43:25,00:43:25,(laughing)
00:43:25,00:43:27,"And they were like, wait, that's that liquor store."
00:43:27,00:43:29,"We've been trying to figure out where that guy,"
00:43:29,00:43:29,who killed that guy.
00:43:29,00:43:31,That's that guy killed that guy.
00:43:31,00:43:32,And then he was just trying to then.
00:43:32,00:43:33,- That's brilliant.
00:43:33,00:43:35,We've spoken about in the past how the Yakuza
00:43:35,00:43:37,would be busted because they all have
00:43:37,00:43:38,very individualistic tattoos.
00:43:38,00:43:39,"And if they're on the run,"
00:43:39,00:43:40,"they might show up on Instagram,"
00:43:40,00:43:42,"sort of like, you know, topless."
00:43:42,00:43:43,- Yeah.
00:43:43,00:43:48,"- And you'll be like, hey, that's him, that's the guy."
00:43:48,00:43:52,Like tattoo spotting is a big way of busting criminals.
00:43:52,00:43:54,"Did you say your one, Andy, happened in Beeston?"
00:43:54,00:43:55,- Yeah.
00:43:55,00:43:57,"- Well, that was when we did our first book of the year."
00:43:57,00:43:59,"There was a crime there committed,"
00:43:59,00:44:03,which was thousands of bees were stolen from Beeston.
00:44:03,00:44:05,I wonder if she can solve that crime now
00:44:05,00:44:07,using this new technology.
00:44:07,00:44:07,- Wow.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"- I just, I'd sort of forgotten that,"
00:44:09,00:44:11,"but as soon as you said we'd had it in our book,"
00:44:11,00:44:13,"I thought we'd all have been a story about bees,"
00:44:13,00:44:14,won't it?
00:44:14,00:44:14,(laughing)
00:44:14,00:44:15,That's the level we operate at.
00:44:15,00:44:16,- We put it on the back.
00:44:16,00:44:17,"It's Sue, it's our burp."
00:44:17,00:44:19,That was our leading fact.
00:44:19,00:44:20,- Of the burp.
00:44:20,00:44:23,(upbeat music)
00:44:23,00:44:28,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:44:28,00:44:30,And that is Anna.
00:44:30,00:44:33,- My fact this week is that parents of newborn penguins
00:44:33,00:44:36,take thousands of naps per day.
00:44:36,00:44:38,- Lazy.
00:44:38,00:44:39,- Absolutely slackers.
00:44:39,00:44:40,- Lazy.
00:44:40,00:44:40,- Yeah.
00:44:40,00:44:42,- And I'm taking very short naps.
00:44:42,00:44:43,These are chin strap penguins.
00:44:43,00:44:46,So they live in the Antarctic and around the South Pacific.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"And they, they were scientists studying them recently"
00:44:49,00:44:50,"on King George Island,"
00:44:50,00:44:54,"and they found that they nap over 10,000 times a day,"
00:44:54,00:44:58,but they only nap for about four seconds at a time
00:44:58,00:44:59,on average.
00:44:59,00:45:00,(laughing)
00:45:00,00:45:01,"But still, it gets them something."
00:45:01,00:45:04,"And I mean, they managed to tot up 11 hours of sleep a day."
00:45:04,00:45:05,- That's insane.
00:45:05,00:45:06,- Amazing.
00:45:06,00:45:07,- Which is a lot less.
00:45:07,00:45:08,- It's basically really blinking.
00:45:08,00:45:08,"It's basically, every time they blink,"
00:45:08,00:45:10,they do it for four seconds and fall asleep.
00:45:10,00:45:11,- Yeah.
00:45:11,00:45:13,- It's like when you fall asleep at the cinema
00:45:13,00:45:15,"or the theater, you know?"
00:45:15,00:45:16,"And you have that kind of,"
00:45:16,00:45:17,(gagging)
00:45:17,00:45:18,"- Yeah, or train them, jolt."
00:45:18,00:45:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:45:19,00:45:20,I've never left one of those occasions
00:45:20,00:45:22,feeling noticeably rested.
00:45:22,00:45:22,- No.
00:45:22,00:45:24,- Despite doing that kind of semi-sleep.
00:45:24,00:45:26,- But I wonder if you had a thousand of them.
00:45:26,00:45:27,"- Yeah, true."
00:45:27,00:45:27,- Yeah.
00:45:27,00:45:28,- Yeah.
00:45:28,00:45:29,- You just haven't been to a long enough play.
00:45:29,00:45:30,"- Oh, I'm sorry."
00:45:30,00:45:33,- You know how you get those sort of rise and grind
00:45:33,00:45:34,influences these days.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"So all about, you know, getting up at five AM,"
00:45:36,00:45:37,doing a gratitude journal.
00:45:37,00:45:39,You've got to like circadian rhythm
00:45:39,00:45:39,and all that sort of stuff.
00:45:39,00:45:42,And you've got to get sunlight before coffee and all this.
00:45:42,00:45:43,"I mean, do you think if they read this pretty soon,"
00:45:43,00:45:45,"everyone would be like, no, no, no, don't go to bed."
00:45:45,00:45:46,Just stand there.
00:45:46,00:45:47,(laughing)
00:45:47,00:45:48,- Just a long blink.
00:45:48,00:45:49,- And then four seconds at a time.
00:45:49,00:45:50,And you just feel perfect.
00:45:50,00:45:51,You'd say you'll never sleep.
00:45:51,00:45:52,- Rejuvenate it.
00:45:52,00:45:53,- Hustle never sleeps.
00:45:53,00:45:55,(laughing)
00:45:55,00:45:57,- It'll become a thing.
00:45:57,00:46:00,"And so yeah, and they go into deep sleep,"
00:46:00,00:46:01,which I'm not sure we're very good at doing
00:46:01,00:46:02,"within four seconds,"
00:46:02,00:46:04,but they looked at their brainwaves.
00:46:04,00:46:05,- Wow.
00:46:05,00:46:05,- Really?
00:46:05,00:46:07,"- Yeah, so it was quite difficult."
00:46:07,00:46:09,- It's like a bungee jump into sleep and then back.
00:46:09,00:46:10,- Yeah.
00:46:10,00:46:11,- You just feel so rapid to get there.
00:46:11,00:46:12,"- Yeah, deep sleep."
00:46:12,00:46:15,"- But yeah, they go into slow wave sleep."
00:46:15,00:46:17,They really rigged them up these penguins.
00:46:17,00:46:19,It's amazing they could sleep at all.
00:46:19,00:46:21,"There was this researcher, Wong Young Lee,"
00:46:21,00:46:22,who I think was leading the research.
00:46:22,00:46:24,You said it was exhausting for them
00:46:24,00:46:26,'cause they had to catch 14 penguins
00:46:26,00:46:29,and they had to get equipment on their brains
00:46:29,00:46:30,to measure their brain activity.
00:46:30,00:46:34,"And then they had to get accelerometers to see how fast,"
00:46:34,00:46:35,"to like record their muscle movements,"
00:46:35,00:46:37,see how fast their muscles are moving and their positions.
00:46:37,00:46:40,And then they filmed like whether their heads start nodding
00:46:40,00:46:41,and then jumping again.
00:46:41,00:46:42,- So is it possible that the penguins actually
00:46:42,00:46:43,"sleep completely normally,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,"but when they're manipulated by scientists,"
00:46:45,00:46:46,they can't sleep at all?
00:46:46,00:46:47,- I think so.
00:46:47,00:46:51,They did say this is probably serving the purpose
00:46:51,00:46:53,of meaning that they can guard their young.
00:46:53,00:46:55,So it's when they guard their newborn children
00:46:55,00:46:58,"because one parent will be off getting food,"
00:46:58,00:46:59,the other parent has to look after the kid.
00:46:59,00:47:01,"So it's like, so you never sleep for so long"
00:47:01,00:47:02,that the kid can get in trouble.
00:47:02,00:47:04,It's like having a baby monitor.
00:47:04,00:47:07,"And they said it's probably 'cause of that,"
00:47:07,00:47:09,"but it could also be because you know penguins,"
00:47:09,00:47:10,"when they're looking after their young,"
00:47:10,00:47:12,they hang out in these massive groups
00:47:12,00:47:15,of just thousands of them and it's really loud and busy.
00:47:15,00:47:16,Like these researchers said we couldn't sleep
00:47:16,00:47:19,'cause it was just so hectic there 'cause so many penguins.
00:47:19,00:47:20,- These researchers are complaining a lot
00:47:20,00:47:21,about their own sleep.
00:47:21,00:47:23,"I have to say, 'cause someone has to study"
00:47:23,00:47:24,about something else.
00:47:24,00:47:27,(laughing)
00:47:27,00:47:29,"- Four seconds, I wish."
00:47:29,00:47:31,(laughing)
00:47:31,00:47:33,But they said it could just be that the penguins
00:47:33,00:47:34,can't sleep for longer than that.
00:47:34,00:47:36,"They might be able to sleep eight hours in a row,"
00:47:36,00:47:37,but it's just that they've been woken up
00:47:37,00:47:40,every four seconds 'cause it's so noisy and bustling.
00:47:40,00:47:41,- Right.
00:47:41,00:47:42,It is crazy.
00:47:42,00:47:44,There are lots of animals in the world
00:47:44,00:47:46,"that do, when they've had a baby,"
00:47:46,00:47:48,are forced into a position of just being awake.
00:47:48,00:47:51,"Like dolphins, for example, are awake for like a month,"
00:47:51,00:47:52,a full month.
00:47:52,00:47:53,They just can't go to sleep
00:47:53,00:47:56,'cause their baby dolphins can't sleep.
00:47:56,00:47:57,So they're just awake the whole time.
00:47:57,00:47:58,- For a month.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"- Yeah, for a month."
00:47:59,00:48:03,"And they basically, they just have to be awake"
00:48:03,00:48:05,"and with them, part of the dolphin not being asleep"
00:48:05,00:48:07,"as a baby, as they keep movement,"
00:48:07,00:48:08,"they're building up blubber,"
00:48:08,00:48:09,they're building up all the things
00:48:09,00:48:11,that they need to make them into a bigger dolphin.
00:48:11,00:48:13,"That's like, and then after like a month or so,"
00:48:13,00:48:14,they all start sleeping again.
00:48:14,00:48:17,But the mum is just solidly awake.
00:48:17,00:48:19,- But don't they do the half of their brains at a time thing?
00:48:19,00:48:22,"- So I'm not sure that, that's what I tried to find out,"
00:48:22,00:48:23,but I couldn't find anything that said
00:48:23,00:48:25,they go to half asleep.
00:48:25,00:48:27,"'Cause yes, dolphins shut half their brain asleep."
00:48:27,00:48:28,- Yeah.
00:48:28,00:48:29,"- As far as I could see, that wasn't part of any of the--"
00:48:29,00:48:31,"- They don't sleep at all, they're not either half."
00:48:31,00:48:31,- Yeah.
00:48:31,00:48:32,- Blimey.
00:48:32,00:48:33,"- I don't know about all bears,"
00:48:33,00:48:35,but don't polar bears do a similar thing
00:48:35,00:48:38,where they basically just attach the children
00:48:38,00:48:39,to them for the whole time.
00:48:39,00:48:42,So the children don't really walk around following them.
00:48:42,00:48:44,"Like you see elephants, you see them following"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"and stuff like that, but polar bears is just like,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,"you see a picture of a new mum in the polar bear community,"
00:48:48,00:48:51,there's just kids just like strapped.
00:48:51,00:48:52,"- And then do they have a walk on a swing to them, is it?"
00:48:52,00:48:53,- They're just like clinging on.
00:48:53,00:48:55,"I think they, yeah, I don't think they have papoos."
00:48:55,00:48:57,(laughing)
00:48:57,00:48:58,But they're just like grabbing hold of them
00:48:58,00:49:00,and they just have to walk around with that
00:49:00,00:49:02,and then just do everything from there
00:49:02,00:49:03,until they like sit down again.
00:49:03,00:49:03,- That's so crazy.
00:49:03,00:49:04,- 'Cause they just don't walk.
00:49:04,00:49:07,"- Tassels, it's got a lot of baby tassels."
00:49:07,00:49:11,"- You know, elephant seals."
00:49:11,00:49:15,"- Yes, which is a huge, great, massive big things."
00:49:15,00:49:18,"We got Santa fact, actually, by Victoria Pierdadi."
00:49:18,00:49:20,"So thank you for that, Victoria."
00:49:20,00:49:21,"Which is that sleeping elephant seals,"
00:49:21,00:49:25,they fall through the sea as they nap.
00:49:25,00:49:28,"So they are mammals, they do not have gills."
00:49:28,00:49:31,"They can last up to about half an hour underwater,"
00:49:31,00:49:32,but sometimes they will just nap.
00:49:32,00:49:35,And it seems like they just spiral downward
00:49:35,00:49:36,through the water asleep.
00:49:36,00:49:37,- Wow.
00:49:37,00:49:39,- That happens in my brain quite a lot.
00:49:39,00:49:41,We've got to get to sleep.
00:49:41,00:49:41,"You know, when you jolt away"
00:49:41,00:49:43,'cause you felt like you were falling.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:49:44,00:49:45,- Well imagine if you woke up
00:49:45,00:49:47,and you had actually jolted into the sea.
00:49:47,00:49:49,(laughing)
00:49:49,00:49:53,"- 'Cause it is fast, they drop 400 meters in 10 minutes."
00:49:53,00:49:54,"Which if you can, that's like,"
00:49:54,00:49:56,we're talking the highest buildings in the world.
00:49:56,00:49:58,"That's like the full height of them, almost."
00:49:58,00:50:00,And it takes quite a long time.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"You know, if you go to one of those skyscrapers,"
00:50:02,00:50:04,the lift takes about that long.
00:50:04,00:50:05,- Yeah. - Sometimes.
00:50:05,00:50:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:50:06,00:50:06,- So they're going that fast.
00:50:06,00:50:07,- Exactly.
00:50:07,00:50:09,If you wake up when you've only got three minutes
00:50:09,00:50:11,"of oxygen left, that's presumably quite stressful."
00:50:11,00:50:12,"- I would have thought so, yeah."
00:50:12,00:50:14,- What's the protocol?
00:50:14,00:50:14,What do they do?
00:50:14,00:50:15,- You can't really do that dancing
00:50:15,00:50:18,of faking that you weren't asleep on the sofa
00:50:18,00:50:19,during a Sunday afternoon movie.
00:50:19,00:50:21,"You know, dads will always be like,"
00:50:21,00:50:22,"""I was asleep, I'm watching, I'm watching."""
00:50:22,00:50:24,- I'm resting my eyes.
00:50:24,00:50:25,"- Dad, you're at the bottom of the ocean."
00:50:25,00:50:28,(laughing)
00:50:28,00:50:30,"- Does anyone, have you ever met a penguin?"
00:50:30,00:50:31,- Oh.
00:50:31,00:50:32,- 'Cause I've got another clack.
00:50:32,00:50:34,"- Here we go, here we go."
00:50:34,00:50:36,Which of your winter sports were you taking part in
00:50:36,00:50:37,with the Olympic team?
00:50:37,00:50:39,"- Well, I did do the skeleton,"
00:50:39,00:50:41,which is basically how penguins travel.
00:50:41,00:50:42,"- Oh, yes."
00:50:42,00:50:43,- Did you?
00:50:43,00:50:44,"- They go, you know, it's like the head first one."
00:50:44,00:50:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:50:45,00:50:46,"- Holding through the, yeah."
00:50:46,00:50:46,- That looks terrifying.
00:50:46,00:50:49,"- Well, I did it, they train on just, on a track."
00:50:49,00:50:51,So just on wheels on track rather than on ice.
00:50:51,00:50:52,- Right.
00:50:52,00:50:53,"- And this is the context where,"
00:50:53,00:50:54,so there were penguins doing penguins.
00:50:54,00:50:55,"- No, I did meet penguins actually."
00:50:55,00:50:55,"- Oh, this is just a bracketed anecdote."
00:50:55,00:50:58,"- But I did, yeah, yeah, because you mentioned"
00:50:58,00:51:00,the Winter Olympics and that was penguin adjacent.
00:51:00,00:51:02,I met a penguin in Australia actually.
00:51:02,00:51:03,"- Okay, right."
00:51:03,00:51:07,"- Man, I can't, I was a child, there are photos of it,"
00:51:07,00:51:08,"but I'm trying to get my head around what it was,"
00:51:08,00:51:12,"because from memory it was like in our hotel,"
00:51:12,00:51:15,"like where the various pools were,"
00:51:15,00:51:16,"there was different pools,"
00:51:16,00:51:17,"but it was presented in a sort of like,"
00:51:17,00:51:18,"go over to this section,"
00:51:18,00:51:19,"it was like a quite kid-friendly hotel,"
00:51:19,00:51:22,'cause like this section is meant to be the Arctic or whatever.
00:51:22,00:51:25,And then in between two of these pools on the walkway
00:51:25,00:51:27,were just like this bit where these penguins were.
00:51:27,00:51:28,- Right.
00:51:28,00:51:29,- And they would do like feedings at a certain time
00:51:29,00:51:30,"every day, and you could go and hang out."
00:51:30,00:51:32,And then I was a penguin of my favorite animal.
00:51:32,00:51:34,I was obsessed with penguins as a kid.
00:51:34,00:51:36,Penguins is actually one of the many nicknames
00:51:36,00:51:39,I tried to start for myself as a child.
00:51:39,00:51:40,(laughing)
00:51:40,00:51:43,"- That's a child, you were 23, weren't you?"
00:51:43,00:51:45,- That's a child in some communities.
00:51:45,00:51:48,And then like I got picked as the volunteer
00:51:48,00:51:50,for this sort of penguin feeding.
00:51:50,00:51:52,"And so I was like doing the whole,"
00:51:52,00:51:53,"you know, I was chucking the fish."
00:51:53,00:51:54,"- Wow, that's great."
00:51:54,00:51:56,- And I shook his fin.
00:51:56,00:51:58,- Shook the penguin fin.
00:51:58,00:51:59,- What do they have there?
00:51:59,00:52:01,"- Wing, wing, wing, yeah, wing."
00:52:01,00:52:02,"Shook his wing, fin."
00:52:02,00:52:03,"- Shook his fin, yeah."
00:52:03,00:52:06,"- Shook his wing, yeah."
00:52:06,00:52:07,- That's lovely.
00:52:07,00:52:08,That's very cool.
00:52:08,00:52:10,- And now your DNA is on that penguin.
00:52:10,00:52:11,And if it's murdered.
00:52:11,00:52:14,"- If that penguin goes missing, I'm absolutely shocked."
00:52:14,00:52:15,My cat's also a suspect
00:52:15,00:52:18,because there's definitely cat hair on that penguin's hand.
00:52:18,00:52:22,"- Have you seen the penguins at the zoo, the London Zoo?"
00:52:22,00:52:22,- No.
00:52:22,00:52:23,"- Oh, well, I recommend."
00:52:23,00:52:26,Is there any nearest penguin to us geographically?
00:52:26,00:52:28,I don't think you can meet them as far as I'm aware.
00:52:28,00:52:30,"There was something about them, wasn't there, though?"
00:52:30,00:52:34,"There was something, isn't there, isn't there enclosure?"
00:52:34,00:52:36,It's the only grade two listed.
00:52:36,00:52:38,"- Oh yes, it's got that amazing"
00:52:38,00:52:39,we talked about before.
00:52:39,00:52:41,- I was in a Harry Styles video.
00:52:41,00:52:42,- Is it?
00:52:42,00:52:43,- I think that rings a bell.
00:52:43,00:52:44,- I can't get this from different angles.
00:52:44,00:52:46,- That enclosure that is grade two listed
00:52:46,00:52:48,but that spiral thing in the middle
00:52:48,00:52:51,is where the as it was video is filmed.
00:52:51,00:52:52,- Has it?
00:52:52,00:52:53,- He's like stood on that thing
00:52:53,00:52:55,and all these women are sort of circling.
00:52:55,00:52:56,- Right.
00:52:56,00:52:58,- Are they dressed as penguins?
00:52:58,00:52:59,"- No, they're wearing tuxedos."
00:52:59,00:53:00,- I wonder what they did with the penguins
00:53:00,00:53:01,when they were filming that video.
00:53:01,00:53:03,"- I know, right?"
00:53:03,00:53:04,I think a lot of people on the internet
00:53:04,00:53:05,were wondering that as well.
00:53:05,00:53:06,"I mean, supposedly it's just a time"
00:53:06,00:53:07,when they weren't using it.
00:53:07,00:53:09,- How can they not be using their main home
00:53:09,00:53:10,in enclosure?
00:53:10,00:53:11,- The album is called Harry's House.
00:53:11,00:53:12,"So it does feel like you're marching and we're like,"
00:53:12,00:53:15,"this is Harry's House, let's get out."
00:53:15,00:53:17,(laughing)
00:53:17,00:53:22,- Something that sleeps quite weirdly is spiders.
00:53:22,00:53:25,"And they actually are unique in the animal world, I think,"
00:53:25,00:53:28,in that they don't have the right body clock.
00:53:28,00:53:31,And they're the only things we know about
00:53:31,00:53:32,that don't have the right body clock.
00:53:32,00:53:34,"So you know, we're all basically 24 hour body clock,"
00:53:34,00:53:36,"although sometimes when people go and live in caves,"
00:53:36,00:53:38,they sort of stretch to 25 hours or 23 or whatever.
00:53:38,00:53:40,But mostly we-
00:53:40,00:53:42,"- So there was such a dismissive role of the air,"
00:53:42,00:53:44,like there's a thing that's personally inconvenient
00:53:44,00:53:46,to you on more than one occasion.
00:53:46,00:53:47,- Those caves are always late.
00:53:47,00:53:49,(laughing)
00:53:49,00:53:53,- The man is waiting outside the table for two.
00:53:53,00:53:53,God's sake.
00:53:53,00:53:55,(laughing)
00:53:55,00:53:57,"- Time, it's a cadian with my arse."
00:53:57,00:54:00,- Yeah.
00:54:00,00:54:03,"- So mostly even bacteria operate on a 24 hour body clock,"
00:54:03,00:54:06,but spiders don't.
00:54:06,00:54:09,And we don't really know why except that they're fucked up.
00:54:09,00:54:11,So they have the shortest body clocks ever known.
00:54:11,00:54:14,Some spiders have been found to have 17 hour body clocks.
00:54:14,00:54:16,But this should really mess with them
00:54:16,00:54:18,because so spiders left their own devices.
00:54:18,00:54:21,"And these are specifically trash line orb weavers,"
00:54:21,00:54:22,which sounds-
00:54:22,00:54:23,- Slam.
00:54:23,00:54:24,- Yeah.
00:54:24,00:54:25,"- I mean, rows of it or what?"
00:54:25,00:54:26,(laughing)
00:54:26,00:54:27,- They're actually called that
00:54:27,00:54:29,'cause they hide in their webs in a pile of crap.
00:54:29,00:54:34,So they like will put dead bodies and feces and dirt
00:54:34,00:54:36,in their web and then they hide amongst it.
00:54:36,00:54:37,- Wow.
00:54:37,00:54:38,It's not dissimilar to my room.
00:54:38,00:54:40,(laughing)
00:54:40,00:54:42,- And that's how you catch flies.
00:54:42,00:54:44,"Anyway, they need to wake up at night"
00:54:44,00:54:46,and get super super active in the dark.
00:54:46,00:54:48,And they spin their webs at nighttime.
00:54:48,00:54:50,And they erect this big pile of trash to live in.
00:54:50,00:54:53,"And then in the daytime, spiders fall asleep still,"
00:54:53,00:54:54,"which is why when you see them in daylight,"
00:54:54,00:54:56,they're usually just motionless.
00:54:56,00:54:59,And then they go nuts at night in the dark.
00:54:59,00:55:03,"But it turns out if you subject a spider to full darkness,"
00:55:03,00:55:05,"it starts waking up and weaving its web,"
00:55:05,00:55:08,web many hours before night would actually fall.
00:55:08,00:55:11,So it wakes up like on the 17 hour mark
00:55:11,00:55:13,rather than on the 24 hour mark.
00:55:13,00:55:16,"So that means they're constantly kind of jet lagged, right?"
00:55:16,00:55:17,- Right.
00:55:17,00:55:18,"- They're constantly, their bodies are going,"
00:55:18,00:55:20,"hey, we've got to wake up now."
00:55:20,00:55:21,"And then it's like, no, no, no, you've got to stay asleep"
00:55:21,00:55:23,'cause it's not night yet.
00:55:23,00:55:25,And then night comes and then they have to go to sleep
00:55:25,00:55:26,and they're wide awake.
00:55:26,00:55:28,But they manage to just reset themselves every day.
00:55:28,00:55:30,- Do they get cranky?
00:55:30,00:55:32,"- Well, maybe that's why they're such bastards."
00:55:32,00:55:34,And they're always eating each other
00:55:34,00:55:36,and hanging out in the corner of the room
00:55:36,00:55:37,to deliberately scaring people.
00:55:37,00:55:39,"- Oh, I feel for them."
00:55:39,00:55:40,That sounds very rough.
00:55:40,00:55:41,- Doesn't it?
00:55:41,00:55:43,"- But apparently you can't catch up on sleep anyway, right?"
00:55:43,00:55:46,"There's a myth, the whole idea of like,"
00:55:46,00:55:47,I only got six hours sleep last night
00:55:47,00:55:49,so I'm going to now have 10 hours sleep or whatever.
00:55:49,00:55:50,It's a myth.
00:55:50,00:55:51,- Is that a myth?
00:55:51,00:55:54,- You're better off just having seven or eight every time.
00:55:54,00:55:57,"So you can't, it's impossible to catch up on sleep."
00:55:57,00:55:59,"- What, you'll always be a bit more tired?"
00:55:59,00:56:02,"- No, you just don't, yeah, so I don't mean,"
00:56:02,00:56:03,"it's impossible to go, this economy,"
00:56:03,00:56:05,it's bloody impossible to catch up on sleep.
00:56:05,00:56:08,I just mean that it actually makes it worse.
00:56:08,00:56:09,- Really?
00:56:09,00:56:10,"- So it's like, it's not a cult or tally"
00:56:10,00:56:12,for the week where you're trying to get us.
00:56:12,00:56:14,"It's like, no, just every day try and get seven or eight."
00:56:14,00:56:18,"- Oh, I did not know how to improve it with ten."
00:56:18,00:56:19,- 'Cause the way to avoid being underslept
00:56:19,00:56:21,"is then just have seven or eight hours, rather than-"
00:56:21,00:56:22,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:56:22,00:56:24,"- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I assumed it was the other thing."
00:56:24,00:56:25,- Me too.
00:56:25,00:56:28,- That there's a ratchet and it only gets worse for your life.
00:56:28,00:56:30,"- Exactly, but it's not like there's a certain amount"
00:56:30,00:56:33,of hours you must sleep in your life.
00:56:33,00:56:34,"And if you're not getting to the total,"
00:56:34,00:56:36,like you're filling it in like one of those thermometers
00:56:36,00:56:38,and at school when you're trying to get donations.
00:56:38,00:56:39,"- Well, you can actually trick yourself"
00:56:39,00:56:41,"into thinking you've had more sleep, can't you?"
00:56:41,00:56:44,Remember we did that thing about the placebo sleep
00:56:44,00:56:45,experiment that was done in America
00:56:45,00:56:48,where they told people that they'd had more sleep
00:56:48,00:56:50,than they actually had and they performed better in tasks.
00:56:50,00:56:52,- I always use this as a life hack
00:56:52,00:56:53,to try and tell myself every morning
00:56:53,00:56:54,I've had loads of sleep if I haven't.
00:56:54,00:56:55,- Do you?
00:56:55,00:56:56,"- It hasn't worked yet, yeah."
00:56:56,00:56:56,- All right.
00:56:56,00:56:58,- You need someone else to tell you that.
00:56:58,00:57:00,"In order for you to actually believe it, right?"
00:57:00,00:57:01,- Yeah.
00:57:01,00:57:01,- 'Cause it was work.
00:57:01,00:57:02,"- 'Cause you know what, yeah."
00:57:02,00:57:03,- But how can you ever do that?
00:57:03,00:57:05,"'Cause if you're employing someone to do that,"
00:57:05,00:57:05,you would also know.
00:57:05,00:57:06,- Exactly.
00:57:06,00:57:07,- Yeah.
00:57:07,00:57:10,"- It's like, if your phone told you, I'd believe it."
00:57:10,00:57:12,"- Yeah, those apps sleep apps should just lie."
00:57:12,00:57:13,"- Exactly, they should just lie."
00:57:13,00:57:14,- And everyone gets so much more done.
00:57:14,00:57:15,- Maybe they are lying.
00:57:15,00:57:16,"'Cause they wouldn't tell us, would they?"
