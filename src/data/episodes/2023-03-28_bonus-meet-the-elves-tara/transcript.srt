 Hi everyone, welcome to Meet the Elves, which is a new bonus feature for you lovely

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,400
 Patreon and Apple subscribers, where we are meeting one of the QI elves who you have not

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,360
 heard before on our podcast. And you might hear in the future, who knows? And today we're

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,320
 speaking to Tara, hello Tara. Hello. And what we thought is, when we first did the podcast,

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,480
 there was never like, this is Andy and these are his likes and dislikes and he likes to

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,260
 go for long walks along the beach and all that kind of stuff. We just got straight into

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,640
 the facts and people got to know us through our facts. We were going to do that, but when

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,680
 we found out it was just moss and trams, we thought let's drop this. I like short walks

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,200
 along canals. So what we thought we'd do is just get straight into it. And Tara, I think

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,760
 you brought us a question. Yes, I did. And then we're going to chat our way through it

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,440
 and see if we can answer it. Okay, so my question is, what would make the Nazis apologize for

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,080
 Overlord's success? Okay, that sounds cryptic. Yeah, Overlord's success. What would make

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,480
 them apologize? I mean, I'm not aware of any big Nazi apologies. Like mid-war apologies.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:27,000
 I don't think it was very apologetic. I'm aware of some Nazi apologists. But is it

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,720
 a famous apology, Tara? It's not very well known, I don't think, but it was something

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,880
 that they had to do. A specific guy had to apologize to someone else. Okay. Was either

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,200
 of these guys Hitler? No. Okay. Okay. What's the biggie out of the way? Yeah, they do say

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,440
 never apologize, never explained. They do. That's, is that like a political thing? Yeah,

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,560
 I think it is. Yeah. No, the Royals is never complain, never explain. Or maybe it's just

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
 never. No, yeah, I think it is. I think that supposedly the Royals have a thing of they

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,040
 never complain and they never explain. And I think never apologize, never explain is

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 to get on in politics. You just sort of keep restating your simple one point over and over.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,960
 Hence those interviews where there's that almost standoff between a Paxman and a that

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,680
 kind of moment. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So does that, is that a, is that the answer?

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,600
 No. Try focusing on like overlord. Okay. So Operation Overlord. Yes. Right. Is a thing.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,200
 Yes, it is. Was it D-Day? I think it was. Was it a British thing? Or was it a? Yeah.

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 So it was the D-Day landings. Battle of Normandy is Operation Overlord. Yeah. Got it. Okay. So

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,440
 this is something to do with the D-Day landings. Yeah. It's an apology. Who's a, can I hear

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,000
 the question one more time? Just for the listener as well, who may have. What would make the

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,080
 Nazis apologize for Overlord's success? Okay. Okay. Can I tell you a quick fact about Operation

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,600
 Overlord? Yeah. It once lost me a quiz when I was 10 years old. Oh. I know. It's a huge

33
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,680
 school quiz. I think we've done quite a lot. My team was in the, I don't know, semi finals

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,000
 or finals or something. Of course. And I remember, there was a lot riding on the last question

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,560
 of the quiz and it was what was the codename for the Normandy landings. It's tough for

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,320
 10 year olds. Yeah. Primary school. Well, it was very military based. This is our bread

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,960
 and butter. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I answered D-Day because I thought that was the codename

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,840
 and it wasn't the codename. The codename was Operation Overlord. I once did a quiz at school,

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,720
 which I equally didn't win. Which I should have won, which I was really annoyed about.

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,400
 These are all formative. These are like the X-Men moments where I'm going to learn all

41
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,720
 the facts now. Yeah. It was in the style of Mastermind. And my specialist subject was

42
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,240
 the Olympics. Okay. It's a big subject, but I learned all, I still know the order of

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,960
 all the Olympics. And that's from when I was 11 years old, 12 years old. But the question

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:58,000
 was, it was about, in one of the Olympics, the Israeli team were attacked and it was

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
 like a huge thing. They almost cancelled the Olympics, but they decided to go through

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,360
 with it. Yeah. And the question was not even about that. It was about, it was in which

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,000
 Olympics did such, such a person do such, such a thing. I answered the question correctly

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,140
 and then the teacher spent about a minute and a half explaining to the class about this

49
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,000
 terrible thing that happened. But I only had three minutes to answer the questions. So

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,680
 I only got like two or three questions, whereas all the others were getting like 10, 11, 12

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,400
 minutes. It was an absolute outrage. You're still bitter about it. I admit I'm not the

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,120
 person who was most badly done to in that whole story if you take it as a story. But

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,200
 you do appear as a footnote, don't you? It's interesting, like, because I remember that

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,640
 so clearly, like presumably you do as well. I hadn't remembered it until Tara said overlord

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,600
 today. And then it did come back to me quickly. I remember where I was sitting, I remember

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,520
 which room at school I was in, you know, I really, yeah, yeah. Any similar things that

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,740
 happened to you, Tara in school? No, you won all your quizzes. We didn't really have quizzes

58
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,280
 like that. No, no, we had like a Spanish dance festival for the languages department. Oh

59
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,080
 yeah. Don't know that would count. Did you absolutely slash it? We came second. Did you

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,120
 also didn't win? There are no prizes for coming. Well, there might be some prizes for coming

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,720
 second actually. People say that don't they though? There are no prizes for coming second.

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,360
 It's usually not true. Yes, it was always not true. I told my one, my formative one

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,440
 on the podcast years ago. Did you remember? Yeah, I was it was when I was at my Steiner

64
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,160
 school and we made it to it was just a classroom. We divide up into teams and we got both of

65
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,480
 us ended with the highest score. So there was a tie break question and the tie break

66
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,840
 question was name all of the seven dwarves. Do you remember the story? Oh, yeah. Yeah,

67
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,120
 got to name all the seven dwarves. We got six of them. We couldn't think of the last

68
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,760
 one. And then my buddy Dan Nice and said, I know it. I know it. It's the name of my dad.

69
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,320
 And the name of his dad was Doc. And because he was a musician in Australia, Doc Neeson.

70
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,120
 Unfortunately, Dan mixed up the fact in his head because Doc was his dad's stage name,

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,760
 not his real name. So what we ended up putting down on the paper was Happy Sad Baba and Dan's

72
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,960
 dad's real name, which was Bernard. We lost, but we trusted him because he went I've had

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,920
 this my whole life. I know it. My dad's got a dwarf name. I don't think of you as doing

74
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,720
 quizzes at your school because what you tell us about your school makes it sound so hippie

75
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,320
 ish that I think you only did like the vibrating properties of metal, like that.

76
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,120
 Yeah. What was your school like? Did you have any hippie element, Tara? Not at all. It was

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,440
 like very straightforward, the whole thing. But I got like fiercely competitive with English

78
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,840
 coursework, which isn't going to surprise anyone. What was it about? We did a range of

79
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,880
 like different things, but I was very proud that I ended like GCSEs with the highest score

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,800
 of anyone in the school. One mark off 100. Oh no, what do you get wrong? It was a question

81
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,240
 about JK Rowling and I got it wrong. I'm not mad about that now. In your GCSEs? It was

82
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,760
 coursework we did. Yeah, it was like a listening thing we had to do interview. I just can't

83
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,200
 believe that Rowling would have been in GCSEs when you were at Tara's a lot younger than

84
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:11,360
 you. Hang on. She would only have been in her 20s. It doesn't make any sense. That's

85
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,840
 amazing. I got one. I once did in my maths mark. I only got one thing wrong in the mock

86
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,760
 exam. I struggled so hard to get a B in maths. Oh really? I hated that. What is that you

87
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,520
 deliberately, sorry, you weren't saying I struggled to damp down the natural A I would

88
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,520
 have got. No, no. I was only just posting about good exam results we got now. I feel like

89
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,320
 this is the... Lord my way to a B. The question that I got wrong in my maths mark was plus

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,380
 one. What was it? I put one plus one equals one. Oh. It's slightly more complicated. It's

91
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,480
 part of a larger equation kind of thing. But it was like, yeah, I had to do all these things

92
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,800
 and then there was a little bit where two sides of a triangle were one and I just instead

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,720
 of adding them together, I just put one plus one equals one. Oh my God. You were overthinking

94
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,760
 it maybe. Yeah. You were thinking of the complicated stuff. Yeah. I once got marked down because

95
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 when we were all as a group travelling through the Astral Plane... She was a weird school.

96
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,060
 We've broken the format already. I actually once dropped a one mark in a history exam

97
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:18,180
 by failing to correctly reassemble the magazine of a Kalashnikov. It was a different model

98
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,580
 of Kalashnikov to the one I was used to training stripping and reassembling and I was so annoyed.

99
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,460
 I'm not there in law. I did do that at school. Stripped a Kalashnikov. I had to learn how

100
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,400
 to do it because she is Russian. Yeah. But yeah. You know, like we used to have like

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,560
 social education or whatever. PSH. Yeah. We put a condom on a banana. That's the Russian

102
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,320
 version of it. We put a condom on a gun. They don't do it anymore. I have to say, but when

103
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,160
 my mother-in-law was at school, that's what they had to do and it was like learning to

104
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,640
 put a gas mask on and so it was during the Cold War. I have done that as well, but not

105
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,820
 in school. Wait, done what? We've made about three different things. I can't remember

106
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,500
 what it was, but I reassembled a something gun. A gun? Really? No. Wow. This is the great

107
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,660
 thing about this format. It was going to learn so much more about what guns. I can't remember

108
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:16,060
 what it was. I used to be part of the air cadets. Did you? Cool. What are the air cadets? Is

109
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,300
 it proper military or is it? Yeah. So it's like Royal Air Force Junior. It's like teenagers

110
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:30,960
 and stuff. You know Muppet Babies. Young Indiana Jones. It's a cadet force. Lots of schools

111
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,240
 have a cadet force and you can choose that. So what did you learn? You learned to put

112
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,280
 a gun together. Honestly, there was just a lot of marching up and down and polish your

113
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,000
 shoes, but I did fly a plane. You flew a plane. You were piloting the plane. So you can pilot?

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,180
 I can't because I only did it once, so I need a pilot's license. But as in, if you were

115
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,940
 sat in a plane right now, like let's say it's desperate times, could you jump in a plane

116
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,380
 and take off? I think you're asking a lot of me. Can I just say in desperate times, it's

117
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,980
 usually can you land the plane not going to take off? That's just not fly. Should we get

118
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,060
 up back up? Absolutely. Operation overlapped. Okay. So are you saying the Nazis apologised

119
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,500
 in some way for Operation Overlord being a success? No. Why should they if it was a

120
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,000
 success? What's the question again? What would make the Nazis apologise for Overlord success?

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 What would make it? Okay, so are we talking about the day landings? We are. And so if it

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,480
 was a success, then the allies would have succeeded. Yes. And obviously the Nazis would

123
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 have not succeeded. Yes. And that would make sense that they would apologise. They would

124
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:43,620
 let you off if you say sorry. Okay. That's how it worked. Yes. The Nazis, yeah. So this

125
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,060
 is we're talking about double agents here. Oh, someone they thought was working for

126
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,540
 them. They apologise to him. But really he had been feeding them the wrong information.

127
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,980
 So this is like a Ben McIntyre thing, isn't it? So there's a British or an allied double

128
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,400
 agent who Nazis think is a German agent, but okay. You have actually covered him on the

129
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,360
 podcast before. You do know who this is. Oh, is it Cummings? No. No, is it Zigzag? Nope.

130
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,400
 Is it someone who's famous for something else? I mean, how he became a double agent, what

131
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,880
 you covered. And that is very funny and interesting. Okay. Okay. I think this was his biggest success.

132
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:34,360
 We have them almost 500 episodes. I know. This was episode 91. 91 classic episode. Wow.

133
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,020
 I don't remember this at all. Okay. Is it Fleming? No. Fleming wasn't a double agent.

134
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:49,780
 I think Fleming was just a... As far as we know, he was a double agent. An agent. Secret

135
00:11:49,780 --> 00:12:00,440
 agent fan. Do you think that he's like... Mr. Bond, are you a double agent? You're gonna

136
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:08,720
 have to help us out, Sarah. Okay. His name, codename Garbo. Oh, Greta Garbo. Yes. Yes. That's

137
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,880
 who he was named for. Okay. Who is it? Who is it? So his full name was Juan Pujol Garcia.

138
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,180
 Spanish, right? Spanish. He hated... I know. Incredible detective work. Shall I chip in

139
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,260
 and say I think he was Spanish? I thought, no, maybe you're wrong. But then, it would

140
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,860
 have been so impressive and then it was so unimpressive. That's the problem. But I genuinely...

141
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,980
 You swuck on Fleming. Oh, yeah. He was definitely a Spanish-speaking country. I know that much.

142
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,980
 I genuinely didn't think it. And then... But that doesn't count for anything in this game.

143
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,480
 He was Catalan. Spanish civil war, hated fascism, hated communism and decided he was

144
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,440
 going to spy for the British. The British never hired him. He decided he was going to

145
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,960
 do it anyway. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. He was useless, wasn't he? No, he was great. He was

146
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,780
 their best double agent. He wasn't involved in any of the spying to do with the Normandy

147
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,800
 landings. Or was he...? Yes, so he was feeding them disinformation about where it was going

148
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,300
 to happen. So he said it was going to be further up the coast. So on the day they were ready

149
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,560
 for something, yeah. They were ready for it to happen in Calais. And I think he was doing

150
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,300
 something like 315 messages each about like 2,000 words long in the months leading up

151
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,980
 to this. So he's given them a lot of information. But at the very last minute, on the day itself,

152
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,500
 so 6th of June, at 3 a.m. he sent them a message saying that the landings are going to happen

153
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,840
 in Normandy, but it was just too late for them to do anything. So it keeps his cover.

154
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,000
 Exactly. But they didn't turn on their radios in Madrid, so they received it 3 hours later

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,200
 and thought it was their fault that they couldn't actually do anything about it. So good. You'd

156
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,080
 also think that was a drunk telegram, wouldn't you, at 3 a.m.? Yeah, honestly. We've all

157
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,240
 got drunk telegrams like that. You would probably, these days, you would save it in your draft

158
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,420
 telegrams and send it in the morning. Wow, that's great. Awesome fact. I read an obituary

159
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,740
 of someone who has just died and he was involved in the Normandy landings. He was one of the,

160
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,540
 he was in a midget submarine, so tiny things just under the surface of the water, observing

161
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,580
 for weather conditions in the English Channel on about the 5th of June, 1944, and so close

162
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,940
 to the beach, as in they could see German troops on the beach. And he spent about three

163
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,520
 days underwater in this tiny, tiny cramped coffin-like space with one colleague, and

164
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,880
 that was his involvement in helping to press go for the... Wow. He's just died. Well, I

165
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,840
 can't remember his name, unfortunately, but just what an incredible contribution to have

166
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,120
 made. What a role. So many little roles. Exactly. And it's also really interesting, when you

167
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,520
 read a description of an area you can visit and sort of feel what a possible moment would

168
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,680
 be like, I was reading Spike Milligan, who's one of my favorite comedians, he wrote a book

169
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,140
 called Adolf Hitler, My Partner's Downfall, and he was stationed at Bexhill on Sea, and

170
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,940
 he wasn't part of D-Day, but he was swimming in the sea on the day that D-Day... Just casually.

171
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,100
 Yeah, they were, because they were on the coast, and so it was a, you know, it was just

172
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,340
 an off day. They would go down to the beach and swim, and they said you could hear the

173
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,460
 sounds of it happening. Imagine that sound, knowing historically what that day was, you

174
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,260
 know, which at the time was... Well, they would have known it was happening, right? Exactly,

175
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,480
 they were so secretive. So he says we were in the ocean, and we could hear what's going

176
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,360
 on in the distance. So can you tell us any more about what was happening at the time?

177
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,800
 Well, actually, I found this quite funny. The next day after their supposed blunder,

178
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,280
 he sent them another message, which was very self-pitying, saying that I am disgusted as

179
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,880
 in this struggle for life and death. I cannot accept excuses or negligence, and were it not

180
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,220
 for my ideals and faith, I would abandon this work as having proved myself a failure. And

181
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,500
 that was when they sent him an apology. It was so funny. It wasn't actually the first

182
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,540
 time that he'd done an operation like this. There had been one operation torch in North

183
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,420
 Africa where, again, he'd given the right information, but too late for them to do anything about

184
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,660
 it. And they similarly sent a message saying, "We're sorry you arrived too late, but your

185
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:20,240
 last reports were absolutely magnificent." So it actually helped his standing with them.

186
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,400
 But it's really clever to give them the information that you must have known it, because you've

187
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,360
 given it before they learned it, but you give it just too late that they'll be able to do

188
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,080
 anything about it. It keeps your cover completely right.

189
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,440
 They thought he had this entire spy network within Britain, but it was actually, I think

190
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,720
 about 27 people who were completely fictional. He just made up their whole identity, background,

191
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,580
 whole thing. And as a result, I don't think they actually put any more spies or tried

192
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,460
 to put any more spies into Britain, because they thought he had it covered.

193
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,460
 Do you know, when I said before about drunk telegramming, I actually think there was a

194
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,180
 book which was written by Ben McIntyre called Agent Zigzag. There's so many of these stories

195
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,840
 about these double agents and how they had to double bluff and think of these little

196
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,460
 things to do. The Agent Zigzag, I can't remember his real name now, but he also did a thing

197
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,240
 where he sent basically a drunk message to the Germans for an overflight bombing that

198
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,080
 was going to happen, and it was wrong. And it was a giveaway that he was basically a

199
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,120
 double agent. And he followed it up by saying either I'm drunk or he said something went

200
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,200
 wrong and what my message was, he excused it as something, I think possibly drunk. And

201
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,400
 they accepted that, but they kind of shouldn't have, and it would have ruined everything

202
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,920
 of this huge moment in the war, a pivotal moment, as a lot of these things were pivotal,

203
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,940
 I guess, you know, on smaller scales.

204
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
 Not a pivot.

205
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
 Yeah.

206
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
 Okay.

207
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
 Where did you get this from, by the way? You had a book on the table, was it?

208
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,540
 Yes. I did. It's this one I've been reading. Stars and Spies, the astonishing history of

209
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:52,420
 espionage and show business. It's really good. It starts off in like 1600s in Britain and

210
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,500
 then moves all the way through into the current day.

211
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 That's great.

212
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,980
 Yeah. And yeah, just a lot of links between like people in showbiz, theater, cinema and

213
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
 spying.

214
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,460
 Okay. Well, thank you very much, Tara.

215
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
 Cool.

216
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
 Thanks for coming on the podcast. Nice to meet you.

217
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,460
 I'm sure.

218
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
 Nice to meet you too.

219
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
 First time.

220
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,360
 I'm speaking on behalf of the listener. I think we'll try this again soon with some

221
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,160
 more elves and get you back again soon with some more great questions. And that was meet

222
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
 the elves.

223
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
 Hey.

224
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
 Okay.

225
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
 Great.

226
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:32,000
 You now need to do that for every single one and remember how that goes.

227
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:45,660
 Yeah. Good luck improvising that Dan because you haven't written it down on any sheet music.

228
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,660
 Yeah.

229
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,240
 (upbeat music)
