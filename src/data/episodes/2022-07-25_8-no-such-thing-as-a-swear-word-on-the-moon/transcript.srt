1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,480
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,680
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,680
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:25,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,400
 a weekly QI podcast coming to you from the QI offices

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
 in Covenant Garden.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,560
 My name is Dan Triber.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
 I'm sitting here with three other elves, James Harkin,

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
 Alex Bell, and Anna Chazinski.

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,360
 And once again, we're gathering around our microphone,

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,920
 and we're going to share with each other

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
 our favorite facts from the last seven days.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
 So in no particular order, here they are.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,320
 Alex, let's start with you.

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,720
 OK, my fact is that one of the last things that NASA

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,960
 had to do before launching space shuttles

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,080
 was detach the inflatable owls.

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
 [LAUGHTER]

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,480
 Wow, why would they have inflatable owls

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
 on those space shuttles?

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,760
 Basically, this was at Cape Kennedy.

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,920
 And they had a bit of a wildlife problem there, just generally,

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,800
 because the launch pad is actually

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,480
 in the middle of a nature reserve.

31
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,960
 So one of the problems they had was with woodpeckers

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,320
 on the big fuel tanks on the side of the space shuttle

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,600
 there, sort of bright orange.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,160
 And they're covered in foam insulation,

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,120
 which is quite delicate.

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,640
 And they had this problem with woodpeckers

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,560
 that were just coming up and pecking holes in them.

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,920
 And they have no idea why they were doing this.

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,600
 So didn't they actually have to cancel a shuttle launch

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,160
 in order to-- because too much damage was done to work?

41
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,120
 Yeah, discovery, I think, was one of the ones

42
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,200
 that was delayed quite a lot.

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,240
 And then it can't fall into rescheduled and things.

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
 So they did several things.

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,640
 Firstly, they used sound blasters, which I think

46
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,960
 were some sort of sound thing to scare away woodpeckers.

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,080
 They also, apparently, had a 24 hour bird-watching contingent

48
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,560
 on the run-up to the launch to keep an eye out.

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,960
 Yeah, I read that there were people, members of the public,

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,920
 when they'd heard about this, writing in with their own suggestions.

51
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
 Like amateur scientists.

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,560
 Yeah, there's great suggestions.

53
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,440
 One of them was to paint the tanks blue.

54
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,600
 A color woodpeckers hate.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,520
 Station falcons at the pads.

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,000
 So acting, yeah, effectively, falcons would chase them off.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,840
 Boyle skunk cabbage and spray water on the tanks.

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,440
 What skunk cabbage?

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
 I have no idea.

60
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,000
 This is just--

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,480
 It put back as, hey, blue.

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
 Do they-- like, sunny days are just a nightmare.

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,880
 Well, they're not trying to peck the sky,

64
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,280
 they're just doing like the taste of blue.

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,600
 Like that.

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,360
 I just say, I'm not allowed to let my dog off the lead

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,320
 in a nature reserve, a NASA can build

68
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,560
 like an entire space station in the middle of one.

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
 It seems like not a good place to put it.

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
 Well, I think there was tickles on issues.

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,600
 There were some other problems as well.

72
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
 I've got an article from a newspaper from 1983

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
 that some headlined NASA must cope with wild pigs,

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,320
 as a quote from it saying, that the space centrifugeals

75
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,920
 say they routinely check runways

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,840
 for pigs and alligators before any aircraft is clear to land.

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,680
 I don't think that's space shuttles, but that's--

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
 Yeah, alligators supposedly always

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,040
 lounging out, because it's a nice heated pad for the landing strip.

80
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,280
 It's not a great place for pigs to be living where

81
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,600
 alligators live as well.

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,480
 Imagine the secret of CCTV footage.

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 They must have epic battles on the runways

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:21,840
 and you can see a little bat that was obviously sleeping

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
 on the shuttle, and obviously woke up when his home

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 took off.

87
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,360
 NASA had to say, we're really sorry, but he probably died.

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,080
 I was really upset.

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
 Sorry, go on.

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,520
 No, just on the pig thing.

91
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,520
 NASA actually hired a pig trapper, only in this article.

92
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,160
 And you imagine kind of going into someone

93
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,480
 saying, yeah, I work for NASA.

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,960
 What do you do?

95
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,720
 Yeah, I track the--

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
 Yeah, I'm the pig trapper.

97
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,000
 I'm NASA.

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,320
 Yeah, I'm a pig trapper.

99
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's figure pigs.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 This is almost unrelated.

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
 But do you know, many evil times in England,

102
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,520
 pigs were a bigger pest than rats in London.

103
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,320
 And feral pigs were all over London.

104
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
 The government offered rewards if you could kill a pig

105
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,720
 and bring the evidence that you'd kill the feral pig.

106
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,920
 They'd just be in your cupboard, seat in your cereal.

107
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
 Yeah.

108
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,080
 Pooing all over the kitchen floor.

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,440
 So we haven't said--

110
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,960
 So the reason they had owls, inflatable owls,

111
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,640
 is because of these woodpeckers.

112
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,840
 And that was the solution to put these owls.

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,320
 So they were basically just spherical balloons

114
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,840
 with owl eyes and an evil eyebrow.

115
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,200
 They'd sit on the top to look like an owl.

116
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,320
 I'll put some pictures up on the website.

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,640
 But they were called, I think, owl terror eyes.

118
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,080
 And then you can buy them now as well.

119
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,800
 They just sort of festooned them over the structure

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,280
 of the space shuttle, like Halloween decorations.

121
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,480
 Because they did have owls that were living on the crane

122
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,760
 that was attached to the space shuttle.

123
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,920
 I don't know if there was a theory that during that period,

124
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,360
 that's why there were no woodpeckers there,

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
 because there was owls living there.

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,960
 But they'd gone to a lot of trouble with the RSPCA

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,640
 and other wildlife foundations.

128
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,120
 Because when they did take off this one time,

129
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,560
 they blasted these owls.

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
 Oh, it's terrible.

131
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,560
 But what's interesting is that NASA's actually

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
 been talked into taking it quite seriously

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
 and looking after the animals.

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
 So they actively do do that.

135
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
 So if they're going to retrieve any of the booster rockets

136
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
 that land in the banana river, which has apparently

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,880
 the largest refuge of manatees in America,

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
 they now use water jets as opposed to propellers

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,040
 so that they don't kill any of the wildlife.

140
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,000
 So they've changed the system for that.

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,880
 This is an interesting one.

142
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,520
 They used to have blinding lights that shine when they were

143
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,720
 on the launch pads.

144
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,920
 That were the turtles that were going into the sea.

145
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,400
 Log head sea turtles.

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,440
 They would see the light as opposed to the moonshine.

147
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,920
 And the moonshine would usually direct them to the ocean.

148
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
 But they would see the launch pad lights.

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,760
 And they would head towards the launch pad lights

150
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,360
 and die on the way, because they'd never reach the ocean.

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,880
 So they've changed their lights to be less disorientating

152
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,640
 bulbs.

153
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,560
 Good for NASA.

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,240
 So I like low-fi things that they do.

155
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,040
 The astronauts do like-- they use tacco sauce

156
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,480
 to secure debris on the ISS.

157
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,960
 And they're inside the space suits.

158
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,800
 They have a little bit of velcro that they

159
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,760
 used to itch their nose with, because they can't itch their nose

160
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 and stuff like that.

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 It's stuff like that.

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
 Yeah, NASA's very good.

164
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,880
 Like, the ALS is a good example of just a continuing

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,160
 tradition of highly inventive solutions.

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,040
 What was the one that you initially, Alex,

167
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,960
 you had a fact that you wanted to use?

168
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,040
 So I think this has been doing around the internet recently,

169
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
 apparently, but I was watching a really old documentary

170
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,400
 about various aspects of the earlier space program.

171
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,480
 And apparently, in the men's spacesuits,

172
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,720
 there's a sort of condom-like sheath

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,160
 that the astronauts have to wear so that they can go

174
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,000
 to the Lou in the suits.

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,480
 And they came in three sizes, which

176
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,840
 is small, medium, and large.

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,480
 But all the astronauts are just picking large,

178
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,160
 and they refuse to give the old NASA decided

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,880
 to change the names to large gigantic and humongous names.

180
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,760
 It's true.

181
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
 I found this out, which I really like.

182
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,800
 Charlie Juke, who was on Apollo 16.

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
 He had such a problem with swearing

184
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,160
 that he had to be hypnotized before heading into space

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,000
 so that he wouldn't swear once he was on the moon.

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
 So when they were doing live broadcasts--

187
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,960
 Are you not allowed to swear on the moon?

188
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,360
 Well, no, I think because we were being--

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
 Oh, we were hearing everything.

190
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,760
 Yeah, so he was told not to swear.

191
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,880
 And it led, as a result, he sings a lot on the moon

192
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,360
 because that was the compensation in the hypnosis.

193
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,520
 He got suddenly--

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,440
 Oh, really?

195
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,720
 Every time he was going to swear,

196
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,600
 he just belted out my way or something.

197
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,680
 Yeah, yeah.

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,440
 There was that guy.

199
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
 I can't remember which astronaut it was.

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,000
 I bet one of you guys remembers who Smok got told off

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,040
 really badly for smuggling a sandwich into space.

202
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
 I think it was called Beef Sandwich, wasn't it?

203
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,960
 And I can't remember who it was in the 1960s.

204
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,200
 Yes, but then weirdly, when Buzz and Neil Armstrong

205
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
 landed on the moon, their first meal

206
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,120
 was a ham salad sandwich.

207
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
 Yeah, oh, yeah.

208
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,440
 And we know that Buzz smuggled some stuff up to the moon, don't we?

209
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,040
 Yeah, yeah, he smuggled up some wine and some holy bread,

210
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,640
 which had been blessed by a priest.

211
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,160
 Yeah, to do the first of a communion.

212
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,040
 Yeah, he's incredible.

213
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,520
 You could sneak--

214
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
 Yeah, it really is.

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,760
 It makes me question whether we can put

216
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,600
 NASA in charge of outer space missions.

217
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,160
 But they can't even body-search someone properly.

218
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,480
 Apollo 12, you get a checklist, which are these kind of flip

219
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,920
 boards that you get on board the ship.

220
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,000
 Some of the prankster kind of employees for NASA,

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,960
 some of the engineers snuck on playboy photos

222
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,760
 in between the checklist.

223
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,040
 So yeah, I will put a photo up on QI.com/podcast.

224
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,080
 It's a--

225
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,880
 It's a naked, naked, naked spot.

226
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,560
 No, it's history, James.

227
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,360
 You're really trying to get people onto my website.

228
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
 Come to QI.com/podcast.

229
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,800
 You can see naked ladies--

230
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,000
 Boops from outer space.

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

232
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:45,560
 OK, time for fact number two, this one's mine.

233
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,840
 So we all know the famous advert that

234
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,800
 comes on at the beginning of DVDs.

235
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
 That sort of anti-piracy.

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
 You wouldn't steal a card.

237
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:05,320
 You wouldn't steal a handbag.

238
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,280
 The advert that's telling you--

239
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,760
 Right at the end, what does it say, Alex?

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,040
 It says, "piracy is a crime.

241
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
 I think piracy is stealing."

242
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
 Piracy is stealing, yeah.

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,520
 And so is stealing.

244
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,440
 And so is stealing.

245
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,840
 That's definitely stealing, it's a crime.

246
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,680
 It was officially, I mean, it was commissioned

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,520
 for an anti-piracy ad, but it was meant

248
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,960
 to be used just at a small film festival where

249
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
 they were sort of showcasing this thing.

250
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,240
 So the guy who created it, his name is Melchior Wright-Velt.

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
 He wrote this music.

252
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,680
 He got given basic money for it to be

253
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,520
 used at this local film festival.

254
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,320
 And then in 2007, he bought a Harry Potter DVD.

255
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,200
 The top was this advert with his music.

256
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,840
 And so since 2007, all the way to 2012,

257
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,600
 he's been trying to say, could I have the money, please?

258
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,520
 Because he was owed millions, I mean,

259
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,320
 for the amount of use--

260
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
 Wow.

261
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,040
 Yeah, and so finally, the company that was using it

262
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,120
 called him up, a guy called Mr. Gerritz.

263
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,160
 And he said that he would pay him out for 1 million euros.

264
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,480
 But that Mr. Gerritz would get to keep 1/3 of that money

265
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,560
 for all the hard work and trouble that he'd gone through

266
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,440
 to get him that 1 million euros.

267
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
 So anyway, he recorded that conversation.

268
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,720
 He played it.

269
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,920
 Mr. Gerritz got fired.

270
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,520
 And he's been compensated since.

271
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,680
 It's pretty appalling that they did that, though.

272
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,440
 And then it's not great.

273
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,040
 I know it will get us out of this mess.

274
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,240
 An old-fashioned bride.

275
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
 What?

276
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,600
 Did you guys know that Holly Davidson tried

277
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,440
 to trademark the sound of its revs?

278
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,040
 What?

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,640
 Yep.

280
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,000
 Those three revs, apparently, I don't really know much about motorbikes.

281
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
 But apparently, the three revs at the start

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,960
 sound like, I think this is on the Holly Davidson website.

283
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,120
 Sound like potato, potato, potato.

284
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,880
 And fair enough, loads of other motorbikes manufacturers

285
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,960
 said, I'm really sorry.

286
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,640
 Our revs sound really similar.

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,480
 You can't do this.

288
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,760
 And they didn't.

289
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,560
 Asda cooperates with slapping your ass.

290
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
 Really?

291
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 Yeah.

292
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,080
 Does it-- you know, it goes that advert where you go,

293
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,400
 did, do, do, do, do.

294
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 Don't they go, that's Asda price?

295
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
 Yeah, that's right.

296
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,800
 Is it just your own ass or anyone's?

297
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
 Like, is it copyrighted a sexual advance, basically?

298
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,200
 Yeah.

299
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,080
 [LAUGHTER]

300
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
 Basically, the way these things work

301
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,560
 is it's only in the specific area.

302
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 If you're trying to pass off as their kind of thing.

303
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,600
 So, Aldi or Waitrose couldn't do an ass slapping kind of advert

304
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,640
 because they copyrighted it for that.

305
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,840
 There was also someone copyrighted touching the side

306
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,520
 of your nose as if to indicate knowledge

307
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,560
 and also tipping a bowl of hat.

308
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,480
 And they're both registered by building societies.

309
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
 Really?

310
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,080
 I think we're living in a really interesting time

311
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,360
 when it comes to copyright and piracy and so on.

312
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
 Because we don't quite yet know if it works for or against.

313
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,560
 The people who either make or sell or whatever.

314
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,320
 But like, for example, Monty Python decided

315
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,280
 they were going to put up a bunch of clips on YouTube

316
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,680
 from their old Monty Python flying circus series.

317
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,360
 And actually, it had the reverse effect of what you would think.

318
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,520
 On the Amazon charts, they went up to number two.

319
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 And the sales increased by an estimated 16,000 to 23,000 percent

320
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,240
 on Amazon alone.

321
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,960
 And that's that worked in their favor,

322
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,920
 whereas everyone would encourage you not to do that because--

323
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
 So, it's really odd.

324
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,160
 You don't know if it works for or against.

325
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,680
 Well, the guys and Netflix, they look into what people are pirating.

326
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,520
 And then they decide what to buy, depending

327
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,000
 on what people are pirating.

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,600
 Really?

329
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,280
 Sensible.

330
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,600
 That's very sensible, yeah.

331
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,880
 I like with video games.

332
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,080
 They have a different approach to anti-piracy.

333
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,080
 They actually embed within their games protection thing

334
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,200
 so that you can continue playing the game,

335
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
 but you know that you've got a stolen item.

336
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,080
 For example, there's a game called Michael Jackson,

337
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,320
 The Experience, which is on DS.

338
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
 And the idea is that once the game realizes

339
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,960
 that you've got a pirated version of it, it halts it,

340
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,920
 and it just plays with a cellar music all over it.

341
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,840
 So it's just a loop.

342
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,560
 So it's just a constant loop.

343
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,040
 That's pretty clever, that I can't do.

344
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 Yeah, yeah.

345
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,760
 It's a Batman game as well, which when it knows

346
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,400
 that you've got a pirated copy, like--

347
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,880
 Batman comes in, in case you're asked.

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
 Physically comes to the door.

349
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,760
 No, his cape will refuse to open, preventing players

350
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
 from gliding and gliding as a massive part of the game.

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,240
 So you can only get so far without being to do anything.

352
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,400
 Talking about similar things to that.

353
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,080
 In the early days of cinema, they

354
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,680
 had silent cinema, and people would pirate films basically

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,200
 by just taking an entire film, cutting in a bit of new material

356
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
 and releasing it as a new picture.

357
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 And there was a company called The Biograph Company.

358
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
 And what they did was they made sure

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
 that their trademark was in every single shot.

360
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
 So it would be on a door or on a wall or in a window

361
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,200
 or on a T-shirt or something like that.

362
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,680
 So that every time someone did that,

363
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,080
 they'd just see their trademark all the way through the movie.

364
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,640
 Yeah, yeah.

365
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,600
 That's very good.

366
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,280
 They-- years ago on Museum of Curiosity,

367
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,040
 we had Terry Pratchadon.

368
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,080
 He told us this thing about, in Germany,

369
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,800
 in the German translated versions of his books,

370
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,920
 he said someone would write to him from Germany saying,

371
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,760
 do you know that they've placed adverts in your book?

372
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,800
 And so Terry was fine.

373
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,960
 Because he was like, well, in America, back in the day,

374
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,840
 that's what they would do.

375
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,920
 There would be just an advert, a full-page advert

376
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,200
 for a cigarette company or something like that.

377
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
 And you'd just continue reading.

378
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,600
 So he was fine with it.

379
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,680
 And so he said, no, that's cool.

380
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,400
 But the person wrote back saying, no, no, no.

381
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,360
 They've inserted the ad into the dialogue amongst the characters.

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,120
 So while the characters from his Discworld novels are running around,

383
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,320
 they would suddenly stop because they were quite parched

384
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,400
 and crack open a Coca-Cola while they were being chased

385
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,880
 or open some magic two-minute noodles

386
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
 and make some two-minute noodles before carrying on

387
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,120
 with what Terry Pratchadon had written.

388
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,640
 And so apparently, this wasn't just Terry Pratchad books.

389
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,000
 There was a lot of books in Germany and Pratchad wrote to them

390
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
 and he's had this stopped now.

391
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,240
 But yeah.

392
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
 That's so good.

393
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,760
 Yeah.

394
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,520
 They also, I like, because you reminded me that in China,

395
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,040
 there's a lot of a similar thing where they take existing text

396
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,880
 or footage, but in this case, text.

397
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,280
 So with Harry Potter books, because of the distance

398
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,080
 of time between each of the sequels,

399
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,320
 people just started writing their own Harry Potter books

400
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
 and publishing in China.

401
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,360
 Yeah, I've got a list.

402
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,800
 That Harry Potter and the Big Funnel.

403
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,080
 This is great.

404
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,280
 I'll give you this was the blurb.

405
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,320
 They came on the book.

406
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,840
 Yeah, yeah.

407
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,080
 No, they were all trying to pass themselves off as genuine books.

408
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,280
 This is the blurb.

409
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,640
 After six years at Hogwarts, Harry Potter

410
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,600
 has become an intern sorcerer and is assigned to teach

411
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,200
 at the Honitan School.

412
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,280
 Harry has a painful time at his aunt's house

413
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,040
 as Dudley has met a belly dancing girl

414
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,080
 as Harry prepares to report to his job.

415
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,320
 Batbug warns him disaster awaits.

416
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,600
 Exciting new character, Batbug.

417
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,560
 At the school, his students become wooden stools

418
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,840
 one after another.

419
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,320
 Harry doesn't know whether an evil student is behind this

420
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,360
 or if his old benefactor, Hagrid, is making a mistake

421
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,640
 or if the shadow of Voldemort has returned

422
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,040
 or did it have something to do with the Big Funnel?

423
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,720
 [LAUGHTER]

424
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,760
 Leave me open and leave me with more of this, more of this.

425
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,400
 So that's the Big Funnel list.

426
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,760
 I reckon it has something to do with the Big Funnel.

427
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
 Yeah.

428
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
 I'm going to wise my the title.

429
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
 [LAUGHTER]

430
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,800
 This is a French version of Harry Potter's book.

431
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,760
 Because Lord Voldemort's name, his full name,

432
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
 Tom Marvelli Riddle, has to be an addict grandma

433
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,760
 by "I am Lord Voldemort."

434
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:11,960
 Yeah.

435
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,720
 And so it doesn't work in all different countries.

436
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,640
 They have to change his name.

437
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,560
 And in France, his middle name is Elvis.

438
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,240
 [LAUGHTER]

439
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,120
 That's a great fact.

440
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
 Do you know what I think the Chinese are doing

441
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
 with the Harry Potter thing?

442
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
 This is just coincidentally, I was reading a bit of an interview

443
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 yesterday with this woman who decided to translate

444
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,560
 Finnegun's Wake, which is like James Joyce's

445
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,200
 more dense than Ulysses' work.

446
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,000
 And she's taken, I think, seven years

447
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
 to translate the first third of it into Mandarin.

448
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 And there's been quite a best seller in China, and they love it.

449
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,040
 But there's a little clip of her saying,

450
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,560
 I don't-- this is so hard.

451
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,440
 Please stop crushing me.

452
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,720
 I just don't know if I can write the rest of it.

453
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,760
 I don't know if I can translate the rest right now.

454
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,680
 So the Chinese are used to having what

455
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,520
 we've got a third of Finnegun's Wake.

456
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,560
 We love it.

457
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
 Once and next in a storm, then.

458
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

459
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,240
 OK, time to move on to fact number three, which is yours, James.

460
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,000
 OK, yeah, my fact is that, according

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,840
 to the government's website of the Czech Republic,

462
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,120
 there are three symbols of Easter in the Czech Republic.

463
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,440
 They are Easter eggs, the Easter lamb, and whipping.

464
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,440
 [LAUGHTER]

465
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,320
 I really want to do that on a poker, sorry.

466
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,360
 No, so this is a tradition that happens every Easter Monday

467
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,800
 in the Czech Republic.

468
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,520
 And boys, young lads, would go around whipping young maids

469
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,320
 so that they are healthy and cheerful for the entire year

470
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,800
 to come.

471
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,960
 And the girls, as a reward for being whipped,

472
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,240
 they give their boys decorated Easter eggs called cross-leads.

473
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,120
 Because they're so grateful for being whipped, yeah, cool.

474
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,000
 Apparently, anyone visiting the country

475
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
 is a bit concerned when they see it,

476
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,000
 because one of the things I like to do

477
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,520
 is to chase the women around with these whips.

478
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
 While they run away.

479
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,760
 Apparently, everyone loves it, so it's--

480
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
 Yeah.

481
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
 These whips, they're like very beautiful pieces of willow

482
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,240
 with ribbons on, so they're not like a, you know,

483
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,440
 it's not like a leather, cat or nine tails kind of thing.

484
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,520
 But yeah, I really love that.

485
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,640
 Just I like to look at traditions that are going on around

486
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,960
 the world. There's loads of really cool stuff happening around Easter,

487
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,760
 because often, as well as it being like a Catholic feast,

488
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,920
 it was traditionally like a pagan time of year, you know,

489
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,640
 it's a rebirth of things.

490
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
 So there's all sorts of going on.

491
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,320
 Apparently, in Norway, I was reading this.

492
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,240
 I don't have this as true.

493
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,080
 But most of the major television stations

494
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,400
 of Easter show murder mystery shows.

495
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,040
 And that's all they show, because it's become a tradition

496
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,840
 that you watch murder mysteries in Norway, obviously.

497
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,400
 And in the Philippines, some Christians

498
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,320
 will-- because they want to associate themselves with Jesus,

499
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,040
 they will crucify themselves.

500
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,600
 They'll nail themselves onto a cross and be self

501
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
 and be graduated and very painful.

502
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,840
 But there's a lot of people around so that they don't--

503
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,600
 Not through-- they nail themselves through the hands.

504
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,400
 Yeah.

505
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
 Right.

506
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,480
 Mental.

507
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,640
 So here's another thing about whipping.

508
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,920
 Do you know about these guys called

509
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,080
 "flagulants" for the Black Death?

510
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,960
 They would whip them so-- they would go to towns

511
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,200
 where they were struggling with the plague.

512
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,480
 And they would whip themselves for a fee

513
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
 to bring God's favor onto a community.

514
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,600
 And the idea was they would hurt themselves,

515
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,480
 and that would somehow get God's favor,

516
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,120
 and he would get rid of the plague.

517
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,800
 It's a nice idea.

518
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,480
 Yeah, that's the best hate for it.

519
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,280
 Was that big?

520
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,560
 Because the only reference point I have to that

521
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,080
 is the Da Vinci code, where the evil guy and that whips

522
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,960
 themselves consistently--

523
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,840
 Oh, it's the same.

524
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,360
 Yeah, it's the same.

525
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,880
 Yeah, exactly.

526
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
 Yeah.

527
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
 And-- but at the same time, apparently,

528
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,760
 there was another group called the pseudo-flagulants,

529
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,520
 and they also went around Europe,

530
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,200
 and they would also get money.

531
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,160
 But instead of hitting themselves with whips,

532
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,040
 they performed unusual sexual acts in public.

533
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,520
 And it doesn't explain what unusual sexual acts are.

534
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,560
 But you just know it's more fun than whipping yourself.

535
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,080
 Yeah.

536
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
 It is more fun.

537
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,160
 And also, it's hard to imagine God would be looking down

538
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,400
 at this and going, yeah, those are the guys.

539
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,880
 Those are the guys--

540
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,040
 Well done, man.

541
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,440
 I like weird, weird traditions.

542
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,320
 I guess our traditions must look weird to our side as well.

543
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,000
 But in "Garvel," you'll probably know this, James,

544
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,160
 which I think is in Sweden.

545
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,960
 They've had this tradition since 1966,

546
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,520
 where a town council built a 13-meter-tour goat figure

547
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,960
 to celebrate Christmas, made of straw,

548
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,440
 and vandals burned it down on Christmas Eve.

549
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,800
 And now it's become tradition.

550
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,520
 So the council is pretty pissed off about that.

551
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,280
 Didn't want vandals to do this.

552
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,240
 But now it's become tradition.

553
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,120
 They've maintained this 13-meter-tour figure.

554
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,520
 And almost every year vandals keep burning it down.

555
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
 And there's this constant night tug of war in this little town,

556
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,440
 the Christmas tradition, the burning of the "Garvel" goat

557
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,960
 happens.

558
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,680
 And I think it's happened 26 times since 1966.

559
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,000
 And since the 1980s, an English bookmaker's

560
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,160
 allows you to place bets on the goat's survival.

561
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,480
 Which you like to bet, James.

562
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,760
 I can imagine you should do that.

563
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
 I mean, it just stopped building it out of straw, maybe.

564
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,000
 Something less flammable, if they really--

565
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,080
 Yeah, but also as well.

566
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Yeah.

567
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,400
 I was when I was looking into the whipping.

568
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,440
 I suddenly realized it in no much about whipping.

569
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,120
 And I wanted to find out more.

570
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,360
 And this was a surprising thing.

571
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
 I read about a guy who had not heard from in history

572
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,640
 called Whipping Tom.

573
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,800
 Has anyone heard of Whipping Tom?

574
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,360
 No, it's really, but no.

575
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,720
 OK, it was an attacker in London,

576
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,000
 lived near Hackney, who would attack women walking in the street.

577
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,760
 He never did anything to the point of actually killing any of them.

578
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,280
 But he was just whipping them.

579
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 He would approach them on accompanied women in alleys and courtyards.

580
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,120
 And he would just spank them on the butt with his whip.

581
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
 And then he would sue my oyster.

582
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
 Yeah.

583
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,760
 No, and he'd flee.

584
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,920
 My favorite thing about it is they did eventually

585
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
 capture the person.

586
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,280
 And then there was a copycat Whipping Tom, who appeared

587
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,200
 a few years later, but the description of him--

588
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,240
 and I know it's obviously this was distressing for women.

589
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,280
 But it was the 1600s.

590
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,200
 We can laugh about it.

591
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,680
 He would see-- he would wait in narrow and dimly alleys and courtyards.

592
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,640
 And a pot and seeing on accompanied women,

593
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
 he would grab them, lift their dress, and slap their buttocks

594
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,960
 repeatedly before fleeing.

595
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,360
 He would sometimes accompany his attacks by shouting, "Spanko!"

596
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,520
 [LAUGHTER]

597
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,960
 He sounds like a superhero.

598
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,760
 He sounds like a superhero.

599
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,200
 Spanko, man.

600
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,160
 So yeah, in Czechoslovakia, he would have been a superhero.

601
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
 That would have been a really good thing for him to be doing, right?

602
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,920
 Because the ladies love it, then.

603
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,760
 Yeah, there would have been like, where's Spanko?

604
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
 [LAUGHTER]

605
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:51,720
 OK, time for our final fact of the show.

606
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,200
 Anna, this one's yours.

607
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,240
 Yeah.

608
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,560
 So my fact is that at Earl's Court tube station in 1911,

609
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,200
 a one-legged man was employed to write the escalator.

610
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,480
 This is Bumper Harris, isn't it?

611
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,880
 This is Bumper Harris, yeah.

612
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,560
 And he was employed to write the escalator.

613
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,840
 It was the first escalator that had been

614
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,520
 installed on the London Underground.

615
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,320
 And people were always really scared of new inventions.

616
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,280
 So common places seem to us.

617
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,040
 And so he was employed by the Department of Transport

618
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,200
 to write up and down the escalator and show people that it was safe.

619
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,040
 And I think the idea was like, even a one-legged man

620
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,840
 can get up and down this safely.

621
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,480
 So you're probably going to be fine, guys.

622
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,840
 Did he-- was he one-legged or did he have a prosthetic?

623
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
 I think he had a prosthetic leg.

624
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,960
 OK.

625
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,440
 Although weirdly, in the first week that the escalator was installed,

626
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,920
 nine dresses were torn, one finger was pinched,

627
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,560
 and one lame passenger fell off his crotch.

628
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,400
 So apparently not that suitable.

629
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,040
 Well, they weren't as--

630
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,400
 in their early days, escalators weren't as--

631
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
 for example, there wasn't a side handrail

632
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
 that you could hold that would go down with you and so on.

633
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,600
 So there were a lot more harsh.

634
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 Yeah.

635
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,840
 It wasn't the first escalator when you came at Harris.

636
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,360
 Yeah, that's right.

637
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,960
 But you used to have someone selling at the top

638
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
 with a bottle of brandy to give people

639
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
 a little shots to come around.

640
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,800
 Brandy and Smellings, that all deal.

641
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,480
 Really?

642
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,240
 Yeah.

643
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,400
 1920s, they had a system in--

644
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,000
 they designed a system for Atlanta.

645
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720
 And they had walkways that would go at six miles an hour.

646
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,440
 It's not that fast.

647
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
 It was kind of fast, you know.

648
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,000
 And the idea was that you would have a walkway

649
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,160
 that went at six miles an hour.

650
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,480
 And then next to that, you would have one at four miles an hour.

651
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,040
 So you would only have a two miles an hour jump

652
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,360
 to go from one to the other.

653
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,680
 Next to that would be a moving walkway of two miles an hour.

654
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,560
 And next to that would be a moving walkway, which

655
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,880
 didn't move.

656
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
 That's sensible.

657
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,120
 Kind of a walkway.

658
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,440
 [LAUGHTER]

659
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,000
 But that never took off because basically cars

660
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,320
 came in around the same time.

661
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,240
 And so they didn't need them anymore.

662
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,720
 I think they installed a similar system, though, in Paris.

663
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,520
 I find it weird how long it took them, by the way,

664
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,800
 to put stairs on escalators.

665
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,000
 Because for like 20 years, they had travelators, which

666
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,160
 were just slopes upwards.

667
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,120
 But anyway, I think they had what you're describing in Paris.

668
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,840
 They had-- it was about a mile long, I think, in 1900.

669
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,080
 And it was two moving walkways going at different pieces.

670
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,120
 And anyway, Thomas Edison turned up there.

671
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,920
 So he seemed to be everywhere around this time doing his thing.

672
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,160
 And he was really impressed with it.

673
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,120
 And he decided to film it and the footage.

674
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
 So I watched the footage of him filming this walkway in Paris.

675
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,680
 And everyone's really excited by it.

676
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,280
 Because it's a new innovation.

677
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,600
 And there's a moment in the footage.

678
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,960
 And I'll put it on the website page, where a man just

679
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,720
 appears from the crowd and punches a boy in the face.

680
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 Oh, what?

681
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,680
 I'll put it on the website.

682
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,320
 Does he shut Spanko, where he's--

683
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,280
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

684
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,200
 It's so weird.

685
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
 Before the L's court, the first escalator L's court,

686
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,960
 I didn't realize that they had--

687
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,440
 they installed this spiral escalator in the 1880s,

688
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
 or spiral elevator, I think they called it at the time.

689
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,840
 And it was really just meant to be like a scenic ride.

690
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,440
 And so it was meant to simulate being

691
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,280
 in France in the middle of the mountains.

692
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,600
 And so you went up this spiral, which was--

693
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,160
 I can't remember how many meters high, but pretty high--

694
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
 went up and up.

695
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
 And then you was surrounded by these Vistas panoramas

696
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,240
 of beautiful mountains.

697
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
 Where was that--

698
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
 Oh, it was cool.

699
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,960
 Oh, was it?

700
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,480
 Yeah.

701
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,240
 The first ever escalator was in Coney Island.

702
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,120
 And that was also an amusement rather than anything else.

703
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,640
 It was just a ride.

704
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,880
 But there was 75,000 people rode it in the first two weeks.

705
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,080
 There's an amazing ride of standing on an escalator.

706
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,680
 Yeah.

707
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,160
 I was reading into just--

708
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,920
 I got interested in other sort of debuts

709
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
 with the underground.

710
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,720
 Oh, yeah.

711
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,320
 Just to see if there are any notable written about stories.

712
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,240
 And there's a great one for the opening of the Circle Line,

713
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,160
 which was in 1884.

714
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,520
 And this was the review from the Times newspaper, which

715
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,600
 said, "A form of mild torture, which no person would undergo

716
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
 if he could conveniently help it."

717
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
 [LAUGHTER]

718
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,440
 Or a separate review for--

719
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,480
 When the chew first opened, there

720
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,100
 was a guy who'd spent a lot of time in Kenya

721
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,600
 rode on it.

722
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 And he described that the smell was being like a crocodile's breath.

723
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,200
 Yeah.

724
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,360
 That's a terrible smell.

725
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,000
 Well, presumably, I don't know.

726
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,680
 It's kind of nice for people to experience.

727
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,600
 You would never going to meet a crocodile in real life.

728
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,640
 You just go on the chew.

729
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
 Turn it into a positive, yeah.

730
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,800
 A crocodile's breath after it's just eaten a pig.

731
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,960
 [LAUGHTER]

732
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,600
 I like so how frightened people are of new inventions.

733
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,720
 And always have been in history and how totally mental

734
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,800
 it seems to us now.

735
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,000
 Like, the obvious fear of one heart of trains, didn't they?

736
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,560
 So I think when Stevenson was trying

737
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,120
 to encourage investment in his whole railway idea,

738
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,520
 then the parliament, a lot of MPs, were really, really

739
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,360
 against it.

740
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,240
 And it was thought that he-- so he intended for trains

741
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,200
 to be going between 12 and 15 miles an hour.

742
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
 And he was advised beforehand, definitely not

743
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,480
 to claim in the House of Commons that they would go above 9.

744
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,240
 Because that were totally free people out there.

745
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
 And then one of the-- so one of the MPs asks him in parliament--

746
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,440
 suppose one of these engines to be going along at a rate of 9

747
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,880
 or 10 miles an hour, and a cow were to strip on the line,

748
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,000
 would that not be a very awkward circumstance?

749
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,200
 And he just-- he just said, yes, very awkward for the cow.

750
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,000
 And that was it.

751
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,440
 Good-- good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

752
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,200
 I also like-- this is my final invention thing.

753
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,280
 I like that people were really frightened of bicycles,

754
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,160
 quite anti-bicycles, when they first came in from the 1860s,

755
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,000
 onwards, I guess.

756
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,320
 And doctors warned about things like bicycle hernia, bicycle--

757
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,240
 bicycle cyclist neurosis, cyclist sore throat,

758
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,720
 and bicycle face.

759
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
 [LAUGHTER]

760
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,200
 So I mean, someone on a bicycle rides into your face.

761
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,840
 You would have thought, but actually it

762
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,600
 meant that you're going to have such a constant look of stress

763
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,560
 on your face from having to balance your bike

764
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,240
 that it's going to get stuck like that.

765
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,160
 And you're going to be permanently twisted.

766
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,760
 Like getting square eyes from watching--

767
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
 Exactly.

768
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,480
 And just going back to Bumper Harris.

769
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,240
 So it was slightly controversial when we first

770
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,840
 read about this quite a few years ago.

771
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,680
 Matt Coward, who's one of the QI researchers,

772
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,040
 reckons that it might be a myth,

773
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,200
 because he couldn't find any evidence,

774
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,080
 contempt-porious news reports mentioned in Bumper Harris.

775
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,320
 Yeah.

776
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
 So I think there are news reports from the time,

777
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,160
 but they don't give evidence as to who he was

778
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,760
 where you could find him.

779
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,520
 They don't have evidence from the transport.

780
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,360
 Because you would think that it would be the kind of thing

781
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
 they would mention.

782
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
 They would have recorded.

783
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
 Well, yeah, I feel like we disagree on this,

784
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,640
 but maybe I like to believe in room.

785
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,160
 So it was recorded from the early 1920s.

786
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,680
 And there is a guy who says that he's Bumper Harris's

787
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,320
 great grandson, who's called Aaron, who can give, like,

788
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,000
 who gives anecdotal evidence about how he apparently retired.

789
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,200
 So he says he eventually retired to make cider violins

790
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,280
 and become a watercolour artist.

791
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,040
 So with that kind of personal detail, James,

792
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,080
 I don't know how you can thwart this story.

793
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,680
 I would love to know if anyone, like, listening

794
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
 by any chance knows anyone who claims to be related

795
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,040
 to Bumper Harris, I would love to know if it is true.

796
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,560
 Yeah.

797
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,320
 So get in touch.

798
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,040
 OK, that's it for another episode.

799
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,880
 That's all our facts.

800
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,600
 Thanks so much for listening.

801
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,240
 If you want to get in contact with any of us

802
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,320
 about what we've said, you can get us on Twitter.

803
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,080
 I'm on @SriberlandJames.

804
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,880
 I am @XshapedAlex.

805
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,680
 I'm @Xpert on this one.

806
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,440
 And Anna's still not on Twitter, but we almost,

807
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,160
 we almost made her buckle last week.

808
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,760
 But in the meantime, you can get her on @Quickipedia.

809
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,880
 Otherwise, you can check out the incredible page

810
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,440
 that she and Alex put together on the QI website,

811
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,200
 called qi.com/podcast, in which we're

812
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,640
 going to have videos of men punching boys on TravelAiders.

813
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,080
 We're going to have all sorts of other pictures and links

814
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
 to the stories that we were talking about.

815
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,560
 So please tune in again next week and tell your friends.

816
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,440
 All right, bye.
