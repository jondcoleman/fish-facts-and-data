00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"You did a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:10,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:10,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:15,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:15,00:00:25,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:25,00:00:28,a weekly QI podcast coming to you from the QI offices
00:00:28,00:00:29,in Covenant Garden.
00:00:29,00:00:30,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:30,00:00:33,"I'm sitting here with three other elves, James Harkin,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Alex Bell, and Anna Chazinski."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"And once again, we're gathering around our microphone,"
00:00:38,00:00:39,and we're going to share with each other
00:00:39,00:00:42,our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:44,"So in no particular order, here they are."
00:00:44,00:00:47,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:47,00:00:49,"Alex, let's start with you."
00:00:49,00:00:52,"OK, my fact is that one of the last things that NASA"
00:00:52,00:00:54,had to do before launching space shuttles
00:00:54,00:00:57,was detach the inflatable owls.
00:00:57,00:00:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:59,00:01:02,"Wow, why would they have inflatable owls"
00:01:02,00:01:03,on those space shuttles?
00:01:03,00:01:06,"Basically, this was at Cape Kennedy."
00:01:06,00:01:09,"And they had a bit of a wildlife problem there, just generally,"
00:01:09,00:01:11,because the launch pad is actually
00:01:11,00:01:13,in the middle of a nature reserve.
00:01:13,00:01:15,So one of the problems they had was with woodpeckers
00:01:15,00:01:19,on the big fuel tanks on the side of the space shuttle
00:01:19,00:01:20,"there, sort of bright orange."
00:01:20,00:01:22,"And they're covered in foam insulation,"
00:01:22,00:01:23,which is quite delicate.
00:01:23,00:01:24,And they had this problem with woodpeckers
00:01:24,00:01:26,that were just coming up and pecking holes in them.
00:01:26,00:01:28,And they have no idea why they were doing this.
00:01:28,00:01:32,So didn't they actually have to cancel a shuttle launch
00:01:32,00:01:35,in order to-- because too much damage was done to work?
00:01:35,00:01:37,"Yeah, discovery, I think, was one of the ones"
00:01:37,00:01:38,that was delayed quite a lot.
00:01:38,00:01:40,And then it can't fall into rescheduled and things.
00:01:40,00:01:41,So they did several things.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"Firstly, they used sound blasters, which I think"
00:01:43,00:01:46,were some sort of sound thing to scare away woodpeckers.
00:01:46,00:01:52,"They also, apparently, had a 24 hour bird-watching contingent"
00:01:52,00:01:54,on the run-up to the launch to keep an eye out.
00:01:54,00:01:57,"Yeah, I read that there were people, members of the public,"
00:01:57,00:02:00,"when they'd heard about this, writing in with their own suggestions."
00:02:00,00:02:02,Like amateur scientists.
00:02:02,00:02:03,"Yeah, there's great suggestions."
00:02:03,00:02:06,One of them was to paint the tanks blue.
00:02:06,00:02:09,A color woodpeckers hate.
00:02:09,00:02:11,Station falcons at the pads.
00:02:11,00:02:15,"So acting, yeah, effectively, falcons would chase them off."
00:02:15,00:02:18,Boyle skunk cabbage and spray water on the tanks.
00:02:18,00:02:20,What skunk cabbage?
00:02:20,00:02:21,I have no idea.
00:02:21,00:02:22,This is just--
00:02:22,00:02:23,"It put back as, hey, blue."
00:02:23,00:02:25,"Do they-- like, sunny days are just a nightmare."
00:02:25,00:02:26,"Well, they're not trying to peck the sky,"
00:02:26,00:02:29,they're just doing like the taste of blue.
00:02:29,00:02:31,Like that.
00:02:31,00:02:34,"I just say, I'm not allowed to let my dog off the lead"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"in a nature reserve, a NASA can build"
00:02:36,00:02:38,like an entire space station in the middle of one.
00:02:38,00:02:40,It seems like not a good place to put it.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"Well, I think there was tickles on issues."
00:02:42,00:02:43,There were some other problems as well.
00:02:43,00:02:46,I've got an article from a newspaper from 1983
00:02:46,00:02:49,"that some headlined NASA must cope with wild pigs,"
00:02:49,00:02:52,"as a quote from it saying, that the space centrifugeals"
00:02:52,00:02:53,say they routinely check runways
00:02:53,00:02:56,for pigs and alligators before any aircraft is clear to land.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"I don't think that's space shuttles, but that's--"
00:02:58,00:03:00,"Yeah, alligators supposedly always"
00:03:00,00:03:04,"lounging out, because it's a nice heated pad for the landing strip."
00:03:04,00:03:06,It's not a great place for pigs to be living where
00:03:06,00:03:07,alligators live as well.
00:03:07,00:03:10,Imagine the secret of CCTV footage.
00:03:10,00:03:12,They must have epic battles on the runways
00:03:12,00:03:21,and you can see a little bat that was obviously sleeping
00:03:21,00:03:23,"on the shuttle, and obviously woke up when his home"
00:03:23,00:03:26,took off.
00:03:26,00:03:29,"NASA had to say, we're really sorry, but he probably died."
00:03:29,00:03:31,I was really upset.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"Sorry, go on."
00:03:32,00:03:33,"No, just on the pig thing."
00:03:33,00:03:36,"NASA actually hired a pig trapper, only in this article."
00:03:36,00:03:38,And you imagine kind of going into someone
00:03:38,00:03:39,"saying, yeah, I work for NASA."
00:03:39,00:03:39,What do you do?
00:03:39,00:03:40,"Yeah, I track the--"
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Yeah, I'm the pig trapper."
00:03:41,00:03:43,I'm NASA.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"Yeah, I'm a pig trapper."
00:03:45,00:03:46,It's figure pigs.
00:03:46,00:03:47,This is almost unrelated.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"But do you know, many evil times in England,"
00:03:49,00:03:51,pigs were a bigger pest than rats in London.
00:03:51,00:03:53,And feral pigs were all over London.
00:03:53,00:03:55,The government offered rewards if you could kill a pig
00:03:55,00:03:57,and bring the evidence that you'd kill the feral pig.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"They'd just be in your cupboard, seat in your cereal."
00:03:59,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:04,Pooing all over the kitchen floor.
00:04:04,00:04:05,So we haven't said--
00:04:05,00:04:07,"So the reason they had owls, inflatable owls,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,is because of these woodpeckers.
00:04:09,00:04:11,And that was the solution to put these owls.
00:04:11,00:04:15,So they were basically just spherical balloons
00:04:15,00:04:18,with owl eyes and an evil eyebrow.
00:04:18,00:04:20,They'd sit on the top to look like an owl.
00:04:20,00:04:22,I'll put some pictures up on the website.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"But they were called, I think, owl terror eyes."
00:04:25,00:04:27,And then you can buy them now as well.
00:04:27,00:04:29,They just sort of festooned them over the structure
00:04:29,00:04:31,"of the space shuttle, like Halloween decorations."
00:04:31,00:04:34,Because they did have owls that were living on the crane
00:04:34,00:04:36,that was attached to the space shuttle.
00:04:36,00:04:39,"I don't know if there was a theory that during that period,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,"that's why there were no woodpeckers there,"
00:04:41,00:04:42,because there was owls living there.
00:04:42,00:04:44,But they'd gone to a lot of trouble with the RSPCA
00:04:44,00:04:47,and other wildlife foundations.
00:04:47,00:04:50,"Because when they did take off this one time,"
00:04:50,00:04:52,they blasted these owls.
00:04:52,00:04:53,"Oh, it's terrible."
00:04:53,00:04:56,But what's interesting is that NASA's actually
00:04:56,00:04:58,been talked into taking it quite seriously
00:04:58,00:05:00,and looking after the animals.
00:05:00,00:05:01,So they actively do do that.
00:05:01,00:05:03,So if they're going to retrieve any of the booster rockets
00:05:03,00:05:06,"that land in the banana river, which has apparently"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"the largest refuge of manatees in America,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,they now use water jets as opposed to propellers
00:05:13,00:05:15,so that they don't kill any of the wildlife.
00:05:15,00:05:17,So they've changed the system for that.
00:05:17,00:05:17,This is an interesting one.
00:05:17,00:05:20,They used to have blinding lights that shine when they were
00:05:20,00:05:21,on the launch pads.
00:05:21,00:05:24,That were the turtles that were going into the sea.
00:05:24,00:05:26,Log head sea turtles.
00:05:26,00:05:28,They would see the light as opposed to the moonshine.
00:05:28,00:05:30,And the moonshine would usually direct them to the ocean.
00:05:30,00:05:32,But they would see the launch pad lights.
00:05:32,00:05:34,And they would head towards the launch pad lights
00:05:34,00:05:37,"and die on the way, because they'd never reach the ocean."
00:05:37,00:05:39,So they've changed their lights to be less disorientating
00:05:39,00:05:40,bulbs.
00:05:40,00:05:42,Good for NASA.
00:05:42,00:05:45,So I like low-fi things that they do.
00:05:45,00:05:49,The astronauts do like-- they use tacco sauce
00:05:49,00:05:51,to secure debris on the ISS.
00:05:51,00:05:53,And they're inside the space suits.
00:05:53,00:05:57,They have a little bit of velcro that they
00:05:57,00:06:00,"used to itch their nose with, because they can't itch their nose"
00:06:00,00:06:01,and stuff like that.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:02,00:06:03,It's stuff like that.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"Yeah, NASA's very good."
00:06:04,00:06:06,"Like, the ALS is a good example of just a continuing"
00:06:06,00:06:10,tradition of highly inventive solutions.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"What was the one that you initially, Alex,"
00:06:12,00:06:13,you had a fact that you wanted to use?
00:06:13,00:06:16,"So I think this has been doing around the internet recently,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"apparently, but I was watching a really old documentary"
00:06:18,00:06:23,about various aspects of the earlier space program.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"And apparently, in the men's spacesuits,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,there's a sort of condom-like sheath
00:06:28,00:06:31,that the astronauts have to wear so that they can go
00:06:31,00:06:33,to the Lou in the suits.
00:06:33,00:06:34,"And they came in three sizes, which"
00:06:34,00:06:35,"is small, medium, and large."
00:06:35,00:06:37,"But all the astronauts are just picking large,"
00:06:37,00:06:40,and they refuse to give the old NASA decided
00:06:40,00:06:44,to change the names to large gigantic and humongous names.
00:06:44,00:06:47,It's true.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"I found this out, which I really like."
00:06:50,00:06:52,"Charlie Juke, who was on Apollo 16."
00:06:52,00:06:54,He had such a problem with swearing
00:06:54,00:06:58,that he had to be hypnotized before heading into space
00:06:58,00:07:01,so that he wouldn't swear once he was on the moon.
00:07:01,00:07:02,So when they were doing live broadcasts--
00:07:02,00:07:03,Are you not allowed to swear on the moon?
00:07:03,00:07:05,"Well, no, I think because we were being--"
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Oh, we were hearing everything."
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Yeah, so he was told not to swear."
00:07:08,00:07:12,"And it led, as a result, he sings a lot on the moon"
00:07:12,00:07:16,because that was the compensation in the hypnosis.
00:07:16,00:07:17,He got suddenly--
00:07:17,00:07:18,"Oh, really?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,"Every time he was going to swear,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,he just belted out my way or something.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:23,00:07:24,There was that guy.
00:07:24,00:07:25,I can't remember which astronaut it was.
00:07:25,00:07:28,I bet one of you guys remembers who Smok got told off
00:07:28,00:07:30,really badly for smuggling a sandwich into space.
00:07:30,00:07:31,"I think it was called Beef Sandwich, wasn't it?"
00:07:31,00:07:33,And I can't remember who it was in the 1960s.
00:07:33,00:07:37,"Yes, but then weirdly, when Buzz and Neil Armstrong"
00:07:37,00:07:38,"landed on the moon, their first meal"
00:07:38,00:07:40,was a ham salad sandwich.
00:07:40,00:07:40,"Yeah, oh, yeah."
00:07:40,00:07:44,"And we know that Buzz smuggled some stuff up to the moon, don't we?"
00:07:44,00:07:50,"Yeah, yeah, he smuggled up some wine and some holy bread,"
00:07:50,00:07:51,which had been blessed by a priest.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"Yeah, to do the first of a communion."
00:07:53,00:07:54,"Yeah, he's incredible."
00:07:54,00:07:55,You could sneak--
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Yeah, it really is."
00:07:56,00:07:58,It makes me question whether we can put
00:07:58,00:08:00,NASA in charge of outer space missions.
00:08:00,00:08:03,But they can't even body-search someone properly.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Apollo 12, you get a checklist, which are these kind of flip"
00:08:05,00:08:07,boards that you get on board the ship.
00:08:07,00:08:11,"Some of the prankster kind of employees for NASA,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,some of the engineers snuck on playboy photos
00:08:13,00:08:15,in between the checklist.
00:08:15,00:08:20,"So yeah, I will put a photo up on QI.com/podcast."
00:08:20,00:08:21,It's a--
00:08:21,00:08:22,"It's a naked, naked, naked spot."
00:08:22,00:08:25,"No, it's history, James."
00:08:25,00:08:29,You're really trying to get people onto my website.
00:08:29,00:08:31,Come to QI.com/podcast.
00:08:31,00:08:32,You can see naked ladies--
00:08:32,00:08:34,Boops from outer space.
00:08:34,00:08:36,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:08:36,00:08:45,"OK, time for fact number two, this one's mine."
00:08:45,00:08:48,So we all know the famous advert that
00:08:48,00:08:50,comes on at the beginning of DVDs.
00:08:50,00:08:52,That sort of anti-piracy.
00:08:52,00:08:53,You wouldn't steal a card.
00:08:53,00:09:05,You wouldn't steal a handbag.
00:09:05,00:09:06,The advert that's telling you--
00:09:06,00:09:07,"Right at the end, what does it say, Alex?"
00:09:07,00:09:10,"It says, ""piracy is a crime."
00:09:10,00:09:11,"I think piracy is stealing."""
00:09:11,00:09:12,"Piracy is stealing, yeah."
00:09:12,00:09:13,And so is stealing.
00:09:13,00:09:14,And so is stealing.
00:09:14,00:09:16,"That's definitely stealing, it's a crime."
00:09:16,00:09:19,"It was officially, I mean, it was commissioned"
00:09:19,00:09:21,"for an anti-piracy ad, but it was meant"
00:09:21,00:09:23,to be used just at a small film festival where
00:09:23,00:09:25,they were sort of showcasing this thing.
00:09:25,00:09:30,"So the guy who created it, his name is Melchior Wright-Velt."
00:09:30,00:09:31,He wrote this music.
00:09:31,00:09:32,He got given basic money for it to be
00:09:32,00:09:34,used at this local film festival.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"And then in 2007, he bought a Harry Potter DVD."
00:09:38,00:09:41,The top was this advert with his music.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"And so since 2007, all the way to 2012,"
00:09:43,00:09:46,"he's been trying to say, could I have the money, please?"
00:09:46,00:09:48,"Because he was owed millions, I mean,"
00:09:48,00:09:49,for the amount of use--
00:09:49,00:09:50,Wow.
00:09:50,00:09:54,"Yeah, and so finally, the company that was using it"
00:09:54,00:09:57,"called him up, a guy called Mr. Gerritz."
00:09:57,00:10:00,And he said that he would pay him out for 1 million euros.
00:10:00,00:10:03,But that Mr. Gerritz would get to keep 1/3 of that money
00:10:03,00:10:05,for all the hard work and trouble that he'd gone through
00:10:05,00:10:07,to get him that 1 million euros.
00:10:07,00:10:09,"So anyway, he recorded that conversation."
00:10:09,00:10:09,He played it.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Mr. Gerritz got fired.
00:10:10,00:10:13,And he's been compensated since.
00:10:13,00:10:15,"It's pretty appalling that they did that, though."
00:10:15,00:10:16,And then it's not great.
00:10:16,00:10:18,I know it will get us out of this mess.
00:10:18,00:10:21,An old-fashioned bride.
00:10:21,00:10:23,What?
00:10:23,00:10:24,Did you guys know that Holly Davidson tried
00:10:24,00:10:26,to trademark the sound of its revs?
00:10:26,00:10:27,What?
00:10:27,00:10:27,Yep.
00:10:27,00:10:31,"Those three revs, apparently, I don't really know much about motorbikes."
00:10:31,00:10:33,"But apparently, the three revs at the start"
00:10:33,00:10:35,"sound like, I think this is on the Holly Davidson website."
00:10:35,00:10:39,"Sound like potato, potato, potato."
00:10:39,00:10:41,"And fair enough, loads of other motorbikes manufacturers"
00:10:41,00:10:42,"said, I'm really sorry."
00:10:42,00:10:44,Our revs sound really similar.
00:10:44,00:10:45,You can't do this.
00:10:45,00:10:46,And they didn't.
00:10:46,00:10:49,Asda cooperates with slapping your ass.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Really?
00:10:50,00:10:51,Yeah.
00:10:51,00:10:54,"Does it-- you know, it goes that advert where you go,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"did, do, do, do, do."
00:10:56,00:10:58,"Don't they go, that's Asda price?"
00:10:58,00:10:59,"Yeah, that's right."
00:10:59,00:11:00,Is it just your own ass or anyone's?
00:11:00,00:11:03,"Like, is it copyrighted a sexual advance, basically?"
00:11:03,00:11:04,Yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:07,00:11:08,"Basically, the way these things work"
00:11:08,00:11:11,is it's only in the specific area.
00:11:11,00:11:13,If you're trying to pass off as their kind of thing.
00:11:13,00:11:18,"So, Aldi or Waitrose couldn't do an ass slapping kind of advert"
00:11:18,00:11:20,because they copyrighted it for that.
00:11:20,00:11:24,There was also someone copyrighted touching the side
00:11:24,00:11:27,of your nose as if to indicate knowledge
00:11:27,00:11:29,and also tipping a bowl of hat.
00:11:29,00:11:32,And they're both registered by building societies.
00:11:32,00:11:33,Really?
00:11:33,00:11:36,I think we're living in a really interesting time
00:11:36,00:11:39,when it comes to copyright and piracy and so on.
00:11:39,00:11:43,Because we don't quite yet know if it works for or against.
00:11:43,00:11:45,The people who either make or sell or whatever.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"But like, for example, Monty Python decided"
00:11:47,00:11:49,they were going to put up a bunch of clips on YouTube
00:11:49,00:11:51,from their old Monty Python flying circus series.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"And actually, it had the reverse effect of what you would think."
00:11:54,00:11:56,"On the Amazon charts, they went up to number two."
00:11:56,00:12:01,"And the sales increased by an estimated 16,000 to 23,000 percent"
00:12:01,00:12:03,on Amazon alone.
00:12:03,00:12:04,"And that's that worked in their favor,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,whereas everyone would encourage you not to do that because--
00:12:07,00:12:09,"So, it's really odd."
00:12:09,00:12:11,You don't know if it works for or against.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"Well, the guys and Netflix, they look into what people are pirating."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"And then they decide what to buy, depending"
00:12:16,00:12:18,on what people are pirating.
00:12:18,00:12:18,Really?
00:12:18,00:12:19,Sensible.
00:12:19,00:12:20,"That's very sensible, yeah."
00:12:20,00:12:22,I like with video games.
00:12:22,00:12:25,They have a different approach to anti-piracy.
00:12:25,00:12:29,They actually embed within their games protection thing
00:12:29,00:12:31,"so that you can continue playing the game,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,but you know that you've got a stolen item.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"For example, there's a game called Michael Jackson,"
00:12:35,00:12:38,"The Experience, which is on DS."
00:12:38,00:12:40,And the idea is that once the game realizes
00:12:40,00:12:43,"that you've got a pirated version of it, it halts it,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,and it just plays with a cellar music all over it.
00:12:46,00:12:48,So it's just a loop.
00:12:48,00:12:50,So it's just a constant loop.
00:12:50,00:12:52,"That's pretty clever, that I can't do."
00:12:52,00:12:53,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:53,00:12:54,"It's a Batman game as well, which when it knows"
00:12:54,00:12:56,"that you've got a pirated copy, like--"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"Batman comes in, in case you're asked."
00:12:58,00:13:00,Physically comes to the door.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"No, his cape will refuse to open, preventing players"
00:13:03,00:13:06,from gliding and gliding as a massive part of the game.
00:13:06,00:13:09,So you can only get so far without being to do anything.
00:13:09,00:13:12,Talking about similar things to that.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"In the early days of cinema, they"
00:13:14,00:13:17,"had silent cinema, and people would pirate films basically"
00:13:17,00:13:21,"by just taking an entire film, cutting in a bit of new material"
00:13:21,00:13:23,and releasing it as a new picture.
00:13:23,00:13:26,And there was a company called The Biograph Company.
00:13:26,00:13:28,And what they did was they made sure
00:13:28,00:13:31,that their trademark was in every single shot.
00:13:31,00:13:34,So it would be on a door or on a wall or in a window
00:13:34,00:13:36,or on a T-shirt or something like that.
00:13:36,00:13:37,"So that every time someone did that,"
00:13:37,00:13:40,they'd just see their trademark all the way through the movie.
00:13:40,00:13:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:40,00:13:41,That's very good.
00:13:41,00:13:45,"They-- years ago on Museum of Curiosity,"
00:13:45,00:13:47,we had Terry Pratchadon.
00:13:47,00:13:49,"He told us this thing about, in Germany,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"in the German translated versions of his books,"
00:13:51,00:13:54,"he said someone would write to him from Germany saying,"
00:13:54,00:13:57,do you know that they've placed adverts in your book?
00:13:57,00:13:58,And so Terry was fine.
00:13:58,00:14:01,"Because he was like, well, in America, back in the day,"
00:14:01,00:14:02,that's what they would do.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"There would be just an advert, a full-page advert"
00:14:04,00:14:07,for a cigarette company or something like that.
00:14:07,00:14:08,And you'd just continue reading.
00:14:08,00:14:09,So he was fine with it.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"And so he said, no, that's cool."
00:14:10,00:14:12,"But the person wrote back saying, no, no, no."
00:14:12,00:14:17,They've inserted the ad into the dialogue amongst the characters.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"So while the characters from his Discworld novels are running around,"
00:14:21,00:14:24,they would suddenly stop because they were quite parched
00:14:24,00:14:28,and crack open a Coca-Cola while they were being chased
00:14:28,00:14:30,or open some magic two-minute noodles
00:14:30,00:14:33,and make some two-minute noodles before carrying on
00:14:33,00:14:35,with what Terry Pratchadon had written.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"And so apparently, this wasn't just Terry Pratchad books."
00:14:37,00:14:40,There was a lot of books in Germany and Pratchad wrote to them
00:14:40,00:14:41,and he's had this stopped now.
00:14:41,00:14:42,But yeah.
00:14:42,00:14:43,That's so good.
00:14:43,00:14:43,Yeah.
00:14:43,00:14:48,"They also, I like, because you reminded me that in China,"
00:14:48,00:14:52,there's a lot of a similar thing where they take existing text
00:14:52,00:14:53,"or footage, but in this case, text."
00:14:53,00:14:56,"So with Harry Potter books, because of the distance"
00:14:56,00:14:58,"of time between each of the sequels,"
00:14:58,00:15:01,people just started writing their own Harry Potter books
00:15:01,00:15:02,and publishing in China.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Yeah, I've got a list."
00:15:04,00:15:06,That Harry Potter and the Big Funnel.
00:15:06,00:15:08,This is great.
00:15:08,00:15:09,I'll give you this was the blurb.
00:15:09,00:15:10,They came on the book.
00:15:10,00:15:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:14,"No, they were all trying to pass themselves off as genuine books."
00:15:14,00:15:15,This is the blurb.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"After six years at Hogwarts, Harry Potter"
00:15:17,00:15:20,has become an intern sorcerer and is assigned to teach
00:15:20,00:15:22,at the Honitan School.
00:15:22,00:15:24,Harry has a painful time at his aunt's house
00:15:24,00:15:27,as Dudley has met a belly dancing girl
00:15:27,00:15:29,as Harry prepares to report to his job.
00:15:29,00:15:32,Batbug warns him disaster awaits.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"Exciting new character, Batbug."
00:15:34,00:15:37,"At the school, his students become wooden stools"
00:15:37,00:15:38,one after another.
00:15:38,00:15:41,Harry doesn't know whether an evil student is behind this
00:15:41,00:15:44,"or if his old benefactor, Hagrid, is making a mistake"
00:15:44,00:15:47,or if the shadow of Voldemort has returned
00:15:47,00:15:52,or did it have something to do with the Big Funnel?
00:15:52,00:15:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:53,00:15:56,"Leave me open and leave me with more of this, more of this."
00:15:56,00:15:58,So that's the Big Funnel list.
00:15:58,00:16:00,I reckon it has something to do with the Big Funnel.
00:16:00,00:16:01,Yeah.
00:16:01,00:16:03,I'm going to wise my the title.
00:16:03,00:16:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:04,00:16:06,This is a French version of Harry Potter's book.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"Because Lord Voldemort's name, his full name,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,"Tom Marvelli Riddle, has to be an addict grandma"
00:16:10,00:16:11,"by ""I am Lord Voldemort."""
00:16:11,00:16:11,Yeah.
00:16:11,00:16:13,And so it doesn't work in all different countries.
00:16:13,00:16:14,They have to change his name.
00:16:14,00:16:16,"And in France, his middle name is Elvis."
00:16:16,00:16:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:19,00:16:20,That's a great fact.
00:16:20,00:16:22,Do you know what I think the Chinese are doing
00:16:22,00:16:23,with the Harry Potter thing?
00:16:23,00:16:26,"This is just coincidentally, I was reading a bit of an interview"
00:16:26,00:16:28,yesterday with this woman who decided to translate
00:16:28,00:16:31,"Finnegun's Wake, which is like James Joyce's"
00:16:31,00:16:34,more dense than Ulysses' work.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"And she's taken, I think, seven years"
00:16:36,00:16:38,to translate the first third of it into Mandarin.
00:16:38,00:16:40,"And there's been quite a best seller in China, and they love it."
00:16:40,00:16:42,"But there's a little clip of her saying,"
00:16:42,00:16:43,I don't-- this is so hard.
00:16:43,00:16:44,Please stop crushing me.
00:16:44,00:16:46,I just don't know if I can write the rest of it.
00:16:46,00:16:48,I don't know if I can translate the rest right now.
00:16:48,00:16:50,So the Chinese are used to having what
00:16:50,00:16:52,we've got a third of Finnegun's Wake.
00:16:52,00:16:53,We love it.
00:16:53,00:16:55,"Once and next in a storm, then."
00:16:55,00:17:00,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:17:00,00:17:05,"OK, time to move on to fact number three, which is yours, James."
00:17:05,00:17:08,"OK, yeah, my fact is that, according"
00:17:08,00:17:11,"to the government's website of the Czech Republic,"
00:17:11,00:17:16,there are three symbols of Easter in the Czech Republic.
00:17:16,00:17:21,"They are Easter eggs, the Easter lamb, and whipping."
00:17:21,00:17:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:24,00:17:28,"I really want to do that on a poker, sorry."
00:17:28,00:17:32,"No, so this is a tradition that happens every Easter Monday"
00:17:32,00:17:33,in the Czech Republic.
00:17:33,00:17:38,"And boys, young lads, would go around whipping young maids"
00:17:38,00:17:41,so that they are healthy and cheerful for the entire year
00:17:41,00:17:42,to come.
00:17:42,00:17:45,"And the girls, as a reward for being whipped,"
00:17:45,00:17:50,they give their boys decorated Easter eggs called cross-leads.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"Because they're so grateful for being whipped, yeah, cool."
00:17:53,00:17:55,"Apparently, anyone visiting the country"
00:17:55,00:17:56,"is a bit concerned when they see it,"
00:17:56,00:17:59,because one of the things I like to do
00:17:59,00:18:03,is to chase the women around with these whips.
00:18:03,00:18:05,While they run away.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"Apparently, everyone loves it, so it's--"
00:18:06,00:18:07,Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"These whips, they're like very beautiful pieces of willow"
00:18:11,00:18:14,"with ribbons on, so they're not like a, you know,"
00:18:14,00:18:18,"it's not like a leather, cat or nine tails kind of thing."
00:18:18,00:18:20,"But yeah, I really love that."
00:18:20,00:18:23,Just I like to look at traditions that are going on around
00:18:23,00:18:26,"the world. There's loads of really cool stuff happening around Easter,"
00:18:26,00:18:29,"because often, as well as it being like a Catholic feast,"
00:18:29,00:18:33,"it was traditionally like a pagan time of year, you know,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,it's a rebirth of things.
00:18:35,00:18:37,So there's all sorts of going on.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"Apparently, in Norway, I was reading this."
00:18:39,00:18:40,I don't have this as true.
00:18:40,00:18:43,But most of the major television stations
00:18:43,00:18:45,of Easter show murder mystery shows.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"And that's all they show, because it's become a tradition"
00:18:48,00:18:51,"that you watch murder mysteries in Norway, obviously."
00:18:51,00:18:53,"And in the Philippines, some Christians"
00:18:53,00:18:57,"will-- because they want to associate themselves with Jesus,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,they will crucify themselves.
00:19:00,00:19:03,They'll nail themselves onto a cross and be self
00:19:03,00:19:06,and be graduated and very painful.
00:19:06,00:19:08,But there's a lot of people around so that they don't--
00:19:08,00:19:10,Not through-- they nail themselves through the hands.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Yeah.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Right.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Mental.
00:19:13,00:19:15,So here's another thing about whipping.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Do you know about these guys called
00:19:16,00:19:20,"""flagulants"" for the Black Death?"
00:19:20,00:19:21,They would whip them so-- they would go to towns
00:19:21,00:19:24,where they were struggling with the plague.
00:19:24,00:19:26,And they would whip themselves for a fee
00:19:26,00:19:29,to bring God's favor onto a community.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"And the idea was they would hurt themselves,"
00:19:32,00:19:35,"and that would somehow get God's favor,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,and he would get rid of the plague.
00:19:37,00:19:37,It's a nice idea.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"Yeah, that's the best hate for it."
00:19:39,00:19:40,Was that big?
00:19:40,00:19:42,Because the only reference point I have to that
00:19:42,00:19:46,"is the Da Vinci code, where the evil guy and that whips"
00:19:46,00:19:46,themselves consistently--
00:19:46,00:19:47,"Oh, it's the same."
00:19:47,00:19:48,"Yeah, it's the same."
00:19:48,00:19:48,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:48,00:19:50,Yeah.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"And-- but at the same time, apparently,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,"there was another group called the pseudo-flagulants,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"and they also went around Europe,"
00:19:56,00:19:58,and they would also get money.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"But instead of hitting themselves with whips,"
00:20:00,00:20:05,they performed unusual sexual acts in public.
00:20:05,00:20:08,And it doesn't explain what unusual sexual acts are.
00:20:08,00:20:10,But you just know it's more fun than whipping yourself.
00:20:10,00:20:11,Yeah.
00:20:11,00:20:12,It is more fun.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"And also, it's hard to imagine God would be looking down"
00:20:15,00:20:17,"at this and going, yeah, those are the guys."
00:20:17,00:20:17,Those are the guys--
00:20:17,00:20:19,"Well done, man."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"I like weird, weird traditions."
00:20:21,00:20:24,I guess our traditions must look weird to our side as well.
00:20:24,00:20:28,"But in ""Garvel,"" you'll probably know this, James,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,which I think is in Sweden.
00:20:30,00:20:31,"They've had this tradition since 1966,"
00:20:31,00:20:35,where a town council built a 13-meter-tour goat figure
00:20:35,00:20:37,"to celebrate Christmas, made of straw,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,and vandals burned it down on Christmas Eve.
00:20:40,00:20:41,And now it's become tradition.
00:20:41,00:20:43,So the council is pretty pissed off about that.
00:20:43,00:20:45,Didn't want vandals to do this.
00:20:45,00:20:46,But now it's become tradition.
00:20:46,00:20:49,They've maintained this 13-meter-tour figure.
00:20:49,00:20:51,And almost every year vandals keep burning it down.
00:20:51,00:20:54,"And there's this constant night tug of war in this little town,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"the Christmas tradition, the burning of the ""Garvel"" goat"
00:20:56,00:20:56,happens.
00:20:56,00:21:00,And I think it's happened 26 times since 1966.
00:21:00,00:21:04,"And since the 1980s, an English bookmaker's"
00:21:04,00:21:06,allows you to place bets on the goat's survival.
00:21:06,00:21:07,"Which you like to bet, James."
00:21:07,00:21:09,I can imagine you should do that.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"I mean, it just stopped building it out of straw, maybe."
00:21:11,00:21:13,"Something less flammable, if they really--"
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Yeah, but also as well."
00:21:14,00:21:15,Yeah.
00:21:15,00:21:18,I was when I was looking into the whipping.
00:21:18,00:21:20,I suddenly realized it in no much about whipping.
00:21:20,00:21:22,And I wanted to find out more.
00:21:22,00:21:25,And this was a surprising thing.
00:21:25,00:21:27,I read about a guy who had not heard from in history
00:21:27,00:21:28,called Whipping Tom.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Has anyone heard of Whipping Tom?
00:21:29,00:21:31,"No, it's really, but no."
00:21:31,00:21:33,"OK, it was an attacker in London,"
00:21:33,00:21:39,"lived near Hackney, who would attack women walking in the street."
00:21:39,00:21:42,He never did anything to the point of actually killing any of them.
00:21:42,00:21:45,But he was just whipping them.
00:21:45,00:21:49,He would approach them on accompanied women in alleys and courtyards.
00:21:49,00:21:52,And he would just spank them on the butt with his whip.
00:21:52,00:21:53,And then he would sue my oyster.
00:21:53,00:21:55,Yeah.
00:21:55,00:21:56,"No, and he'd flee."
00:21:56,00:21:58,My favorite thing about it is they did eventually
00:21:58,00:21:59,capture the person.
00:21:59,00:22:02,"And then there was a copycat Whipping Tom, who appeared"
00:22:02,00:22:05,"a few years later, but the description of him--"
00:22:05,00:22:08,and I know it's obviously this was distressing for women.
00:22:08,00:22:10,But it was the 1600s.
00:22:10,00:22:12,We can laugh about it.
00:22:12,00:22:16,He would see-- he would wait in narrow and dimly alleys and courtyards.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"And a pot and seeing on accompanied women,"
00:22:18,00:22:22,"he would grab them, lift their dress, and slap their buttocks"
00:22:22,00:22:23,repeatedly before fleeing.
00:22:23,00:22:28,"He would sometimes accompany his attacks by shouting, ""Spanko!"""
00:22:28,00:22:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:30,00:22:31,He sounds like a superhero.
00:22:31,00:22:33,He sounds like a superhero.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Spanko, man."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"So yeah, in Czechoslovakia, he would have been a superhero."
00:22:37,00:22:38,"That would have been a really good thing for him to be doing, right?"
00:22:38,00:22:39,"Because the ladies love it, then."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Yeah, there would have been like, where's Spanko?"
00:22:41,00:22:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:43,00:22:51,"OK, time for our final fact of the show."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"Anna, this one's yours."
00:22:53,00:22:54,Yeah.
00:22:54,00:22:58,"So my fact is that at Earl's Court tube station in 1911,"
00:22:58,00:23:02,a one-legged man was employed to write the escalator.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"This is Bumper Harris, isn't it?"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"This is Bumper Harris, yeah."
00:23:05,00:23:07,And he was employed to write the escalator.
00:23:07,00:23:08,It was the first escalator that had been
00:23:08,00:23:10,installed on the London Underground.
00:23:10,00:23:13,And people were always really scared of new inventions.
00:23:13,00:23:15,So common places seem to us.
00:23:15,00:23:19,And so he was employed by the Department of Transport
00:23:19,00:23:22,to write up and down the escalator and show people that it was safe.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"And I think the idea was like, even a one-legged man"
00:23:25,00:23:26,can get up and down this safely.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"So you're probably going to be fine, guys."
00:23:28,00:23:31,Did he-- was he one-legged or did he have a prosthetic?
00:23:31,00:23:33,I think he had a prosthetic leg.
00:23:33,00:23:33,OK.
00:23:33,00:23:37,"Although weirdly, in the first week that the escalator was installed,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,"nine dresses were torn, one finger was pinched,"
00:23:39,00:23:42,and one lame passenger fell off his crotch.
00:23:42,00:23:44,So apparently not that suitable.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"Well, they weren't as--"
00:23:46,00:23:49,"in their early days, escalators weren't as--"
00:23:49,00:23:51,"for example, there wasn't a side handrail"
00:23:51,00:23:53,that you could hold that would go down with you and so on.
00:23:53,00:23:56,So there were a lot more harsh.
00:23:56,00:23:57,Yeah.
00:23:57,00:23:59,It wasn't the first escalator when you came at Harris.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"Yeah, that's right."
00:24:00,00:24:01,But you used to have someone selling at the top
00:24:01,00:24:03,with a bottle of brandy to give people
00:24:03,00:24:04,a little shots to come around.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"Brandy and Smellings, that all deal."
00:24:05,00:24:06,Really?
00:24:06,00:24:07,Yeah.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"1920s, they had a system in--"
00:24:09,00:24:12,they designed a system for Atlanta.
00:24:12,00:24:14,And they had walkways that would go at six miles an hour.
00:24:14,00:24:15,It's not that fast.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"It was kind of fast, you know."
00:24:16,00:24:19,And the idea was that you would have a walkway
00:24:19,00:24:20,that went at six miles an hour.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"And then next to that, you would have one at four miles an hour."
00:24:22,00:24:25,So you would only have a two miles an hour jump
00:24:25,00:24:26,to go from one to the other.
00:24:26,00:24:29,Next to that would be a moving walkway of two miles an hour.
00:24:29,00:24:31,"And next to that would be a moving walkway, which"
00:24:31,00:24:32,didn't move.
00:24:32,00:24:33,That's sensible.
00:24:33,00:24:35,Kind of a walkway.
00:24:35,00:24:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:36,00:24:40,But that never took off because basically cars
00:24:40,00:24:41,came in around the same time.
00:24:41,00:24:43,And so they didn't need them anymore.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"I think they installed a similar system, though, in Paris."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"I find it weird how long it took them, by the way,"
00:24:47,00:24:48,to put stairs on escalators.
00:24:48,00:24:52,"Because for like 20 years, they had travelators, which"
00:24:52,00:24:53,were just slopes upwards.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"But anyway, I think they had what you're describing in Paris."
00:24:56,00:25:00,"They had-- it was about a mile long, I think, in 1900."
00:25:00,00:25:03,And it was two moving walkways going at different pieces.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"And anyway, Thomas Edison turned up there."
00:25:05,00:25:07,So he seemed to be everywhere around this time doing his thing.
00:25:07,00:25:09,And he was really impressed with it.
00:25:09,00:25:11,And he decided to film it and the footage.
00:25:11,00:25:13,So I watched the footage of him filming this walkway in Paris.
00:25:13,00:25:14,And everyone's really excited by it.
00:25:14,00:25:16,Because it's a new innovation.
00:25:16,00:25:17,And there's a moment in the footage.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"And I'll put it on the website page, where a man just"
00:25:19,00:25:22,appears from the crowd and punches a boy in the face.
00:25:22,00:25:23,"Oh, what?"
00:25:23,00:25:24,I'll put it on the website.
00:25:24,00:25:27,"Does he shut Spanko, where he's--"
00:25:27,00:25:29,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
00:25:29,00:25:31,It's so weird.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"Before the L's court, the first escalator L's court,"
00:25:34,00:25:35,I didn't realize that they had--
00:25:35,00:25:39,"they installed this spiral escalator in the 1880s,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"or spiral elevator, I think they called it at the time."
00:25:41,00:25:44,And it was really just meant to be like a scenic ride.
00:25:44,00:25:47,And so it was meant to simulate being
00:25:47,00:25:49,in France in the middle of the mountains.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"And so you went up this spiral, which was--"
00:25:51,00:25:54,"I can't remember how many meters high, but pretty high--"
00:25:54,00:25:54,went up and up.
00:25:54,00:25:58,And then you was surrounded by these Vistas panoramas
00:25:58,00:25:59,of beautiful mountains.
00:25:59,00:26:00,Where was that--
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Oh, it was cool."
00:26:01,00:26:01,"Oh, was it?"
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:05,The first ever escalator was in Coney Island.
00:26:05,00:26:08,And that was also an amusement rather than anything else.
00:26:08,00:26:09,It was just a ride.
00:26:09,00:26:13,"But there was 75,000 people rode it in the first two weeks."
00:26:13,00:26:16,There's an amazing ride of standing on an escalator.
00:26:16,00:26:17,Yeah.
00:26:17,00:26:20,I was reading into just--
00:26:20,00:26:23,I got interested in other sort of debuts
00:26:23,00:26:24,with the underground.
00:26:24,00:26:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:25,00:26:28,Just to see if there are any notable written about stories.
00:26:28,00:26:32,"And there's a great one for the opening of the Circle Line,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,which was in 1884.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"And this was the review from the Times newspaper, which"
00:26:37,00:26:41,"said, ""A form of mild torture, which no person would undergo"
00:26:41,00:26:43,"if he could conveniently help it."""
00:26:43,00:26:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:44,00:26:46,Or a separate review for--
00:26:46,00:26:48,"When the chew first opened, there"
00:26:48,00:26:51,was a guy who'd spent a lot of time in Kenya
00:26:51,00:26:51,rode on it.
00:26:51,00:26:56,And he described that the smell was being like a crocodile's breath.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:26:58,That's a terrible smell.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"Well, presumably, I don't know."
00:27:00,00:27:01,It's kind of nice for people to experience.
00:27:01,00:27:04,You would never going to meet a crocodile in real life.
00:27:04,00:27:05,You just go on the chew.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"Turn it into a positive, yeah."
00:27:06,00:27:08,A crocodile's breath after it's just eaten a pig.
00:27:08,00:27:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:10,00:27:14,I like so how frightened people are of new inventions.
00:27:14,00:27:16,And always have been in history and how totally mental
00:27:16,00:27:17,it seems to us now.
00:27:17,00:27:22,"Like, the obvious fear of one heart of trains, didn't they?"
00:27:22,00:27:23,So I think when Stevenson was trying
00:27:23,00:27:28,"to encourage investment in his whole railway idea,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"then the parliament, a lot of MPs, were really, really"
00:27:30,00:27:31,against it.
00:27:31,00:27:33,And it was thought that he-- so he intended for trains
00:27:33,00:27:35,to be going between 12 and 15 miles an hour.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"And he was advised beforehand, definitely not"
00:27:37,00:27:39,to claim in the House of Commons that they would go above 9.
00:27:39,00:27:42,Because that were totally free people out there.
00:27:42,00:27:45,And then one of the-- so one of the MPs asks him in parliament--
00:27:45,00:27:48,suppose one of these engines to be going along at a rate of 9
00:27:48,00:27:51,"or 10 miles an hour, and a cow were to strip on the line,"
00:27:51,00:27:55,would that not be a very awkward circumstance?
00:27:55,00:27:59,"And he just-- he just said, yes, very awkward for the cow."
00:27:59,00:28:00,And that was it.
00:28:00,00:28:03,"Good-- good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
00:28:03,00:28:08,I also like-- this is my final invention thing.
00:28:08,00:28:10,"I like that people were really frightened of bicycles,"
00:28:10,00:28:14,"quite anti-bicycles, when they first came in from the 1860s,"
00:28:14,00:28:15,"onwards, I guess."
00:28:15,00:28:20,"And doctors warned about things like bicycle hernia, bicycle--"
00:28:20,00:28:25,"bicycle cyclist neurosis, cyclist sore throat,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,and bicycle face.
00:28:26,00:28:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:28,00:28:32,"So I mean, someone on a bicycle rides into your face."
00:28:32,00:28:33,"You would have thought, but actually it"
00:28:33,00:28:36,meant that you're going to have such a constant look of stress
00:28:36,00:28:38,on your face from having to balance your bike
00:28:38,00:28:40,that it's going to get stuck like that.
00:28:40,00:28:42,And you're going to be permanently twisted.
00:28:42,00:28:43,Like getting square eyes from watching--
00:28:43,00:28:45,Exactly.
00:28:45,00:28:47,And just going back to Bumper Harris.
00:28:47,00:28:50,So it was slightly controversial when we first
00:28:50,00:28:53,read about this quite a few years ago.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"Matt Coward, who's one of the QI researchers,"
00:28:55,00:28:57,"reckons that it might be a myth,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"because he couldn't find any evidence,"
00:28:59,00:29:03,contempt-porious news reports mentioned in Bumper Harris.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"So I think there are news reports from the time,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,but they don't give evidence as to who he was
00:29:09,00:29:10,where you could find him.
00:29:10,00:29:12,They don't have evidence from the transport.
00:29:12,00:29:14,Because you would think that it would be the kind of thing
00:29:14,00:29:15,they would mention.
00:29:15,00:29:16,They would have recorded.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"Well, yeah, I feel like we disagree on this,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,but maybe I like to believe in room.
00:29:19,00:29:22,So it was recorded from the early 1920s.
00:29:22,00:29:24,And there is a guy who says that he's Bumper Harris's
00:29:24,00:29:27,"great grandson, who's called Aaron, who can give, like,"
00:29:27,00:29:31,who gives anecdotal evidence about how he apparently retired.
00:29:31,00:29:34,So he says he eventually retired to make cider violins
00:29:34,00:29:36,and become a watercolour artist.
00:29:36,00:29:38,"So with that kind of personal detail, James,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,I don't know how you can thwart this story.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"I would love to know if anyone, like, listening"
00:29:42,00:29:44,by any chance knows anyone who claims to be related
00:29:44,00:29:47,"to Bumper Harris, I would love to know if it is true."
00:29:47,00:29:47,Yeah.
00:29:47,00:29:48,So get in touch.
00:29:48,00:29:54,"OK, that's it for another episode."
00:29:54,00:29:54,That's all our facts.
