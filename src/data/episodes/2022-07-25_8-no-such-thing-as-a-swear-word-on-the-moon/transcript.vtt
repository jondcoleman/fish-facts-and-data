WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.160
 Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.480
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.680
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.680
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:25.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.400
 a weekly QI podcast coming to you from the QI offices

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 in Covenant Garden.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.560
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.560
 I'm sitting here with three other elves, James Harkin,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880
 Alex Bell, and Anna Chazinski.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360
 And once again, we're gathering around our microphone,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.920
 and we're going to share with each other

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.320
 our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 So in no particular order, here they are.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 Alex, let's start with you.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.720
 OK, my fact is that one of the last things that NASA

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.960
 had to do before launching space shuttles

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080
 was detach the inflatable owls.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.480
 Wow, why would they have inflatable owls

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.440
 on those space shuttles?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 Basically, this was at Cape Kennedy.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.920
 And they had a bit of a wildlife problem there, just generally,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.800
 because the launch pad is actually

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.480
 in the middle of a nature reserve.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.960
 So one of the problems they had was with woodpeckers

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.320
 on the big fuel tanks on the side of the space shuttle

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.600
 there, sort of bright orange.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.160
 And they're covered in foam insulation,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.120
 which is quite delicate.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.640
 And they had this problem with woodpeckers

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.560
 that were just coming up and pecking holes in them.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.920
 And they have no idea why they were doing this.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.600
 So didn't they actually have to cancel a shuttle launch

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.160
 in order to-- because too much damage was done to work?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.120
 Yeah, discovery, I think, was one of the ones

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.200
 that was delayed quite a lot.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.240
 And then it can't fall into rescheduled and things.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.680
 So they did several things.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 Firstly, they used sound blasters, which I think

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.960
 were some sort of sound thing to scare away woodpeckers.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.080
 They also, apparently, had a 24 hour bird-watching contingent

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.560
 on the run-up to the launch to keep an eye out.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.960
 Yeah, I read that there were people, members of the public,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920
 when they'd heard about this, writing in with their own suggestions.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 Like amateur scientists.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.560
 Yeah, there's great suggestions.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.440
 One of them was to paint the tanks blue.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.600
 A color woodpeckers hate.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 Station falcons at the pads.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.000
 So acting, yeah, effectively, falcons would chase them off.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 Boyle skunk cabbage and spray water on the tanks.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.440
 What skunk cabbage?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.480
 I have no idea.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.000
 This is just--

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.480
 It put back as, hey, blue.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.400
 Do they-- like, sunny days are just a nightmare.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.880
 Well, they're not trying to peck the sky,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.280
 they're just doing like the taste of blue.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 Like that.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 I just say, I'm not allowed to let my dog off the lead

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.320
 in a nature reserve, a NASA can build

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.560
 like an entire space station in the middle of one.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.560
 It seems like not a good place to put it.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.480
 Well, I think there was tickles on issues.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.600
 There were some other problems as well.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.000
 I've got an article from a newspaper from 1983

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.360
 that some headlined NASA must cope with wild pigs,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.320
 as a quote from it saying, that the space centrifugeals

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.920
 say they routinely check runways

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.840
 for pigs and alligators before any aircraft is clear to land.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.680
 I don't think that's space shuttles, but that's--

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.120
 Yeah, alligators supposedly always

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.040
 lounging out, because it's a nice heated pad for the landing strip.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280
 It's not a great place for pigs to be living where

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.600
 alligators live as well.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.480
 Imagine the secret of CCTV footage.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 They must have epic battles on the runways

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.840
 and you can see a little bat that was obviously sleeping

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.920
 on the shuttle, and obviously woke up when his home

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920
 took off.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.360
 NASA had to say, we're really sorry, but he probably died.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.080
 I was really upset.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080
 Sorry, go on.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.520
 No, just on the pig thing.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.520
 NASA actually hired a pig trapper, only in this article.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.160
 And you imagine kind of going into someone

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.480
 saying, yeah, I work for NASA.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.960
 What do you do?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.720
 Yeah, I track the--

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.920
 Yeah, I'm the pig trapper.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.000
 I'm NASA.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.320
 Yeah, I'm a pig trapper.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.000
 It's figure pigs.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 This is almost unrelated.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240
 But do you know, many evil times in England,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.520
 pigs were a bigger pest than rats in London.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.320
 And feral pigs were all over London.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880
 The government offered rewards if you could kill a pig

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.720
 and bring the evidence that you'd kill the feral pig.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.920
 They'd just be in your cupboard, seat in your cereal.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920
 Yeah.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.080
 Pooing all over the kitchen floor.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.440
 So we haven't said--

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.960
 So the reason they had owls, inflatable owls,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.640
 is because of these woodpeckers.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.840
 And that was the solution to put these owls.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.320
 So they were basically just spherical balloons

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.840
 with owl eyes and an evil eyebrow.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.200
 They'd sit on the top to look like an owl.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 I'll put some pictures up on the website.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.640
 But they were called, I think, owl terror eyes.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.080
 And then you can buy them now as well.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.800
 They just sort of festooned them over the structure

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.280
 of the space shuttle, like Halloween decorations.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.480
 Because they did have owls that were living on the crane

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.760
 that was attached to the space shuttle.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.920
 I don't know if there was a theory that during that period,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.360
 that's why there were no woodpeckers there,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.880
 because there was owls living there.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.960
 But they'd gone to a lot of trouble with the RSPCA

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.640
 and other wildlife foundations.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.120
 Because when they did take off this one time,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.560
 they blasted these owls.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.800
 Oh, it's terrible.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.560
 But what's interesting is that NASA's actually

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.560
 been talked into taking it quite seriously

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.240
 and looking after the animals.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.560
 So they actively do do that.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.720
 So if they're going to retrieve any of the booster rockets

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.360
 that land in the banana river, which has apparently

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.880
 the largest refuge of manatees in America,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.120
 they now use water jets as opposed to propellers

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.040
 so that they don't kill any of the wildlife.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.000
 So they've changed the system for that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.880
 This is an interesting one.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.520
 They used to have blinding lights that shine when they were

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.720
 on the launch pads.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.920
 That were the turtles that were going into the sea.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.400
 Log head sea turtles.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.440
 They would see the light as opposed to the moonshine.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.920
 And the moonshine would usually direct them to the ocean.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.800
 But they would see the launch pad lights.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.760
 And they would head towards the launch pad lights

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.360
 and die on the way, because they'd never reach the ocean.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.880
 So they've changed their lights to be less disorientating

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.640
 bulbs.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.560
 Good for NASA.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.240
 So I like low-fi things that they do.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.040
 The astronauts do like-- they use tacco sauce

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.480
 to secure debris on the ISS.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.960
 And they're inside the space suits.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.800
 They have a little bit of velcro that they

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.760
 used to itch their nose with, because they can't itch their nose

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 and stuff like that.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 It's stuff like that.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 Yeah, NASA's very good.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.880
 Like, the ALS is a good example of just a continuing

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.160
 tradition of highly inventive solutions.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.040
 What was the one that you initially, Alex,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.960
 you had a fact that you wanted to use?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.040
 So I think this has been doing around the internet recently,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.840
 apparently, but I was watching a really old documentary

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.400
 about various aspects of the earlier space program.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.480
 And apparently, in the men's spacesuits,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.720
 there's a sort of condom-like sheath

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.160
 that the astronauts have to wear so that they can go

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.000
 to the Lou in the suits.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.480
 And they came in three sizes, which

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.840
 is small, medium, and large.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.480
 But all the astronauts are just picking large,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.160
 and they refuse to give the old NASA decided

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.880
 to change the names to large gigantic and humongous names.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.760
 It's true.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.360
 I found this out, which I really like.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.800
 Charlie Juke, who was on Apollo 16.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.480
 He had such a problem with swearing

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.160
 that he had to be hypnotized before heading into space

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.000
 so that he wouldn't swear once he was on the moon.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.360
 So when they were doing live broadcasts--

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.960
 Are you not allowed to swear on the moon?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.360
 Well, no, I think because we were being--

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.560
 Oh, we were hearing everything.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.760
 Yeah, so he was told not to swear.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.880
 And it led, as a result, he sings a lot on the moon

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.360
 because that was the compensation in the hypnosis.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.520
 He got suddenly--

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.440
 Oh, really?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.720
 Every time he was going to swear,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.600
 he just belted out my way or something.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.440
 There was that guy.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.680
 I can't remember which astronaut it was.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.000
 I bet one of you guys remembers who Smok got told off

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.040
 really badly for smuggling a sandwich into space.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.720
 I think it was called Beef Sandwich, wasn't it?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.960
 And I can't remember who it was in the 1960s.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.200
 Yes, but then weirdly, when Buzz and Neil Armstrong

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.600
 landed on the moon, their first meal

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.120
 was a ham salad sandwich.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.960
 Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.440
 And we know that Buzz smuggled some stuff up to the moon, don't we?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.040
 Yeah, yeah, he smuggled up some wine and some holy bread,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.640
 which had been blessed by a priest.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.160
 Yeah, to do the first of a communion.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.040
 Yeah, he's incredible.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.520
 You could sneak--

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.720
 Yeah, it really is.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.760
 It makes me question whether we can put

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.600
 NASA in charge of outer space missions.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.160
 But they can't even body-search someone properly.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.480
 Apollo 12, you get a checklist, which are these kind of flip

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.920
 boards that you get on board the ship.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.000
 Some of the prankster kind of employees for NASA,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.960
 some of the engineers snuck on playboy photos

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.760
 in between the checklist.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.040
 So yeah, I will put a photo up on QI.com/podcast.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.080
 It's a--

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.880
 It's a naked, naked, naked spot.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.560
 No, it's history, James.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.360
 You're really trying to get people onto my website.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.280
 Come to QI.com/podcast.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.800
 You can see naked ladies--

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.000
 Boops from outer space.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:45.560
 OK, time for fact number two, this one's mine.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.840
 So we all know the famous advert that

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.800
 comes on at the beginning of DVDs.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.000
 That sort of anti-piracy.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.400
 You wouldn't steal a card.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:05.320
 You wouldn't steal a handbag.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.280
 The advert that's telling you--

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.760
 Right at the end, what does it say, Alex?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.040
 It says, "piracy is a crime.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.240
 I think piracy is stealing."

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.320
 Piracy is stealing, yeah.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.520
 And so is stealing.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.440
 And so is stealing.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.840
 That's definitely stealing, it's a crime.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.680
 It was officially, I mean, it was commissioned

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.520
 for an anti-piracy ad, but it was meant

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.960
 to be used just at a small film festival where

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.960
 they were sort of showcasing this thing.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.240
 So the guy who created it, his name is Melchior Wright-Velt.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.160
 He wrote this music.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.680
 He got given basic money for it to be

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.520
 used at this local film festival.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.320
 And then in 2007, he bought a Harry Potter DVD.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.200
 The top was this advert with his music.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.840
 And so since 2007, all the way to 2012,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.600
 he's been trying to say, could I have the money, please?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.520
 Because he was owed millions, I mean,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.320
 for the amount of use--

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.320
 Wow.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.040
 Yeah, and so finally, the company that was using it

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.120
 called him up, a guy called Mr. Gerritz.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.160
 And he said that he would pay him out for 1 million euros.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.480
 But that Mr. Gerritz would get to keep 1/3 of that money

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.560
 for all the hard work and trouble that he'd gone through

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.440
 to get him that 1 million euros.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.200
 So anyway, he recorded that conversation.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.720
 He played it.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.920
 Mr. Gerritz got fired.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.520
 And he's been compensated since.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.680
 It's pretty appalling that they did that, though.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.440
 And then it's not great.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.040
 I know it will get us out of this mess.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.240
 An old-fashioned bride.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.080
 What?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.600
 Did you guys know that Holly Davidson tried

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.440
 to trademark the sound of its revs?

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.040
 What?

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.640
 Yep.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.000
 Those three revs, apparently, I don't really know much about motorbikes.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.200
 But apparently, the three revs at the start

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.960
 sound like, I think this is on the Holly Davidson website.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.120
 Sound like potato, potato, potato.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.880
 And fair enough, loads of other motorbikes manufacturers

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.960
 said, I'm really sorry.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.640
 Our revs sound really similar.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.480
 You can't do this.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.760
 And they didn't.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.560
 Asda cooperates with slapping your ass.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.400
 Really?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 Yeah.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.080
 Does it-- you know, it goes that advert where you go,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.400
 did, do, do, do, do.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.400
 Don't they go, that's Asda price?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.240
 Yeah, that's right.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.800
 Is it just your own ass or anyone's?

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.680
 Like, is it copyrighted a sexual advance, basically?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.200
 Yeah.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.640
 Basically, the way these things work

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.560
 is it's only in the specific area.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.560
 If you're trying to pass off as their kind of thing.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.600
 So, Aldi or Waitrose couldn't do an ass slapping kind of advert

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.640
 because they copyrighted it for that.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.840
 There was also someone copyrighted touching the side

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.520
 of your nose as if to indicate knowledge

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.560
 and also tipping a bowl of hat.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.480
 And they're both registered by building societies.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480
 Really?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.080
 I think we're living in a really interesting time

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.360
 when it comes to copyright and piracy and so on.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.440
 Because we don't quite yet know if it works for or against.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.560
 The people who either make or sell or whatever.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.320
 But like, for example, Monty Python decided

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.280
 they were going to put up a bunch of clips on YouTube

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.680
 from their old Monty Python flying circus series.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.360
 And actually, it had the reverse effect of what you would think.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.520
 On the Amazon charts, they went up to number two.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.520
 And the sales increased by an estimated 16,000 to 23,000 percent

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.240
 on Amazon alone.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.960
 And that's that worked in their favor,

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.920
 whereas everyone would encourage you not to do that because--

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.000
 So, it's really odd.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.160
 You don't know if it works for or against.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.680
 Well, the guys and Netflix, they look into what people are pirating.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.520
 And then they decide what to buy, depending

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.000
 on what people are pirating.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.600
 Really?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.280
 Sensible.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.600
 That's very sensible, yeah.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.880
 I like with video games.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.080
 They have a different approach to anti-piracy.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.080
 They actually embed within their games protection thing

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.200
 so that you can continue playing the game,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.120
 but you know that you've got a stolen item.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.080
 For example, there's a game called Michael Jackson,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.320
 The Experience, which is on DS.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.880
 And the idea is that once the game realizes

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.960
 that you've got a pirated version of it, it halts it,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.920
 and it just plays with a cellar music all over it.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.840
 So it's just a loop.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.560
 So it's just a constant loop.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.040
 That's pretty clever, that I can't do.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.760
 It's a Batman game as well, which when it knows

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.400
 that you've got a pirated copy, like--

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.880
 Batman comes in, in case you're asked.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.480
 Physically comes to the door.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.760
 No, his cape will refuse to open, preventing players

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.000
 from gliding and gliding as a massive part of the game.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.240
 So you can only get so far without being to do anything.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.400
 Talking about similar things to that.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.080
 In the early days of cinema, they

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.680
 had silent cinema, and people would pirate films basically

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.200
 by just taking an entire film, cutting in a bit of new material

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.800
 and releasing it as a new picture.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.800
 And there was a company called The Biograph Company.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.720
 And what they did was they made sure

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.120
 that their trademark was in every single shot.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.160
 So it would be on a door or on a wall or in a window

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.200
 or on a T-shirt or something like that.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.680
 So that every time someone did that,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.080
 they'd just see their trademark all the way through the movie.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.600
 That's very good.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.280
 They-- years ago on Museum of Curiosity,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.040
 we had Terry Pratchadon.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.080
 He told us this thing about, in Germany,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.800
 in the German translated versions of his books,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.920
 he said someone would write to him from Germany saying,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.760
 do you know that they've placed adverts in your book?

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.800
 And so Terry was fine.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.960
 Because he was like, well, in America, back in the day,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.840
 that's what they would do.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.920
 There would be just an advert, a full-page advert

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.200
 for a cigarette company or something like that.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.640
 And you'd just continue reading.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.600
 So he was fine with it.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.680
 And so he said, no, that's cool.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.400
 But the person wrote back saying, no, no, no.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.360
 They've inserted the ad into the dialogue amongst the characters.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.120
 So while the characters from his Discworld novels are running around,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.320
 they would suddenly stop because they were quite parched

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.400
 and crack open a Coca-Cola while they were being chased

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.880
 or open some magic two-minute noodles

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.040
 and make some two-minute noodles before carrying on

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.120
 with what Terry Pratchadon had written.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.640
 And so apparently, this wasn't just Terry Pratchad books.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.000
 There was a lot of books in Germany and Pratchad wrote to them

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.400
 and he's had this stopped now.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.240
 But yeah.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.240
 That's so good.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.760
 Yeah.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.520
 They also, I like, because you reminded me that in China,

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.040
 there's a lot of a similar thing where they take existing text

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.880
 or footage, but in this case, text.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.280
 So with Harry Potter books, because of the distance

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.080
 of time between each of the sequels,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.320
 people just started writing their own Harry Potter books

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.600
 and publishing in China.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.360
 Yeah, I've got a list.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.800
 That Harry Potter and the Big Funnel.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.080
 This is great.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.280
 I'll give you this was the blurb.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.320
 They came on the book.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:10.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.080
 No, they were all trying to pass themselves off as genuine books.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.280
 This is the blurb.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.640
 After six years at Hogwarts, Harry Potter

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.600
 has become an intern sorcerer and is assigned to teach

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.200
 at the Honitan School.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.280
 Harry has a painful time at his aunt's house

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.040
 as Dudley has met a belly dancing girl

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.080
 as Harry prepares to report to his job.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.320
 Batbug warns him disaster awaits.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.600
 Exciting new character, Batbug.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.560
 At the school, his students become wooden stools

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.840
 one after another.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.320
 Harry doesn't know whether an evil student is behind this

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.360
 or if his old benefactor, Hagrid, is making a mistake

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.640
 or if the shadow of Voldemort has returned

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.040
 or did it have something to do with the Big Funnel?

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.760
 Leave me open and leave me with more of this, more of this.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.400
 So that's the Big Funnel list.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.760
 I reckon it has something to do with the Big Funnel.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.600
 Yeah.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.520
 I'm going to wise my the title.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.800
 This is a French version of Harry Potter's book.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.760
 Because Lord Voldemort's name, his full name,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.680
 Tom Marvelli Riddle, has to be an addict grandma

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.760
 by "I am Lord Voldemort."

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:11.960
 Yeah.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.720
 And so it doesn't work in all different countries.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.640
 They have to change his name.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.560
 And in France, his middle name is Elvis.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.120
 That's a great fact.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.120
 Do you know what I think the Chinese are doing

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.680
 with the Harry Potter thing?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.320
 This is just coincidentally, I was reading a bit of an interview

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.320
 yesterday with this woman who decided to translate

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.560
 Finnegun's Wake, which is like James Joyce's

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.200
 more dense than Ulysses' work.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.000
 And she's taken, I think, seven years

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.480
 to translate the first third of it into Mandarin.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.480
 And there's been quite a best seller in China, and they love it.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.040
 But there's a little clip of her saying,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.560
 I don't-- this is so hard.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.440
 Please stop crushing me.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.720
 I just don't know if I can write the rest of it.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.760
 I don't know if I can translate the rest right now.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.680
 So the Chinese are used to having what

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.520
 we've got a third of Finnegun's Wake.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.560
 We love it.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.560
 Once and next in a storm, then.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.240
 OK, time to move on to fact number three, which is yours, James.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.000
 OK, yeah, my fact is that, according

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.840
 to the government's website of the Czech Republic,

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.120
 there are three symbols of Easter in the Czech Republic.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.440
 They are Easter eggs, the Easter lamb, and whipping.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.320
 I really want to do that on a poker, sorry.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.360
 No, so this is a tradition that happens every Easter Monday

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.800
 in the Czech Republic.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.520
 And boys, young lads, would go around whipping young maids

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.320
 so that they are healthy and cheerful for the entire year

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.800
 to come.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.960
 And the girls, as a reward for being whipped,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.240
 they give their boys decorated Easter eggs called cross-leads.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.120
 Because they're so grateful for being whipped, yeah, cool.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.000
 Apparently, anyone visiting the country

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.600
 is a bit concerned when they see it,

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.000
 because one of the things I like to do

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.520
 is to chase the women around with these whips.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.200
 While they run away.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.760
 Apparently, everyone loves it, so it's--

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.760
 Yeah.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.600
 These whips, they're like very beautiful pieces of willow

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.240
 with ribbons on, so they're not like a, you know,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.440
 it's not like a leather, cat or nine tails kind of thing.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.520
 But yeah, I really love that.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.640
 Just I like to look at traditions that are going on around

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.960
 the world. There's loads of really cool stuff happening around Easter,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.760
 because often, as well as it being like a Catholic feast,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.920
 it was traditionally like a pagan time of year, you know,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.640
 it's a rebirth of things.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.400
 So there's all sorts of going on.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.320
 Apparently, in Norway, I was reading this.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.240
 I don't have this as true.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.080
 But most of the major television stations

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.400
 of Easter show murder mystery shows.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.040
 And that's all they show, because it's become a tradition

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.840
 that you watch murder mysteries in Norway, obviously.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.400
 And in the Philippines, some Christians

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.320
 will-- because they want to associate themselves with Jesus,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.040
 they will crucify themselves.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.600
 They'll nail themselves onto a cross and be self

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.160
 and be graduated and very painful.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.840
 But there's a lot of people around so that they don't--

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.600
 Not through-- they nail themselves through the hands.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.400
 Yeah.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.200
 Right.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.480
 Mental.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.640
 So here's another thing about whipping.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.920
 Do you know about these guys called

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.080
 "flagulants" for the Black Death?

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.960
 They would whip them so-- they would go to towns

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.200
 where they were struggling with the plague.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.480
 And they would whip themselves for a fee

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.440
 to bring God's favor onto a community.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.600
 And the idea was they would hurt themselves,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.480
 and that would somehow get God's favor,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.120
 and he would get rid of the plague.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.800
 It's a nice idea.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.480
 Yeah, that's the best hate for it.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.280
 Was that big?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.560
 Because the only reference point I have to that

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.080
 is the Da Vinci code, where the evil guy and that whips

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.960
 themselves consistently--

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.840
 Oh, it's the same.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.360
 Yeah, it's the same.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.400
 Yeah.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.200
 And-- but at the same time, apparently,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.760
 there was another group called the pseudo-flagulants,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.520
 and they also went around Europe,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.200
 and they would also get money.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.160
 But instead of hitting themselves with whips,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.040
 they performed unusual sexual acts in public.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.520
 And it doesn't explain what unusual sexual acts are.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.560
 But you just know it's more fun than whipping yourself.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.080
 Yeah.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.080
 It is more fun.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.160
 And also, it's hard to imagine God would be looking down

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.400
 at this and going, yeah, those are the guys.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.880
 Those are the guys--

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.040
 Well done, man.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.440
 I like weird, weird traditions.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.320
 I guess our traditions must look weird to our side as well.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.000
 But in "Garvel," you'll probably know this, James,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.160
 which I think is in Sweden.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.960
 They've had this tradition since 1966,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.520
 where a town council built a 13-meter-tour goat figure

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.960
 to celebrate Christmas, made of straw,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.440
 and vandals burned it down on Christmas Eve.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.800
 And now it's become tradition.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.520
 So the council is pretty pissed off about that.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.280
 Didn't want vandals to do this.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.240
 But now it's become tradition.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.120
 They've maintained this 13-meter-tour figure.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.520
 And almost every year vandals keep burning it down.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.080
 And there's this constant night tug of war in this little town,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.440
 the Christmas tradition, the burning of the "Garvel" goat

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:56.960
 happens.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.680
 And I think it's happened 26 times since 1966.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.000
 And since the 1980s, an English bookmaker's

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.160
 allows you to place bets on the goat's survival.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.480
 Which you like to bet, James.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.760
 I can imagine you should do that.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.600
 I mean, it just stopped building it out of straw, maybe.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.000
 Something less flammable, if they really--

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.080
 Yeah, but also as well.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080
 Yeah.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.400
 I was when I was looking into the whipping.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.440
 I suddenly realized it in no much about whipping.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.120
 And I wanted to find out more.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.360
 And this was a surprising thing.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.600
 I read about a guy who had not heard from in history

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.640
 called Whipping Tom.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.800
 Has anyone heard of Whipping Tom?

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.360
 No, it's really, but no.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.720
 OK, it was an attacker in London,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.000
 lived near Hackney, who would attack women walking in the street.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.760
 He never did anything to the point of actually killing any of them.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.280
 But he was just whipping them.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.280
 He would approach them on accompanied women in alleys and courtyards.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.120
 And he would just spank them on the butt with his whip.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.680
 And then he would sue my oyster.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.680
 Yeah.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.760
 No, and he'd flee.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.920
 My favorite thing about it is they did eventually

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920
 capture the person.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.280
 And then there was a copycat Whipping Tom, who appeared

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.200
 a few years later, but the description of him--

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.240
 and I know it's obviously this was distressing for women.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.280
 But it was the 1600s.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.200
 We can laugh about it.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.680
 He would see-- he would wait in narrow and dimly alleys and courtyards.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.640
 And a pot and seeing on accompanied women,

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.240
 he would grab them, lift their dress, and slap their buttocks

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.960
 repeatedly before fleeing.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.360
 He would sometimes accompany his attacks by shouting, "Spanko!"

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.960
 He sounds like a superhero.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.760
 He sounds like a superhero.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.200
 Spanko, man.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.160
 So yeah, in Czechoslovakia, he would have been a superhero.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.960
 That would have been a really good thing for him to be doing, right?

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.920
 Because the ladies love it, then.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.760
 Yeah, there would have been like, where's Spanko?

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:51.720
 OK, time for our final fact of the show.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.200
 Anna, this one's yours.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.240
 Yeah.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.560
 So my fact is that at Earl's Court tube station in 1911,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.200
 a one-legged man was employed to write the escalator.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.480
 This is Bumper Harris, isn't it?

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.880
 This is Bumper Harris, yeah.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.560
 And he was employed to write the escalator.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.840
 It was the first escalator that had been

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.520
 installed on the London Underground.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.320
 And people were always really scared of new inventions.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.280
 So common places seem to us.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.040
 And so he was employed by the Department of Transport

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.200
 to write up and down the escalator and show people that it was safe.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.040
 And I think the idea was like, even a one-legged man

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.840
 can get up and down this safely.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.480
 So you're probably going to be fine, guys.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.840
 Did he-- was he one-legged or did he have a prosthetic?

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.440
 I think he had a prosthetic leg.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:33.960
 OK.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.440
 Although weirdly, in the first week that the escalator was installed,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.920
 nine dresses were torn, one finger was pinched,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.560
 and one lame passenger fell off his crotch.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.400
 So apparently not that suitable.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.040
 Well, they weren't as--

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.400
 in their early days, escalators weren't as--

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.600
 for example, there wasn't a side handrail

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.760
 that you could hold that would go down with you and so on.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.600
 So there were a lot more harsh.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 Yeah.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.840
 It wasn't the first escalator when you came at Harris.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.360
 Yeah, that's right.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.960
 But you used to have someone selling at the top

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.440
 with a bottle of brandy to give people

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.480
 a little shots to come around.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.800
 Brandy and Smellings, that all deal.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.480
 Really?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.240
 Yeah.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.400
 1920s, they had a system in--

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.000
 they designed a system for Atlanta.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.720
 And they had walkways that would go at six miles an hour.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.440
 It's not that fast.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.840
 It was kind of fast, you know.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.000
 And the idea was that you would have a walkway

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.160
 that went at six miles an hour.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.480
 And then next to that, you would have one at four miles an hour.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.040
 So you would only have a two miles an hour jump

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.360
 to go from one to the other.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.680
 Next to that would be a moving walkway of two miles an hour.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.560
 And next to that would be a moving walkway, which

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.880
 didn't move.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.720
 That's sensible.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.120
 Kind of a walkway.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.000
 But that never took off because basically cars

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.320
 came in around the same time.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.240
 And so they didn't need them anymore.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.720
 I think they installed a similar system, though, in Paris.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.520
 I find it weird how long it took them, by the way,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.800
 to put stairs on escalators.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.000
 Because for like 20 years, they had travelators, which

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.160
 were just slopes upwards.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.120
 But anyway, I think they had what you're describing in Paris.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.840
 They had-- it was about a mile long, I think, in 1900.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.080
 And it was two moving walkways going at different pieces.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.120
 And anyway, Thomas Edison turned up there.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.920
 So he seemed to be everywhere around this time doing his thing.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.160
 And he was really impressed with it.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.120
 And he decided to film it and the footage.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.520
 So I watched the footage of him filming this walkway in Paris.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.680
 And everyone's really excited by it.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.280
 Because it's a new innovation.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.600
 And there's a moment in the footage.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.960
 And I'll put it on the website page, where a man just

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.720
 appears from the crowd and punches a boy in the face.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720
 Oh, what?

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.680
 I'll put it on the website.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.320
 Does he shut Spanko, where he's--

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.280
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.200
 It's so weird.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.400
 Before the L's court, the first escalator L's court,

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.960
 I didn't realize that they had--

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.440
 they installed this spiral escalator in the 1880s,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.600
 or spiral elevator, I think they called it at the time.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.840
 And it was really just meant to be like a scenic ride.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.440
 And so it was meant to simulate being

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.280
 in France in the middle of the mountains.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.600
 And so you went up this spiral, which was--

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.160
 I can't remember how many meters high, but pretty high--

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.840
 went up and up.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.000
 And then you was surrounded by these Vistas panoramas

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.240
 of beautiful mountains.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.240
 Where was that--

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.440
 Oh, it was cool.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:01.960
 Oh, was it?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.480
 Yeah.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.240
 The first ever escalator was in Coney Island.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.120
 And that was also an amusement rather than anything else.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.640
 It was just a ride.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.880
 But there was 75,000 people rode it in the first two weeks.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.080
 There's an amazing ride of standing on an escalator.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.680
 Yeah.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.160
 I was reading into just--

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.920
 I got interested in other sort of debuts

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920
 with the underground.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.320
 Just to see if there are any notable written about stories.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.240
 And there's a great one for the opening of the Circle Line,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.160
 which was in 1884.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.520
 And this was the review from the Times newspaper, which

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.600
 said, "A form of mild torture, which no person would undergo

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.600
 if he could conveniently help it."

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.440
 Or a separate review for--

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.480
 When the chew first opened, there

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.100
 was a guy who'd spent a lot of time in Kenya

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.600
 rode on it.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.600
 And he described that the smell was being like a crocodile's breath.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.200
 Yeah.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.360
 That's a terrible smell.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.000
 Well, presumably, I don't know.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.680
 It's kind of nice for people to experience.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.600
 You would never going to meet a crocodile in real life.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.640
 You just go on the chew.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.640
 Turn it into a positive, yeah.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.800
 A crocodile's breath after it's just eaten a pig.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.600
 I like so how frightened people are of new inventions.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.720
 And always have been in history and how totally mental

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.800
 it seems to us now.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.000
 Like, the obvious fear of one heart of trains, didn't they?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.560
 So I think when Stevenson was trying

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.120
 to encourage investment in his whole railway idea,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.520
 then the parliament, a lot of MPs, were really, really

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.360
 against it.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.240
 And it was thought that he-- so he intended for trains

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.200
 to be going between 12 and 15 miles an hour.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.120
 And he was advised beforehand, definitely not

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.480
 to claim in the House of Commons that they would go above 9.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.240
 Because that were totally free people out there.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.600
 And then one of the-- so one of the MPs asks him in parliament--

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.440
 suppose one of these engines to be going along at a rate of 9

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.880
 or 10 miles an hour, and a cow were to strip on the line,

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.000
 would that not be a very awkward circumstance?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.200
 And he just-- he just said, yes, very awkward for the cow.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.000
 And that was it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.440
 Good-- good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.200
 I also like-- this is my final invention thing.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.280
 I like that people were really frightened of bicycles,

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.160
 quite anti-bicycles, when they first came in from the 1860s,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.000
 onwards, I guess.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.320
 And doctors warned about things like bicycle hernia, bicycle--

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.240
 bicycle cyclist neurosis, cyclist sore throat,

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.720
 and bicycle face.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.200
 So I mean, someone on a bicycle rides into your face.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.840
 You would have thought, but actually it

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.600
 meant that you're going to have such a constant look of stress

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.560
 on your face from having to balance your bike

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.240
 that it's going to get stuck like that.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.160
 And you're going to be permanently twisted.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.760
 Like getting square eyes from watching--

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.360
 Exactly.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.480
 And just going back to Bumper Harris.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.240
 So it was slightly controversial when we first

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.840
 read about this quite a few years ago.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.680
 Matt Coward, who's one of the QI researchers,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.040
 reckons that it might be a myth,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.200
 because he couldn't find any evidence,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.080
 contempt-porious news reports mentioned in Bumper Harris.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.320
 Yeah.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.640
 So I think there are news reports from the time,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.160
 but they don't give evidence as to who he was

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.760
 where you could find him.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.520
 They don't have evidence from the transport.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.360
 Because you would think that it would be the kind of thing

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.200
 they would mention.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.200
 They would have recorded.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.800
 Well, yeah, I feel like we disagree on this,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.640
 but maybe I like to believe in room.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.160
 So it was recorded from the early 1920s.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.680
 And there is a guy who says that he's Bumper Harris's

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.320
 great grandson, who's called Aaron, who can give, like,

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.000
 who gives anecdotal evidence about how he apparently retired.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.200
 So he says he eventually retired to make cider violins

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.280
 and become a watercolour artist.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.040
 So with that kind of personal detail, James,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.080
 I don't know how you can thwart this story.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.680
 I would love to know if anyone, like, listening

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.680
 by any chance knows anyone who claims to be related

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.040
 to Bumper Harris, I would love to know if it is true.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.560
 Yeah.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.320
 So get in touch.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.040
 OK, that's it for another episode.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.880
 That's all our facts.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.600
 Thanks so much for listening.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.240
 If you want to get in contact with any of us

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.320
 about what we've said, you can get us on Twitter.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.080
 I'm on @SriberlandJames.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.880
 I am @XshapedAlex.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.680
 I'm @Xpert on this one.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.440
 And Anna's still not on Twitter, but we almost,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.160
 we almost made her buckle last week.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.760
 But in the meantime, you can get her on @Quickipedia.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.880
 Otherwise, you can check out the incredible page

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.440
 that she and Alex put together on the QI website,

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.200
 called qi.com/podcast, in which we're

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.640
 going to have videos of men punching boys on TravelAiders.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.080
 We're going to have all sorts of other pictures and links

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.320
 to the stories that we were talking about.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.560
 So please tune in again next week and tell your friends.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.440
 All right, bye.
