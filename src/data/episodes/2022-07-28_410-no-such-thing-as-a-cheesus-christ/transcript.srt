1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,640
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,300
 This week, coming to you live from Newcastle!

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,880
 (upbeat music)

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,720
 - Hi, it is Dan Schreiber,

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,200
 and I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,040
 Andrew Hunts and Murray, and Jay Tarkin.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,280
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,840
 My fact this week is that Harry Houdini's dog

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,360
 was a professional escape artist.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,240
 (audience laughing)

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,880
 - Did they call him Harry Houdini?

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,680
 - Brilliant, very nice.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,680
 They should have, no, they called him Bobby.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,760
 And Bobby was Harry Houdini's dog,

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,600
 aka the only handcuff king dog in the world,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,880
 and Bobby headlined the 14th Annual Society

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,120
 of American Magicians Dinner.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,480
 This is the annual thing that they had.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
 Harry Houdini was the president at the time,

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,000
 and he taught Bobby to be an escape artist,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
 so he made him little tiny handcuffs

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
 that would go around his wrist.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,120
 - Do you know if you were the second on the belt

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
 of that dog?

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,800
 - Yeah.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,160
 - You've been invited to the Society of American Magicians.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,280
 This is your big chance.

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 - And you have to warm up for a fucking dog.

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,160
 - Yeah, exactly, it's so funny.

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
 - But he could do, I mean, it wasn't just the handcuffs,

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
 he also had a little tiny straight jacket

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,120
 that was made for him that he could escape from.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,360
 - It sounds like an incredible act.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,680
 - Apparently, I mean, according to Houdini,

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,400
 he said he was a dog gone hit from the evening.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
 - Yeah, he wasn't known for his jokes, come on.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,160
 (audience laughing)

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
 Don't give him shit for that.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 - He did that and he didn't go for Houdini.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,840
 (audience laughing)

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
 - Oh, my goodness.

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 - But yeah, so he loved pets generally.

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
 He had a lot of pets.

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
 He had a talking parrot called Laura.

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,880
 He had a pet turtle called Petey.

53
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,040
 He had an American eagle called Abraham Lincoln.

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,880
 And my favorite one is that he had a lot of parrots.

55
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,720
 He had one called Pat Houdini,

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,640
 and he taught this parrot how to pick locks.

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,320
 And Pat, after Houdini died, according to the story,

58
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,960
 Bess, his wife, was living in the house with Pat.

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,200
 Pat picked his own lock, got out of the cage,

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 and flew away, and I was in there for a scene again.

61
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,040
 - Really? I disappeared.

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
 Wasn't it because of Bess

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,960
 that Bobby came to them in the first place?

64
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,600
 She bought Bobby from a butcher.

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
 It was a butcher's pet,

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,280
 and the butcher wouldn't let her give it a bone.

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,160
 And so I guess she thought,

68
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,880
 I really want to give this dog a bone, desperately.

69
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,440
 I'm going to buy it, so I can.

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
 Is that true?

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
 - That's the story.

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
 - It's a slightly confusing story, but yeah.

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,200
 - Magical dogs, just while we're on them,

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,120
 there are so many magical dogs.

75
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,840
 Have you heard of Oscar the Hypno Dog?

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
 - No.

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,560
 - Oscar the Hypno Dog was a recent performing dog.

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
 He played from 1989 to 2001,

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,120
 and then he had to retire for health reasons.

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,240
 Apparently, his owner said he could no longer

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,320
 hold the penetrating stare necessary for stage hypnosis.

82
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,000
 Basically, I think it was a chocolate Labrador,

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,920
 and he had these incredibly melting brown eyes.

84
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,520
 It was beautiful, and the story was that anyone

85
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,000
 who looked at Oscar the Hypno Dog's eyes

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,800
 will fall into a deep trance.

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,480
 And he went missing at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1995,

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
 and they put up posters all over the place saying,

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,080
 "Oscar is missing, be very careful.

90
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,800
 "Do not look into his eyes."

91
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,680
 - That was the Edinburgh Fringe that they put that up?

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
 - He was hard to...

93
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,760
 Oscar performed all over, and his only...

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,560
 - Can you imagine a worse time in the world

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,160
 to put up missing posters than at the Edinburgh Fringe?

96
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,040
 (laughing)

97
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 - Can you take one of these?

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
 - No, thank you, I'm all right, take one of these.

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,400
 - But he was just allowed to wander around the audience, Oscar,

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,120
 and his owner was the hypnotist, obviously.

101
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
 His owner was called Hugh Lennon,

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
 and was a brilliant hypnotist.

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
 But there is an account that Oscar was just free

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
 to walk around the aisles of the theatre

105
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
 in the interval and things like that,

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,680
 and he saw a man eating some crisps,

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,240
 and being a dog, obviously, he wanted some crisps,

108
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
 so he just sat and stared at the man,

109
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,600
 hoping for some crisps,

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,120
 and then the man crumpled over in his chair

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,720
 in a deep, catatonic, hypnotic trance.

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,320
 - Wow, cool.

113
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,520
 - He crumpled like his very crisp packet.

114
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,760
 (laughing)

115
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,400
 Yeah, sort of dogs doing cool tricks

116
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
 goes back such a long way.

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,720
 - It seems like as soon as we decided,

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
 man decided to befriend the dog,

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
 we started making them do weird stuff.

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,640
 It was like the 14th century,

121
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,000
 the Middle East in the 14th century,

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
 in the marketplace, there'd be merchants

123
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,880
 who trained their dogs to put on proper plays and stuff,

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,640
 dramatic performances, and they'd dress them up,

125
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,240
 and they'd act out parts.

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,800
 I read a thing that in the sixth century,

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,280
 so, you know, 1500 years ago,

128
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
 there was a Byzantine chronicler

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,920
 who said there was a showman

130
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,680
 who, his show, was bringing his dog to the marketplace,

131
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,840
 and the dog would collect rings from audience members,

132
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,480
 I guess he handed over your wedding ring or whatever,

133
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,640
 and crossed your fingers,

134
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,360
 and then he'd bury them,

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,520
 and then he'd have the dog dig up all the rings

136
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
 and return them to the correct person.

137
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,600
 - Oh, wow. - Impressive.

138
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,400
 - In 1670, Philip the Duke of Olion in Paris,

139
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
 he possessed a dog who knew how to sort books

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
 alphabetically by offer.

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,080
 - Cool. - Apparently.

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,840
 (all laughing)

143
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,120
 - So what do you think there is to the level of truth

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,600
 that these dogs were, I don't think,

145
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,720
 psychically, but were learning to do with things?

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
 - Okay, well, here's one.

147
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
 Here's a famous one that we do know how they did it.

148
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,800
 So there was a famous dog genius

149
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,240
 in the 1820s called Monito,

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
 and they basically, they could spell,

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
 they could play cards, they could play dominoes,

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,640
 they could do maths.

153
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,760
 Like, with the maths, it would be what's two plus three?

154
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,000
 Is it one, is it two, is it three, is it four,

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
 is it five, and when you said five,

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
 he would go rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, like that.

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
 And the way that we know that he was doing it

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,720
 is his instructor would have, in his pocket,

159
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,800
 a tiny little toothpick, and he would just pring,

160
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,480
 pling the little toothpick, go bling, bling, bling.

161
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
 No one in the audience could hear it,

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
 but the dog could hear it, and as soon as he heard it,

163
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,520
 he knew he would have to bark.

164
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,160
 - That's very clever. - Yeah.

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
 - There is another thing where people think

166
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,120
 that dogs are doing this, and they're actually not,

167
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,960
 but the dogs are picking up on signals

168
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,760
 that the humans don't realise they're giving off.

169
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,040
 So there was a thing, the Hundsplech Schuller Azra,

170
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,000
 which is also known as the Nazi Talking Dog Programme,

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,440
 which John Boddison, you know, friend of the show,

172
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,000
 has written about before, he wrote a book

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,040
 called Amazing Dogs, and they were convinced

174
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,200
 that dogs could be taught to count or talk quite well.

175
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,160
 - And what were the Nazis gonna do with this information?

176
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
 - I don't know, it's such a good question.

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,920
 - Because, like, the British supposedly, you know,

178
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,880
 lovers of dogs, you know, famously,

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,760
 maybe they were gonna turn them against their owners.

180
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,280
 - That's absolutely true, yeah, yeah.

181
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,680
 Well, there were lots of headlines,

182
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,320
 things like "Heel Hitler" or "The Third Reich" and...

183
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,680
 - K-9? - 9?

184
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
 - Yes!

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
 - Anyway, they didn't have a...

186
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,560
 John Boddison clarified that the Nazis did not have a legion

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,240
 of talking machine gun toting hounds, so...

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,520
 - The programmers are bad. - There is famously,

189
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,920
 I can't remember all of this,

190
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,800
 but there's famously a Nazi monument in London.

191
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,160
 I think there's one. - Right.

192
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,400
 - And it was a Nazi dog, and the dog died in London.

193
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
 It was like the German ambassador's dog,

194
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,640
 and they give a proper Nazi funeral,

195
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,240
 and they put a little kind of thing up,

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,920
 and that's the only Nazi memorial in the whole of London.

197
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
 - Wow, really? - I'm still there.

198
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,640
 - It's still there, yeah. - That's a bit weird.

199
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,760
 - Oh, I suppose the dog... - That's what you wanted.

200
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,840
 - Are you proposing, are you proposing we tear it down?

201
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,760
 - Maybe you're proposing we get a few more.

202
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,320
 - I'm just surprised in the big moment of all the statues going down,

203
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,640
 that no one went, "Can we just lob this one in this one?"

204
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,440
 - Yeah. - Fair enough.

205
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,200
 - The dog didn't know what it was doing in its defence.

206
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,120
 Uncessel Rhodes did, is all I'm saying.

207
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
 - Fair enough.

208
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,200
 Do you know the movie Air Bud?

209
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 It's a movie about a dog that becomes a basketball sensation,

210
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,680
 because it can play basketball.

211
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,480
 It's a kid's film. - True story, yeah.

212
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,400
 - Based on, yeah. - Based on, kind of,

213
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,160
 because it turned out that Bud, the dog that was hired for the movie,

214
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,800
 it wasn't CGI, Bud could play basketball.

215
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,360
 This was a stray golden retriever that, in 1989,

216
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,120
 was found roaming the mountains of Yosemite,

217
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,200
 and the person who found him, and I called him Buddy,

218
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,280
 he trained him in a lot of different sports.

219
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,520
 So he trained him how to catch a baseball pitch.

220
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,240
 I don't know how that's possible.

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,640
 He then set up a hockey net,

222
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,800
 and he showed him how to block shots coming into the net.

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
 But then he taught him how to shoot basketball,

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,840
 and he went on the David Letterman show,

225
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,520
 and he displayed it, and how he did it.

226
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,840
 He became quite a national star.

227
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,440
 - I'd like to have seen him do pole vault.

228
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,520
 - Yeah?

229
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,640
 He might have done.

230
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,160
 But there was no CGI use.

231
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,800
 He was playing real basketball.

232
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,960
 He was shooting hoops.

233
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,680
 - And was LeBron James frightened of his career,

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,600
 or how could we tell him that Bob and James were alike?

235
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,120
 - Guys, you're gonna have to get on board.

236
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
 You knew what you were coming to.

237
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,400
 - You bought the tickets.

238
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
 - I've just got one more thing on, sort of,

239
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
 the risk to performing "Docs" now.

240
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,680
 - Yes.

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
 - Because now, people are, you know,

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
 motion capture is really good.

243
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
 So there is a film called "The Call of the Wild,"

244
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,040
 based on a book by Jack London,

245
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,520
 out last year or the year before,

246
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,960
 stars Harrison Ford, and it's about this man

247
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,400
 and his dog best friend.

248
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,240
 And they didn't use a dog for it.

249
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
 They used a guy called Terry,

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,360
 who just wore a motion capture suit.

251
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,760
 Terry Notary is his name,

252
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
 and he just would go around on all fours

253
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,040
 for the whole film, pretending to be a dog,

254
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
 and then they CGI'd the whole thing.

255
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
 - Oh, wow.

256
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,000
 - And there's a scene where they're lying together,

257
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,760
 you know, like, the dog is in Harrison Ford's lap,

258
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
 and it's very moving.

259
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,040
 And it's just a guy called Terry.

260
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,760
 (audience laughing)

261
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,000
 The production photo's unbelievable.

262
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,840
 And Terry, he's a serious motion capture dude.

263
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
 Like, he's an anti-circus-style guy.

264
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,280
 So he said it was about trying to be present for Ford

265
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,880
 and let him forget, really forget that I was a human,

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
 and be a dog and dissolve into it.

267
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,280
 Harrison Ford said, "Terry Notary does a great tennis ball."

268
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,120
 - Wow.

269
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
 (audience laughing)

270
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,120
 - Is there a scene in the movie,

271
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
 and I really hope there is,

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,760
 where the dog takes a poo on the grass, because--

273
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,840
 (audience laughing)

274
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,440
 - And then Harrison Ford has to pick up Terry's poo.

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,480
 (audience laughing)

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
 - You can see in his face that he's not happy in that scene.

277
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
 He's putting the bag around.

278
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,720
 Oh, fuck, Terry!

279
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,680
 (audience laughing)

280
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,480
 - Listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

281
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,160
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

282
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,760
 - My fact this week is that in the First World War,

283
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,520
 MI5 employed 90 girl guides.

284
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,160
 They tried Boy Scouts at first,

285
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,960
 but found they couldn't be trusted.

286
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,960
 (audience laughing)

287
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,680
 - So what did they employ them to do?

288
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,640
 - Well, lots of stuff.

289
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,400
 So this was girl guides, age 14 to 16,

290
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,760
 and it was very shortly after the girl guides

291
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
 had been founded,

292
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,280
 and they were paid tensionings a week.

293
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,800
 They were at nine-hour days,

294
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,760
 and they were asked to sort of carry messages

295
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,280
 between floors, to carry messages across town,

296
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,960
 and they had to swear an oath

297
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,600
 that they would never open the messages

298
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,280
 and read what was inside them.

299
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,800
 And yet they tried it with boys first,

300
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,640
 with the Boy Scouts,

301
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,920
 and they'd found they were too boisterous

302
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,040
 and too mischievous.

303
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,600
 Not what you want in a spy.

304
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,920
 - It's really cool to do newly formed girl guides

305
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,200
 going around the MI5 HQ.

306
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,080
 They were a company, you know,

307
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,760
 'cause you get companies of girl guides.

308
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,000
 They were the special MI5 guide company,

309
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,240
 and they got quite seriously involved with the war,

310
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
 you know, like back-of-house capacity,

311
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
 but they worked in the--

312
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,480
 (audience laughing)

313
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
 - To begin with, but then it was quite sad

314
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
 at the end, wasn't it?

315
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
 - The front lines.

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,160
 - Over the top now.

317
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,040
 Do I get a bunch for this?

318
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,920
 I'm just throwing brownies at the enemy.

319
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,840
 (audience laughing)

320
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,200
 - Yeah, okay, yeah, point taken.

321
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,880
 But they worked in the Postal Censorship Office,

322
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,160
 and that was also where they dislodged Boy Scouts

323
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,520
 from the role that the Boy Scouts had there.

324
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,600
 The poor Boy Scouts, I mean,

325
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,240
 they clearly had really muffed it.

326
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
 But they also, this is the most amazing thing,

327
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
 the girl guides, they acted as messengers

328
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,440
 for the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

329
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,160
 16 of them were invited to witness

330
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
 the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

331
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360
 The leaders of Europe and 16 girl guides were there.

332
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,200
 (audience laughing)

333
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,080
 I just think that's incredible.

334
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 - But yeah, they were, they're very cool,

335
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,240
 and I think they were a little bit goody too choosy,

336
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,640
 shockingly enough, girl guides as they were.

337
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,720
 There was an MI5 employee who said

338
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,800
 they used to sort of be always lurking in corners.

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
 But being useful, but you know, just always there,

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
 you can imagine, what's this 14 year old girl doing

341
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,280
 in my office?

342
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,120
 (audience laughing)

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,520
 - Well, they had to always wear their outfits, didn't they?

344
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 Like, they had to wear their hats,

345
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,120
 and they had to wear their skirt

346
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,920
 was not allowed to be more than eight inches off the ground.

347
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,880
 And so they dressed in that,

348
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,840
 you wouldn't just see a random 14 year old girl,

349
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
 you would know they were.

350
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,720
 - You'd know, you'd know.

351
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,360
 But apparently in their breaks,

352
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,840
 this MI5 employee said the girl guide

353
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
 retires to her attractive little sitting room

354
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
 where she converses on high topics with her friends.

355
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,880
 - Aw, so sweet. - I know, so sweet.

356
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,000
 - They were quite controversial

357
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,640
 when they first came about, girl guides, girl scouts.

358
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,480
 - Were they?

359
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
 - Yeah, they were, so initially it was just thought

360
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,600
 to be a boys thing,

361
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,360
 and Baden Powell had set up the Boy Scouts,

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,440
 and there were a few moments where,

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,920
 particularly in Crystal Palace in London,

364
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,080
 where a bunch of Boy Scouts got together,

365
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,760
 a thousand in order to just do a big display

366
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,720
 and say we're here.

367
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,040
 And completely unsanctioned,

368
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,680
 these girls came along, dressed up in the--

369
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
 - The Boy Scouts costume at the time.

370
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,640
 - The Boy Scouts, sorry, yeah.

371
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,480
 - 'Cause they're one of the girls scouts.

372
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,800
 - And declared themselves to be girl scouts.

373
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,360
 And Baden Powell suddenly was like,

374
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,320
 "Hang on a second, this might be a thing."

375
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
 He just assumed,

376
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,360
 because any time that they were trying to do it,

377
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,640
 the reviews, they got reviews, were bad.

378
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,760
 They were saying, there were complaints saying that,

379
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
 they were mannish girls,

380
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,280
 and girls not being peaceful if they were in a uniform.

381
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,120
 They were worried that it was gonna start

382
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,600
 this whole new, different thing.

383
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,760
 And so they were really against it,

384
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,920
 and the girls said, "No, screw you, we're doing it."

385
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,760
 - Yeah, they were very plucky.

386
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,800
 It was led by a team of, I think, six or seven girls.

387
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,120
 And this was a huge march.

388
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,080
 It was the first Boy Scouts march, 1909.

389
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,040
 The Boy Scouts had just been founded.

390
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,960
 11,000 boys, and apparently 2,000 girls also turned up,

391
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,040
 and led by these six or seven girls who just decided

392
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
 we wanna get involved with this,

393
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,120
 and pretty much went up to Baden Powell.

394
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,840
 He went up to them and said, "We want it."

395
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,880
 And to his credit, Baden Powell was always really pro.

396
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
 He wrote a lot of stuff even before this,

397
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,720
 saying how girls can be just as brave as boys.

398
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,040
 Over and again, they've proved it.

399
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
 It's just not part of their education.

400
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,640
 And within about a week, 6,000 girl guides

401
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,840
 had registered, hadn't they? - Wow.

402
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,880
 - Well, he thought at first,

403
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,440
 he might just let the girls into the Boy Scouts,

404
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,120
 and it would just be the Scouts.

405
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,520
 But then in the end, he decided

406
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
 they would do the girl guides instead.

407
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,040
 One of the reasons that they did that

408
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,520
 is because he was always worried about something

409
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,640
 that he called girlitis.

410
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,920
 And that was whenever his Boy Scouts got to a certain age,

411
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,360
 they started not being very interested in setting fires.

412
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,880
 - Oh, dear. - Yeah.

413
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,240
 - Wow. - It's a legitimate concern.

414
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
 - Yes, sir. - Let's face it.

415
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
 - Wow.

416
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
 Gosh, is it, yeah.

417
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
 So...

418
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
 (audience laughing)

419
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,920
 - I'm used to... (laughing)

420
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,480
 - Okay, I said it, all right.

421
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,960
 Can I, why are you drooling?

422
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
 Stop drooling.

423
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
 - I'm not drooling. - Put that woggle away.

424
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
 (audience laughing)

425
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,920
 - Can I tell you one more thing about Girl Guides' War?

426
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,080
 - Yes, please. - Yeah.

427
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,720
 - First World War specifically, this one.

428
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,480
 They were very helpful in both World Wars, actually,

429
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
 the Girl Guides.

430
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,000
 And one of the things they did,

431
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 along with the Boys Brigade, Scottish organization,

432
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,160
 and the Boy Scouts,

433
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,600
 the Girl Guides did a lot of collecting of sphagnum moss

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,400
 during the First World War. - Oh, Jesus Christ.

435
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,520
 - And it's very interesting.

436
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,880
 It was used for wound dressing,

437
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,360
 as I think we may have mentioned once or twice

438
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
 on this podcast before.

439
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,000
 And they were the ones out there in the peat bogs

440
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
 picking up the moss, collecting it,

441
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
 so it could be used to dress wounds.

442
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,600
 And there was even a poem about it.

443
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,680
 What good news?

444
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,000
 (audience laughing)

445
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,360
 - We don't have time for that, I don't think.

446
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,800
 - We do, we do, and we will.

447
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,200
 Mrs. A.M. Smith of the Edinburgh War Dressing Supply

448
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,520
 organization wrote this very brief poem, all right.

449
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,320
 The doctors of the nurses look north with eager eyes

450
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,400
 and call on us to send them the dressing that they prize.

451
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,800
 No other is its equal.

452
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,520
 In modest bulk it goes until it meets the gaping wound

453
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,640
 where the red lifeblood flows.

454
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,160
 Then spreading, swelling in its might,

455
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,480
 it checks the fatal loss and kills the germ

456
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,080
 and heals the hurt, the kindly sphagnum moss.

457
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,200
 (audience laughing)

458
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,920
 What a poem!

459
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
 What a poem!

460
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,840
 - Oh, dear.

461
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,800
 Pretty good.

462
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,600
 - There was a concern, so it was controversial

463
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,840
 when they were formed and lots of pushback.

464
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,160
 And one of the reasons, other reasons that they were separated

465
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
 is because it was thought that Boy Scouts

466
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,080
 wouldn't like the idea that girls were joining in their games

467
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,120
 and it made them kind of effeminate and silly.

468
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,400
 And someone wrote to Bade and Powell

469
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,720
 very shortly after they were formed saying,

470
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
 they thought it was ridiculous,

471
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
 this idea that you could have girls scouts

472
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
 given that girls aren't even allowed to run,

473
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,200
 hurry, swim, ride a bike,

474
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 or raise their arms above their head.

475
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,160
 (audience laughing)

476
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,080
 It was a very strict parenting that that man was enforcing.

477
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,320
 - Hurry, you're not allowed to hurry?

478
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,520
 - You weren't allowed to hurry as a girl, apparently.

479
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
 - In 1909, yeah?

480
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,720
 Raise your arms, you couldn't put your hand up in class.

481
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,680
 That's why they didn't do as well in education.

482
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,600
 - Couldn't do the YMCA?

483
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,400
 - No, no, couldn't do the MOBOT.

484
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,480
 Although that wouldn't become a problem

485
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,640
 for another 100 years, so it was probably fine.

486
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,480
 - I don't think the YMCA dances much of an issue

487
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,760
 in 1909 either.

488
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,960
 (audience laughing)

489
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,520
 - Well, another dance actually got them into trouble.

490
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
 They always seemed to, like when you read in the news,

491
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,360
 it always seems that girl scouts

492
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,920
 are somehow involved in some weird controversy.

493
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,280
 So 1996, the American Society of Composers,

494
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,480
 authors and publishers, threatened to sue them

495
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,360
 over royalties for songs that members would sing

496
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,920
 during campfires.

497
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,600
 So they said to them, "You're not allowed to sing our songs

498
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
 "unless you're paying a royalty."

499
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,200
 And the idea was, yeah, groups would have to pay $250

500
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,000
 for public performances for the rights to songs

501
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
 that they wanted to sing.

502
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,920
 - But what were they, they must have been singing

503
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,760
 pop songs then, right?

504
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,080
 - Yeah, it was pop songs and so on.

505
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,720
 - God, what, was it the Rolling Stones who were complaining?

506
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,560
 Is it the Paul McCartney who was--

507
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,120
 - It was the publishing companies.

508
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,160
 And so there were cautions.

509
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,440
 There were copyright infringement penalties that they said.

510
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,120
 They said, "We'll charge you 100,000

511
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,840
 "or you will get a year in prison."

512
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
 Like, they were really strict things.

513
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 And it was a dance that stopped all of this nonsense

514
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,120
 happening because footage was shown of them on TV

515
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,000
 dancing the Macarena with no music

516
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
 and there was such a backlash from the public going,

517
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,480
 "Don't make girl scouts dance the Macarena

518
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
 "without the fucking song."

519
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,080
 (audience laughing)

520
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,120
 - At least with a Macarena,

521
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,720
 you never have to put your hands above your head.

522
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,600
 - That's not, that's, exactly.

523
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,440
 - He is only, yeah.

524
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,800
 - Yeah, he is only.

525
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,920
 - One thing that neither boy scouts

526
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
 nor girl guides were allowed to do

527
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
 in official literature was masturbate.

528
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
 They were given official books.

529
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,200
 - What, they're not allowed to do it in literature?

530
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,360
 - Sorry, full stop, in or out of literature.

531
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
 The Girl Guides guidebook said,

532
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 "Don't masturbate, it can lead to blindness,

533
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
 "paralysis and loss of memory."

534
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
 - Sorry, didn't it, it said in the guidebook then.

535
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,560
 - Yeah, really, really.

536
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,520
 - I don't think it said,

537
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,920
 I don't think it said the word masturbate,

538
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,120
 but I think it was clear what the,

539
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,520
 'cause a lot of it was taken from the Boy Scouts guidebook,

540
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,480
 it was pretty much copied directly over.

541
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,120
 - Wow. - And, yeah, I know.

542
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,480
 - I don't recall ever seeing a no masturbation badge

543
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,440
 on a scale.

544
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,280
 (audience laughing)

545
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,120
 - Have you not?

546
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,960
 - No.

547
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,680
 - Well, you're not trying hard enough to earn it then.

548
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
 (audience laughing)

549
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,360
 There was a vice, actually.

550
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,920
 The Girl Guides guidebook is funny, reading it now,

551
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,280
 you know, so here's a great bit of advice

552
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,720
 from it, "It is said that you can tell a man's character

553
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
 "from the way he wears his hat.

554
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,480
 "If it is slightly on one side, the wearer is good-natured.

555
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,760
 "If it is worn very much on one side, he is a swaggerer.

556
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,820
 "If on the back of the head, he is bad at paying his debts.

557
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,560
 (audience laughing)

558
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,560
 "If worn straight on top, he is probably honest,

559
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,960
 "but very dull."

560
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,440
 (audience laughing)

561
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,920
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

562
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,040
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

563
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,760
 My fact is that there is a fictional Victorian detective

564
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,080
 who was created to be the opposite of Sherlock Holmes.

565
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,240
 In the only recent adaptation of the stories,

566
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,120
 the detective in question was played by Benedict Gumberbatch.

567
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,040
 (audience laughing)

568
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,680
 This is the fictional detective Thorpe Hazel,

569
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,720
 and these are the Thorpe Hazel mysteries

570
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,080
 by an author called Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch,

571
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,440
 and basically he is a railway-based detective.

572
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,200
 He only solves crimes that involve the railways,

573
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,040
 and he only solves them

574
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,800
 through the medium of railway timetables.

575
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,360
 (audience laughing)

576
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,200
 He's incredible.

577
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,040
 - That's awesome.

578
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,080
 - He's awesome.

579
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,600
 - He's a vegetarian railway detective.

580
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,440
 - He certainly is.

581
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,200
 - That's very important in the description.

582
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,920
 - Yeah, and I'm very proud to say I have a copy here

583
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,720
 of Stories of the Railway by Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch.

584
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,560
 The Thorpe Hazel mysteries are in here,

585
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,480
 and I just want to read you a brief poem about Moss

586
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,200
 from that book.

587
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,640
 No, it's basically, he's a book collector

588
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,760
 and a railway enthusiast,

589
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,680
 and it's always his knowledge of train timetables

590
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
 that saves the day.

591
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,720
 - So if you want to get away with something,

592
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,680
 just don't commit the crime on the railway.

593
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,120
 Just drag the victim 100 yards from the train track.

594
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,960
 - Well, that's the problem.

595
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,080
 That's where Sherlock Holmes gets you, right?

596
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,920
 If you do something on the railway,

597
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,760
 this guy gets you,

598
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,480
 everywhere else is Sherlock Holmes.

599
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
 - Isn't they divided at the top?

600
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,600
 - Is it like having your own spots of the city,

601
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,880
 you know, with like drug dealers?

602
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,160
 Like this guy's fucked up

603
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,720
 when Poirot has the Orient Express crime going on.

604
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
 (audience laughing)

605
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
 - Yeah, it's really charming.

606
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,240
 - And the author was also a railway nut,

607
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,640
 obviously, Victor Whitechurch,

608
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,200
 and he was a vicar and basically loved railways as well.

609
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,760
 And so there were loads of vicar's

610
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,840
 who were very productive around this time,

611
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,040
 maybe because they had cut down the requirement

612
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,600
 to deliver a two hour sermon on Sundays.

613
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
 Suddenly all these vicar's had time on their hands.

614
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,360
 - Well, the other thing about this guy,

615
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,240
 Victor Whitechurch, is he was a vicar

616
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,560
 in charge of the Mission Church

617
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,800
 at Williston Junction railway station.

618
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
 So he was well into his trains.

619
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,920
 I really like the way that he wrote his stories.

620
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,200
 So like most people would kind of like,

621
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,640
 think of the end of the story and then work backwards.

622
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
 He would get his characters, come up with a murder,

623
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,440
 describe the whole murder,

624
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,840
 and then go right from here,

625
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,680
 I'm gonna work out what happens.

626
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,280
 And he would solve the made up murder in his head

627
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,200
 as he went along.

628
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,240
 - Right, that's really cool, isn't it?

629
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,880
 - You're sort of reading the murder mystery

630
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,080
 as well as writing it.

631
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
 - Yeah, exactly.

632
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
 - Great.

633
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,580
 - Were they big at the time?

634
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,680
 Were they tourist?

635
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,000
 - Yeah, to the level of Conan Doyle's.

636
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,320
 - They were not as big as others.

637
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
 We would have heard more about thought-pays

638
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,000
 in the railway detective.

639
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,720
 The book was originally,

640
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,880
 the book I've got is called Stories of the Railway.

641
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,080
 It was originally called Thrilling Stories of the Railway.

642
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,320
 And at some point, so many of us decided,

643
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,200
 we can't sell these as thrilling stories of the railway.

644
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,740
 So I just don't back it up.

645
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,080
 - It's false advertising.

646
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,280
 I'm sorry. - It's really like.

647
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,840
 - He was, the veggie thing was interesting

648
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,200
 that he made him vegetarian.

649
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,600
 And not only vegetarian, but very fatty.

650
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,280
 So we've talked before a bit about how the turn

651
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 of the 20th century vegetarianism started

652
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
 to be a bit of a thing in one of the stories.

653
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,600
 He asked for directions to a vegetarian restaurant,

654
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,520
 which is like the proper early days of vegetarian restaurants.

655
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
 And then he goes there and he lunches

656
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,440
 on rice pudding and prunes.

657
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
 So they weren't quite up to the standards

658
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080
 that we have today.

659
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,560
 But he was really into this weird physical fads

660
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,400
 that came with it.

661
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 So in one book, White Church writes,

662
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,040
 "He carried vegetarianism to an extreme

663
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,280
 "and was continually practicing various exercises

664
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,480
 "at the strangest description,

665
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,680
 "much to the bewilderment of those around."

666
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,240
 And so I was reading, there's one scene

667
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,920
 where a friend comes upon him and describes

668
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,160
 a sort of crime on the railway to him.

669
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,520
 And as the friend starts talking,

670
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,760
 Thorpe begins some exercises.

671
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,840
 And as, you know, he's been spoken to,

672
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,200
 it's like Hazel Thorpe smiled

673
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,760
 and went on whirling his arms around his head.

674
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,960
 - I've just read that story.

675
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,800
 - Have you?

676
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,280
 - It's the story of Peter Crane's cigars.

677
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,680
 And it's not very thrilling.

678
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,520
 But it is.

679
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,360
 - But it is a story.

680
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,800
 - It is a story on the railway, yeah.

681
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,320
 - And then what happens, Anna?

682
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,840
 - Well, all I know is that he mentions a timetable

683
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
 and suddenly Hazel Thorpe goes,

684
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,000
 "You begin to interest me," said Hazel,

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,320
 "stopping his whirly gigs

686
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,280
 "and beginning to eat his plasmon."

687
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,240
 (laughing)

688
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,040
 - It's nicely written for our language.

689
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,640
 Plasmon was a kind of biscuit.

690
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,400
 - What it is, is there's a cigar smuggling operation.

691
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,720
 - We don't have time for this.

692
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
 (laughing)

693
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,920
 - I really like sort of fictional detectives all this time,

694
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,520
 'cause lots of people were following Arthur Covendoll

695
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
 and trying to come up with like a detective with a gimmick.

696
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,840
 So there was a fictional detective called Max Carrados.

697
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,000
 I don't know if you guys came across.

698
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,840
 - No.

699
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,920
 - So he is blind, but despite that,

700
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,560
 he is so talented that he can read fine print by touch alone.

701
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
 - Wow.

702
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,080
 - He can also fire a pistol at targets accurately

703
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,560
 because his senses are so good.

704
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,200
 In one of the books, he can smell

705
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,160
 when someone is wearing a false mustache.

706
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,720
 (laughing)

707
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,560
 - That's so cool.

708
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,680
 - It's great. - It's really good.

709
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,520
 - It's weird because the person wearing a false mustache

710
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,960
 doesn't need to be doing it in the first place

711
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,280
 if the detective is blind.

712
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,120
 (laughing)

713
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,280
 - That's absolutely true.

714
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,240
 - There were lots of rip-offs of Sherlock Holmes

715
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,080
 at the very start.

716
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,120
 In the first 10 years or so,

717
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,200
 there was a detective called Sherwood Hoax,

718
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,360
 another Shylock Obes,

719
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,840
 Sherlock Shomes,

720
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,400
 Sherlock Gnomes,

721
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
 (laughing)

722
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,800
 Kerlach Combs,

723
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,440
 and Shamrock Jones.

724
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,320
 (laughing)

725
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
 - That's very good. - Nice.

726
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,120
 - I think that's sort of the Detection Club.

727
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
 - No.

728
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,800
 - Oh yeah, so cool.

729
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
 - Oh man.

730
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,000
 - It is a British club for detective writers.

731
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,880
 So Victor Whitechurch of Thor Paisel fame

732
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,240
 was a member himself.

733
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,080
 Lots of people remember us.

734
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,360
 Agatha Christie was the president for many years,

735
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,040
 and it has these sacred rituals that it enacts.

736
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,200
 It's really exciting.

737
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,280
 So a procession will enter

738
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,360
 if you're joining the club for the first time.

739
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,680
 Procession will enter led by a figure

740
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,800
 wearing a scarlet cloak and carrying Eric the Skull, okay?

741
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,760
 And you have to swear an oath to join,

742
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
 and then once you join, the president will says to you,

743
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
 if you fail to remember your promises

744
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,560
 and break even one of our unwritten laws,

745
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,040
 may other writers anticipate your plots,

746
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,640
 may total strangers sue you for libel,

747
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,240
 may your pages swarm with misprints,

748
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,880
 and may your sales continually diminish.

749
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,200
 (laughing)

750
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,440
 - And their rules are, they're strict.

751
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,280
 - They're really strict.

752
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,720
 - The rules written down in the '20s, I think,

753
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,640
 early '30s were your detective shall detect crimes

754
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
 using their wits and not placing reliance

755
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,360
 on divine revelation, feminine intuition,

756
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,000
 a mumbo jumbo, jiggery pokery, coincidence,

757
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,600
 or acts of God.

758
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,120
 And also, you can't conceal clues from the reader.

759
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
 But you know, the Skull that you put your hand on,

760
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,960
 it's not Eric.

761
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,760
 They sexted it recently, and it's Erica.

762
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
 - Oh! - Yeah.

763
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,680
 - Wow. - Yeah.

764
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,400
 Can I, there's a guy called Ronald Knox, who I love.

765
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,880
 He's another, he was another clerical detective author,

766
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,000
 actually, and he wrote these 10 Commandments

767
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
 of Detective Fiction, which are quite fun.

768
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,400
 So one of them is, not more than one secret room

769
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,160
 or passage is allowed per detective story.

770
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,560
 - That's fun. - And also,

771
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,680
 twin brothers and doubles generally must not appear

772
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,160
 unless we have been duly prepared for them.

773
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,400
 - Wow. - Anyway, he did this really cool thing,

774
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,240
 Ronald Knox, as well as being the detective author.

775
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,560
 1926, he interrupted all broadcasts

776
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,720
 on the one radio channel on the BBC,

777
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
 basically to announce that there was a riot in London.

778
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,000
 It was a spoof.

779
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,880
 People didn't realise it was a spoof.

780
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 And it was bloody terrifying.

781
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,600
 So it contained, he said things like,

782
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,560
 "The crowd has now passed along Whitehall

783
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,080
 "and at the suggestion of Mr. Popplebury,

784
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
 "Secretary of the National Movement

785
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,320
 "for Abolishing Theatre Cues,

786
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,360
 "is preparing to demolish the houses of parliament

787
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,440
 "with trench mortars.

788
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,160
 "The clock tower has just fallen to the ground,

789
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,480
 "along with Big Ben.

790
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,160
 "The noise you just heard was the Savoy being blown up."

791
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,680
 (laughing)

792
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,080
 So the awfulest gooch has been intercepted

793
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,160
 by the remnants of the crowd

794
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,440
 and has been roasted alive in Trafalgar Square as I speak.

795
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,360
 And then it was snowing.

796
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,080
 So no one could get the news for days.

797
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,280
 So the BBC just received thousands of letters saying,

798
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,000
 "What's going on? Oh my God."

799
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,840
 - That's so funny. - We're going to have to move on very soon.

800
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
 I just want to quickly mention,

801
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,000
 there's a thing that we wrote about in the Book of the Year,

802
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,680
 which was, do you remember there's that story

803
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,360
 that Benedict Cumberbatch,

804
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,680
 he was in an Uber with his wife

805
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,120
 and suddenly he saw a robbery that was happening

806
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,000
 outside on the road.

807
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,760
 It was a Deliveroo driver

808
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,960
 who was being attacked by some four muggers

809
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,480
 who were trying to get to him.

810
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,160
 So he hopped out and he went,

811
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,120
 "Ah!" and sort of tried to stop it and it worked

812
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,840
 and they got away. - Classic show of move.

813
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,320
 - But so he successfully scared away these muggers

814
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,840
 and helped this Deliveroo person.

815
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,520
 But the thing is that this robbery was happening

816
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,240
 on Marlborough and High Street,

817
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,400
 which is just down the road from Baker Street in London.

818
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,800
 Can you imagine the robbers as they turned around

819
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 to see Sherlock Holmes

820
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,840
 right next to where he should be looking around at them?

821
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,000
 - You feel honoured.

822
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,680
 You'd say, "Thank you."

823
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,640
 - I was just trying to mug a Deliveroo driver.

824
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,680
 I'm not sure this is a Holmes-level crime.

825
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,400
 - I was just thinking that, like, you know,

826
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,280
 this guy was all about his railway time tables.

827
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,440
 Like an Uber driver who would solve crimes

828
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,720
 would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?

829
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 - Yes. - Yeah, that would be really cool.

830
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,840
 But is it based on the star rating that you have?

831
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,360
 - Yeah. - No, how could it be?

832
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,200
 - No. - Yeah.

833
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,480
 - It could be like... - Three stars,

834
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 he drove a bit too fast,

835
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
 but he did solve the murder of my wife.

836
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
 - So...

837
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
 (LAUGHTER)

838
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,880
 - Just as OK, one tiny thing, which...

839
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,600
 P.D. James, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant crime author,

840
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,440
 died only a few years ago.

841
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,000
 She was once doing a signing,

842
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,960
 and an Australian woman came to the front of the queue,

843
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,800
 said her name was Emma Chizit, right?

844
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,880
 P.D. James signed the book to Emma Chizit,

845
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,400
 only to realise this Australian woman

846
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,160
 had been asking how much the book cost.

847
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,560
 (LAUGHTER)

848
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,960
 - Emma Chizit. Emma Chizit. - Emma Chizit.

849
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
 (LAUGHTER)

850
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,240
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

851
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,960
 and that is James.

852
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,880
 OK, my fact this week is that Himalayan chewing gum

853
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
 is made out of cheese.

854
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,160
 - Mmm. - And there it is.

855
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,280
 - Yeah. - It looks like sausages a little bit.

856
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,760
 - Yeah. - Or like ladies' fingers, maybe.

857
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,960
 - Like baguettes.

858
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,000
 - So in what sense is it chewing gum?

859
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,720
 - It's chewing gum in the sense that it's called Himalayan chewing gum,

860
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,800
 and that you chew it a lot.

861
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,560
 It's the world's hardest cheese that we know of.

862
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,360
 It's called chirpy, and because it's so, so hard,

863
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,000
 you put it in your mouth, and if you're like a yak farmer

864
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,280
 or something, you're just having your daily yak farm,

865
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,240
 then you put it in your mouth and you just chew it and chew it and chew it,

866
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,680
 and the saliva slowly makes it softer and softer and softer,

867
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,640
 and it's hours and hours that you chew this stuff,

868
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,960
 and eventually you can eat it,

869
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
 and so that's why they call it chewing gum.

870
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,200
 - It sounds nice, but it does sound unbelievably tough,

871
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,760
 as in there was a BBC journalist who tried it,

872
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,920
 and he chewed his piece for seven minutes.

873
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
 Seven minutes, didn't leave a scratch on it.

874
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,160
 - Yeah, it's really hard. - Wow.

875
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,920
 - I have had it, but I've not had the hard version,

876
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
 I've had the soft version. - Oh, God.

877
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,360
 - Do they ease you in on that?

878
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,040
 - Basically, this stuff, they've kind of dried it out for ages and ages.

879
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,000
 I think they put it in like an animal skin or something,

880
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,240
 and dry it out for ages,

881
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,520
 but if you have it early on before they do all that,

882
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 it's more like cottage cheese, like Georgian cheese,

883
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,760
 and it's the national dish of Bhutan, it's called emadatzi,

884
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,720
 and that's the type that I had,

885
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,320
 and it's basically really, really, really, really hot chilies

886
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,120
 inside a bowl of this cheese, and it is delicious.

887
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,160
 It's one of the best things I've ever had.

888
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,200
 And they don't usually let foreigners eat it,

889
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,520
 because it's too spicy, that's what they say.

890
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,600
 - Oh, yeah, that's how they flutter every foreigner who walks in.

891
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,120
 (LAUGHTER)

892
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,320
 - Well, you know, those British people can't handle this one.

893
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,920
 - How so?

894
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,160
 - Right, it was in Bhutan's Nando's,

895
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,400
 and they put a very nice little flag on the top of it.

896
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,600
 - Did it have a lemon and a herb on it, is what I wanted to know.

897
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,560
 - But chirpy as well is sometimes used these days as a dog treat,

898
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,280
 because it's so chewy.

899
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,360
 I think even in America, I don't know if you can buy it here,

900
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,080
 but in America you can buy this cheesy dog treat

901
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,440
 that they can just keep chewing on. - Right.

902
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,160
 - I read a very spurious sentence about it,

903
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,040
 I thought, in one of the articles, which said,

904
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,360
 "Since it's rich in protein and fat,

905
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,760
 "it makes a great substitute for vegetables."

906
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,800
 (LAUGHTER)

907
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,360
 - I don't know, that's why we're eating our greens.

908
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,000
 - Can I tell you about the Fight Club for Cheese?

909
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,320
 - No, you can't tell us about the Fight Club for Cheese.

910
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,360
 - OK. - That's the whole point.

911
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
 - Oh, yeah, oh, shit.

912
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
 (LAUGHTER)

913
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,520
 - Damn it.

914
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,400
 (APPLAUSE)

915
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,240
 - Yeah, it's the Cheese Munger International,

916
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
 which happens in the USA, and it's...

917
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,000
 This was a description of the FT.

918
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,120
 "It involves 50 young cheese mungers

919
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,800
 "pitting their skills against each other

920
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,400
 "in a frenetic battle of curd-nerdery."

921
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
 (LAUGHTER)

922
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,520
 - That's just so cool. - It does sound fun, yeah.

923
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,600
 The charismatic founder, Adam Moskovitz,

924
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,640
 is called Mr. Moo and compares in a cow onesie.

925
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,240
 - Wow. - OK, a bit less cool now, it's cool.

926
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,960
 (LAUGHTER)

927
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,240
 - I wonder who's called him the charismatic founder.

928
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,680
 Sounds like something on his own website.

929
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,760
 Him and his onesie at the top.

930
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,920
 - You know, Baratta, the more delicious version of mozzarella?

931
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,320
 - Um, yep. - I didn't really know what that was,

932
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,920
 but it's... So it came about as a way of using up leftovers,

933
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,440
 and the way they did it, this was in the 1930s,

934
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,440
 it's in Apulia, it's the only place you can make it.

935
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,920
 Cream would be scraped off the top of milk,

936
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,720
 and it was usually chucked away,

937
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,440
 and instead they mixed it with stretched mozzarella curds

938
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,200
 to make that really creamy soupy inside,

939
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,400
 and then they blew mozzarella into a bubble,

940
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,440
 so they got mozzarella, and they blew like a bubblegum bubble,

941
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,680
 and then they stuffed this cream inside,

942
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,360
 and this was just to preserve it,

943
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,560
 so this meant that when you had like a day's journey to get to market,

944
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,560
 then this apparently insulated it from the heat of the sun,

945
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,120
 and meant that the cream and cheese didn't go off inside,

946
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,800
 so when you prod that open, but I just love that they blew into it,

947
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,480
 like a little, you know... - Yeah, that's incredible, yeah.

948
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,920
 - Bubble. - Like a bubble.

949
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,160
 - Don't make me that clear. - Liquid soupy stuff from cheese.

950
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,240
 This is an interesting new innovation that's happening around the world,

951
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,760
 and I wonder if it's going to take off in Wisconsin.

952
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,840
 They've been doing this, so they make a lot of cheese there,

953
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,320
 and they have a lot of master cheese makers there as well.

954
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
 So as a result of having a lot of cheese,

955
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,640
 they have a lot of excess brine that they need to get rid of,

956
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,960
 and what they do is they liquefy it,

957
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,920
 and they pour it on the side of the roads during winter in place of salt,

958
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,120
 and it works way better than salt does.

959
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,560
 It's great for them, because they're getting rid of a lot of waste,

960
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,120
 and they're using it really efficiently.

961
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
 - Does it not make the entire state smell of cheese?

962
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,040
 - It stinks like shit, yeah.

963
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,840
 - I think a lot of Wisconsin smells of cheese already to give that.

964
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,400
 - I could... OK.

965
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,840
 - But what's really interesting is, A, it's just a great way

966
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,520
 of just recycling the materials in a good way,

967
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,200
 but also, this typical salt they would use on roads,

968
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,680
 that would freeze at six below zero,

969
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,200
 whereas cheese doesn't freeze until 21 below zero,

970
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,680
 so it's actually even just useful in the sense that the colder it gets,

971
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,960
 it's still useful.

972
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,720
 - But that's why you never get cheese ice cream, tragically.

973
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,960
 - Oh, really? - No.

974
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,880
 (LAUGHTER)

975
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,960
 So, there was a big story, a big story in Germany last year,

976
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,800
 and that was that someone was living above a cheese shop,

977
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,480
 and she was very, very upset because her house smelled of cheese all the time.

978
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,160
 She said the smell of cheese was coming through her electrical sockets,

979
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,040
 and it went to court because she said that they should just stop selling cheese all the time.

980
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,480
 Basically, she was, like, putting signs up saying, "This place stinks of cheese."

981
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,680
 I was in a cheese-fucking-cheese shop, but she was putting that.

982
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,200
 He said that she had been hiding cheese behind a fuse box to frame him.

983
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,160
 (LAUGHTER)

984
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,960
 Anyway, so they found in favour of the cheese seller,

985
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,200
 but he's decided, "OK, I want to be a good neighbour,

986
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,840
 "so I'm going to move away anyway."

987
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,600
 But because of this story, no one will let him move into that shop anymore,

988
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,760
 and he's stuck in the place and she's stuck living above him.

989
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,440
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Isn't that bad?

990
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,280
 Will you re-home, Mr Stinky Cheese seller?

991
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,440
 (LAUGHTER)

992
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,600
 We've got to wrap up in a sec, guys.

993
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,400
 Anything before we do?

994
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,720
 St Hildegard of Bingen, who was friend of the podcast.

995
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,000
 Yeah, yes. Mystic from the 12th century.

996
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,240
 She always thought that all cheese should be dried,

997
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,920
 and she really liked her cheese,

998
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,880
 but she also thought that cheese was...

999
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,520
 Like cheese-making was how children was made.

1000
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,280
 So she wrote that, "At first, the semen inside the woman is milky,

1001
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,640
 "then it coagulates, then it becomes flesh,

1002
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
 "and then it becomes the body."

1003
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,840
 So it's cheese just halfway to becoming a human.

1004
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,600
 Is that what she's saying?

1005
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,800
 I guess it's what she's saying. It's terrifying.

1006
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
 Wow, she was a wise woman,

1007
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,560
 but she did get some things wrong, didn't she, Hildegard?

1008
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,720
 Her restaurant was a disaster.

1009
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,640
 But there was a guy called Tertuion,

1010
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,920
 who was a father from the 2nd and 3rd century.

1011
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
 He was like a priest,

1012
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,840
 and he thought that the birth of Jesus was a bit like this.

1013
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,440
 So Jesus had been born in a kind of cheesy way.

1014
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,160
 So, like, away, yeah.

1015
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,200
 So, like, the curds...

1016
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,480
 Away, away in a manger.

1017
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,560
 Away in a manger.

1018
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,840
 So the curds liked cheese.

1019
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,680
 (LAUGHTER)

1020
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,040
 The curds liked cheese.

1021
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,880
 Jesus had grown, Jesus had grown into his shape.

1022
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,600
 And then he kind of got kicked out of the church

1023
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,120
 because of this crazy stuff that he grew up with.

1024
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,600
 Well, he went to another sect called the Montanists,

1025
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,280
 and he kind of became really big in the Montanists,

1026
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,880
 and they decided that as well as bread and wine

1027
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,080
 and Holy Communion,

1028
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,440
 you could also have a little bit of cheese with your wafer.

1029
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,360
 (LAUGHTER)

1030
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,200
 Look, we need to wrap up, I'm afraid.

1031
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,920
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1032
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,640
