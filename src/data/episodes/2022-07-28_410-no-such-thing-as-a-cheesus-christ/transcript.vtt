00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.640
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.300
 This week, coming to you live from Newcastle!

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 (audience cheering)

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.880
 (upbeat music)

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.720
 - Hi, it is Dan Schreiber,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200
 and I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.040
 Andrew Hunts and Murray, and Jay Tarkin.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.280
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.840
 My fact this week is that Harry Houdini's dog

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.360
 was a professional escape artist.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240
 (audience laughing)

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.880
 - Did they call him Harry Houdini?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.680
 - Brilliant, very nice.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 They should have, no, they called him Bobby.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.760
 And Bobby was Harry Houdini's dog,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 aka the only handcuff king dog in the world,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.880
 and Bobby headlined the 14th Annual Society

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.120
 of American Magicians Dinner.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.480
 This is the annual thing that they had.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 Harry Houdini was the president at the time,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.000
 and he taught Bobby to be an escape artist,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.200
 so he made him little tiny handcuffs

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
 that would go around his wrist.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.120
 - Do you know if you were the second on the belt

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.960
 of that dog?

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.800
 - Yeah.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.160
 - You've been invited to the Society of American Magicians.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.280
 This is your big chance.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 - And you have to warm up for a fucking dog.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 - Yeah, exactly, it's so funny.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 - But he could do, I mean, it wasn't just the handcuffs,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 he also had a little tiny straight jacket

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.120
 that was made for him that he could escape from.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.360
 - It sounds like an incredible act.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.680
 - Apparently, I mean, according to Houdini,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.400
 he said he was a dog gone hit from the evening.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.000
 - Yeah, he wasn't known for his jokes, come on.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.160
 (audience laughing)

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.000
 Don't give him shit for that.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 - He did that and he didn't go for Houdini.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.840
 (audience laughing)

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.400
 - Oh, my goodness.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 - But yeah, so he loved pets generally.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.360
 He had a lot of pets.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.280
 He had a talking parrot called Laura.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880
 He had a pet turtle called Petey.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.040
 He had an American eagle called Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.880
 And my favorite one is that he had a lot of parrots.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.720
 He had one called Pat Houdini,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.640
 and he taught this parrot how to pick locks.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.320
 And Pat, after Houdini died, according to the story,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.960
 Bess, his wife, was living in the house with Pat.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.200
 Pat picked his own lock, got out of the cage,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 and flew away, and I was in there for a scene again.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.040
 - Really? I disappeared.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.320
 Wasn't it because of Bess

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.960
 that Bobby came to them in the first place?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.600
 She bought Bobby from a butcher.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.000
 It was a butcher's pet,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.280
 and the butcher wouldn't let her give it a bone.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160
 And so I guess she thought,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 I really want to give this dog a bone, desperately.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.440
 I'm going to buy it, so I can.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.280
 Is that true?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 - That's the story.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 - It's a slightly confusing story, but yeah.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.200
 - Magical dogs, just while we're on them,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.120
 there are so many magical dogs.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.840
 Have you heard of Oscar the Hypno Dog?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.680
 - No.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.560
 - Oscar the Hypno Dog was a recent performing dog.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.200
 He played from 1989 to 2001,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.120
 and then he had to retire for health reasons.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.240
 Apparently, his owner said he could no longer

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.320
 hold the penetrating stare necessary for stage hypnosis.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.000
 Basically, I think it was a chocolate Labrador,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.920
 and he had these incredibly melting brown eyes.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.520
 It was beautiful, and the story was that anyone

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.000
 who looked at Oscar the Hypno Dog's eyes

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.800
 will fall into a deep trance.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.480
 And he went missing at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1995,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.720
 and they put up posters all over the place saying,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.080
 "Oscar is missing, be very careful.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.800
 "Do not look into his eyes."

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.680
 - That was the Edinburgh Fringe that they put that up?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.520
 - He was hard to...

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.760
 Oscar performed all over, and his only...

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.560
 - Can you imagine a worse time in the world

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.160
 to put up missing posters than at the Edinburgh Fringe?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.040
 (laughing)

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 - Can you take one of these?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.120
 - No, thank you, I'm all right, take one of these.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.400
 - But he was just allowed to wander around the audience, Oscar,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.120
 and his owner was the hypnotist, obviously.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.200
 His owner was called Hugh Lennon,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.400
 and was a brilliant hypnotist.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.840
 But there is an account that Oscar was just free

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.520
 to walk around the aisles of the theatre

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.040
 in the interval and things like that,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.680
 and he saw a man eating some crisps,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.240
 and being a dog, obviously, he wanted some crisps,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.520
 so he just sat and stared at the man,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.600
 hoping for some crisps,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.120
 and then the man crumpled over in his chair

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.720
 in a deep, catatonic, hypnotic trance.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.320
 - Wow, cool.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.520
 - He crumpled like his very crisp packet.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.760
 (laughing)

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.400
 Yeah, sort of dogs doing cool tricks

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.000
 goes back such a long way.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.720
 - It seems like as soon as we decided,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.320
 man decided to befriend the dog,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.280
 we started making them do weird stuff.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.640
 It was like the 14th century,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.000
 the Middle East in the 14th century,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.480
 in the marketplace, there'd be merchants

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.880
 who trained their dogs to put on proper plays and stuff,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.640
 dramatic performances, and they'd dress them up,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.240
 and they'd act out parts.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.800
 I read a thing that in the sixth century,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.280
 so, you know, 1500 years ago,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.080
 there was a Byzantine chronicler

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.920
 who said there was a showman

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.680
 who, his show, was bringing his dog to the marketplace,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.840
 and the dog would collect rings from audience members,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.480
 I guess he handed over your wedding ring or whatever,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.640
 and crossed your fingers,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.360
 and then he'd bury them,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.520
 and then he'd have the dog dig up all the rings

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.280
 and return them to the correct person.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.600
 - Oh, wow. - Impressive.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.400
 - In 1670, Philip the Duke of Olion in Paris,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.800
 he possessed a dog who knew how to sort books

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560
 alphabetically by offer.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.080
 - Cool. - Apparently.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.840
 (all laughing)

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.120
 - So what do you think there is to the level of truth

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.600
 that these dogs were, I don't think,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.720
 psychically, but were learning to do with things?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.560
 - Okay, well, here's one.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.440
 Here's a famous one that we do know how they did it.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.800
 So there was a famous dog genius

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.240
 in the 1820s called Monito,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.800
 and they basically, they could spell,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.280
 they could play cards, they could play dominoes,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.640
 they could do maths.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.760
 Like, with the maths, it would be what's two plus three?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.000
 Is it one, is it two, is it three, is it four,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.360
 is it five, and when you said five,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.440
 he would go rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, like that.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.360
 And the way that we know that he was doing it

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.720
 is his instructor would have, in his pocket,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.800
 a tiny little toothpick, and he would just pring,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.480
 pling the little toothpick, go bling, bling, bling.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.800
 No one in the audience could hear it,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.120
 but the dog could hear it, and as soon as he heard it,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.520
 he knew he would have to bark.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.160
 - That's very clever. - Yeah.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.840
 - There is another thing where people think

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.120
 that dogs are doing this, and they're actually not,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.960
 but the dogs are picking up on signals

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.760
 that the humans don't realise they're giving off.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.040
 So there was a thing, the Hundsplech Schuller Azra,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.000
 which is also known as the Nazi Talking Dog Programme,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.440
 which John Boddison, you know, friend of the show,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.000
 has written about before, he wrote a book

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.040
 called Amazing Dogs, and they were convinced

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.200
 that dogs could be taught to count or talk quite well.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.160
 - And what were the Nazis gonna do with this information?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.800
 - I don't know, it's such a good question.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.920
 - Because, like, the British supposedly, you know,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.880
 lovers of dogs, you know, famously,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.760
 maybe they were gonna turn them against their owners.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.280
 - That's absolutely true, yeah, yeah.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.680
 Well, there were lots of headlines,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.320
 things like "Heel Hitler" or "The Third Reich" and...

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.680
 - K-9? - 9?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.000
 - Yes!

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.200
 - Anyway, they didn't have a...

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.560
 John Boddison clarified that the Nazis did not have a legion

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.240
 of talking machine gun toting hounds, so...

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.520
 - The programmers are bad. - There is famously,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.920
 I can't remember all of this,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.800
 but there's famously a Nazi monument in London.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.160
 I think there's one. - Right.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.400
 - And it was a Nazi dog, and the dog died in London.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.400
 It was like the German ambassador's dog,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.640
 and they give a proper Nazi funeral,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.240
 and they put a little kind of thing up,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.920
 and that's the only Nazi memorial in the whole of London.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.480
 - Wow, really? - I'm still there.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.640
 - It's still there, yeah. - That's a bit weird.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.760
 - Oh, I suppose the dog... - That's what you wanted.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.840
 - Are you proposing, are you proposing we tear it down?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.760
 - Maybe you're proposing we get a few more.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.320
 - I'm just surprised in the big moment of all the statues going down,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.640
 that no one went, "Can we just lob this one in this one?"

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.440
 - Yeah. - Fair enough.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.200
 - The dog didn't know what it was doing in its defence.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.120
 Uncessel Rhodes did, is all I'm saying.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.160
 - Fair enough.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.200
 Do you know the movie Air Bud?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 It's a movie about a dog that becomes a basketball sensation,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.680
 because it can play basketball.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.480
 It's a kid's film. - True story, yeah.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.400
 - Based on, yeah. - Based on, kind of,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.160
 because it turned out that Bud, the dog that was hired for the movie,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.800
 it wasn't CGI, Bud could play basketball.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.360
 This was a stray golden retriever that, in 1989,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.120
 was found roaming the mountains of Yosemite,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.200
 and the person who found him, and I called him Buddy,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.280
 he trained him in a lot of different sports.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.520
 So he trained him how to catch a baseball pitch.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.240
 I don't know how that's possible.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.640
 He then set up a hockey net,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.800
 and he showed him how to block shots coming into the net.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.120
 But then he taught him how to shoot basketball,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.840
 and he went on the David Letterman show,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.520
 and he displayed it, and how he did it.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.840
 He became quite a national star.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.440
 - I'd like to have seen him do pole vault.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.520
 - Yeah?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.640
 He might have done.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.160
 But there was no CGI use.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.800
 He was playing real basketball.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.960
 He was shooting hoops.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.680
 - And was LeBron James frightened of his career,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.600
 or how could we tell him that Bob and James were alike?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.120
 - Guys, you're gonna have to get on board.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.800
 You knew what you were coming to.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.400
 - You bought the tickets.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.200
 - I've just got one more thing on, sort of,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.840
 the risk to performing "Docs" now.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.680
 - Yes.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.160
 - Because now, people are, you know,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.440
 motion capture is really good.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.680
 So there is a film called "The Call of the Wild,"

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.040
 based on a book by Jack London,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.520
 out last year or the year before,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.960
 stars Harrison Ford, and it's about this man

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.400
 and his dog best friend.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.240
 And they didn't use a dog for it.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.000
 They used a guy called Terry,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.360
 who just wore a motion capture suit.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.760
 Terry Notary is his name,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.320
 and he just would go around on all fours

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.040
 for the whole film, pretending to be a dog,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.240
 and then they CGI'd the whole thing.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.000
 - And there's a scene where they're lying together,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.760
 you know, like, the dog is in Harrison Ford's lap,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.320
 and it's very moving.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.040
 And it's just a guy called Terry.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.760
 (audience laughing)

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.000
 The production photo's unbelievable.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.840
 And Terry, he's a serious motion capture dude.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.840
 Like, he's an anti-circus-style guy.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.280
 So he said it was about trying to be present for Ford

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.880
 and let him forget, really forget that I was a human,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.800
 and be a dog and dissolve into it.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.280
 Harrison Ford said, "Terry Notary does a great tennis ball."

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.120
 - Wow.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.960
 (audience laughing)

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.120
 - Is there a scene in the movie,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.320
 and I really hope there is,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.760
 where the dog takes a poo on the grass, because--

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.840
 (audience laughing)

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.440
 - And then Harrison Ford has to pick up Terry's poo.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.480
 (audience laughing)

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.680
 - You can see in his face that he's not happy in that scene.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.440
 He's putting the bag around.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.720
 Oh, fuck, Terry!

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.680
 (audience laughing)

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.480
 - Listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.160
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.760
 - My fact this week is that in the First World War,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.520
 MI5 employed 90 girl guides.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.160
 They tried Boy Scouts at first,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.960
 but found they couldn't be trusted.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.960
 (audience laughing)

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.680
 - So what did they employ them to do?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.640
 - Well, lots of stuff.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.400
 So this was girl guides, age 14 to 16,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.760
 and it was very shortly after the girl guides

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.960
 had been founded,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.280
 and they were paid tensionings a week.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.800
 They were at nine-hour days,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.760
 and they were asked to sort of carry messages

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.280
 between floors, to carry messages across town,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.960
 and they had to swear an oath

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.600
 that they would never open the messages

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.280
 and read what was inside them.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.800
 And yet they tried it with boys first,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.640
 with the Boy Scouts,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.920
 and they'd found they were too boisterous

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.040
 and too mischievous.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.600
 Not what you want in a spy.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.920
 - It's really cool to do newly formed girl guides

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.200
 going around the MI5 HQ.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.080
 They were a company, you know,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.760
 'cause you get companies of girl guides.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.000
 They were the special MI5 guide company,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.240
 and they got quite seriously involved with the war,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.480
 you know, like back-of-house capacity,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.640
 but they worked in the--

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.480
 (audience laughing)

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.280
 - To begin with, but then it was quite sad

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.320
 at the end, wasn't it?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.000
 - The front lines.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.160
 - Over the top now.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.040
 Do I get a bunch for this?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.920
 I'm just throwing brownies at the enemy.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.840
 (audience laughing)

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.200
 - Yeah, okay, yeah, point taken.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.880
 But they worked in the Postal Censorship Office,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.160
 and that was also where they dislodged Boy Scouts

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.520
 from the role that the Boy Scouts had there.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.600
 The poor Boy Scouts, I mean,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.240
 they clearly had really muffed it.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.000
 But they also, this is the most amazing thing,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.640
 the girl guides, they acted as messengers

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.440
 for the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.160
 16 of them were invited to witness

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.240
 the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.360
 The leaders of Europe and 16 girl guides were there.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.200
 (audience laughing)

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.080
 I just think that's incredible.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080
 - But yeah, they were, they're very cool,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.240
 and I think they were a little bit goody too choosy,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640
 shockingly enough, girl guides as they were.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.720
 There was an MI5 employee who said

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.800
 they used to sort of be always lurking in corners.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.200
 But being useful, but you know, just always there,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.360
 you can imagine, what's this 14 year old girl doing

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.280
 in my office?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.120
 (audience laughing)

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.520
 - Well, they had to always wear their outfits, didn't they?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.520
 Like, they had to wear their hats,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.120
 and they had to wear their skirt

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.920
 was not allowed to be more than eight inches off the ground.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.880
 And so they dressed in that,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.840
 you wouldn't just see a random 14 year old girl,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.680
 you would know they were.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.720
 - You'd know, you'd know.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.360
 But apparently in their breaks,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.840
 this MI5 employee said the girl guide

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.720
 retires to her attractive little sitting room

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.920
 where she converses on high topics with her friends.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.880
 - Aw, so sweet. - I know, so sweet.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.000
 - They were quite controversial

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.640
 when they first came about, girl guides, girl scouts.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.480
 - Were they?

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.080
 - Yeah, they were, so initially it was just thought

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.600
 to be a boys thing,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.360
 and Baden Powell had set up the Boy Scouts,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.440
 and there were a few moments where,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.920
 particularly in Crystal Palace in London,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.080
 where a bunch of Boy Scouts got together,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.760
 a thousand in order to just do a big display

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.720
 and say we're here.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.040
 And completely unsanctioned,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.680
 these girls came along, dressed up in the--

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.800
 - The Boy Scouts costume at the time.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.640
 - The Boy Scouts, sorry, yeah.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.480
 - 'Cause they're one of the girls scouts.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.800
 - And declared themselves to be girl scouts.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.360
 And Baden Powell suddenly was like,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.320
 "Hang on a second, this might be a thing."

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.480
 He just assumed,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.360
 because any time that they were trying to do it,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.640
 the reviews, they got reviews, were bad.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.760
 They were saying, there were complaints saying that,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.880
 they were mannish girls,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.280
 and girls not being peaceful if they were in a uniform.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.120
 They were worried that it was gonna start

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.600
 this whole new, different thing.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.760
 And so they were really against it,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.920
 and the girls said, "No, screw you, we're doing it."

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.760
 - Yeah, they were very plucky.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.800
 It was led by a team of, I think, six or seven girls.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.120
 And this was a huge march.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.080
 It was the first Boy Scouts march, 1909.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.040
 The Boy Scouts had just been founded.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.960
 11,000 boys, and apparently 2,000 girls also turned up,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.040
 and led by these six or seven girls who just decided

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.440
 we wanna get involved with this,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.120
 and pretty much went up to Baden Powell.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.840
 He went up to them and said, "We want it."

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.880
 And to his credit, Baden Powell was always really pro.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.800
 He wrote a lot of stuff even before this,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.720
 saying how girls can be just as brave as boys.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.040
 Over and again, they've proved it.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.040
 It's just not part of their education.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.640
 And within about a week, 6,000 girl guides

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.840
 had registered, hadn't they? - Wow.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.880
 - Well, he thought at first,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.440
 he might just let the girls into the Boy Scouts,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.120
 and it would just be the Scouts.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.520
 But then in the end, he decided

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.520
 they would do the girl guides instead.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.040
 One of the reasons that they did that

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.520
 is because he was always worried about something

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.640
 that he called girlitis.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.920
 And that was whenever his Boy Scouts got to a certain age,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.360
 they started not being very interested in setting fires.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.880
 - Oh, dear. - Yeah.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.240
 - Wow. - It's a legitimate concern.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.760
 - Yes, sir. - Let's face it.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.360
 - Wow.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.360
 Gosh, is it, yeah.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.360
 So...

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.680
 (audience laughing)

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.920
 - I'm used to... (laughing)

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.480
 - Okay, I said it, all right.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.960
 Can I, why are you drooling?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.800
 Stop drooling.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.720
 - I'm not drooling. - Put that woggle away.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.120
 (audience laughing)

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.920
 - Can I tell you one more thing about Girl Guides' War?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.080
 - Yes, please. - Yeah.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.720
 - First World War specifically, this one.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.480
 They were very helpful in both World Wars, actually,

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.320
 the Girl Guides.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.000
 And one of the things they did,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 along with the Boys Brigade, Scottish organization,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.160
 and the Boy Scouts,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.600
 the Girl Guides did a lot of collecting of sphagnum moss

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.400
 during the First World War. - Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.520
 - And it's very interesting.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.880
 It was used for wound dressing,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.360
 as I think we may have mentioned once or twice

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.720
 on this podcast before.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.000
 And they were the ones out there in the peat bogs

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.360
 picking up the moss, collecting it,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.880
 so it could be used to dress wounds.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.600
 And there was even a poem about it.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.680
 What good news?

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.000
 (audience laughing)

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.360
 - We don't have time for that, I don't think.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.800
 - We do, we do, and we will.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.200
 Mrs. A.M. Smith of the Edinburgh War Dressing Supply

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.520
 organization wrote this very brief poem, all right.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.320
 The doctors of the nurses look north with eager eyes

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.400
 and call on us to send them the dressing that they prize.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.800
 No other is its equal.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.520
 In modest bulk it goes until it meets the gaping wound

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.640
 where the red lifeblood flows.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.160
 Then spreading, swelling in its might,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.480
 it checks the fatal loss and kills the germ

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.080
 and heals the hurt, the kindly sphagnum moss.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.200
 (audience laughing)

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.920
 What a poem!

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.760
 What a poem!

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.840
 - Oh, dear.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.800
 Pretty good.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.600
 - There was a concern, so it was controversial

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.840
 when they were formed and lots of pushback.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.160
 And one of the reasons, other reasons that they were separated

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.920
 is because it was thought that Boy Scouts

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.080
 wouldn't like the idea that girls were joining in their games

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.120
 and it made them kind of effeminate and silly.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.400
 And someone wrote to Bade and Powell

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.720
 very shortly after they were formed saying,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.920
 they thought it was ridiculous,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.920
 this idea that you could have girls scouts

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.920
 given that girls aren't even allowed to run,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.200
 hurry, swim, ride a bike,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 or raise their arms above their head.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.160
 (audience laughing)

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.080
 It was a very strict parenting that that man was enforcing.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.320
 - Hurry, you're not allowed to hurry?

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.520
 - You weren't allowed to hurry as a girl, apparently.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.520
 - In 1909, yeah?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.720
 Raise your arms, you couldn't put your hand up in class.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.680
 That's why they didn't do as well in education.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.600
 - Couldn't do the YMCA?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.400
 - No, no, couldn't do the MOBOT.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.480
 Although that wouldn't become a problem

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.640
 for another 100 years, so it was probably fine.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.480
 - I don't think the YMCA dances much of an issue

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.760
 in 1909 either.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.960
 (audience laughing)

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.520
 - Well, another dance actually got them into trouble.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.040
 They always seemed to, like when you read in the news,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.360
 it always seems that girl scouts

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.920
 are somehow involved in some weird controversy.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.280
 So 1996, the American Society of Composers,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.480
 authors and publishers, threatened to sue them

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.360
 over royalties for songs that members would sing

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.920
 during campfires.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.600
 So they said to them, "You're not allowed to sing our songs

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.400
 "unless you're paying a royalty."

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.200
 And the idea was, yeah, groups would have to pay $250

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.000
 for public performances for the rights to songs

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.840
 that they wanted to sing.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.920
 - But what were they, they must have been singing

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.760
 pop songs then, right?

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.080
 - Yeah, it was pop songs and so on.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.720
 - God, what, was it the Rolling Stones who were complaining?

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.560
 Is it the Paul McCartney who was--

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.120
 - It was the publishing companies.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.160
 And so there were cautions.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.440
 There were copyright infringement penalties that they said.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.120
 They said, "We'll charge you 100,000

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.840
 "or you will get a year in prison."

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.800
 Like, they were really strict things.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 And it was a dance that stopped all of this nonsense

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.120
 happening because footage was shown of them on TV

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.000
 dancing the Macarena with no music

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.880
 and there was such a backlash from the public going,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.480
 "Don't make girl scouts dance the Macarena

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.840
 "without the fucking song."

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.080
 (audience laughing)

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.120
 - At least with a Macarena,

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.720
 you never have to put your hands above your head.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.600
 - That's not, that's, exactly.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.440
 - He is only, yeah.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.800
 - Yeah, he is only.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.920
 - One thing that neither boy scouts

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.280
 nor girl guides were allowed to do

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.520
 in official literature was masturbate.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.880
 They were given official books.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.200
 - What, they're not allowed to do it in literature?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.360
 - Sorry, full stop, in or out of literature.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.760
 The Girl Guides guidebook said,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.760
 "Don't masturbate, it can lead to blindness,

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.400
 "paralysis and loss of memory."

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.000
 - Sorry, didn't it, it said in the guidebook then.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.560
 - Yeah, really, really.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.520
 - I don't think it said,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.920
 I don't think it said the word masturbate,

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.120
 but I think it was clear what the,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.520
 'cause a lot of it was taken from the Boy Scouts guidebook,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.480
 it was pretty much copied directly over.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.120
 - Wow. - And, yeah, I know.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.480
 - I don't recall ever seeing a no masturbation badge

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.440
 on a scale.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.280
 (audience laughing)

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.120
 - Have you not?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.960
 - No.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.680
 - Well, you're not trying hard enough to earn it then.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.680
 (audience laughing)

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.360
 There was a vice, actually.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.920
 The Girl Guides guidebook is funny, reading it now,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.280
 you know, so here's a great bit of advice

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.720
 from it, "It is said that you can tell a man's character

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.480
 "from the way he wears his hat.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.480
 "If it is slightly on one side, the wearer is good-natured.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.760
 "If it is worn very much on one side, he is a swaggerer.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.820
 "If on the back of the head, he is bad at paying his debts.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.560
 (audience laughing)

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.560
 "If worn straight on top, he is probably honest,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.960
 "but very dull."

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.440
 (audience laughing)

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.920
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.040
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.760
 My fact is that there is a fictional Victorian detective

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.080
 who was created to be the opposite of Sherlock Holmes.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.240
 In the only recent adaptation of the stories,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.120
 the detective in question was played by Benedict Gumberbatch.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.040
 (audience laughing)

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.680
 This is the fictional detective Thorpe Hazel,

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.720
 and these are the Thorpe Hazel mysteries

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.080
 by an author called Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.440
 and basically he is a railway-based detective.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.200
 He only solves crimes that involve the railways,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.040
 and he only solves them

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.800
 through the medium of railway timetables.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.360
 (audience laughing)

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.200
 He's incredible.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.040
 - That's awesome.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.080
 - He's awesome.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.600
 - He's a vegetarian railway detective.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.440
 - He certainly is.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.200
 - That's very important in the description.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.920
 - Yeah, and I'm very proud to say I have a copy here

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.720
 of Stories of the Railway by Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.560
 The Thorpe Hazel mysteries are in here,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.480
 and I just want to read you a brief poem about Moss

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.200
 from that book.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.640
 No, it's basically, he's a book collector

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.760
 and a railway enthusiast,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.680
 and it's always his knowledge of train timetables

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.080
 that saves the day.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.720
 - So if you want to get away with something,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.680
 just don't commit the crime on the railway.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.120
 Just drag the victim 100 yards from the train track.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.960
 - Well, that's the problem.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.080
 That's where Sherlock Holmes gets you, right?

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.920
 If you do something on the railway,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.760
 this guy gets you,

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.480
 everywhere else is Sherlock Holmes.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.400
 - Isn't they divided at the top?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.600
 - Is it like having your own spots of the city,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.880
 you know, with like drug dealers?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.160
 Like this guy's fucked up

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.720
 when Poirot has the Orient Express crime going on.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.720
 (audience laughing)

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
 - Yeah, it's really charming.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.240
 - And the author was also a railway nut,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.640
 obviously, Victor Whitechurch,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.200
 and he was a vicar and basically loved railways as well.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.760
 And so there were loads of vicar's

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.840
 who were very productive around this time,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.040
 maybe because they had cut down the requirement

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.600
 to deliver a two hour sermon on Sundays.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.200
 Suddenly all these vicar's had time on their hands.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.360
 - Well, the other thing about this guy,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.240
 Victor Whitechurch, is he was a vicar

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.560
 in charge of the Mission Church

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.800
 at Williston Junction railway station.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.000
 So he was well into his trains.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.920
 I really like the way that he wrote his stories.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.200
 So like most people would kind of like,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.640
 think of the end of the story and then work backwards.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.080
 He would get his characters, come up with a murder,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.440
 describe the whole murder,

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.840
 and then go right from here,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.680
 I'm gonna work out what happens.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.280
 And he would solve the made up murder in his head

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.200
 as he went along.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.240
 - Right, that's really cool, isn't it?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.880
 - You're sort of reading the murder mystery

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.080
 as well as writing it.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.920
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.760
 - Great.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.580
 - Were they big at the time?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.680
 Were they tourist?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.000
 - Yeah, to the level of Conan Doyle's.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.320
 - They were not as big as others.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.480
 We would have heard more about thought-pays

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.000
 in the railway detective.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.720
 The book was originally,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.880
 the book I've got is called Stories of the Railway.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.080
 It was originally called Thrilling Stories of the Railway.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.320
 And at some point, so many of us decided,

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.200
 we can't sell these as thrilling stories of the railway.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.740
 So I just don't back it up.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.080
 - It's false advertising.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.280
 I'm sorry. - It's really like.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.840
 - He was, the veggie thing was interesting

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.200
 that he made him vegetarian.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.600
 And not only vegetarian, but very fatty.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.280
 So we've talked before a bit about how the turn

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.280
 of the 20th century vegetarianism started

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.320
 to be a bit of a thing in one of the stories.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.600
 He asked for directions to a vegetarian restaurant,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.520
 which is like the proper early days of vegetarian restaurants.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.880
 And then he goes there and he lunches

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.440
 on rice pudding and prunes.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.840
 So they weren't quite up to the standards

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.080
 that we have today.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.560
 But he was really into this weird physical fads

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.400
 that came with it.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.400
 So in one book, White Church writes,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.040
 "He carried vegetarianism to an extreme

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.280
 "and was continually practicing various exercises

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.480
 "at the strangest description,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.680
 "much to the bewilderment of those around."

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.240
 And so I was reading, there's one scene

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.920
 where a friend comes upon him and describes

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.160
 a sort of crime on the railway to him.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.520
 And as the friend starts talking,

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.760
 Thorpe begins some exercises.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.840
 And as, you know, he's been spoken to,

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.200
 it's like Hazel Thorpe smiled

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.760
 and went on whirling his arms around his head.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.960
 - I've just read that story.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.800
 - Have you?

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.280
 - It's the story of Peter Crane's cigars.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.680
 And it's not very thrilling.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.520
 But it is.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.360
 - But it is a story.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.800
 - It is a story on the railway, yeah.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.320
 - And then what happens, Anna?

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.840
 - Well, all I know is that he mentions a timetable

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.120
 and suddenly Hazel Thorpe goes,

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.000
 "You begin to interest me," said Hazel,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.320
 "stopping his whirly gigs

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.280
 "and beginning to eat his plasmon."

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.240
 (laughing)

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.040
 - It's nicely written for our language.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.640
 Plasmon was a kind of biscuit.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.400
 - What it is, is there's a cigar smuggling operation.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.720
 - We don't have time for this.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.000
 (laughing)

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.920
 - I really like sort of fictional detectives all this time,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.520
 'cause lots of people were following Arthur Covendoll

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.520
 and trying to come up with like a detective with a gimmick.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.840
 So there was a fictional detective called Max Carrados.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.000
 I don't know if you guys came across.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.840
 - No.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.920
 - So he is blind, but despite that,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.560
 he is so talented that he can read fine print by touch alone.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.400
 - Wow.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.080
 - He can also fire a pistol at targets accurately

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.560
 because his senses are so good.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.200
 In one of the books, he can smell

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.160
 when someone is wearing a false mustache.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.720
 (laughing)

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.560
 - That's so cool.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.680
 - It's great. - It's really good.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.520
 - It's weird because the person wearing a false mustache

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.960
 doesn't need to be doing it in the first place

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.280
 if the detective is blind.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.120
 (laughing)

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.280
 - That's absolutely true.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.240
 - There were lots of rip-offs of Sherlock Holmes

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.080
 at the very start.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.120
 In the first 10 years or so,

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.200
 there was a detective called Sherwood Hoax,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.360
 another Shylock Obes,

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.840
 Sherlock Shomes,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.400
 Sherlock Gnomes,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.320
 (laughing)

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.800
 Kerlach Combs,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.440
 and Shamrock Jones.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.320
 (laughing)

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.320
 - That's very good. - Nice.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.120
 - I think that's sort of the Detection Club.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:14.960
 - No.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.800
 - Oh yeah, so cool.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.640
 - Oh man.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.000
 - It is a British club for detective writers.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.880
 So Victor Whitechurch of Thor Paisel fame

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.240
 was a member himself.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.080
 Lots of people remember us.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.360
 Agatha Christie was the president for many years,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.040
 and it has these sacred rituals that it enacts.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.200
 It's really exciting.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.280
 So a procession will enter

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.360
 if you're joining the club for the first time.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.680
 Procession will enter led by a figure

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.800
 wearing a scarlet cloak and carrying Eric the Skull, okay?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.760
 And you have to swear an oath to join,

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.080
 and then once you join, the president will says to you,

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.920
 if you fail to remember your promises

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.560
 and break even one of our unwritten laws,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.040
 may other writers anticipate your plots,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.640
 may total strangers sue you for libel,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.240
 may your pages swarm with misprints,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.880
 and may your sales continually diminish.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.200
 (laughing)

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.440
 - And their rules are, they're strict.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.280
 - They're really strict.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.720
 - The rules written down in the '20s, I think,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.640
 early '30s were your detective shall detect crimes

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.240
 using their wits and not placing reliance

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.360
 on divine revelation, feminine intuition,

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.000
 a mumbo jumbo, jiggery pokery, coincidence,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.600
 or acts of God.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.120
 And also, you can't conceal clues from the reader.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.760
 But you know, the Skull that you put your hand on,

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.960
 it's not Eric.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.760
 They sexted it recently, and it's Erica.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760
 - Oh! - Yeah.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.680
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.400
 Can I, there's a guy called Ronald Knox, who I love.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.880
 He's another, he was another clerical detective author,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.000
 actually, and he wrote these 10 Commandments

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.240
 of Detective Fiction, which are quite fun.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.400
 So one of them is, not more than one secret room

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.160
 or passage is allowed per detective story.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.560
 - That's fun. - And also,

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.680
 twin brothers and doubles generally must not appear

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.160
 unless we have been duly prepared for them.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.400
 - Wow. - Anyway, he did this really cool thing,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.240
 Ronald Knox, as well as being the detective author.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.560
 1926, he interrupted all broadcasts

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.720
 on the one radio channel on the BBC,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.960
 basically to announce that there was a riot in London.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.000
 It was a spoof.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.880
 People didn't realise it was a spoof.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.880
 And it was bloody terrifying.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.600
 So it contained, he said things like,

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.560
 "The crowd has now passed along Whitehall

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.080
 "and at the suggestion of Mr. Popplebury,

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.760
 "Secretary of the National Movement

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.320
 "for Abolishing Theatre Cues,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.360
 "is preparing to demolish the houses of parliament

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.440
 "with trench mortars.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.160
 "The clock tower has just fallen to the ground,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.480
 "along with Big Ben.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.160
 "The noise you just heard was the Savoy being blown up."

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.680
 (laughing)

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.080
 So the awfulest gooch has been intercepted

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.160
 by the remnants of the crowd

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.440
 and has been roasted alive in Trafalgar Square as I speak.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.360
 And then it was snowing.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.080
 So no one could get the news for days.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.280
 So the BBC just received thousands of letters saying,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.000
 "What's going on? Oh my God."

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.840
 - That's so funny. - We're going to have to move on very soon.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.600
 I just want to quickly mention,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.000
 there's a thing that we wrote about in the Book of the Year,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.680
 which was, do you remember there's that story

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.360
 that Benedict Cumberbatch,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.680
 he was in an Uber with his wife

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.120
 and suddenly he saw a robbery that was happening

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.000
 outside on the road.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.760
 It was a Deliveroo driver

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.960
 who was being attacked by some four muggers

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.480
 who were trying to get to him.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.160
 So he hopped out and he went,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.120
 "Ah!" and sort of tried to stop it and it worked

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.840
 and they got away. - Classic show of move.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.320
 - But so he successfully scared away these muggers

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.840
 and helped this Deliveroo person.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.520
 But the thing is that this robbery was happening

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.240
 on Marlborough and High Street,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.400
 which is just down the road from Baker Street in London.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.800
 Can you imagine the robbers as they turned around

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 to see Sherlock Holmes

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.840
 right next to where he should be looking around at them?

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.000
 - You feel honoured.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.680
 You'd say, "Thank you."

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.640
 - I was just trying to mug a Deliveroo driver.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.680
 I'm not sure this is a Holmes-level crime.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.400
 - I was just thinking that, like, you know,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.280
 this guy was all about his railway time tables.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.440
 Like an Uber driver who would solve crimes

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.720
 would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.720
 - Yes. - Yeah, that would be really cool.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.840
 But is it based on the star rating that you have?

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.360
 - Yeah. - No, how could it be?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.200
 - No. - Yeah.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.480
 - It could be like... - Three stars,

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480
 he drove a bit too fast,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.080
 but he did solve the murder of my wife.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080
 - So...

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.080
 (LAUGHTER)

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.880
 - Just as OK, one tiny thing, which...

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.600
 P.D. James, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant crime author,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.440
 died only a few years ago.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.000
 She was once doing a signing,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.960
 and an Australian woman came to the front of the queue,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.800
 said her name was Emma Chizit, right?

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.880
 P.D. James signed the book to Emma Chizit,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.400
 only to realise this Australian woman

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.160
 had been asking how much the book cost.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.560
 (LAUGHTER)

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.960
 - Emma Chizit. Emma Chizit. - Emma Chizit.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:44.240
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.960
 and that is James.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.880
 OK, my fact this week is that Himalayan chewing gum

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.720
 is made out of cheese.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.160
 - Mmm. - And there it is.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.280
 - Yeah. - It looks like sausages a little bit.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.760
 - Yeah. - Or like ladies' fingers, maybe.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.960
 - Like baguettes.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.000
 - So in what sense is it chewing gum?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.720
 - It's chewing gum in the sense that it's called Himalayan chewing gum,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.800
 and that you chew it a lot.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.560
 It's the world's hardest cheese that we know of.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.360
 It's called chirpy, and because it's so, so hard,

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.000
 you put it in your mouth, and if you're like a yak farmer

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.280
 or something, you're just having your daily yak farm,

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.240
 then you put it in your mouth and you just chew it and chew it and chew it,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.680
 and the saliva slowly makes it softer and softer and softer,

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.640
 and it's hours and hours that you chew this stuff,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.960
 and eventually you can eat it,

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.720
 and so that's why they call it chewing gum.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.200
 - It sounds nice, but it does sound unbelievably tough,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.760
 as in there was a BBC journalist who tried it,

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.920
 and he chewed his piece for seven minutes.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.920
 Seven minutes, didn't leave a scratch on it.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.160
 - Yeah, it's really hard. - Wow.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.920
 - I have had it, but I've not had the hard version,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.920
 I've had the soft version. - Oh, God.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.360
 - Do they ease you in on that?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.040
 - Basically, this stuff, they've kind of dried it out for ages and ages.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.000
 I think they put it in like an animal skin or something,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.240
 and dry it out for ages,

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.520
 but if you have it early on before they do all that,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.520
 it's more like cottage cheese, like Georgian cheese,

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.760
 and it's the national dish of Bhutan, it's called emadatzi,

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.720
 and that's the type that I had,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.320
 and it's basically really, really, really, really hot chilies

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.120
 inside a bowl of this cheese, and it is delicious.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.160
 It's one of the best things I've ever had.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.200
 And they don't usually let foreigners eat it,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.520
 because it's too spicy, that's what they say.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.600
 - Oh, yeah, that's how they flutter every foreigner who walks in.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.120
 (LAUGHTER)

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.320
 - Well, you know, those British people can't handle this one.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.920
 - How so?

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.160
 - Right, it was in Bhutan's Nando's,

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.400
 and they put a very nice little flag on the top of it.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.600
 - Did it have a lemon and a herb on it, is what I wanted to know.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.560
 - But chirpy as well is sometimes used these days as a dog treat,

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.280
 because it's so chewy.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.360
 I think even in America, I don't know if you can buy it here,

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.080
 but in America you can buy this cheesy dog treat

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.440
 that they can just keep chewing on. - Right.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.160
 - I read a very spurious sentence about it,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.040
 I thought, in one of the articles, which said,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.360
 "Since it's rich in protein and fat,

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.760
 "it makes a great substitute for vegetables."

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.800
 (LAUGHTER)

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.360
 - I don't know, that's why we're eating our greens.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.000
 - Can I tell you about the Fight Club for Cheese?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.320
 - No, you can't tell us about the Fight Club for Cheese.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.360
 - OK. - That's the whole point.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.960
 - Oh, yeah, oh, shit.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.520
 - Damn it.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.400
 (APPLAUSE)

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.240
 - Yeah, it's the Cheese Munger International,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.240
 which happens in the USA, and it's...

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.000
 This was a description of the FT.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.120
 "It involves 50 young cheese mungers

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.800
 "pitting their skills against each other

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.400
 "in a frenetic battle of curd-nerdery."

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.520
 - That's just so cool. - It does sound fun, yeah.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.600
 The charismatic founder, Adam Moskovitz,

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.640
 is called Mr. Moo and compares in a cow onesie.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.240
 - Wow. - OK, a bit less cool now, it's cool.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.240
 - I wonder who's called him the charismatic founder.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.680
 Sounds like something on his own website.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.760
 Him and his onesie at the top.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.920
 - You know, Baratta, the more delicious version of mozzarella?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.320
 - Um, yep. - I didn't really know what that was,

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.920
 but it's... So it came about as a way of using up leftovers,

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.440
 and the way they did it, this was in the 1930s,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.440
 it's in Apulia, it's the only place you can make it.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.920
 Cream would be scraped off the top of milk,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.720
 and it was usually chucked away,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.440
 and instead they mixed it with stretched mozzarella curds

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.200
 to make that really creamy soupy inside,

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.400
 and then they blew mozzarella into a bubble,

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.440
 so they got mozzarella, and they blew like a bubblegum bubble,

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.680
 and then they stuffed this cream inside,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.360
 and this was just to preserve it,

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.560
 so this meant that when you had like a day's journey to get to market,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.560
 then this apparently insulated it from the heat of the sun,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.120
 and meant that the cream and cheese didn't go off inside,

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.800
 so when you prod that open, but I just love that they blew into it,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.480
 like a little, you know... - Yeah, that's incredible, yeah.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.920
 - Bubble. - Like a bubble.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.160
 - Don't make me that clear. - Liquid soupy stuff from cheese.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.240
 This is an interesting new innovation that's happening around the world,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.760
 and I wonder if it's going to take off in Wisconsin.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.840
 They've been doing this, so they make a lot of cheese there,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.320
 and they have a lot of master cheese makers there as well.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.840
 So as a result of having a lot of cheese,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.640
 they have a lot of excess brine that they need to get rid of,

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.960
 and what they do is they liquefy it,

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.920
 and they pour it on the side of the roads during winter in place of salt,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.120
 and it works way better than salt does.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.560
 It's great for them, because they're getting rid of a lot of waste,

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.120
 and they're using it really efficiently.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.120
 - Does it not make the entire state smell of cheese?

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.040
 - It stinks like shit, yeah.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.840
 - I think a lot of Wisconsin smells of cheese already to give that.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.400
 - I could... OK.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.840
 - But what's really interesting is, A, it's just a great way

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.520
 of just recycling the materials in a good way,

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.200
 but also, this typical salt they would use on roads,

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.680
 that would freeze at six below zero,

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.200
 whereas cheese doesn't freeze until 21 below zero,

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.680
 so it's actually even just useful in the sense that the colder it gets,

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.960
 it's still useful.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.720
 - But that's why you never get cheese ice cream, tragically.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.960
 - Oh, really? - No.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.960
 So, there was a big story, a big story in Germany last year,

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.800
 and that was that someone was living above a cheese shop,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.480
 and she was very, very upset because her house smelled of cheese all the time.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.160
 She said the smell of cheese was coming through her electrical sockets,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.040
 and it went to court because she said that they should just stop selling cheese all the time.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.480
 Basically, she was, like, putting signs up saying, "This place stinks of cheese."

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.680
 I was in a cheese-fucking-cheese shop, but she was putting that.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.200
 He said that she had been hiding cheese behind a fuse box to frame him.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.960
 Anyway, so they found in favour of the cheese seller,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.200
 but he's decided, "OK, I want to be a good neighbour,

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.840
 "so I'm going to move away anyway."

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.600
 But because of this story, no one will let him move into that shop anymore,

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.760
 and he's stuck in the place and she's stuck living above him.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.440
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Isn't that bad?

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.280
 Will you re-home, Mr Stinky Cheese seller?

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.600
 We've got to wrap up in a sec, guys.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.400
 Anything before we do?

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.720
 St Hildegard of Bingen, who was friend of the podcast.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.000
 Yeah, yes. Mystic from the 12th century.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.240
 She always thought that all cheese should be dried,

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.920
 and she really liked her cheese,

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.880
 but she also thought that cheese was...

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.520
 Like cheese-making was how children was made.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.280
 So she wrote that, "At first, the semen inside the woman is milky,

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.640
 "then it coagulates, then it becomes flesh,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.560
 "and then it becomes the body."

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.840
 So it's cheese just halfway to becoming a human.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.600
 Is that what she's saying?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.800
 I guess it's what she's saying. It's terrifying.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.000
 Wow, she was a wise woman,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.560
 but she did get some things wrong, didn't she, Hildegard?

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.720
 Her restaurant was a disaster.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.640
 But there was a guy called Tertuion,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.920
 who was a father from the 2nd and 3rd century.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.400
 He was like a priest,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.840
 and he thought that the birth of Jesus was a bit like this.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.440
 So Jesus had been born in a kind of cheesy way.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.160
 So, like, away, yeah.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.200
 So, like, the curds...

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.480
 Away, away in a manger.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.560
 Away in a manger.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.840
 So the curds liked cheese.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.680
 (LAUGHTER)

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.040
 The curds liked cheese.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.880
 Jesus had grown, Jesus had grown into his shape.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.600
 And then he kind of got kicked out of the church

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.120
 because of this crazy stuff that he grew up with.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.600
 Well, he went to another sect called the Montanists,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.280
 and he kind of became really big in the Montanists,

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.880
 and they decided that as well as bread and wine

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.080
 and Holy Communion,

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.440
 you could also have a little bit of cheese with your wafer.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.200
 Look, we need to wrap up, I'm afraid.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.920
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.640
