00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:18,00:00:22,"This week, coming to you live from Newcastle!"
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:27,(upbeat music)
00:00:28,00:00:30,"- Hi, it is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"and I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"Andrew Hunts and Murray, and Jay Tarkin."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:41,00:00:45,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:48,00:00:51,My fact this week is that Harry Houdini's dog
00:00:51,00:00:54,was a professional escape artist.
00:00:54,00:00:56,(audience laughing)
00:00:56,00:00:58,- Did they call him Harry Houdini?
00:00:58,00:01:00,"- Brilliant, very nice."
00:01:00,00:01:03,"They should have, no, they called him Bobby."
00:01:03,00:01:06,"And Bobby was Harry Houdini's dog,"
00:01:06,00:01:10,"aka the only handcuff king dog in the world,"
00:01:10,00:01:13,and Bobby headlined the 14th Annual Society
00:01:13,00:01:16,of American Magicians Dinner.
00:01:16,00:01:17,This is the annual thing that they had.
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Harry Houdini was the president at the time,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,"and he taught Bobby to be an escape artist,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,so he made him little tiny handcuffs
00:01:24,00:01:25,that would go around his wrist.
00:01:25,00:01:27,- Do you know if you were the second on the belt
00:01:27,00:01:27,of that dog?
00:01:27,00:01:28,- Yeah.
00:01:28,00:01:31,- You've been invited to the Society of American Magicians.
00:01:31,00:01:32,This is your big chance.
00:01:32,00:01:33,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:01:33,00:01:35,- And you have to warm up for a fucking dog.
00:01:35,00:01:37,"- Yeah, exactly, it's so funny."
00:01:37,00:01:39,"- But he could do, I mean, it wasn't just the handcuffs,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,he also had a little tiny straight jacket
00:01:41,00:01:44,that was made for him that he could escape from.
00:01:44,00:01:46,- It sounds like an incredible act.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"- Apparently, I mean, according to Houdini,"
00:01:48,00:01:52,he said he was a dog gone hit from the evening.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"- Yeah, he wasn't known for his jokes, come on."
00:01:54,00:01:55,(audience laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:56,Don't give him shit for that.
00:01:56,00:01:58,- He did that and he didn't go for Houdini.
00:01:58,00:01:58,(audience laughing)
00:01:58,00:02:00,"- Oh, my goodness."
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- But yeah, so he loved pets generally."
00:02:02,00:02:03,He had a lot of pets.
00:02:03,00:02:05,He had a talking parrot called Laura.
00:02:05,00:02:07,He had a pet turtle called Petey.
00:02:07,00:02:11,He had an American eagle called Abraham Lincoln.
00:02:11,00:02:14,And my favorite one is that he had a lot of parrots.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"He had one called Pat Houdini,"
00:02:16,00:02:19,and he taught this parrot how to pick locks.
00:02:19,00:02:23,"And Pat, after Houdini died, according to the story,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"Bess, his wife, was living in the house with Pat."
00:02:25,00:02:28,"Pat picked his own lock, got out of the cage,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,"and flew away, and I was in there for a scene again."
00:02:30,00:02:31,- Really? I disappeared.
00:02:31,00:02:32,Wasn't it because of Bess
00:02:32,00:02:34,that Bobby came to them in the first place?
00:02:34,00:02:37,She bought Bobby from a butcher.
00:02:37,00:02:39,"It was a butcher's pet,"
00:02:39,00:02:41,and the butcher wouldn't let her give it a bone.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"And so I guess she thought,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,"I really want to give this dog a bone, desperately."
00:02:45,00:02:47,"I'm going to buy it, so I can."
00:02:47,00:02:48,Is that true?
00:02:48,00:02:49,- That's the story.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- It's a slightly confusing story, but yeah."
00:02:51,00:02:54,"- Magical dogs, just while we're on them,"
00:02:54,00:02:56,there are so many magical dogs.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Have you heard of Oscar the Hypno Dog?
00:02:57,00:02:58,- No.
00:02:58,00:03:02,- Oscar the Hypno Dog was a recent performing dog.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"He played from 1989 to 2001,"
00:03:05,00:03:08,and then he had to retire for health reasons.
00:03:08,00:03:10,"Apparently, his owner said he could no longer"
00:03:10,00:03:13,hold the penetrating stare necessary for stage hypnosis.
00:03:13,00:03:16,"Basically, I think it was a chocolate Labrador,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,and he had these incredibly melting brown eyes.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"It was beautiful, and the story was that anyone"
00:03:21,00:03:23,who looked at Oscar the Hypno Dog's eyes
00:03:23,00:03:24,will fall into a deep trance.
00:03:24,00:03:28,"And he went missing at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1995,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"and they put up posters all over the place saying,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"""Oscar is missing, be very careful."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"""Do not look into his eyes."""
00:03:35,00:03:39,- That was the Edinburgh Fringe that they put that up?
00:03:39,00:03:40,- He was hard to...
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Oscar performed all over, and his only..."
00:03:41,00:03:43,- Can you imagine a worse time in the world
00:03:43,00:03:46,to put up missing posters than at the Edinburgh Fringe?
00:03:46,00:03:48,(laughing)
00:03:48,00:03:49,- Can you take one of these?
00:03:49,00:03:51,"- No, thank you, I'm all right, take one of these."
00:03:51,00:03:53,"- But he was just allowed to wander around the audience, Oscar,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,"and his owner was the hypnotist, obviously."
00:03:56,00:03:57,"His owner was called Hugh Lennon,"
00:03:57,00:03:58,and was a brilliant hypnotist.
00:03:58,00:03:59,But there is an account that Oscar was just free
00:03:59,00:04:01,to walk around the aisles of the theatre
00:04:01,00:04:03,"in the interval and things like that,"
00:04:03,00:04:04,"and he saw a man eating some crisps,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,"and being a dog, obviously, he wanted some crisps,"
00:04:06,00:04:07,"so he just sat and stared at the man,"
00:04:07,00:04:08,"hoping for some crisps,"
00:04:08,00:04:11,and then the man crumpled over in his chair
00:04:11,00:04:13,"in a deep, catatonic, hypnotic trance."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"- Wow, cool."
00:04:15,00:04:17,- He crumpled like his very crisp packet.
00:04:17,00:04:18,(laughing)
00:04:18,00:04:21,"Yeah, sort of dogs doing cool tricks"
00:04:21,00:04:23,goes back such a long way.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"- It seems like as soon as we decided,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"man decided to befriend the dog,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,we started making them do weird stuff.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"It was like the 14th century,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,"the Middle East in the 14th century,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,"in the marketplace, there'd be merchants"
00:04:33,00:04:36,"who trained their dogs to put on proper plays and stuff,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,"dramatic performances, and they'd dress them up,"
00:04:38,00:04:40,and they'd act out parts.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"I read a thing that in the sixth century,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,"so, you know, 1500 years ago,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,there was a Byzantine chronicler
00:04:46,00:04:47,who said there was a showman
00:04:47,00:04:51,"who, his show, was bringing his dog to the marketplace,"
00:04:51,00:04:54,"and the dog would collect rings from audience members,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"I guess he handed over your wedding ring or whatever,"
00:04:57,00:04:58,"and crossed your fingers,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"and then he'd bury them,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,and then he'd have the dog dig up all the rings
00:05:02,00:05:04,and return them to the correct person.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Oh, wow. - Impressive."
00:05:06,00:05:10,"- In 1670, Philip the Duke of Olion in Paris,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,he possessed a dog who knew how to sort books
00:05:12,00:05:14,alphabetically by offer.
00:05:14,00:05:17,- Cool. - Apparently.
00:05:17,00:05:18,(all laughing)
00:05:18,00:05:21,- So what do you think there is to the level of truth
00:05:21,00:05:22,"that these dogs were, I don't think,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"psychically, but were learning to do with things?"
00:05:24,00:05:25,"- Okay, well, here's one."
00:05:25,00:05:27,Here's a famous one that we do know how they did it.
00:05:27,00:05:29,So there was a famous dog genius
00:05:29,00:05:32,"in the 1820s called Monito,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"and they basically, they could spell,"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"they could play cards, they could play dominoes,"
00:05:37,00:05:38,they could do maths.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"Like, with the maths, it would be what's two plus three?"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"Is it one, is it two, is it three, is it four,"
00:05:44,00:05:45,"is it five, and when you said five,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"he would go rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, like that."
00:05:47,00:05:49,And the way that we know that he was doing it
00:05:49,00:05:51,"is his instructor would have, in his pocket,"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"a tiny little toothpick, and he would just pring,"
00:05:54,00:05:57,"pling the little toothpick, go bling, bling, bling."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"No one in the audience could hear it,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"but the dog could hear it, and as soon as he heard it,"
00:06:01,00:06:02,he knew he would have to bark.
00:06:02,00:06:04,- That's very clever. - Yeah.
00:06:04,00:06:05,- There is another thing where people think
00:06:05,00:06:08,"that dogs are doing this, and they're actually not,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,but the dogs are picking up on signals
00:06:10,00:06:12,that the humans don't realise they're giving off.
00:06:12,00:06:16,"So there was a thing, the Hundsplech Schuller Azra,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"which is also known as the Nazi Talking Dog Programme,"
00:06:19,00:06:23,"which John Boddison, you know, friend of the show,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"has written about before, he wrote a book"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"called Amazing Dogs, and they were convinced"
00:06:27,00:06:31,that dogs could be taught to count or talk quite well.
00:06:31,00:06:34,- And what were the Nazis gonna do with this information?
00:06:34,00:06:36,"- I don't know, it's such a good question."
00:06:36,00:06:38,"- Because, like, the British supposedly, you know,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,"lovers of dogs, you know, famously,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,maybe they were gonna turn them against their owners.
00:06:42,00:06:44,"- That's absolutely true, yeah, yeah."
00:06:44,00:06:45,"Well, there were lots of headlines,"
00:06:45,00:06:51,"things like ""Heel Hitler"" or ""The Third Reich"" and..."
00:06:51,00:06:52,- K-9? - 9?
00:06:52,00:06:54,- Yes!
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- Anyway, they didn't have a..."
00:06:56,00:06:58,John Boddison clarified that the Nazis did not have a legion
00:06:58,00:07:01,"of talking machine gun toting hounds, so..."
00:07:01,00:07:03,"- The programmers are bad. - There is famously,"
00:07:03,00:07:04,"I can't remember all of this,"
00:07:04,00:07:07,but there's famously a Nazi monument in London.
00:07:07,00:07:09,I think there's one. - Right.
00:07:09,00:07:12,"- And it was a Nazi dog, and the dog died in London."
00:07:12,00:07:14,"It was like the German ambassador's dog,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"and they give a proper Nazi funeral,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"and they put a little kind of thing up,"
00:07:18,00:07:20,and that's the only Nazi memorial in the whole of London.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- Wow, really? - I'm still there."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- It's still there, yeah. - That's a bit weird."
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- Oh, I suppose the dog... - That's what you wanted."
00:07:26,00:07:29,"- Are you proposing, are you proposing we tear it down?"
00:07:29,00:07:31,- Maybe you're proposing we get a few more.
00:07:33,00:07:36,"- I'm just surprised in the big moment of all the statues going down,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"that no one went, ""Can we just lob this one in this one?"""
00:07:38,00:07:41,- Yeah. - Fair enough.
00:07:41,00:07:44,- The dog didn't know what it was doing in its defence.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"Uncessel Rhodes did, is all I'm saying."
00:07:47,00:07:48,- Fair enough.
00:07:48,00:07:50,Do you know the movie Air Bud?
00:07:50,00:07:56,"It's a movie about a dog that becomes a basketball sensation,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,because it can play basketball.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"It's a kid's film. - True story, yeah."
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- Based on, yeah. - Based on, kind of,"
00:08:03,00:08:08,"because it turned out that Bud, the dog that was hired for the movie,"
00:08:08,00:08:11,"it wasn't CGI, Bud could play basketball."
00:08:11,00:08:14,"This was a stray golden retriever that, in 1989,"
00:08:14,00:08:17,"was found roaming the mountains of Yosemite,"
00:08:17,00:08:20,"and the person who found him, and I called him Buddy,"
00:08:20,00:08:22,he trained him in a lot of different sports.
00:08:22,00:08:24,So he trained him how to catch a baseball pitch.
00:08:24,00:08:26,I don't know how that's possible.
00:08:26,00:08:27,"He then set up a hockey net,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,and he showed him how to block shots coming into the net.
00:08:30,00:08:33,"But then he taught him how to shoot basketball,"
00:08:33,00:08:34,"and he went on the David Letterman show,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"and he displayed it, and how he did it."
00:08:36,00:08:37,He became quite a national star.
00:08:37,00:08:40,- I'd like to have seen him do pole vault.
00:08:40,00:08:41,- Yeah?
00:08:41,00:08:42,He might have done.
00:08:42,00:08:45,But there was no CGI use.
00:08:45,00:08:46,He was playing real basketball.
00:08:46,00:08:47,He was shooting hoops.
00:08:47,00:08:51,"- And was LeBron James frightened of his career,"
00:08:51,00:08:55,or how could we tell him that Bob and James were alike?
00:08:55,00:09:00,"- Guys, you're gonna have to get on board."
00:09:00,00:09:02,You knew what you were coming to.
00:09:02,00:09:05,- You bought the tickets.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"- I've just got one more thing on, sort of,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,"the risk to performing ""Docs"" now."
00:09:09,00:09:10,- Yes.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- Because now, people are, you know,"
00:09:12,00:09:13,motion capture is really good.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"So there is a film called ""The Call of the Wild,"""
00:09:15,00:09:17,"based on a book by Jack London,"
00:09:17,00:09:18,"out last year or the year before,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"stars Harrison Ford, and it's about this man"
00:09:20,00:09:22,and his dog best friend.
00:09:22,00:09:24,And they didn't use a dog for it.
00:09:24,00:09:26,"They used a guy called Terry,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,who just wore a motion capture suit.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"Terry Notary is his name,"
00:09:29,00:09:32,and he just would go around on all fours
00:09:32,00:09:34,"for the whole film, pretending to be a dog,"
00:09:34,00:09:35,and then they CGI'd the whole thing.
00:09:35,00:09:36,"- Oh, wow."
00:09:36,00:09:39,"- And there's a scene where they're lying together,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"you know, like, the dog is in Harrison Ford's lap,"
00:09:41,00:09:44,and it's very moving.
00:09:44,00:09:46,And it's just a guy called Terry.
00:09:46,00:09:47,(audience laughing)
00:09:47,00:09:51,The production photo's unbelievable.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"And Terry, he's a serious motion capture dude."
00:09:53,00:09:55,"Like, he's an anti-circus-style guy."
00:09:55,00:09:58,So he said it was about trying to be present for Ford
00:09:58,00:10:00,"and let him forget, really forget that I was a human,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,and be a dog and dissolve into it.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"Harrison Ford said, ""Terry Notary does a great tennis ball."""
00:10:06,00:10:07,- Wow.
00:10:07,00:10:07,(audience laughing)
00:10:07,00:10:09,"- Is there a scene in the movie,"
00:10:09,00:10:10,"and I really hope there is,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,"where the dog takes a poo on the grass, because--"
00:10:12,00:10:14,(audience laughing)
00:10:14,00:10:17,- And then Harrison Ford has to pick up Terry's poo.
00:10:17,00:10:18,(audience laughing)
00:10:18,00:10:21,- You can see in his face that he's not happy in that scene.
00:10:21,00:10:23,He's putting the bag around.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"Oh, fuck, Terry!"
00:10:25,00:10:27,(audience laughing)
00:10:27,00:10:29,"- Listen, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:10:29,00:10:33,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:10:33,00:10:35,"- My fact this week is that in the First World War,"
00:10:35,00:10:39,MI5 employed 90 girl guides.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"They tried Boy Scouts at first,"
00:10:41,00:10:42,but found they couldn't be trusted.
00:10:42,00:10:46,(audience laughing)
00:10:46,00:10:48,- So what did they employ them to do?
00:10:48,00:10:49,"- Well, lots of stuff."
00:10:49,00:10:53,"So this was girl guides, age 14 to 16,"
00:10:53,00:10:54,and it was very shortly after the girl guides
00:10:54,00:10:55,"had been founded,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,and they were paid tensionings a week.
00:10:58,00:10:59,"They were at nine-hour days,"
00:10:59,00:11:02,and they were asked to sort of carry messages
00:11:02,00:11:05,"between floors, to carry messages across town,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,and they had to swear an oath
00:11:06,00:11:08,that they would never open the messages
00:11:08,00:11:10,and read what was inside them.
00:11:10,00:11:11,"And yet they tried it with boys first,"
00:11:11,00:11:12,"with the Boy Scouts,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,and they'd found they were too boisterous
00:11:13,00:11:15,and too mischievous.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Not what you want in a spy.
00:11:16,00:11:19,- It's really cool to do newly formed girl guides
00:11:19,00:11:22,going around the MI5 HQ.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"They were a company, you know,"
00:11:23,00:11:24,'cause you get companies of girl guides.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"They were the special MI5 guide company,"
00:11:27,00:11:30,"and they got quite seriously involved with the war,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,"you know, like back-of-house capacity,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,but they worked in the--
00:11:34,00:11:35,(audience laughing)
00:11:35,00:11:37,"- To begin with, but then it was quite sad"
00:11:37,00:11:38,"at the end, wasn't it?"
00:11:38,00:11:40,- The front lines.
00:11:40,00:11:41,- Over the top now.
00:11:41,00:11:44,Do I get a bunch for this?
00:11:44,00:11:46,I'm just throwing brownies at the enemy.
00:11:46,00:11:48,(audience laughing)
00:11:48,00:11:51,"- Yeah, okay, yeah, point taken."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"But they worked in the Postal Censorship Office,"
00:11:53,00:11:56,and that was also where they dislodged Boy Scouts
00:11:56,00:11:57,from the role that the Boy Scouts had there.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"The poor Boy Scouts, I mean,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,they clearly had really muffed it.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"But they also, this is the most amazing thing,"
00:12:02,00:12:03,"the girl guides, they acted as messengers"
00:12:03,00:12:06,for the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.
00:12:06,00:12:08,16 of them were invited to witness
00:12:08,00:12:10,the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.
00:12:10,00:12:13,The leaders of Europe and 16 girl guides were there.
00:12:13,00:12:14,(audience laughing)
00:12:14,00:12:15,I just think that's incredible.
00:12:15,00:12:17,"- But yeah, they were, they're very cool,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"and I think they were a little bit goody too choosy,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"shockingly enough, girl guides as they were."
00:12:21,00:12:23,There was an MI5 employee who said
00:12:23,00:12:26,they used to sort of be always lurking in corners.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"But being useful, but you know, just always there,"
00:12:29,00:12:31,"you can imagine, what's this 14 year old girl doing"
00:12:31,00:12:32,in my office?
00:12:32,00:12:33,(audience laughing)
00:12:33,00:12:35,"- Well, they had to always wear their outfits, didn't they?"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"Like, they had to wear their hats,"
00:12:37,00:12:40,and they had to wear their skirt
00:12:40,00:12:42,was not allowed to be more than eight inches off the ground.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"And so they dressed in that,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,"you wouldn't just see a random 14 year old girl,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,you would know they were.
00:12:47,00:12:48,"- You'd know, you'd know."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"But apparently in their breaks,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,this MI5 employee said the girl guide
00:12:52,00:12:54,retires to her attractive little sitting room
00:12:54,00:12:57,where she converses on high topics with her friends.
00:12:57,00:13:00,"- Aw, so sweet. - I know, so sweet."
00:13:00,00:13:02,- They were quite controversial
00:13:02,00:13:04,"when they first came about, girl guides, girl scouts."
00:13:04,00:13:05,- Were they?
00:13:05,00:13:07,"- Yeah, they were, so initially it was just thought"
00:13:07,00:13:08,"to be a boys thing,"
00:13:08,00:13:11,"and Baden Powell had set up the Boy Scouts,"
00:13:11,00:13:13,"and there were a few moments where,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,"particularly in Crystal Palace in London,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,"where a bunch of Boy Scouts got together,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,a thousand in order to just do a big display
00:13:20,00:13:21,and say we're here.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"And completely unsanctioned,"
00:13:24,00:13:27,"these girls came along, dressed up in the--"
00:13:27,00:13:28,- The Boy Scouts costume at the time.
00:13:28,00:13:29,"- The Boy Scouts, sorry, yeah."
00:13:29,00:13:30,- 'Cause they're one of the girls scouts.
00:13:30,00:13:32,- And declared themselves to be girl scouts.
00:13:32,00:13:34,"And Baden Powell suddenly was like,"
00:13:34,00:13:36,"""Hang on a second, this might be a thing."""
00:13:36,00:13:37,"He just assumed,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"because any time that they were trying to do it,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"the reviews, they got reviews, were bad."
00:13:41,00:13:43,"They were saying, there were complaints saying that,"
00:13:43,00:13:44,"they were mannish girls,"
00:13:44,00:13:47,and girls not being peaceful if they were in a uniform.
00:13:47,00:13:49,They were worried that it was gonna start
00:13:49,00:13:50,"this whole new, different thing."
00:13:50,00:13:51,"And so they were really against it,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"and the girls said, ""No, screw you, we're doing it."""
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- Yeah, they were very plucky."
00:13:54,00:13:57,"It was led by a team of, I think, six or seven girls."
00:13:57,00:13:59,And this was a huge march.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"It was the first Boy Scouts march, 1909."
00:14:01,00:14:03,The Boy Scouts had just been founded.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"11,000 boys, and apparently 2,000 girls also turned up,"
00:14:07,00:14:11,and led by these six or seven girls who just decided
00:14:11,00:14:12,"we wanna get involved with this,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,and pretty much went up to Baden Powell.
00:14:14,00:14:15,"He went up to them and said, ""We want it."""
00:14:15,00:14:18,"And to his credit, Baden Powell was always really pro."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"He wrote a lot of stuff even before this,"
00:14:20,00:14:23,saying how girls can be just as brave as boys.
00:14:23,00:14:25,"Over and again, they've proved it."
00:14:25,00:14:27,It's just not part of their education.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"And within about a week, 6,000 girl guides"
00:14:29,00:14:30,"had registered, hadn't they? - Wow."
00:14:30,00:14:31,"- Well, he thought at first,"
00:14:31,00:14:34,"he might just let the girls into the Boy Scouts,"
00:14:34,00:14:36,and it would just be the Scouts.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"But then in the end, he decided"
00:14:37,00:14:39,they would do the girl guides instead.
00:14:39,00:14:41,One of the reasons that they did that
00:14:41,00:14:43,is because he was always worried about something
00:14:43,00:14:45,that he called girlitis.
00:14:45,00:14:48,"And that was whenever his Boy Scouts got to a certain age,"
00:14:48,00:14:52,they started not being very interested in setting fires.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"- Oh, dear. - Yeah."
00:14:53,00:14:56,- Wow. - It's a legitimate concern.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"- Yes, sir. - Let's face it."
00:14:57,00:14:59,- Wow.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"Gosh, is it, yeah."
00:15:01,00:15:02,So...
00:15:02,00:15:03,(audience laughing)
00:15:03,00:15:07,- I'm used to... (laughing)
00:15:07,00:15:10,"- Okay, I said it, all right."
00:15:10,00:15:11,"Can I, why are you drooling?"
00:15:11,00:15:12,Stop drooling.
00:15:12,00:15:14,- I'm not drooling. - Put that woggle away.
00:15:14,00:15:17,(audience laughing)
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Can I tell you one more thing about Girl Guides' War?
00:15:18,00:15:20,"- Yes, please. - Yeah."
00:15:20,00:15:21,"- First World War specifically, this one."
00:15:21,00:15:24,"They were very helpful in both World Wars, actually,"
00:15:24,00:15:25,the Girl Guides.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"And one of the things they did,"
00:15:27,00:15:30,"along with the Boys Brigade, Scottish organization,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,"and the Boy Scouts,"
00:15:31,00:15:35,the Girl Guides did a lot of collecting of sphagnum moss
00:15:35,00:15:37,"during the First World War. - Oh, Jesus Christ."
00:15:37,00:15:39,- And it's very interesting.
00:15:39,00:15:40,"It was used for wound dressing,"
00:15:40,00:15:42,as I think we may have mentioned once or twice
00:15:42,00:15:43,on this podcast before.
00:15:43,00:15:46,And they were the ones out there in the peat bogs
00:15:46,00:15:47,"picking up the moss, collecting it,"
00:15:47,00:15:48,so it could be used to dress wounds.
00:15:48,00:15:50,And there was even a poem about it.
00:15:50,00:15:51,What good news?
00:15:51,00:15:53,(audience laughing)
00:15:53,00:15:54,"- We don't have time for that, I don't think."
00:15:54,00:15:56,"- We do, we do, and we will."
00:15:56,00:15:59,Mrs. A.M. Smith of the Edinburgh War Dressing Supply
00:15:59,00:16:01,"organization wrote this very brief poem, all right."
00:16:01,00:16:04,The doctors of the nurses look north with eager eyes
00:16:04,00:16:07,and call on us to send them the dressing that they prize.
00:16:07,00:16:08,No other is its equal.
00:16:08,00:16:12,In modest bulk it goes until it meets the gaping wound
00:16:12,00:16:14,where the red lifeblood flows.
00:16:14,00:16:17,"Then spreading, swelling in its might,"
00:16:17,00:16:20,it checks the fatal loss and kills the germ
00:16:20,00:16:24,"and heals the hurt, the kindly sphagnum moss."
00:16:24,00:16:25,(audience laughing)
00:16:25,00:16:26,What a poem!
00:16:26,00:16:27,What a poem!
00:16:27,00:16:30,"- Oh, dear."
00:16:30,00:16:33,Pretty good.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"- There was a concern, so it was controversial"
00:16:35,00:16:37,when they were formed and lots of pushback.
00:16:37,00:16:40,"And one of the reasons, other reasons that they were separated"
00:16:40,00:16:41,is because it was thought that Boy Scouts
00:16:41,00:16:44,wouldn't like the idea that girls were joining in their games
00:16:44,00:16:46,and it made them kind of effeminate and silly.
00:16:46,00:16:48,And someone wrote to Bade and Powell
00:16:48,00:16:50,"very shortly after they were formed saying,"
00:16:50,00:16:51,"they thought it was ridiculous,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,this idea that you could have girls scouts
00:16:53,00:16:56,"given that girls aren't even allowed to run,"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"hurry, swim, ride a bike,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,or raise their arms above their head.
00:17:01,00:17:03,(audience laughing)
00:17:03,00:17:06,It was a very strict parenting that that man was enforcing.
00:17:06,00:17:07,"- Hurry, you're not allowed to hurry?"
00:17:07,00:17:09,"- You weren't allowed to hurry as a girl, apparently."
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- In 1909, yeah?"
00:17:11,00:17:13,"Raise your arms, you couldn't put your hand up in class."
00:17:13,00:17:15,That's why they didn't do as well in education.
00:17:15,00:17:17,- Couldn't do the YMCA?
00:17:17,00:17:20,"- No, no, couldn't do the MOBOT."
00:17:20,00:17:21,Although that wouldn't become a problem
00:17:21,00:17:23,"for another 100 years, so it was probably fine."
00:17:23,00:17:25,- I don't think the YMCA dances much of an issue
00:17:25,00:17:26,in 1909 either.
00:17:26,00:17:27,(audience laughing)
00:17:27,00:17:30,"- Well, another dance actually got them into trouble."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"They always seemed to, like when you read in the news,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,it always seems that girl scouts
00:17:33,00:17:35,are somehow involved in some weird controversy.
00:17:35,00:17:40,"So 1996, the American Society of Composers,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"authors and publishers, threatened to sue them"
00:17:43,00:17:46,over royalties for songs that members would sing
00:17:46,00:17:47,during campfires.
00:17:47,00:17:50,"So they said to them, ""You're not allowed to sing our songs"
00:17:50,00:17:52,"""unless you're paying a royalty."""
00:17:52,00:17:56,"And the idea was, yeah, groups would have to pay $250"
00:17:56,00:17:59,for public performances for the rights to songs
00:17:59,00:17:59,that they wanted to sing.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"- But what were they, they must have been singing"
00:18:00,00:18:01,"pop songs then, right?"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"- Yeah, it was pop songs and so on."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"- God, what, was it the Rolling Stones who were complaining?"
00:18:05,00:18:07,Is it the Paul McCartney who was--
00:18:07,00:18:09,- It was the publishing companies.
00:18:09,00:18:10,And so there were cautions.
00:18:10,00:18:12,There were copyright infringement penalties that they said.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"They said, ""We'll charge you 100,000"
00:18:15,00:18:16,"""or you will get a year in prison."""
00:18:16,00:18:18,"Like, they were really strict things."
00:18:18,00:18:21,And it was a dance that stopped all of this nonsense
00:18:21,00:18:25,happening because footage was shown of them on TV
00:18:25,00:18:28,dancing the Macarena with no music
00:18:28,00:18:30,"and there was such a backlash from the public going,"
00:18:30,00:18:32,"""Don't make girl scouts dance the Macarena"
00:18:32,00:18:33,"""without the fucking song."""
00:18:33,00:18:35,(audience laughing)
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- At least with a Macarena,"
00:18:36,00:18:37,you never have to put your hands above your head.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"- That's not, that's, exactly."
00:18:39,00:18:40,"- He is only, yeah."
00:18:40,00:18:41,"- Yeah, he is only."
00:18:41,00:18:43,- One thing that neither boy scouts
00:18:43,00:18:45,nor girl guides were allowed to do
00:18:45,00:18:47,in official literature was masturbate.
00:18:47,00:18:48,They were given official books.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"- What, they're not allowed to do it in literature?"
00:18:51,00:18:55,"- Sorry, full stop, in or out of literature."
00:18:55,00:18:57,"The Girl Guides guidebook said,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,"""Don't masturbate, it can lead to blindness,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,"""paralysis and loss of memory."""
00:19:02,00:19:05,"- Sorry, didn't it, it said in the guidebook then."
00:19:05,00:19:06,"- Yeah, really, really."
00:19:06,00:19:07,"- I don't think it said,"
00:19:07,00:19:08,"I don't think it said the word masturbate,"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"but I think it was clear what the,"
00:19:11,00:19:13,"'cause a lot of it was taken from the Boy Scouts guidebook,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,it was pretty much copied directly over.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"- Wow. - And, yeah, I know."
00:19:17,00:19:19,- I don't recall ever seeing a no masturbation badge
00:19:19,00:19:20,on a scale.
00:19:20,00:19:21,(audience laughing)
00:19:21,00:19:22,- Have you not?
00:19:22,00:19:22,- No.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"- Well, you're not trying hard enough to earn it then."
00:19:24,00:19:26,(audience laughing)
00:19:26,00:19:28,"There was a vice, actually."
00:19:28,00:19:30,"The Girl Guides guidebook is funny, reading it now,"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"you know, so here's a great bit of advice"
00:19:32,00:19:34,"from it, ""It is said that you can tell a man's character"
00:19:34,00:19:36,"""from the way he wears his hat."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"""If it is slightly on one side, the wearer is good-natured."
00:19:39,00:19:43,"""If it is worn very much on one side, he is a swaggerer."
00:19:43,00:19:46,"""If on the back of the head, he is bad at paying his debts."
00:19:46,00:19:48,(audience laughing)
00:19:48,00:19:51,"""If worn straight on top, he is probably honest,"
00:19:51,00:19:52,"""but very dull."""
00:19:52,00:19:56,(audience laughing)
00:19:56,00:19:57,- We need to move on to our next fact.
00:19:57,00:20:02,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:20:02,00:20:04,My fact is that there is a fictional Victorian detective
00:20:04,00:20:08,who was created to be the opposite of Sherlock Holmes.
00:20:08,00:20:10,"In the only recent adaptation of the stories,"
00:20:10,00:20:13,the detective in question was played by Benedict Gumberbatch.
00:20:13,00:20:15,(audience laughing)
00:20:15,00:20:18,"This is the fictional detective Thorpe Hazel,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,and these are the Thorpe Hazel mysteries
00:20:20,00:20:23,"by an author called Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,and basically he is a railway-based detective.
00:20:25,00:20:28,"He only solves crimes that involve the railways,"
00:20:28,00:20:29,and he only solves them
00:20:29,00:20:30,through the medium of railway timetables.
00:20:30,00:20:32,(audience laughing)
00:20:32,00:20:33,He's incredible.
00:20:33,00:20:34,- That's awesome.
00:20:34,00:20:35,- He's awesome.
00:20:35,00:20:37,- He's a vegetarian railway detective.
00:20:37,00:20:38,- He certainly is.
00:20:38,00:20:40,- That's very important in the description.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"- Yeah, and I'm very proud to say I have a copy here"
00:20:42,00:20:47,of Stories of the Railway by Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"The Thorpe Hazel mysteries are in here,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,and I just want to read you a brief poem about Moss
00:20:51,00:20:54,from that book.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"No, it's basically, he's a book collector"
00:20:56,00:20:57,"and a railway enthusiast,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,and it's always his knowledge of train timetables
00:20:59,00:21:01,that saves the day.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"- So if you want to get away with something,"
00:21:02,00:21:05,just don't commit the crime on the railway.
00:21:05,00:21:09,Just drag the victim 100 yards from the train track.
00:21:09,00:21:09,"- Well, that's the problem."
00:21:09,00:21:12,"That's where Sherlock Holmes gets you, right?"
00:21:12,00:21:13,"If you do something on the railway,"
00:21:13,00:21:14,"this guy gets you,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,everywhere else is Sherlock Holmes.
00:21:16,00:21:18,- Isn't they divided at the top?
00:21:18,00:21:20,"- Is it like having your own spots of the city,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,"you know, with like drug dealers?"
00:21:21,00:21:23,Like this guy's fucked up
00:21:23,00:21:25,when Poirot has the Orient Express crime going on.
00:21:25,00:21:27,(audience laughing)
00:21:27,00:21:28,"- Yeah, it's really charming."
00:21:28,00:21:30,"- And the author was also a railway nut,"
00:21:30,00:21:31,"obviously, Victor Whitechurch,"
00:21:31,00:21:35,and he was a vicar and basically loved railways as well.
00:21:35,00:21:36,And so there were loads of vicar's
00:21:36,00:21:38,"who were very productive around this time,"
00:21:38,00:21:41,maybe because they had cut down the requirement
00:21:41,00:21:43,to deliver a two hour sermon on Sundays.
00:21:43,00:21:45,Suddenly all these vicar's had time on their hands.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"- Well, the other thing about this guy,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,"Victor Whitechurch, is he was a vicar"
00:21:48,00:21:49,in charge of the Mission Church
00:21:49,00:21:51,at Williston Junction railway station.
00:21:51,00:21:54,So he was well into his trains.
00:21:54,00:21:55,I really like the way that he wrote his stories.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"So like most people would kind of like,"
00:21:58,00:22:00,think of the end of the story and then work backwards.
00:22:00,00:22:04,"He would get his characters, come up with a murder,"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"describe the whole murder,"
00:22:05,00:22:06,"and then go right from here,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,I'm gonna work out what happens.
00:22:08,00:22:11,And he would solve the made up murder in his head
00:22:11,00:22:12,as he went along.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"- Right, that's really cool, isn't it?"
00:22:14,00:22:15,- You're sort of reading the murder mystery
00:22:15,00:22:17,as well as writing it.
00:22:17,00:22:17,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:22:17,00:22:18,- Great.
00:22:18,00:22:19,- Were they big at the time?
00:22:19,00:22:20,Were they tourist?
00:22:20,00:22:23,"- Yeah, to the level of Conan Doyle's."
00:22:23,00:22:24,- They were not as big as others.
00:22:24,00:22:26,We would have heard more about thought-pays
00:22:26,00:22:28,in the railway detective.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"The book was originally,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,the book I've got is called Stories of the Railway.
00:22:31,00:22:34,It was originally called Thrilling Stories of the Railway.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"And at some point, so many of us decided,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,we can't sell these as thrilling stories of the railway.
00:22:40,00:22:41,So I just don't back it up.
00:22:41,00:22:43,- It's false advertising.
00:22:43,00:22:45,I'm sorry. - It's really like.
00:22:45,00:22:46,"- He was, the veggie thing was interesting"
00:22:46,00:22:48,that he made him vegetarian.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"And not only vegetarian, but very fatty."
00:22:50,00:22:52,So we've talked before a bit about how the turn
00:22:52,00:22:54,of the 20th century vegetarianism started
00:22:54,00:22:56,to be a bit of a thing in one of the stories.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"He asked for directions to a vegetarian restaurant,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,which is like the proper early days of vegetarian restaurants.
00:23:01,00:23:02,And then he goes there and he lunches
00:23:02,00:23:04,on rice pudding and prunes.
00:23:04,00:23:06,So they weren't quite up to the standards
00:23:06,00:23:08,that we have today.
00:23:08,00:23:12,But he was really into this weird physical fads
00:23:12,00:23:13,that came with it.
00:23:13,00:23:15,"So in one book, White Church writes,"
00:23:15,00:23:18,"""He carried vegetarianism to an extreme"
00:23:18,00:23:20,"""and was continually practicing various exercises"
00:23:20,00:23:21,"""at the strangest description,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,"""much to the bewilderment of those around."""
00:23:23,00:23:25,"And so I was reading, there's one scene"
00:23:25,00:23:26,where a friend comes upon him and describes
00:23:26,00:23:29,a sort of crime on the railway to him.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"And as the friend starts talking,"
00:23:30,00:23:32,Thorpe begins some exercises.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"And as, you know, he's been spoken to,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,it's like Hazel Thorpe smiled
00:23:36,00:23:38,and went on whirling his arms around his head.
00:23:38,00:23:39,- I've just read that story.
00:23:39,00:23:40,- Have you?
00:23:40,00:23:42,- It's the story of Peter Crane's cigars.
00:23:42,00:23:43,And it's not very thrilling.
00:23:43,00:23:44,But it is.
00:23:44,00:23:45,- But it is a story.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"- It is a story on the railway, yeah."
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- And then what happens, Anna?"
00:23:49,00:23:52,"- Well, all I know is that he mentions a timetable"
00:23:52,00:23:54,"and suddenly Hazel Thorpe goes,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"""You begin to interest me,"" said Hazel,"
00:23:56,00:23:57,"""stopping his whirly gigs"
00:23:57,00:23:59,"""and beginning to eat his plasmon."""
00:23:59,00:24:01,(laughing)
00:24:01,00:24:03,- It's nicely written for our language.
00:24:03,00:24:04,Plasmon was a kind of biscuit.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"- What it is, is there's a cigar smuggling operation."
00:24:07,00:24:08,- We don't have time for this.
00:24:08,00:24:10,(laughing)
00:24:10,00:24:12,"- I really like sort of fictional detectives all this time,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,'cause lots of people were following Arthur Covendoll
00:24:14,00:24:16,and trying to come up with like a detective with a gimmick.
00:24:16,00:24:19,So there was a fictional detective called Max Carrados.
00:24:19,00:24:21,I don't know if you guys came across.
00:24:21,00:24:21,- No.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"- So he is blind, but despite that,"
00:24:23,00:24:28,he is so talented that he can read fine print by touch alone.
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Wow.
00:24:29,00:24:32,- He can also fire a pistol at targets accurately
00:24:32,00:24:34,because his senses are so good.
00:24:34,00:24:36,"In one of the books, he can smell"
00:24:36,00:24:38,when someone is wearing a false mustache.
00:24:38,00:24:40,(laughing)
00:24:40,00:24:41,- That's so cool.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- It's great. - It's really good.
00:24:42,00:24:44,- It's weird because the person wearing a false mustache
00:24:44,00:24:45,doesn't need to be doing it in the first place
00:24:45,00:24:47,if the detective is blind.
00:24:47,00:24:48,(laughing)
00:24:48,00:24:49,- That's absolutely true.
00:24:51,00:24:54,- There were lots of rip-offs of Sherlock Holmes
00:24:54,00:24:55,at the very start.
00:24:55,00:24:57,"In the first 10 years or so,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,"there was a detective called Sherwood Hoax,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"another Shylock Obes,"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"Sherlock Shomes,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"Sherlock Gnomes,"
00:25:05,00:25:06,(laughing)
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Kerlach Combs,"
00:25:07,00:25:09,and Shamrock Jones.
00:25:09,00:25:11,(laughing)
00:25:11,00:25:12,- That's very good. - Nice.
00:25:12,00:25:14,- I think that's sort of the Detection Club.
00:25:14,00:25:14,- No.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"- Oh yeah, so cool."
00:25:15,00:25:16,- Oh man.
00:25:16,00:25:19,- It is a British club for detective writers.
00:25:19,00:25:21,So Victor Whitechurch of Thor Paisel fame
00:25:21,00:25:23,was a member himself.
00:25:23,00:25:24,Lots of people remember us.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"Agatha Christie was the president for many years,"
00:25:26,00:25:29,and it has these sacred rituals that it enacts.
00:25:29,00:25:30,It's really exciting.
00:25:30,00:25:32,So a procession will enter
00:25:32,00:25:34,if you're joining the club for the first time.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Procession will enter led by a figure
00:25:35,00:25:39,"wearing a scarlet cloak and carrying Eric the Skull, okay?"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"And you have to swear an oath to join,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,"and then once you join, the president will says to you,"
00:25:44,00:25:45,if you fail to remember your promises
00:25:45,00:25:48,"and break even one of our unwritten laws,"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"may other writers anticipate your plots,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"may total strangers sue you for libel,"
00:25:53,00:25:56,"may your pages swarm with misprints,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,and may your sales continually diminish.
00:25:58,00:26:00,(laughing)
00:26:00,00:26:02,"- And their rules are, they're strict."
00:26:02,00:26:03,- They're really strict.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- The rules written down in the '20s, I think,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,early '30s were your detective shall detect crimes
00:26:08,00:26:10,using their wits and not placing reliance
00:26:10,00:26:12,"on divine revelation, feminine intuition,"
00:26:12,00:26:15,"a mumbo jumbo, jiggery pokery, coincidence,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,or acts of God.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"And also, you can't conceal clues from the reader."
00:26:19,00:26:21,"But you know, the Skull that you put your hand on,"
00:26:21,00:26:22,it's not Eric.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"They sexted it recently, and it's Erica."
00:26:25,00:26:27,- Oh! - Yeah.
00:26:27,00:26:29,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:26:29,00:26:32,"Can I, there's a guy called Ronald Knox, who I love."
00:26:32,00:26:34,"He's another, he was another clerical detective author,"
00:26:34,00:26:38,"actually, and he wrote these 10 Commandments"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"of Detective Fiction, which are quite fun."
00:26:40,00:26:43,"So one of them is, not more than one secret room"
00:26:43,00:26:46,or passage is allowed per detective story.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- That's fun. - And also,"
00:26:47,00:26:50,twin brothers and doubles generally must not appear
00:26:50,00:26:53,unless we have been duly prepared for them.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"- Wow. - Anyway, he did this really cool thing,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"Ronald Knox, as well as being the detective author."
00:26:58,00:27:00,"1926, he interrupted all broadcasts"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"on the one radio channel on the BBC,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,basically to announce that there was a riot in London.
00:27:04,00:27:06,It was a spoof.
00:27:06,00:27:07,People didn't realise it was a spoof.
00:27:07,00:27:09,And it was bloody terrifying.
00:27:09,00:27:11,"So it contained, he said things like,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"""The crowd has now passed along Whitehall"
00:27:13,00:27:16,"""and at the suggestion of Mr. Popplebury,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,"""Secretary of the National Movement"
00:27:17,00:27:19,"""for Abolishing Theatre Cues,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"""is preparing to demolish the houses of parliament"
00:27:21,00:27:22,"""with trench mortars."
00:27:22,00:27:24,"""The clock tower has just fallen to the ground,"
00:27:24,00:27:25,"""along with Big Ben."
00:27:25,00:27:28,"""The noise you just heard was the Savoy being blown up."""
00:27:28,00:27:29,(laughing)
00:27:29,00:27:32,So the awfulest gooch has been intercepted
00:27:32,00:27:33,by the remnants of the crowd
00:27:33,00:27:36,and has been roasted alive in Trafalgar Square as I speak.
00:27:36,00:27:37,And then it was snowing.
00:27:37,00:27:39,So no one could get the news for days.
00:27:39,00:27:42,"So the BBC just received thousands of letters saying,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,"""What's going on? Oh my God."""
00:27:44,00:27:49,- That's so funny. - We're going to have to move on very soon.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"I just want to quickly mention,"
00:27:51,00:27:54,"there's a thing that we wrote about in the Book of the Year,"
00:27:54,00:27:55,"which was, do you remember there's that story"
00:27:55,00:27:57,"that Benedict Cumberbatch,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,he was in an Uber with his wife
00:27:59,00:28:02,and suddenly he saw a robbery that was happening
00:28:02,00:28:03,outside on the road.
00:28:03,00:28:04,It was a Deliveroo driver
00:28:04,00:28:07,who was being attacked by some four muggers
00:28:07,00:28:09,who were trying to get to him.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"So he hopped out and he went,"
00:28:11,00:28:14,"""Ah!"" and sort of tried to stop it and it worked"
00:28:14,00:28:16,and they got away. - Classic show of move.
00:28:16,00:28:20,- But so he successfully scared away these muggers
00:28:20,00:28:21,and helped this Deliveroo person.
00:28:21,00:28:24,But the thing is that this robbery was happening
00:28:24,00:28:26,"on Marlborough and High Street,"
00:28:26,00:28:30,which is just down the road from Baker Street in London.
00:28:30,00:28:33,Can you imagine the robbers as they turned around
00:28:33,00:28:36,to see Sherlock Holmes
00:28:36,00:28:39,right next to where he should be looking around at them?
00:28:39,00:28:41,- You feel honoured.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"You'd say, ""Thank you."""
00:28:42,00:28:45,- I was just trying to mug a Deliveroo driver.
00:28:45,00:28:48,I'm not sure this is a Holmes-level crime.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"- I was just thinking that, like, you know,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,this guy was all about his railway time tables.
00:28:53,00:28:56,Like an Uber driver who would solve crimes
00:28:56,00:28:57,"would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?"
00:28:57,00:28:58,"- Yes. - Yeah, that would be really cool."
00:28:58,00:29:01,But is it based on the star rating that you have?
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- Yeah. - No, how could it be?"
00:29:03,00:29:04,- No. - Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- It could be like... - Three stars,"
00:29:05,00:29:06,"he drove a bit too fast,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,but he did solve the murder of my wife.
00:29:08,00:29:09,- So...
00:29:09,00:29:11,(LAUGHTER)
00:29:11,00:29:14,"- Just as OK, one tiny thing, which..."
00:29:14,00:29:18,"P.D. James, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant crime author,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,died only a few years ago.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"She was once doing a signing,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,"and an Australian woman came to the front of the queue,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"said her name was Emma Chizit, right?"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"P.D. James signed the book to Emma Chizit,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,only to realise this Australian woman
00:29:30,00:29:32,had been asking how much the book cost.
00:29:32,00:29:33,(LAUGHTER)
00:29:33,00:29:35,- Emma Chizit. Emma Chizit. - Emma Chizit.
00:29:35,00:29:37,(LAUGHTER)
00:29:37,00:29:44,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,and that is James.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"OK, my fact this week is that Himalayan chewing gum"
00:29:48,00:29:50,is made out of cheese.
00:29:50,00:29:53,- Mmm. - And there it is.
00:29:53,00:29:55,- Yeah. - It looks like sausages a little bit.
00:29:55,00:29:56,"- Yeah. - Or like ladies' fingers, maybe."
00:29:56,00:29:57,- Like baguettes.
00:29:57,00:30:00,- So in what sense is it chewing gum?
00:30:00,00:30:03,"- It's chewing gum in the sense that it's called Himalayan chewing gum,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,and that you chew it a lot.
00:30:05,00:30:08,It's the world's hardest cheese that we know of.
00:30:08,00:30:12,"It's called chirpy, and because it's so, so hard,"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"you put it in your mouth, and if you're like a yak farmer"
00:30:15,00:30:18,"or something, you're just having your daily yak farm,"
00:30:18,00:30:21,"then you put it in your mouth and you just chew it and chew it and chew it,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"and the saliva slowly makes it softer and softer and softer,"
00:30:24,00:30:27,"and it's hours and hours that you chew this stuff,"
00:30:27,00:30:28,"and eventually you can eat it,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,and so that's why they call it chewing gum.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"- It sounds nice, but it does sound unbelievably tough,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"as in there was a BBC journalist who tried it,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,and he chewed his piece for seven minutes.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"Seven minutes, didn't leave a scratch on it."
00:30:40,00:30:42,"- Yeah, it's really hard. - Wow."
00:30:42,00:30:44,"- I have had it, but I've not had the hard version,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,"I've had the soft version. - Oh, God."
00:30:46,00:30:49,- Do they ease you in on that?
00:30:49,00:30:53,"- Basically, this stuff, they've kind of dried it out for ages and ages."
00:30:53,00:30:55,"I think they put it in like an animal skin or something,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,"and dry it out for ages,"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"but if you have it early on before they do all that,"
00:30:59,00:31:03,"it's more like cottage cheese, like Georgian cheese,"
00:31:03,00:31:07,"and it's the national dish of Bhutan, it's called emadatzi,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"and that's the type that I had,"
00:31:09,00:31:13,"and it's basically really, really, really, really hot chilies"
00:31:13,00:31:17,"inside a bowl of this cheese, and it is delicious."
00:31:17,00:31:19,It's one of the best things I've ever had.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"And they don't usually let foreigners eat it,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,"because it's too spicy, that's what they say."
00:31:23,00:31:26,"- Oh, yeah, that's how they flutter every foreigner who walks in."
00:31:26,00:31:28,(LAUGHTER)
00:31:28,00:31:31,"- Well, you know, those British people can't handle this one."
00:31:31,00:31:32,- How so?
00:31:32,00:31:35,"- Right, it was in Bhutan's Nando's,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,and they put a very nice little flag on the top of it.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"- Did it have a lemon and a herb on it, is what I wanted to know."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"- But chirpy as well is sometimes used these days as a dog treat,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,because it's so chewy.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"I think even in America, I don't know if you can buy it here,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,but in America you can buy this cheesy dog treat
00:31:53,00:31:55,that they can just keep chewing on. - Right.
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- I read a very spurious sentence about it,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,"I thought, in one of the articles, which said,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"""Since it's rich in protein and fat,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"""it makes a great substitute for vegetables."""
00:32:03,00:32:05,(LAUGHTER)
00:32:05,00:32:10,"- I don't know, that's why we're eating our greens."
00:32:10,00:32:13,- Can I tell you about the Fight Club for Cheese?
00:32:13,00:32:15,"- No, you can't tell us about the Fight Club for Cheese."
00:32:15,00:32:17,- OK. - That's the whole point.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"- Oh, yeah, oh, shit."
00:32:18,00:32:20,(LAUGHTER)
00:32:20,00:32:23,- Damn it.
00:32:23,00:32:25,(APPLAUSE)
00:32:25,00:32:28,"- Yeah, it's the Cheese Munger International,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,"which happens in the USA, and it's..."
00:32:30,00:32:32,This was a description of the FT.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"""It involves 50 young cheese mungers"
00:32:34,00:32:35,"""pitting their skills against each other"
00:32:35,00:32:38,"""in a frenetic battle of curd-nerdery."""
00:32:38,00:32:40,(LAUGHTER)
00:32:40,00:32:42,"- That's just so cool. - It does sound fun, yeah."
00:32:42,00:32:44,"The charismatic founder, Adam Moskovitz,"
00:32:44,00:32:48,is called Mr. Moo and compares in a cow onesie.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"- Wow. - OK, a bit less cool now, it's cool."
00:32:51,00:32:52,(LAUGHTER)
00:32:52,00:32:55,- I wonder who's called him the charismatic founder.
00:32:55,00:32:57,Sounds like something on his own website.
00:32:57,00:32:59,Him and his onesie at the top.
00:32:59,00:33:02,"- You know, Baratta, the more delicious version of mozzarella?"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"- Um, yep. - I didn't really know what that was,"
00:33:05,00:33:08,"but it's... So it came about as a way of using up leftovers,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"and the way they did it, this was in the 1930s,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,"it's in Apulia, it's the only place you can make it."
00:33:14,00:33:16,"Cream would be scraped off the top of milk,"
00:33:16,00:33:18,"and it was usually chucked away,"
00:33:18,00:33:22,and instead they mixed it with stretched mozzarella curds
00:33:22,00:33:25,"to make that really creamy soupy inside,"
00:33:25,00:33:28,"and then they blew mozzarella into a bubble,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"so they got mozzarella, and they blew like a bubblegum bubble,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,"and then they stuffed this cream inside,"
00:33:33,00:33:35,"and this was just to preserve it,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,"so this meant that when you had like a day's journey to get to market,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,"then this apparently insulated it from the heat of the sun,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,"and meant that the cream and cheese didn't go off inside,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,"so when you prod that open, but I just love that they blew into it,"
00:33:46,00:33:49,"like a little, you know... - Yeah, that's incredible, yeah."
00:33:49,00:33:51,- Bubble. - Like a bubble.
00:33:51,00:33:55,- Don't make me that clear. - Liquid soupy stuff from cheese.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"This is an interesting new innovation that's happening around the world,"
00:33:58,00:34:00,and I wonder if it's going to take off in Wisconsin.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"They've been doing this, so they make a lot of cheese there,"
00:34:02,00:34:06,and they have a lot of master cheese makers there as well.
00:34:06,00:34:07,"So as a result of having a lot of cheese,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"they have a lot of excess brine that they need to get rid of,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"and what they do is they liquefy it,"
00:34:12,00:34:17,"and they pour it on the side of the roads during winter in place of salt,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,and it works way better than salt does.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"It's great for them, because they're getting rid of a lot of waste,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,and they're using it really efficiently.
00:34:24,00:34:26,- Does it not make the entire state smell of cheese?
00:34:26,00:34:28,"- It stinks like shit, yeah."
00:34:28,00:34:31,- I think a lot of Wisconsin smells of cheese already to give that.
00:34:31,00:34:33,- I could... OK.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"- But what's really interesting is, A, it's just a great way"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"of just recycling the materials in a good way,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"but also, this typical salt they would use on roads,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"that would freeze at six below zero,"
00:34:44,00:34:48,"whereas cheese doesn't freeze until 21 below zero,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,"so it's actually even just useful in the sense that the colder it gets,"
00:34:51,00:34:52,it's still useful.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"- But that's why you never get cheese ice cream, tragically."
00:34:55,00:34:57,"- Oh, really? - No."
00:34:57,00:35:00,(LAUGHTER)
00:35:00,00:35:05,"So, there was a big story, a big story in Germany last year,"
00:35:05,00:35:09,"and that was that someone was living above a cheese shop,"
00:35:09,00:35:14,"and she was very, very upset because her house smelled of cheese all the time."
00:35:14,00:35:19,"She said the smell of cheese was coming through her electrical sockets,"
00:35:19,00:35:24,and it went to court because she said that they should just stop selling cheese all the time.
00:35:24,00:35:28,"Basically, she was, like, putting signs up saying, ""This place stinks of cheese."""
00:35:28,00:35:31,"I was in a cheese-fucking-cheese shop, but she was putting that."
00:35:31,00:35:36,He said that she had been hiding cheese behind a fuse box to frame him.
00:35:36,00:35:38,(LAUGHTER)
00:35:38,00:35:42,"Anyway, so they found in favour of the cheese seller,"
00:35:42,00:35:45,"but he's decided, ""OK, I want to be a good neighbour,"
00:35:45,00:35:46,"""so I'm going to move away anyway."""
00:35:46,00:35:51,"But because of this story, no one will let him move into that shop anymore,"
00:35:51,00:35:55,and he's stuck in the place and she's stuck living above him.
00:35:55,00:35:57,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Isn't that bad?"
00:35:57,00:36:00,"Will you re-home, Mr Stinky Cheese seller?"
00:36:00,00:36:02,(LAUGHTER)
00:36:02,00:36:04,"We've got to wrap up in a sec, guys."
00:36:04,00:36:06,Anything before we do?
00:36:06,00:36:10,"St Hildegard of Bingen, who was friend of the podcast."
00:36:10,00:36:14,"Yeah, yes. Mystic from the 12th century."
00:36:14,00:36:17,"She always thought that all cheese should be dried,"
00:36:17,00:36:18,"and she really liked her cheese,"
00:36:18,00:36:22,but she also thought that cheese was...
00:36:22,00:36:25,Like cheese-making was how children was made.
00:36:25,00:36:29,"So she wrote that, ""At first, the semen inside the woman is milky,"
00:36:29,00:36:32,"""then it coagulates, then it becomes flesh,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"""and then it becomes the body."""
00:36:34,00:36:36,So it's cheese just halfway to becoming a human.
00:36:36,00:36:38,Is that what she's saying?
00:36:38,00:36:40,I guess it's what she's saying. It's terrifying.
00:36:40,00:36:42,"Wow, she was a wise woman,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,"but she did get some things wrong, didn't she, Hildegard?"
00:36:44,00:36:47,Her restaurant was a disaster.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"But there was a guy called Tertuion,"
00:36:49,00:36:52,who was a father from the 2nd and 3rd century.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"He was like a priest,"
00:36:54,00:36:57,and he thought that the birth of Jesus was a bit like this.
00:36:57,00:37:01,So Jesus had been born in a kind of cheesy way.
00:37:01,00:37:03,"So, like, away, yeah."
00:37:03,00:37:04,"So, like, the curds..."
00:37:04,00:37:05,"Away, away in a manger."
00:37:05,00:37:07,Away in a manger.
00:37:07,00:37:09,So the curds liked cheese.
00:37:09,00:37:13,(LAUGHTER)
00:37:13,00:37:16,The curds liked cheese.
00:37:16,00:37:21,"Jesus had grown, Jesus had grown into his shape."
00:37:21,00:37:24,And then he kind of got kicked out of the church
00:37:24,00:37:27,because of this crazy stuff that he grew up with.
00:37:27,00:37:30,"Well, he went to another sect called the Montanists,"
00:37:30,00:37:33,"and he kind of became really big in the Montanists,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,and they decided that as well as bread and wine
00:37:35,00:37:37,"and Holy Communion,"
00:37:37,00:37:39,you could also have a little bit of cheese with your wafer.
00:37:39,00:37:42,(LAUGHTER)
00:37:42,00:37:44,"Look, we need to wrap up, I'm afraid."
00:37:44,00:37:46,"OK, that is it. That is all of our facts."
