 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
 from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,200
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,800
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that in 1950s America,

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,320
 flight attendants consulted an alcohol chart of the sky so they knew when they were allowed to

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,600
 serve booze. Wow. Yeah. So is that because, it must be because some parts of America you can't drink,

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,320
 but does that mean Colorado goes all the way up to the top of the universe? Where does it end? Does

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,480
 the ISS, are they not allowed to drink their snuck up portions of booze that they hide? Yeah.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,160
 This is the 1950s where there were a lot of dry states in America, and that dry ban expanded

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,160
 all the way up to 30,000 feet into the air. I suppose it makes sense, because let's say you

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,920
 lived in a dry county, and you thought, well I'm gonna get out of this, I'm gonna hire a hot air

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
 balloon, and I'm just gonna float off the ground and drink a load of booze. It makes sense that

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,080
 they stopped that from happening. That would be my first thought. Exactly. But you used to be

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
 able to go off short, didn't you? That's true. And that's how people would get around it. But so

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
 this is the issue, is that obviously you're in a plane that's flying over multiple states. Do all

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,560
 laws apply above all this? You know there's like 12 weird laws, and it's like you're not allowed to

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,480
 kick a horse in a higher on a Sunday. And you're flying over in a plane, and you're like stop kicking

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,960
 that horse. Anyone intending to marry a second wife is now allowed for the next 30 minutes.

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,400
 Was it the case that you'd have to say quickly down it, we're about to hit Pennsylvania?

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,400
 Yeah, it's really odd. What I couldn't find was if it's the sale of alcohol, because they used to

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,120
 sell the alcohol on board there, or whether or not. So exactly, we're approaching Pennsylvania,

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,480
 quick everyone. And so, yes, skull, skull, skull. And the way that it was done is the flight attendants

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,240
 would look out the windows for monuments, so they'd be like, oh okay, we're coming up for that now.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,280
 What? Yeah, yeah, there was so many restrictions. How can you tell you're in Pennsylvania from the air?

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
 Well, just to say this, surely the pilot had a better way of knowing where they were going,

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,720
 the muttering down, saying look, there's a church that I recognize. Well, remember back in the 50s,

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,120
 with mail delivery, they just had big arrows on the ground. Concrete arrows. Yeah, to point that side.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
 Yeah, I don't know what it was like. Having been in a helicopter with my wife flying, it's only a

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,600
 small helicopter, so we don't have that much instruments and stuff. But you do, like you have

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,120
 a map and it's like, there's a golf course here and you're like, my wife's like, can you check

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
 there's a golf course on the left hand side? Yes, there is. Okay, we're going in the right

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,640
 direction. Yeah, unfortunately, you always get lost because you're only looking for the next golf course.

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,680
 But it wasn't just that. The attendant would have to know, is this state allowing drinking on a Sunday

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,920
 or an election day? What are the hour restrictions? Because sometimes they're just restricted for

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,960
 certain hours. So yeah, certain holidays that are being celebrated there, are we allowed to drink

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,320
 then or not? So question, yeah, there are still dry states in America. Why did they not do this

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,200
 anymore? I guess maybe they've realized. It was weird being an air stewardess in the 1950s, wasn't

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,880
 it? Sorry, the fact that I paused at air stewardess does remind me how weird it also is that I still

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,600
 think of air stewardess as the terminology, even though it stopped being the term in the 70s.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 Yeah, before you were born, in fact. Way before I was born. Wait, I just want to emphasize way

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 before I was born. Does everyone else do that? I cycle through them in my head, you know.

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,520
 Like hostess, stewardess, trolley dolly. I actually don't even think trolley dolly anymore,

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,680
 I'd like to point out. It's so woke, Andy. I think we can call them flight attendants, can we?

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,480
 Well, it was weird being a flight attendant in the 1950s and it was explicitly just for women.

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,520
 I hadn't quite realized how all flights in America, pretty much all airlines, stated men need not

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,640
 apply, to the extent that there was a completely transformative lawsuit in 1971, which was brought

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,720
 by a man who wanted to be a flight attendant, a guy called Celio Diaz, and they had a witness

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,560
 for the airline, who was a guy called Eric Byrne, a psychiatrist, and he testified that

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
 a flight attendant who was male would make passengers really uncomfortable. And he said,

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,280
 you know, because you'll be effeminate. And he said it'll make male passengers uneasy,

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
 as it might arouse feelings in him, he would rather not have aroused.

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
 Oh, there are definitely some states in America that you won't be able to do that.

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,960
 How interesting. And we've said before, I think, that the reason that they were women to start off

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,800
 with is because they were nurses. Yeah, Ellen Church was, she wanted to become a pilot. They

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,960
 said you can't. She made a case of saying, what if then you need a nurse on board? And while I'm

58
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,920
 there, I can serve some drinks, I can, I can refuel the plane, just like a nurse. But her biggest

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,080
 argument, I think, was that she said, if you have a woman on board, you're not going to have scared

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,400
 passengers because the men will be too afraid to admit that they're scared when there's a woman

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,000
 who's not scared on board. That was her pitch. And I think before that it was children, basically,

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
 right? It was teenagers. Yeah. And again, it's like, you know, if the teenager's not scared,

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,920
 then we probably won't be scared. That's good logic. I think that would work for me.

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,080
 Teenagers famously have no sense of risk. They have absolutely no clue whether something is

65
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
 harmful or dangerous behaviour. That's true. Maybe it's more like the protective instinct.

66
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,120
 You can't show you're afraid in front of a teenager because you're the grown up in the room.

67
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,040
 To be honest, one of the main reasons they were teenagers is because teenagers were a bit smaller

68
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,560
 than adults. I'm talking now about the 1920s. There was an airline called Daimler Airway,

69
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,400
 which went from Manchester to London in a biplane, which could carry nine passengers.

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,040
 But this was a route you could take. And they had these cabin boys whose job was to hand out hot

71
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,320
 water bottles and earplugs and reassure you during the flight saying, don't worry, it's supposed to

72
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,680
 be falling apart. It's the only days of flying. In 50 years, if it makes you feel better, this

73
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,760
 will be totally safe. I should just finish what I was saying about the guy who brought the lawsuit

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,920
 to say that in 1971, four years after he brought it, it was ruled that airlines could not discriminate

75
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,920
 against men. And it obviously also was a very homophobic thing. So we think of the fight

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,520
 tendons rules as being sexist, but it was also really homophobic. The idea was that these men

77
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,880
 would be effeminate and there'd be arousing homosexual feelings in other men that they didn't

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,080
 want to have. And in 1971, you weren't allowed to do that. Sadly, this poor guy who brought the

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,040
 lawsuit was at that point too old to become an air steward. Oh, so it was Aegis as well.

80
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,600
 It was Aegis and he'd hit 35, yes. And women, we should also specify, were employed at first as

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,440
 nurses. But the reason that they employed only women after that was because they were fair

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
 and they wanted the male passengers to be attracted to them. It was. And it's really

83
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,560
 interesting. Like until 1978 in America, if you took a plane from, let's say, Detroit to Chicago,

84
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,640
 you had to charge a certain amount, no matter what. Do you mean ticket price, sorry?

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,520
 Ticket price, yeah. Right. Exactly. So it was all dependent on the route and it was not dependent

86
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,920
 on anything else. And so you had to attract customers. So what would you do? You would

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,640
 make it really attractive. So you would have like piano bars on your plane. You would have

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,240
 fillet stakes on your menu. You would have very attractive cabin crew, stuff like that.

89
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,320
 And then in 1978, they increased competition, complete race to the bottom, cheaper the better.

90
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,640
 They got rid of all the frills, no more pianos on planes, no more fillet steak,

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,000
 hideous stuff at every turn, unbelievably ugly stuff. But what it meant was the race to the

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,840
 bottom meant that a lot of companies went out of business. So you had much fewer companies

93
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,720
 who are running those routes. And it meant that the cabin crew had less sort of chance to move

94
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,000
 between different jobs. Right. Anyway, that's my rant against capitalism. Please enjoy my next

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,800
 TED talk. So you just want posh fillet stakes on your first class flights? First class for everyone.

96
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,840
 Yeah. I remember I was on a flight coming back from Dubai and we were going through the craziest

97
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,840
 turbulence I've ever felt. You guys know I'm a nervous flyer. So that was, I was petrified.

98
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,680
 Were you? Yeah. And someone started screaming in the back, screaming. And it screamed, it kind of-

99
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,600
 Was that the echo of your own screaming? We were traveling so fast, sound couldn't keep up with it.

100
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,240
 Yeah. No, this guy was yelling and he was yelling quite a few scary words. And so we were like,

101
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,680
 oh my God, is this like a, is this a bombing? Is it a hijacking? Poltergeist!

102
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,880
 Loneliness. Yeah. And so everyone's terrified. Everyone's really scared, but clearly the people

103
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
 know what's going on. And suddenly flight attendants were all running to the back. Now it turns out it

104
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
 was a medical emergency. Right. But my last thought that I always think about this, my last thought

105
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,280
 that had the plane had blown up in that moment was that I watched a chef run back and all I could

106
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,160
 think was they have chefs up front. That's incredible. That was my final thought. How did

107
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,840
 you know was he a chef? How do you know he was a chef? He had a giant white hat. He saw what was

108
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:29,200
 going on with Mum, Mum here. A huge long mustache. Yeah, yeah. Flipping a pancake as he ran. He was

109
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,120
 slicing some tribes at the big knife in midair as he went. Incredible. They don't have chefs on

110
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,840
 planes. Yes, they do. Chef is the, that's a perfect disguise. He fooled you absolutely. He was an

111
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,080
 air marshal, but all air marshals these days stress as chefs. First class they have chefs. They do.

112
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,000
 Can I tell you about an incident that happened? This is not a flight I was on, but it is in the

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,320
 great list of air rage incidents on Wikipedia. In 1995, a group of 18 British and Irish tourists

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,040
 got rowdy on a flight from London to Minneapolis. They started sending their children to steal

115
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,920
 food and drink from the flight attendants' carts. So causing trouble. What they didn't know is that

116
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,880
 several wrestlers from the US Olympic freestyle wrestling team were also on board the flight.

117
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,520
 And did they take part or is it like a doctor? They're not allowed to intervene in situations

118
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,360
 otherwise they're liable. I can't do a triple suplex on this child. He is my son.

119
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,520
 Yeah, they did know they piled in and they helped restrain the rowdy.

120
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,080
 Every 30 seconds, he's getting out the train table.

121
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,040
 Wait, doctors aren't allowed to intervene? No, they are.

122
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,040
 Is there a doctor on board? Yes, great. Can you stay where you are?

123
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,080
 Can literally anyone else perform surgery? At TMCBR. I mean, I don't know the details,

124
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,200
 but there's a thing where if you intervene, you feel like you are liable or you could be liable

125
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
 for something. So obviously they do because they can save someone's life, but then if something

126
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
 goes wrong, then suddenly they're wearing their doctor's hat. Yeah, because they're not wearing

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,240
 their chef's hat. I was looking at some famous flight attendants. Kate Middleton's mum, Carol.

128
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,520
 Carol Middleton. Yeah, I'd say famous. Oh, there was snobbery about her, wasn't there?

129
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,160
 Strawberry. Snobbery. She always keeps a strawberry about a person.

130
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,320
 There was snobbery because they called her doors to manual or something, which is what you say

131
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,240
 when the plane lands, don't you think? I didn't know about that, yeah. Johanna Sigurthardotir,

132
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,880
 who was Prime Minister of Iceland from 2009 to 2013, and the country's first female PM and the

133
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,760
 first openly LGBTQ head of government. She was a flight attendant. Marina Machete, who was the

134
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,120
 first transgender winner of Miss Portugal. Marina Machete. It's such a great name, isn't it?

135
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
 You'd be too scared to take her on. Another one I was reading about was the first female

136
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:59,440
 steward in the Soviet Union called Elsa Garodetskaya, and she flew from Moscow to Ashkabat in Turkmenistan,

137
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,720
 and it took 13 hours. And if you went by train, it would take 129 hours and 30 minutes.

138
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,360
 So the flights were really important in the Soviet Union because these places are so far apart.

139
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,480
 And the best version of this I found was in Kazakhstan, there was a flight from Almaty to

140
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,520
 Balcash, okay, and it was a two-hour flight, but if you wanted to go by train, it would take 157

141
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:31,280
 hours because there was no direct train between the two cities. So you had to go from Kazakhstan,

142
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,000
 from Almaty, all the way up to Novosibirsk in Siberia, and all the way back down again,

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,560
 and it would take about a week. And we regret to announce there's a five-minute delay to today's

144
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,720
 journey. Wow. Some flight attendant codes, a bit of language, so do you know what they say if they

145
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,040
 find you attractive? No, and nor do you, and they be honest. As in they say it to you directly?

146
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,800
 No, so it's one of these silly little sort of things that gets put into click-baity articles

147
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,400
 online. I'm going back in there already. No, so right, you can either say "Bob" about someone.

148
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,600
 How would you say it? Like, what's the context? Best on board. Yeah, exactly.

149
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,000
 When do you sort of shout "Bob" up the plane? Why do you need a code?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,960
 You must be saying to your fellow attendants, "Oh, there's a Bob in World 13 CB."

151
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:30,400
 Or, as people get off the plane, you say "Cheerio" to them instead of "Goodbye,"

152
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,960
 or "Thank you for flying with us," or whatever. There'll be a word that you say, you know.

153
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,280
 That's interesting. Toodaloo, or something.

154
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,680
 Don't take this as gospel and humiliate yourself in front of just a perfectly

155
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
 polite vice-attendant. It's not my sweet.

156
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,920
 Cheerio. You just grab them like that guy at the end of World War II.

157
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,120
 I have a favourite flight attendant story, a story of honey traps, very topical.

158
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,920
 In the 1960s, the KGB was trying to blackmail the Indonesian president,

159
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,040
 the guy called Ahmad Sukarno. And the way that the KGB blackmailed him was that they had their

160
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,640
 agents on one of his flights, a private flight, disguise themselves as flight attendants and,

161
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,520
 you know, serve him drinks and stuff and look sexy. And they flirted with him to the extent

162
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,080
 that eventually he invited them to his hotel room when he landed. And they had a big old orgy,

163
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,640
 not knowing that the Soviets had hidden a camera behind the mirror in the room and filmed the

164
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,720
 entire orgy. And then, later on, the Soviets called him to a private cinema and gave him a

165
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,960
 private showing of himself having an orgy with these flight attendants who were in fact agents.

166
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,640
 And so, do you know what he did?

167
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
 Had a wink.

168
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:48,400
 Bad news, there's another camera in the cinema. He's filming that.

169
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,080
 And he just kept happening again and again.

170
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,480
 He's still there? That didn't happen. But he did ask for more copies that he could take home

171
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
 to his homeland because he said the people would love him for it.

172
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
 That's very... I mean, that is funny.

173
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,600
 Completely backfired.

174
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:15,040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

175
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,920
 My fact this week is that a team of ecologists have been studying the health of the oceans

176
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,000
 by dissecting leftover tins of fish from the 1980s.

177
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
 All these fish are dead!

178
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,760
 Yeah, it's quite... It's quite a roundabout way of doing it.

179
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,520
 It seems like half of the ocean was made of brine, but the other half was made out of

180
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,040
 olive oil. What about the spicy tomato sauce? That was Mediterranean.

181
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,280
 So what? Yeah, what's that?

182
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,920
 Well, this is really ingenious. It's actually been published now.

183
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,640
 It's a paper in the Ecology and Evolution Journal, and it's research done by Chelsea Wood

184
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,600
 and Natalie Mastic, who were looking into the health of marine mammals specifically.

185
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,080
 So there's quite a few links in this chain.

186
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,520
 They were looking at seals and whales and how their health had been over time.

187
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,120
 But to do that, they wanted to know what parasites have been in the ocean,

188
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,880
 because parasites get into salmon and cause disease in salmon,

189
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,960
 and then seals and whales eat salmon.

190
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,800
 And then you know what kind of diseases seals and whales would have been getting,

191
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,960
 because these parasites will give them certain diseases.

192
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,600
 So how did they find out what parasites were in the ocean 40 years ago?

193
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
 Well, they didn't know, and then suddenly out of the blue,

194
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
 they got a call from a seafood products association in Seattle,

195
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,400
 saying they were cleaning out their basement, had loads of long expired tins of salmon.

196
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,840
 Did she want them?

197
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,440
 And she said, that's actually a great idea. Yeah, let's do it.

198
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,320
 Does it work?

199
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,400
 It worked. There were tins of tins of salmon.

200
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,360
 So can I just say, so this was 40 years ago, so just before you were born, Anna?

201
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
 Just ages before I was born, yeah.

202
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,080
 Ages before you were born.

203
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,040
 But does that mean that anyone eating salmon 40 years ago might have had parasites in their salmon?

204
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,680
 None of the parasites, when they opened the cans were alive,

205
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,080
 nor they'd been alive once they'd been canned.

206
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,920
 So they'd burrow into salmon's muscle.

207
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
 They're right inside these muscle pockets,

208
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
 and they said they could pick through the tinned muscle tissue with forceps,

209
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,680
 and see the worms like spring out of their muscles.

210
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,520
 What? That's disgusting.

211
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,240
 It's so disgusting.

212
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,920
 So if I eat salmon, that's not happening today, is it?

213
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,120
 Yeah, you've got what?

214
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
 Yeah, a magnifying glass on it.

215
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,280
 Salmon do have a lot of problems with, especially the farmed ones,

216
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,080
 because they're in such a tight proximity to each other.

217
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,440
 Sorry, I'm really putting you off here.

218
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,960
 But they're so close that they get more, obviously they get more lice.

219
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
 Yeah, I know of that, but I've never seen worms in salmon.

220
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,160
 Yeah, they're there.

221
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,800
 You've got to maybe get a magnifying glass to them.

222
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,160
 Don't put a magnifying glass on anything.

223
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,280
 It's the basic rule of food.

224
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
 It's just that you're so off-put by whatever you see.

225
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,640
 You're right.

226
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,040
 So the cans ranged from expired cans from 1979 to 2021,

227
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,680
 and they were literally able to plot the health can by can year by year.

228
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
 The parasite thing, I just found that really interesting.

229
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,120
 I don't fully understand the science of it,

230
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,160
 but basically the parasite in order to reproduce,

231
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,840
 it needed to be eaten by something.

232
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,720
 That then is eaten.

233
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
 So it's eaten by krill.

234
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
 The krill is then eaten by salmon.

235
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,800
 The salmon is then eaten by a marine mammal.

236
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
 And once it gets to the mammal,

237
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
 that's when it can reproduce and put its stuff back out.

238
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,200
 And the cycle starts again.

239
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,520
 So are you saying that these parasites don't survive

240
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,880
 unless they end up in a mammal?

241
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,600
 Yeah, exactly.

242
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,560
 They can't reproduce.

243
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,000
 It's like the old woman who swallows a fly,

244
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,040
 but at the end, a giant fly bursts out of the horse.

245
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
 It's sort of that disgusting.

246
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
 I wouldn't make such an appealing children's book, but yeah.

247
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,040
 Canned din food.

248
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,120
 We have briefly mentioned Nicholas Appere,

249
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,160
 who discovered it.

250
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,920
 There was a big competition in France

251
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,440
 to find a way of preserving food

252
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
 so that Napoleon could basically feed his armies overseas

253
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
 and at long distances.

254
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
 And it took 15 years and he won it.

255
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,160
 What we didn't say, I love this.

256
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
 He originally used ceramic container sealed with cork,

257
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,920
 but he's basically the father of canned food.

258
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,200
 The process was called, he was called Nicholas Appere.

259
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
 It was called Appertising.

260
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,520
 Spooky.

261
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,400
 That is good.

262
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,040
 It's appetising.

263
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,160
 It's good branding.

264
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,800
 Yeah.

265
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 Is it a pun or is that there's no correlation?

266
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,840
 No, it's one work in French.

267
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,400
 Yeah, exactly.

268
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
 His name is Appere and it's appetising.

269
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,360
 An accidental pun.

270
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,240
 Isn't that mad?

271
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,040
 Wow.

272
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,240
 Let's type.

273
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
 He was so convinced about his work.

274
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,640
 He published a book about it in 1810.

275
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
 He was so confident about it.

276
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
 He attached a small note to every copy with his address on it

277
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
 so you could turn up at his house.

278
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
 That's a great idea.

279
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
 Andy, have you considered that for your novel

280
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
 for anyone who doesn't like it?

281
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,040
 Yeah, absolutely.

282
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,080
 I will do anything.

283
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,600
 But his thing didn't really work that well, did it?

284
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,240
 Oh, it did look.

285
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
 No, all the jars exploded.

286
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,000
 Some of the jars, come on.

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,040
 They didn't well explode.

288
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,600
 Yeah, no.

289
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,320
 What happens is you heat up the food

290
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 so that it kills all the bacteria and stuff.

291
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
 But if you don't do it well enough,

292
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,880
 the bacteria will create gases

293
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,640
 and the gases will get more and more and more

294
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,920
 and eventually bang.

295
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,720
 Right.

296
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
 Quite exciting opening the pantry, isn't it, every day?

297
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,440
 You had to wear face masks.

298
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,320
 I quite like that the original tins were champagne bottles.

299
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,720
 Because the first thing that he can stuff in

300
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
 was empty champagne bottles.

301
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,880
 Really?

302
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,520
 Yeah.

303
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
 And there were champagne bottles corked with cheese.

304
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,840
 What a disgusting image of the cork pops.

305
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
 It's just this foaming cheese.

306
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,240
 Are you joking?

307
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
 Like, it's cheese and wine together at last.

308
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,600
 Yeah.

309
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 Only a French inventor would have come up

310
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,480
 with the empty champagne bottles of the cheese.

311
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
 How the hell do you shove a whole duck into a champagne bottle?

312
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
 Well, I'm delighted that you've asked.

313
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
 He found this a bit of a problem at first.

314
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
 And he found, surprisingly enough,

315
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
 they weren't wide enough to fit a lot of foods in them.

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
 But he doctored them so that they cut off the top

317
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
 so that it widened the neck.

318
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
 And then, yeah, stuffed it with cheese and lime

319
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
 wrapped in cloth to cork it.

320
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,800
 I assume it's lime as in the stone.

321
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,600
 Quick lime.

322
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
 Yeah, quick lime as opposed to--

323
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
 Not to squeeze of lime, just to squeeze.

324
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,960
 But then it was a guy called Philip de Gérard

325
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
 who came up with the tin can,

326
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
 which is closer to what we have today.

327
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
 He was also French,

328
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
 but he actually sold it to the British.

329
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,560
 He gave the patent to a guy called Peter Durand.

330
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,680
 And Peter Durand--

331
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,280
 Who also sounds French, do you?

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,960
 Yes, he does.

333
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,800
 Yeah, but he was Durand.

334
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,280
 Yeah.

335
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,600
 Durand.

336
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,080
 There you go.

337
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,080
 And basically became part of the British army,

338
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,600
 then started using the tins.

339
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,120
 And actually, at the Battle of Waterloo,

340
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
 the British army had loads of these French tins,

341
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,160
 which must have seemed a bit off to the French.

342
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,880
 It's so weird that he was the front man, Peter Durand,

343
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
 because he was completely the front man.

344
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,360
 He did not come up with the idea.

345
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
 And it was also that Gérard could get his thing through.

346
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,720
 One reason, because the English didn't trust the French.

347
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,520
 So if a Frenchman came over with these tins of food

348
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
 and said, "Hey, everyone, buy these,"

349
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
 no one would believe him because he was French.

350
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
 Yeah, yeah.

351
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,400
 So he needed someone with a French-sounding name.

352
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,880
 But then Durand sold the patent after a couple of years

353
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,120
 to a man who I think we've mentioned it once before,

354
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
 Brian Duncan.

355
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,680
 That is a solid English name, isn't it?

356
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,640
 Brian Duncan.

357
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,920
 You don't get more English than that.

358
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,840
 God, I've had a throwback to like 10 years

359
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
 of you constantly going, "Donk, donk, donk, donk."

360
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,280
 What was that?

361
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
 Well, that was just an old music style donk.

362
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
 Yeah, donk.

363
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
 Do you not remember that?

364
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,960
 James had always mentioned that.

365
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
 It's honestly like 10 years ago.

366
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,520
 It was like a northern music style where it was like dance

367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
 music, but it would be like, "Donk, donk, donk, donk,

368
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,320
 put a donk on it."

369
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,400
 You take a normal tune and you put a donk on it.

370
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
 It's like a remix.

371
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,560
 But I once got Stephen Fry to say,

372
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 "Put a donk on it on QI as part of a bet."

373
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,440
 That's it.

374
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,400
 Yeah.

375
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
 Did he also invent the music, Brian Duncan,

376
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,040
 or was he just the front man for that?

377
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,840
 Duncan invented the donk, and he made it big on that.

378
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,440
 No, so he was an amazing engineer.

379
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
 It's from Northumbria.

380
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
 He was a metalworker.

381
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
 He had a paper-making machine business.

382
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
 He patented the first steel pen,

383
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,840
 and then he starts making corned beef in his preservatory.

384
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,280
 He's just a legend this guy.

385
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
 And then in 1813, he presented his beef to the Duke of Kent,

386
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,040
 not a euphemism.

387
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,440
 He got a letter back from Four Royals saying the Queen herself

388
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
 had tasted and enjoyed his canned beef again,

389
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
 and he got the patent.

390
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
 And he's so popular.

391
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,160
 He was so popular.

392
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,000
 There is a cove in Chile, which is called Catela Donkin,

393
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,880
 because the crew had loved their Donkin-tinned meat so much.

394
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
 We already have Donkin statues now,

395
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
 and maybe there are some in Northumbria,

396
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,680
 but I've never-- like, he should be a national hero.

397
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
 And he's completely forgotten.

398
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
 There was an amazing BBC article.

399
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
 It was really, really a long one about his life and canned food,

400
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,040
 but Donkin is a huge part of it.

401
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,600
 He's buried in Nunhead Cemetery, which is in South London,

402
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,920
 and his name is a footnote beneath three other guys

403
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,760
 all called Brian Duncan, who--

404
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
 Who are related to him?

405
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,440
 Who are related to him?

406
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
 He's put all the random Donkins in one place.

407
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
 It's a mass Donkin grave, wasn't it?

408
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,920
 It was called Donkin Donkins.

409
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,280
 There's one angry guy trying to kill Brian Duncan,

410
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,520
 got it wrong three times, finally got it right.

411
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,000
 I know.

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,600
 He did do lots of other stuff, didn't he?

413
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
 He worked with Brunel, Brunel's son, on the Thames Tunnel.

414
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
 He worked on Charles Babbage's computer.

415
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
 He was multi-talented.

416
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,440
 And as John Nutting of the Cannes--

417
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,680
 It's just a great name.

418
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,000
 John Nutting, editor of the Cannes Maker magazine.

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,480
 Never go to the cinema alone with John Nutting.

420
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,200
 Wait, why not?

421
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 It's euphemism for masturbating.

422
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,720
 Right, I just thought it was headbutting someone.

423
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,760
 So I think that could have led to all sorts of confusion

424
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,240
 in my life.

425
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,200
 Anyway, he's editor of the Cannes Maker magazine.

426
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,040
 Either way, we'll get you kicked out of a weather spoon

427
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,840
 for the Friday night.

428
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,120
 The double nutting, that's why you're getting arrested.

429
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,640
 He's just a big fan of Duncan, Duncan and Nutting.

430
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,600
 He said, lamented that he's forgotten by the wider world,

431
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
 which I always think when people say,

432
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
 "Can we believe he's lost to history?"

433
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,560
 I can believe it.

434
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,240
 I agree he's done an important thing.

435
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
 He's come up with sort of tin canning

436
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
 or like commercialized the process.

437
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,360
 What do you expect for that to be a household name?

438
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,160
 200 years later?

439
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,120
 No, no, no.

440
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,400
 I mean, it's been sad truth.

441
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
 Well, anyway, nice to dust off the donk.

442
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,080
 There's a really old fact on QI

443
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
 that it took 50 years after the invention of the Cannes

444
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,960
 to invent the Cannes.

445
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

446
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 I'm sure we've said that before on this show as well.

447
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,920
 I didn't realize that there are actually

448
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,520
 really good reasons for that.

449
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
 Firstly, the first process,

450
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
 there were only six Cannes made an hour.

451
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
 So, you know, there wasn't the mass market.

452
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,040
 If you invent a tin opener,

453
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
 they're going to open them quicker than you can make them.

454
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,680
 Exactly.

455
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,840
 It's not worth it.

456
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
 And secondly, they were made of wrought iron

457
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,640
 and lined with tin.

458
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,360
 They were thick.

459
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,560
 No modern Cannes opener would have possibly

460
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,000
 been able to crack into this.

461
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
 What was the method back then to get into them?

462
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
 Just chisel, hammer and chisel.

463
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
 I mean, very few, in my experience,

464
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,520
 very few modern Cannes openers can open modern Cannes.

465
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,440
 So, modern ones are steel and they're incredibly thin.

466
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,080
 But the original ones were just so thick.

467
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,640
 I love this.

468
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,240
 In 1860s America, shop grocery clerks

469
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,880
 would open your cans for you to take home.

470
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,360
 Yeah.

471
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,720
 They would open it in the shop.

472
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,560
 You would have your cans open for you.

473
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,440
 That's quite nice.

474
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,800
 Actually, I quite like that with jars.

475
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,840
 Like a jar of pickles, just go to the person

476
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,800
 who's scattered in the street.

477
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,120
 Well, you wouldn't mind losing in the bar, would you say?

478
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,360
 Slowly walking back along the high street.

479
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
 Imagine you're in the queue.

480
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
 Like, there's always so many different reasons

481
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,040
 that it's going to take ages at the counter

482
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,000
 when someone's in front of you

483
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,160
 and you just see the person who's scanning all the stuff

484
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,760
 heads off to get a chisel and a hammer.

485
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,480
 And you're like, oh, shit, cashier off the cashier.

486
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,520
 Jimmy with the big wrists is trying to open your cans for you.

487
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,720
 Jimmy big wrists.

488
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
 Jimmy nutting.

489
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,360
 I found out about an invention in canopening

490
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
 that I didn't know about, and it was almost 100 years ago.

491
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,040
 Wow.

492
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,240
 So just before you were born.

493
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,960
 So she was before I was born.

494
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
 So the electric canopener.

495
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,920
 Did you guys know this was a thing?

496
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,400
 Was it my room?

497
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
 I own one.

498
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
 Why have I been struggling away

499
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,040
 with these coffee plastic things?

500
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,880
 This is no exaggeration.

501
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,360
 My electric can opener is probably the best thing

502
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,320
 I've ever bought.

503
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,200
 Wow.

504
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
 I think it's a genius thing.

505
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,360
 You just put it on, you press a button,

506
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,400
 and then it opens the can.

507
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,520
 That's so good.

508
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
 Invented in 1931.

509
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,080
 Why didn't they all have them by 1932?

510
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
 Why don't I have one today?

511
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 I mean, it sounds like they are readily available to buy.

512
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,240
 They are.

513
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
 You could just go to a shop and buy them.

514
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,640
 Well, we don't all have James's secret sources.

515
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,760
 You guys heard it here first.

516
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,960
 I've actually never heard one.

517
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,840
 And it does sound like a...

518
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
 I mean, James has given it at the hard sale.

519
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
 Genuinely, I would say it is one of my favorite items

520
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,160
 in my entire house.

521
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,360
 Wow.

522
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
 Including his wife and child.

523
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,160
 The only thing that obviously puts them out of business

524
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,040
 a little bit at the moment is those ring pull tins

525
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,200
 that you get, like a lot of them are ring pull.

526
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
 So I will deliberately buy tins

527
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
 that don't have the ring pull on,

528
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,720
 so I can use my tin opener.

529
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,840
 In the aftertimes, once the food's run out

530
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,920
 and everyone has used up all the ring pull cans,

531
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
 you're going to be the king.

532
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
 Exactly, until the batteries run out.

533
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,360
 Oh, yeah, then your stuff.

534
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

535
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
 A glorious two and a half weeks.

536
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,680
 I will be the king of the world.

537
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,840
 Does it have a manual setting?

538
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,160
 Like, can you do it if the batteries run out?

539
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,680
 Yeah, if the batteries run out, you're knackered.

540
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,240
 Wow.

541
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,280
 Um, yeah.

542
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,520
 You should just pull all the rings off your cans

543
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,080
 when you buy them.

544
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,520
 Yeah, I do ask the person in the shop to do that for me.

545
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,920
 Funny.

546
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,080
 Yeah, electric can open it.

547
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,200
 Is it big?

548
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,560
 Does it have to sit on the counter?

549
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,120
 Or is it not?

550
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,560
 No, it's this big.

551
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,200
 If it was solar-

552
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,760
 It's a bit chunky.

553
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
 If it was solar-powered, you could have permanent-

554
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,800
 Yeah, it's not.

555
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,720
 Yeah, it's not, I'm not, I'm afraid.

556
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,400
 It's probably not very good for the environment.

557
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,000
 But I find them so useful.

558
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,480
 Yeah, that is good.

559
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
 I think that's not a big cost for the environment, frankly.

560
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,680
 I've got, but I've got solar on my roof.

561
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
 So if you come round,

562
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
 we could form a power couple in the aftertimes.

563
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,520
 The original power couple, the opposite of the original.

564
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,600
 The post-apocalyptic power couple.

565
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
 He can harness the sun.

566
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,040
 He can open your tins.

567
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,080
 Right, you're sort of giving yourself the main part in that, aren't you?

568
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:10,720
 And Dan and Anna will find some jobs for you, you know?

569
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,440
 I'm good, thanks.

570
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,920
 Cansardines.

571
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,800
 This is a nice thing.

572
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,600
 I didn't know this.

573
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,280
 They have their own kind of connoisseurs

574
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,400
 and vintage years.

575
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,920
 No.

576
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,480
 Oh, wow.

577
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,040
 If you buy an expensive can of sardines,

578
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,080
 you might prefer to get a 2004 vintage

579
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
 compared to a 2008 vintage.

580
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
 That's incredible, right?

581
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,960
 Are there people at the restaurant who send them back?

582
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,400
 So this is a 1993.

583
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,800
 Ask specifically for the '97.

584
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,520
 This is corks.

585
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,240
 This is tinned.

586
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,480
 It's absolutely amazing.

587
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,640
 So there are like companies like,

588
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,440
 who I'd never heard of,

589
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,960
 like Rodel and Connoitabla in France.

590
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
 And they sell these sardines.

591
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,440
 And the thing is, apparently sardines get better

592
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,640
 the longer they're in the can,

593
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,440
 up to a certain number of years.

594
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,840
 But what happens is the flesh becomes much smoother

595
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,720
 and more tender and the bones eventually kind of disappear,

596
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
 the tiny bones that you get in your sardines.

597
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,320
 Eventually it just becomes a mush of sardine.

598
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
 And that's the absolute best time to buy them.

599
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,360
 And you get people who just buy them

600
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,040
 and then just keep them for 10 years

601
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,800
 until they're exactly the right moment

602
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,160
 and then they'll eat the sardines.

603
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
 Again, that'll be funny for the prepping.

604
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,920
 Don't have that.

605
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,000
 Exactly when the nuclear war happened.

606
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,800
 Yeah, exactly.

607
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,560
 We need to keep that another seven years.

608
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,640
 And apparently you have to flip the tins every six months.

609
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,440
 Like a mattress.

610
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,560
 Like a mattress.

611
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,840
 Just, I don't know,

612
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,480
 I think it's so that the oil or whatever

613
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,400
 gets nicely distributed and doesn't settle.

614
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,440
 This is really interesting, James,

615
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,600
 because my mum went to Portugal last year

616
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
 and she brought back tinned,

617
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
 because Portugal, they're obsessed with canned fish, aren't they?

618
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,440
 And they have these really beautiful tins.

619
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,000
 And she brought back cans for each of her children,

620
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,040
 of which I am one,

621
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,960
 with our year of birth written on them.

622
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,440
 Really?

623
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,720
 And mine just said 1986.

624
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,160
 And I just thought that's a nice design

625
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,760
 and cracked into it and had it on toast.

626
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,800
 But I suspect that was actually a 1986 vintage.

627
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,520
 Did it taste better than any other sardines you'd ever eaten?

628
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,920
 It was sort of full of crawling maggots.

629
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,000
 But aside from that, it was actually delicious, yeah.

630
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Did you just, as we know, your mum would go,

631
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,880
 "Oh, what?

632
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,680
 "Crawling maggots?

633
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,600
 "We used to eat those every single week."

634
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,200
 Exactly, it's a delicacy.

635
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,720
 Also, did you just slip in your birth year

636
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
 to prove that you're not 100 years old?

637
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,360
 God damn it, cut that out, edit it out.

638
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:34,400
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

639
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,800
 Okay, my fact this week is that German writer

640
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,440
 Christoph Friedrich Nicolai treated his visions of ghosts

641
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,080
 by applying leeches to his anus.

642
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,240
 Really built that fight, doesn't it?

643
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,160
 Did it work?

644
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,200
 Yeah.

645
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,080
 How's it worked?

646
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,120
 Okay, come on.

647
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,160
 Explain yourself.

648
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,120
 So, he had previously suffered from something

649
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,800
 that he called a violent giddiness.

650
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,360
 And he was treated by leeches.

651
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,440
 And he was kept having these treatments.

652
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
 And then one time he missed his treatment,

653
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,560
 and he started seeing what he thought was ghosts.

654
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,960
 He said, "I observed at a distance of 10 paces

655
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
 "the figure of a deceased person.

656
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
 "I asked my wife whether she saw it.

657
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,360
 "She saw nothing, but being much alarmed

658
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,480
 "sent for the physician."

659
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,160
 Okay, and so then what he did was, he decided,

660
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,400
 he was a bit of a skeptic, a bit of a scientist,

661
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,560
 so he decided he would not take any more leeches for a while,

662
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,920
 put up with the ghosts, and then after a while,

663
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,880
 he would try the leeches and see if it got rid of the ghosts.

664
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,280
 And sure enough, a bit later he presented

665
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,400
 is what he called his memoir on the appearance of spectres

666
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,800
 or phantoms occasioned by disease

667
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,040
 to the Berlin Academy of Sciences.

668
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,640
 And he said that he applied the leeches to the anus,

669
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
 and they went away, the ghosts.

670
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
 And he concluded that the ghosts originated

671
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
 in my internal consciousness alone,

672
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,920
 a consciousness that was disordered.

673
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,880
 So, he was kind of disproving the ghosts existed

674
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,400
 by saying there was a physical treatment for these ghosts,

675
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
 and that means there's no such thing as a ghost,

676
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,040
 it was all in my head.

677
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,600
 Yeah.

678
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,560
 And was there a reason he had to apply it to his anus?

679
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,920
 Why his anus?

680
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,080
 I think it was an easy way to get up blood.

681
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,520
 It's easy access, isn't it?

682
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,240
 It is, yeah.

683
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
 It's sort of easy access.

684
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
 I think your hand is even easier access.

685
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,800
 No, a leech is better than your hand,

686
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,120
 for getting blood out of your anus.

687
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,400
 I believe that there was like a relatively common place

688
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
 to put leeches back in the day.

689
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,960
 Well, King George III used to put them on his temples

690
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,800
 when he was suffering from his bouts of depression and so on.

691
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
 So, when was this guy?

692
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,200
 When was this paper?

693
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,160
 Sorry, I should say who Christoph Friedrich Nicolai was.

694
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,000
 So, this problem that he had was in 1799.

695
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,600
 He was German, he was around at the same time

696
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,560
 as lots of other German writers that you would know,

697
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,600
 such as Goethe, and in fact he had a...

698
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,680
 You've listed all the German writers I would know.

699
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
 I might come to some more.

700
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,240
 So, he had a big argument with Goethe, actually.

701
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,320
 So, Goethe wrote a book called The Sorrows of Jungwurther,

702
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,840
 which we have mentioned before,

703
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,280
 which was about a depressed young man,

704
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,600
 and actually a lot of people copied this young man

705
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,840
 and dressed like him and committed suicide and so on.

706
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,200
 So, it was like a real massive, massive deal in Germany.

707
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,560
 And Nicolai wrote The Joys of Jungwurther,

708
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,400
 which was kind of a slam on the sorrows of Jungwurther.

709
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,000
 And then Goethe, in response, composed a poem

710
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,760
 where Nicolai stood next to Wurther's grave and defecates on it.

711
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,440
 And he also put him in Faust.

712
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,520
 Not one of his most famous works, was it?

713
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
 Faust is one of his...

714
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,920
 It sure is, yeah, there's very little defecating in Faust, is there?

715
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,160
 There isn't, but there is a character called the Proctofantasmist,

716
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,240
 who was actually Nicolai in disguise who put leeches on his bum.

717
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,720
 And in Faust, Goethe says he is about to sit down in a puddle.

718
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,480
 That's the way his soul acts.

719
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
 And when leeches feast on his rump,

720
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,800
 he is cured of ghosts and ghouls.

721
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,760
 Wow.

722
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
 I mean, it must have been a big deal at the time.

723
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,960
 He's made it into that.

724
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,520
 That's not the only work of fiction that he's made it into.

725
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,800
 He also was in a story called Mrs. Zant and the Ghost,

726
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,360
 which was written by friend of the podcast, Wilkie Collins.

727
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,160
 Really?

728
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,880
 Yeah.

729
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
 And so, and in reference to the hallucinations and so on.

730
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,080
 So, it must have been the talk of the town.

731
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,320
 Yeah, ETA Hoffman wrote about him.

732
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,760
 Schlegel wrote about him.

733
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,880
 Not Schlegel.

734
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,160
 Schlegel, you know Schlegel.

735
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,040
 I've heard the name.

736
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,640
 You know him from the philosopher's song.

737
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,560
 That's literally what I was about to say.

738
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
 I was saying Monty Python's.

739
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
 Yeah, he's just as drunk as Schlegel.

740
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,800
 But yeah, Schlegel was a linguist,

741
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,200
 basically, who's a philosopher as well and stuff.

742
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,000
 ETA Hoffman wrote the Nutcracker, I think.

743
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,960
 Oh, wow.

744
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,600
 That's big news.

745
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,080
 So, you know, they are big names who were,

746
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,000
 as well as writing all these big things,

747
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,080
 also writing about this guy's rectum.

748
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,720
 Yeah, yeah.

749
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
 And Tchaikovsky wrote the music to the Nutcracker.

750
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:02,720
 Yeah, yeah.

751
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,240
 But he wrote the story.

752
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,360
 Well, Schlegel actually wrote,

753
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
 in response to the Nutcracker,

754
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,560
 he wrote The Can Opener,

755
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
 which is a very beautiful...

756
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,160
 So, it was huge leeches for thousands of years, wasn't it?

757
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,560
 You hear about old treatments that come and go,

758
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,920
 but leeches just came about 2,500 years ago

759
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,640
 and then stuck around until the 19th century,

760
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,400
 when finally they went out of fashion,

761
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,240
 because it was thought to be unscientific,

762
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,920
 and then came back into fashion.

763
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,840
 But the way you treat people with leeches is,

764
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,400
 they, you attach them to someone and they make you bleed.

765
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,640
 Their saliva has an anticoagulant in it,

766
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,960
 and they also put a chemical into you

767
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,120
 that widens up your blood vessels,

768
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,800
 and they put an anesthetic into you.

769
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,160
 They're great surgeons.

770
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,560
 I think I can drink about a thumb full of,

771
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,120
 or a thumb's size of blood, you know, from an area.

772
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,200
 Yeah, they can drink five times more than their own body size,

773
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,240
 I think, which is a lot.

774
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,440
 But you don't normally leech to death,

775
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,160
 unless the doctors have put dozens of leeches on you,

776
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,040
 which is pretty rare.

777
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,560
 You're definitely not going to leech to death.

778
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,480
 No, it'll just be like an annoying little pinprick

779
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,760
 in your finger for a day.

780
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,600
 I've sometimes had to like a blood sample

781
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,520
 from my fingers at home,

782
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,880
 and you get these little sort of pinprick things, don't you?

783
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,200
 Yeah.

784
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
 And I just can't get them to work.

785
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,920
 Really?

786
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,520
 Yeah, last time I had to do it, they gave me two,

787
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
 and I couldn't get it to work,

788
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,600
 and so I had to go and buy some more.

789
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,320
 But you could only buy them from the pharmacist

790
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,400
 in boxes of 500.

791
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,000
 So I now have about 495 of these at home,

792
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
 which I literally, if anyone wants to buy them, I'll think.

793
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,000
 Well, in the aftertimes, those will probably come in handy,

794
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
 those will be a way for you to test the faith of the elect.

795
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,200
 You could probably gradually open a can

796
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,760
 with one of those actually, because you're an online battery.

797
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
 Have you used 20 of them?

798
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,160
 Have you heard of the Birmingham Leech Centre?

799
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
 No.

800
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,520
 This is run by Bridget Croft, who is a nurse,

801
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,480
 and she is the only nurse in the UK

802
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,200
 who is qualified to do private leaching.

803
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,480
 So everyone else is, all the other leaching is on the NHS,

804
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,600
 and it's to repair joints and after microsurgery

805
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,040
 and help blood vessels heal.

806
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,920
 She does it privately, and she says,

807
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,520
 in some areas of Eastern Europe,

808
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,000
 it is looked on in the same way as going to a spa.

809
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,080
 What is she using it for, though,

810
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,720
 because it's not for sewing fingers back on?

811
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,800
 No, so that would be on the NHS or whatever.

812
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,680
 This is pain relief, gout, baldness, all sorts of stuff.

813
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
 Oh, so is this stuff that doesn't work?

814
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,280
 Because it doesn't work for those things.

815
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,120
 I don't know about baldness.

816
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,480
 Is it just that people see you from a distance

817
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,080
 with all the leeches on your head?

818
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,320
 I think, oh, he's got a full head of hair.

819
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,120
 That's two pays moving around the world, isn't it?

820
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,160
 It works from across a dimly lit bar,

821
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,280
 but up close, the results do fall off.

822
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,160
 I mean, that does sound like old school leech work to me.

823
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,720
 It does, yeah.

824
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,880
 Whereas modern leech work is quite specifically

825
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,920
 for the getting body parts back on, isn't it?

826
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
 Leeches, they share something in common with tinned salmon,

827
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,680
 which is then now being used to tell us about the environment.

828
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,040
 So in China, they took 700 terrestrial leeches

829
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,560
 that they found, all the same species,

830
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,360
 and they are going and taking the blood out of them

831
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,440
 and diagnosing what animal it was taken from.

832
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,520
 A question, sorry, that's when I interrupt.

833
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,000
 Terrestrial leech, is that something that's not an alien?

834
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,200
 You have to listen to Dan's other podcast

835
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,280
 to find out about terrestrial leeches.

836
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,680
 And the ones that you won't find in the water of bogs and stuff,

837
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,480
 they're land-based.

838
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,920
 Land-based, that's cool.

839
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,640
 That's all you do?

840
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,520
 That's me guessing.

841
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,360
 Yeah, so some of them feed on deer, for example.

842
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,360
 The story of how they came back into use is a pretty amazing one.

843
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 I actually listened to a podcast on leeches,

844
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,520
 an episode of Sideways, which I love, by the way,

845
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,040
 you should listen to it, Matthew Side.

846
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,680
 And he was talking about this story.

847
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,200
 So in 1985, there's a four-year-old called Guy Condelli,

848
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,120
 whose ear is bitten off by his grandparents dog.

849
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,080
 And as the surgeon remembers it,

850
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,240
 the surgeon Joe Upton remembers it,

851
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,320
 the ear arrived in the emergency room

852
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,240
 half an hour before the boy.

853
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
 So I don't know what kind of thing happened there.

854
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,800
 I said, we're going to reattach you to the boy.

855
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,520
 So they've got this here.

856
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,560
 They've got this boy.

857
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,480
 And they can repair the arteries fine.

858
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,000
 This is where leeches come in so useful.

859
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,200
 It's for vein repair.

860
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
 Because as Joe Upton described it,

861
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,120
 to try and sew veins back on,

862
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,520
 imagine sewing wet toilet paper together.

863
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
 They're so floppy, they just keep flopping,

864
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,040
 and they kept on reattaching the ear,

865
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,760
 and it kept on going purple and black as it filled with blood,

866
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,840
 because the veins couldn't carry it away.

867
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,480
 Old Upton, he'd read about leeches as a treatment.

868
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
 And he tracked down the Welsh biopharma place

869
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,200
 where they bred them for use in pharmaceuticals,

870
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,840
 so they hadn't been used actually the way they are now.

871
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,920
 And he got some scent to him.

872
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
 And this is a completely new idea.

873
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,880
 He's just thought, you know what,

874
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,120
 let's attach a leech to this guy's ear and see if it works.

875
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,120
 That's amazing.

876
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,920
 So amazing.

877
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
 And he just about gets the leeches out in time

878
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,040
 and says literally as soon as he puts them on this boy's ear,

879
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,240
 the ear goes from black to a lovely pink ear colour,

880
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,480
 as the leech basically repairs the veins,

881
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,720
 or it allows the blood to flow through the veins.

882
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,000
 It widens the veins.

883
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
 It means that the blood can flow freely,

884
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
 which gives them chance to repair themselves.

885
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
 The body's very good at repairing itself.

886
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,760
 It just needed a rest.

887
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,800
 The ear just needed a rest.

888
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,000
 So apparently now these days,

889
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,960
 if you have finger or ear or penis surgery,

890
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,640
 what they'll do is for the 10 days afterwards,

891
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
 you keep getting a leech just put onto the place

892
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,760
 that needs repairing.

893
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,920
 So over the 10 days, that's how they fix it.

894
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,720
 Oh, yeah.

895
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,400
 That's just incredible.

896
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,960
 Yeah, they are.

897
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,920
 They're amazing.

898
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,200
 Have you heard of the B-dale leech house?

899
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,840
 This is in North Yorkshire.

900
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,720
 I know, B-dale.

901
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,280
 Yeah.

902
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,240
 So Yorkshire, and it's a little building,

903
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,480
 but it looks like a miniature fortress

904
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
 because it's got crenellations on the top,

905
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,680
 or castellations, you know.

906
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,640
 So it looks like a castle.

907
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,200
 Yeah, yeah.

908
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,760
 I love that you just corrected crenellations to castellations,

909
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,960
 and I think people appreciate that.

910
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,840
 It's just absolutely just...

911
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,760
 Because people will have been listening to it and gone,

912
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,360
 "Oh, I don't know what a crenellation is."

913
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,600
 And then you started to repeat yourself.

914
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,800
 They'll have gone, "Oh, thank God."

915
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,960
 He's repeating himself and telling me what it is.

916
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,200
 And then you said an even more skill word.

917
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,920
 Like these bits.

918
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,360
 I've just drawn them from the back there.

919
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,400
 Yeah, these kind of things.

920
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,760
 Look at all that more crenellation is.

921
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,880
 I thought that was a crenellation,

922
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,680
 not a castellation in that.

923
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
 That's what I thought as well.

924
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,560
 I'm not sure it's the form,

925
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,680
 but it's definitely the latter.

926
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,320
 I don't know.

927
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,760
 So I think we've got distracted from the fact

928
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,680
 this is a house built for leeches.

929
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,560
 So they would be kept in there

930
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
 because to collect leeches for the market,

931
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,760
 you collect them from the wild,

932
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,800
 you collect them from rivers,

933
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,160
 and from bogs and swamps,

934
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,120
 and you normally just walk through barefoot,

935
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,960
 and you come out and you've got a load of leeches on you,

936
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,240
 and that's the leech collector's job.

937
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,040
 And then you take them to the leech house

938
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,080
 and drop them off there.

939
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,120
 So they'd be kept alive,

940
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,080
 and then there's a sort of staging post for them.

941
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,120
 And this is the last leech house in the UK,

942
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,840
 and it's still there,

943
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,760
 and it's got a stream diverted to run through it.

944
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
 It's on the banks of a little beck.

945
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,440
 It doesn't still house leeches, does it?

946
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
 It doesn't still house leeches,

947
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,960
 but it had a fire to keep them warm in winter,

948
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,000
 and it had...

949
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,320
 There were special containers of moist turf and moss

950
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,200
 for the leeches to live in.

951
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,000
 Oh, here we go.

952
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,320
 How'd I find this bag?

953
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,200
 She went search.

954
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,760
 It's amazing how Andy searches on Google for moss leeches,

955
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,280
 and Dan searches for extraterrestrial leeches,

956
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,920
 and he goes, "Did you mean terrestrial leeches?"

957
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,840
 Ah, I didn't, but okay, yes, what is it?

958
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:35,920
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,

959
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,600
 and that is Andy.

960
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,680
 My fact is that in some American states and cities

961
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,560
 in the late 80s,

962
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,400
 children could be sent to prison for six months

963
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,640
 for the crime of owning a pager.

964
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,320
 What's a pager, Granddad?

965
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,040
 I don't know, Anna, you're 100 years old.

966
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,360
 So, this is from a great...

967
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,440
 A swimmer newsletter called "Pessimists Archive"

968
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,240
 by Louis Anslow.

969
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,280
 It's a brilliant article,

970
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
 and it was all about how there was this panic about pagers,

971
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,960
 which are electronic devices.

972
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,800
 Can you tell us a bit more about them?

973
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,240
 Yeah, you can do very, very primitive texting

974
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,600
 on advanced models.

975
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,200
 In the early ones, you just got a beep,

976
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,560
 and you knew that you had to do something

977
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,120
 in response to the beep.

978
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,880
 So, like a doctor might have them,

979
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,920
 it would beep, and they're like,

980
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,280
 "I have to go to the hospital."

981
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,600
 Exactly, that.

982
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,440
 But then later, they would be able to send you

983
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,160
 like a couple of words or numbers or something.

984
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,480
 You wouldn't be able to send a message back.

985
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,920
 It's purely receiving.

986
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
 To send the message, someone had to pick up a phone,

987
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,280
 call a number,

988
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,160
 and kind of direct your pager to be beeped.

989
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,200
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

990
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,120
 So, there were all these headlines in the '80s

991
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,280
 about these powering the drug trade.

992
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,960
 Maybe youths who own pagers are getting paged,

993
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,600
 and they're going to pick up the drugs or whatever.

994
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,320
 And they probably were useful for drug dealers, to be honest.

995
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,800
 Yeah, exactly.

996
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,080
 But it probably wasn't most pagers in schools

997
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,120
 being used to pick up cocaine.

998
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,840
 I think what it was is that most drug dealers

999
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,960
 did use pagers,

1000
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,200
 but not most pagers were used by drug dealers.

1001
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,880
 Exactly that, it's exactly that.

1002
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,680
 That wasn't necessarily what the right-wing press thought.

1003
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,320
 No.

1004
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,440
 And so, New Jersey banned them for under 18s

1005
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,600
 on the pain of six months in Choke,

1006
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,320
 which is such a long time for owning a pager.

1007
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,520
 Michigan did the same,

1008
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,720
 and thousands of young people were arrested and suspended

1009
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,400
 and handcuffed and things.

1010
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,520
 I couldn't find anyone who was sent to prison for that.

1011
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,880
 But in one year alone,

1012
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
 there were a thousand arrests in Chicago schools

1013
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,000
 solely for owning pagers, arrests.

1014
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,080
 Because your fact, it kind of reads like one of those,

1015
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,760
 like, there's a law in Mississippi

1016
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,920
 that you can't let your horse open your can.

1017
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,000
 You're saying, "You're flying over New Jersey,

1018
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,600
 everyone put your pagers away."

1019
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,280
 But then, as you say, 700 school kids were arrested in 1994.

1020
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,520
 And weird kids, because if they're not dealing drugs,

1021
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,720
 which as we say, some of them were,

1022
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,560
 but if they're not, they're just losers.

1023
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,720
 Because I'm going to associate owning a pager

1024
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,800
 with, like, nerdy businessmen.

1025
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
 What I associated with actually is Ross and Friends,

1026
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,840
 who famously has one in series one.

1027
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,960
 Oh, does he?

1028
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,200
 And so, what kind of kid owns a pager?

1029
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,960
 In the 80s, they were so cool.

1030
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,920
 They were so cool.

1031
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,040
 Oh, were they cool in the 80s?

1032
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,360
 Because drug dealers use them, right?

1033
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,120
 And because your parents hated them,

1034
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,040
 and because politicians hated them,

1035
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,000
 to have one was the ultimate status symbol.

1036
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,520
 James is speaking, as if.

1037
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,160
 I was alive.

1038
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,880
 You were desperate for a pager.

1039
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,640
 Yeah, this is in America.

1040
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,080
 It wasn't in the UK as far as I could remember/read.

1041
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,840
 But basically, the reason they were good

1042
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,600
 for drug dealers is before you had them,

1043
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,280
 if you wanted to get in contact with someone

1044
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,560
 to buy your drugs, you had to give them

1045
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,520
 your landline number.

1046
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,360
 And now you're giving them,

1047
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,720
 effectively, a mobile number,

1048
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,120
 so the cops wouldn't know where you are.

1049
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,160
 But because they became associated with the bad guy,

1050
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,400
 kids were wearing them round their necks,

1051
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,760
 as like a status symbol.

1052
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,320
 Wow.

1053
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,680
 And they were so cool,

1054
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,000
 there was a market for fake pagers.

1055
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,800
 So you could buy a cheaper pager

1056
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,400
 that didn't do anything, didn't send,

1057
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,120
 or anything like that,

1058
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,480
 but you would just wear it around your neck

1059
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,600
 and say, "Look, I've got a pager."

1060
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,640
 When it wasn't real.

1061
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,320
 Would you occasionally have to say "beep"

1062
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,280
 to make people think you're getting a mouse, my dealer?

1063
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1064
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,640
 But I read an article that was written

1065
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,720
 in 1977 about pagers,

1066
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,800
 just talking about how awesome they were.

1067
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,320
 They would say that if you were in a queue

1068
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,520
 for a restaurant,

1069
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,400
 and the Matredease saw a pager on your belt,

1070
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,560
 you would be able to go up the line.

1071
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,720
 There's stories of parties

1072
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,240
 where the hostess of a party,

1073
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,760
 and this was in Washington,

1074
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,080
 became nervous that she hadn't invited

1075
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,160
 the best people in her social group there,

1076
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,000
 because she couldn't hear the beep of pagers

1077
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,280
 at her party.

1078
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,320
 "These pagers are fakes!"

1079
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,880
 Well, what then became even cooler

1080
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,040
 than the beeping pager was the wiggler,

1081
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,000
 and the wiggler was the one that doesn't beep out loud,

1082
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,400
 but like a phone on silent vibrates.

1083
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,480
 So she thought, "Okay, maybe if that's not beeping,

1084
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,080
 it's because I've got the extra cool new kicks here."

1085
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,560
 "I've got the wiggles."

1086
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,440
 "I've got the wigglers."

1087
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,000
 Yeah.

1088
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,400
 It is interesting how transformative that is.

1089
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,200
 Just what you said, James,

1090
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,360
 about it going from a landline to a mobile,

1091
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,200
 people communicating in new ways

1092
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,280
 that cannot be tracked as easily.

1093
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,880
 Yeah, maybe a huge difference.

1094
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,040
 And then I read one article in 1993

1095
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,000
 that was talking about the drug business using pagers.

1096
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,600
 They interviewed a cop, and they said,

1097
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,320
 "Now we're finding dealers with flip phones.

1098
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,000
 Maybe that will be the next rage."

1099
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,360
 Maybe.

1100
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:09,840
 Wow.

1101
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,880
 Who's to say?

1102
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,560
 Which we probably should say.

1103
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,320
 Pagers are still in use.

1104
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,480
 Well, they were until a couple of years ago.

1105
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
 No, well, there's this old factoid about,

1106
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
 the NHS is the only place where you still get

1107
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,160
 faxes and pagers used.

1108
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,400
 They were slated to be phased out in 2021, but--

1109
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
 Matt Hancock said that was going to happen, didn't they?

1110
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,680
 Matt Hancock.

1111
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,800
 And if you're outside the UK

1112
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,480
 and you don't know who Matt Hancock is,

1113
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,440
 good for you.

1114
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,960
 And still, I think about 80,000 being used in the NHS

1115
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,160
 as of last summer.

1116
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,640
 Because they still kind of work.

1118
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,520
 Yeah, really.

1119
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,400
 And if you're in a hospital

1120
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,120
 and there's no reception in a room, it's useful.

1121
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,120
 And it is, obviously, it's used for the doctors

1122
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,440
 who are in rooms where there's incredibly thick walls

1123
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
 because of x-ray and all sorts of...

1124
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,600
 All that stuff is what they're basically fighting

1125
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,800
 further than a mobile signal.

1126
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,280
 So it's--

1127
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,520
 Add a lot of NHS stuff, deal a crack.

1128
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:06,160
 But we're also using pagers in ways

1129
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,200
 that we don't realize.

1130
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,160
 All of us.

1131
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:08,640
 All of us have had--

1132
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,280
 What's that?

1133
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,320
 All of us have had, probably, our hands on a pager

1134
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,520
 and not known it in the last few months.

1135
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,400
 This thing got my bottom up.

1136
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,120
 Keeps on floating.

1137
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,640
 Anytime you go to a restaurant

1138
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,840
 and you order up at the bar

1139
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,120
 and they give you an item

1140
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,880
 that says when this buzzes, come back.

1141
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,080
 That's when your meal is ready.

1142
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,960
 That's a pager.

1143
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,280
 No.

1144
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,560
 Yeah, that's pager technology.

1145
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,680
 Just using a different form.

1146
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,360
 I have one of those that I hang around my neck.

1147
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,640
 And you get a beep on it

1148
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,160
 and it lets you know that your cans have been opened.

1149
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,880
 Do you know what they stopped doing?

1150
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,880
 Because they've been around for decades, actually.

1151
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,400
 I think they've stopped doing this.

1152
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,440
 Although I've never tested it,

1153
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,360
 they obviously have a range that you can't go out of.

1154
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,520
 And they used to shout at you.

1155
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,160
 So pagers often used to speak instead of beeping.

1156
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,320
 And if you went more than 100 feet away, they'd shout,

1157
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,080
 "You are out of range."

1158
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,080
 So it was just so embarrassing

1159
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,240
 if you go and try and sneak into the shop next door.

1160
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,600
 Actually, just a normal one.

1161
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,120
 I can't say this is true of all of them,

1162
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,880
 but they have a range of about half a mile.

1163
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,640
 So that's quite long.

1164
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,840
 That means in most restaurants,

1165
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,280
 you could just go to the pub.

1166
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,800
 Near as pub, in London anyway.

1167
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,760
 That's around the middle of nowhere.

1168
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,880
 So sometimes pagers would have a thing

1169
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,040
 in the '70s, '80s, '90s,

1170
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,760
 where if you wanted to contact someone on their pager,

1171
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,880
 you would call a number

1172
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,080
 and you'd get through to a switchboard.

1173
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,720
 And you'd say, "Can you contact this pager?"

1174
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,840
 And it's from this number.

1175
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,160
 And then the person would send a message to the pager,

1176
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
 and they'd have a series of messages that they could send.

1177
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,680
 So if you were the wife calling,

1178
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,440
 the message would be programmed to come up,

1179
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,240
 "Call your wife."

1180
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,000
 Or if you were work calling, it would be,

1181
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,720
 "Go to the office."

1182
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,920
 Or if you're a doctor, it would be,

1183
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,960
 "Go to the hospital."

1184
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
 Which is also your work.

1185
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,200
 Yeah, so you don't need those two messages

1186
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,320
 if you are a doctor.

1187
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,960
 But if you're not, you know, useful.

1188
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,600
 Anyway, it was reading a really good article

1189
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,000
 in The New York Times from 1976.

1190
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,880
 Which is talking about the pros and cons of pagers.

1191
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,240
 And it does say,

1192
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,800
 "The problem is almost every beeper wearer

1193
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,560
 has a story to tell of the beeper going off

1194
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,680
 at the wrong time."

1195
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,120
 And this is an issue with them.

1196
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,600
 So for instance, a salesman we spoke to

1197
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,400
 said that one evening,

1198
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,240
 he was having a very pleasant conversation

1199
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,200
 with a young woman.

1200
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,440
 And just when he felt that he was making an impression

1201
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,640
 and he was getting somewhere,

1202
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,400
 his pager blared out,

1203
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,440
 "Call your wife."

1204
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,280
 Honestly, what a nightmare.

1205
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,360
 The pager is definitely the bad guy in this article.

1206
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,120
 And they did actually speak to an answering service

1207
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,680
 in New Orleans,

1208
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,920
 one of the interchange services,

1209
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,480
 which said,

1210
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,280
 "We have 1,400 pagers in our system

1211
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,840
 and not a single one when the wife calls

1212
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,000
 asks them to say the message, "Call your wife."

1213
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,800
 They all said,

1214
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,200
 "I'd like the message, "Call your answering service."

1215
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,280
 Please, to come up."

1216
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,840
 Or just, you know, go to work.

1217
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,000
 Every man thinks there might be a situation

1218
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,080
 where I don't want the message to come up,

1219
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,040
 "Call your wife."

1220
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,000
 That is outrageous.

1221
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,800
 That is men.

1222
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,320
 Answering service.

1223
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,800
 It's such an awful euphemism for life.

1224
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,120
 So I think of myself.

1225
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,400
 Have you guys heard of gaydar?

1226
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,240
 Heard of it?

1227
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,680
 Yes, I have.

1228
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,360
 The idea that gay people can tell whether other people are gay.

1229
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,800
 Yeah, but in 1999,

1230
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,400
 someone invented a device

1231
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,600
 which has been described as a kind of electronic pager,

1232
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,840
 which was called gaydar.

1233
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,240
 And what it would be was for guys

1234
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,480
 who were walking through big parks

1235
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,800
 and if they saw someone that looked good looking

1236
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,160
 and they didn't want to embarrass themselves

1237
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,040
 by hitting on them,

1238
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,440
 they would have their gaydar go off

1239
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,280
 because they had a gaydar as well.

1240
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,760
 What?

1241
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,080
 Yeah, yeah.

1242
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,840
 So it was an electronic device that you kept on you.

1243
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,040
 Well, what if I'm with my wife?

1244
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,040
 What's that coming from your ass, Andy?

1245
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,800
 Yeah, so they invented it.

1246
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,760
 And this guy called Graham Lees was one of the inventors.

1247
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,760
 And so he went to test it out in a park

1248
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,200
 and he walked through the park.

1249
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
 And unfortunately, they discovered quite quickly...

1250
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,080
 No one else had one.

1251
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,320
 Buzzing around the park, crying.

1252
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,400
 Well, I assume there must have been someone else

1253
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,440
 that was in the park.

1254
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,960
 And he didn't know they were testing it.

1255
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,600
 Unfortunately, they hadn't fully tested out the frequencies

1256
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,120
 and it was at the wrong frequency.

1257
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,640
 So instead of spotting someone else

1258
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,320
 who was wearing one of the gaydars,

1259
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,560
 he was suddenly chased by a horny badger.

1260
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,240
 There was squirrels.

1261
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
 There were squirrels that were coming after him.

1262
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:16,800
 What?

1263
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,240
 He then, as he was running away from them...

1264
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,440
 Sorry, no badger.

1265
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,320
 Has ever hornily chased a person with a vibrating tail?

1266
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,920
 We all have vibrating phones now.

1267
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,360
 We've all been chased by badgers every day.

1268
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,480
 The frequency is a specific frequency.

1269
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
 There's a love note for badgers, is what you'll say.

1270
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,040
 Exactly.

1271
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,280
 He set off car alarms as he walked by

1272
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,440
 because the frequency just met a certain tone

1273
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,400
 that made them erupt.

1274
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,080
 It's the one special frequency

1275
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,160
 that works for all cars and all badgers.

1276
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,640
 Yeah, badgers, squirrels and car alarms.

1277
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,080
 No, you all can come back to your car.

1278
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,200
 There's a badger humping it.

1279
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,320
 No arms going up.

1280
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,760
 OK, that's it.

1281
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,720
 That is all of our facts.

1282
