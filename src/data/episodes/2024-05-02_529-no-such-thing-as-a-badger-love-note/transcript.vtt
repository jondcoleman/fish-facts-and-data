 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480
 from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.200
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that in 1950s America,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 flight attendants consulted an alcohol chart of the sky so they knew when they were allowed to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.600
 serve booze. Wow. Yeah. So is that because, it must be because some parts of America you can't drink,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 but does that mean Colorado goes all the way up to the top of the universe? Where does it end? Does

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.480
 the ISS, are they not allowed to drink their snuck up portions of booze that they hide? Yeah.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.160
 This is the 1950s where there were a lot of dry states in America, and that dry ban expanded

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
 all the way up to 30,000 feet into the air. I suppose it makes sense, because let's say you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.920
 lived in a dry county, and you thought, well I'm gonna get out of this, I'm gonna hire a hot air

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 balloon, and I'm just gonna float off the ground and drink a load of booze. It makes sense that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.080
 they stopped that from happening. That would be my first thought. Exactly. But you used to be

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 able to go off short, didn't you? That's true. And that's how people would get around it. But so

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.920
 this is the issue, is that obviously you're in a plane that's flying over multiple states. Do all

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560
 laws apply above all this? You know there's like 12 weird laws, and it's like you're not allowed to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.480
 kick a horse in a higher on a Sunday. And you're flying over in a plane, and you're like stop kicking

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.960
 that horse. Anyone intending to marry a second wife is now allowed for the next 30 minutes.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.400
 Was it the case that you'd have to say quickly down it, we're about to hit Pennsylvania?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 Yeah, it's really odd. What I couldn't find was if it's the sale of alcohol, because they used to

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.120
 sell the alcohol on board there, or whether or not. So exactly, we're approaching Pennsylvania,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.480
 quick everyone. And so, yes, skull, skull, skull. And the way that it was done is the flight attendants

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.240
 would look out the windows for monuments, so they'd be like, oh okay, we're coming up for that now.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.280
 What? Yeah, yeah, there was so many restrictions. How can you tell you're in Pennsylvania from the air?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.080
 Well, just to say this, surely the pilot had a better way of knowing where they were going,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.720
 the muttering down, saying look, there's a church that I recognize. Well, remember back in the 50s,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.120
 with mail delivery, they just had big arrows on the ground. Concrete arrows. Yeah, to point that side.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.120
 Yeah, I don't know what it was like. Having been in a helicopter with my wife flying, it's only a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.600
 small helicopter, so we don't have that much instruments and stuff. But you do, like you have

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.120
 a map and it's like, there's a golf course here and you're like, my wife's like, can you check

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.400
 there's a golf course on the left hand side? Yes, there is. Okay, we're going in the right

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.640
 direction. Yeah, unfortunately, you always get lost because you're only looking for the next golf course.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.680
 But it wasn't just that. The attendant would have to know, is this state allowing drinking on a Sunday

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.920
 or an election day? What are the hour restrictions? Because sometimes they're just restricted for

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.960
 certain hours. So yeah, certain holidays that are being celebrated there, are we allowed to drink

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.320
 then or not? So question, yeah, there are still dry states in America. Why did they not do this

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:27.200
 anymore? I guess maybe they've realized. It was weird being an air stewardess in the 1950s, wasn't

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.880
 it? Sorry, the fact that I paused at air stewardess does remind me how weird it also is that I still

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.600
 think of air stewardess as the terminology, even though it stopped being the term in the 70s.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 Yeah, before you were born, in fact. Way before I was born. Wait, I just want to emphasize way

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 before I was born. Does everyone else do that? I cycle through them in my head, you know.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.520
 Like hostess, stewardess, trolley dolly. I actually don't even think trolley dolly anymore,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.680
 I'd like to point out. It's so woke, Andy. I think we can call them flight attendants, can we?

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 Well, it was weird being a flight attendant in the 1950s and it was explicitly just for women.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.520
 I hadn't quite realized how all flights in America, pretty much all airlines, stated men need not

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.640
 apply, to the extent that there was a completely transformative lawsuit in 1971, which was brought

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.720
 by a man who wanted to be a flight attendant, a guy called Celio Diaz, and they had a witness

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.560
 for the airline, who was a guy called Eric Byrne, a psychiatrist, and he testified that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.000
 a flight attendant who was male would make passengers really uncomfortable. And he said,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.280
 you know, because you'll be effeminate. And he said it'll make male passengers uneasy,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.280
 as it might arouse feelings in him, he would rather not have aroused.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.880
 Oh, there are definitely some states in America that you won't be able to do that.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 How interesting. And we've said before, I think, that the reason that they were women to start off

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.800
 with is because they were nurses. Yeah, Ellen Church was, she wanted to become a pilot. They

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.960
 said you can't. She made a case of saying, what if then you need a nurse on board? And while I'm

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.920
 there, I can serve some drinks, I can, I can refuel the plane, just like a nurse. But her biggest

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.080
 argument, I think, was that she said, if you have a woman on board, you're not going to have scared

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.400
 passengers because the men will be too afraid to admit that they're scared when there's a woman

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.000
 who's not scared on board. That was her pitch. And I think before that it was children, basically,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.560
 right? It was teenagers. Yeah. And again, it's like, you know, if the teenager's not scared,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.920
 then we probably won't be scared. That's good logic. I think that would work for me.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.080
 Teenagers famously have no sense of risk. They have absolutely no clue whether something is

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.520
 harmful or dangerous behaviour. That's true. Maybe it's more like the protective instinct.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.120
 You can't show you're afraid in front of a teenager because you're the grown up in the room.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.040
 To be honest, one of the main reasons they were teenagers is because teenagers were a bit smaller

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.560
 than adults. I'm talking now about the 1920s. There was an airline called Daimler Airway,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.400
 which went from Manchester to London in a biplane, which could carry nine passengers.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.040
 But this was a route you could take. And they had these cabin boys whose job was to hand out hot

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.320
 water bottles and earplugs and reassure you during the flight saying, don't worry, it's supposed to

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.680
 be falling apart. It's the only days of flying. In 50 years, if it makes you feel better, this

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.760
 will be totally safe. I should just finish what I was saying about the guy who brought the lawsuit

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.920
 to say that in 1971, four years after he brought it, it was ruled that airlines could not discriminate

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.920
 against men. And it obviously also was a very homophobic thing. So we think of the fight

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.520
 tendons rules as being sexist, but it was also really homophobic. The idea was that these men

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.880
 would be effeminate and there'd be arousing homosexual feelings in other men that they didn't

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.080
 want to have. And in 1971, you weren't allowed to do that. Sadly, this poor guy who brought the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.040
 lawsuit was at that point too old to become an air steward. Oh, so it was Aegis as well.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.600
 It was Aegis and he'd hit 35, yes. And women, we should also specify, were employed at first as

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.440
 nurses. But the reason that they employed only women after that was because they were fair

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.720
 and they wanted the male passengers to be attracted to them. It was. And it's really

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.560
 interesting. Like until 1978 in America, if you took a plane from, let's say, Detroit to Chicago,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.640
 you had to charge a certain amount, no matter what. Do you mean ticket price, sorry?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.520
 Ticket price, yeah. Right. Exactly. So it was all dependent on the route and it was not dependent

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.920
 on anything else. And so you had to attract customers. So what would you do? You would

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.640
 make it really attractive. So you would have like piano bars on your plane. You would have

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.240
 fillet stakes on your menu. You would have very attractive cabin crew, stuff like that.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.320
 And then in 1978, they increased competition, complete race to the bottom, cheaper the better.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.640
 They got rid of all the frills, no more pianos on planes, no more fillet steak,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.000
 hideous stuff at every turn, unbelievably ugly stuff. But what it meant was the race to the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.840
 bottom meant that a lot of companies went out of business. So you had much fewer companies

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.720
 who are running those routes. And it meant that the cabin crew had less sort of chance to move

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.000
 between different jobs. Right. Anyway, that's my rant against capitalism. Please enjoy my next

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.800
 TED talk. So you just want posh fillet stakes on your first class flights? First class for everyone.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.840
 Yeah. I remember I was on a flight coming back from Dubai and we were going through the craziest

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.840
 turbulence I've ever felt. You guys know I'm a nervous flyer. So that was, I was petrified.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.680
 Were you? Yeah. And someone started screaming in the back, screaming. And it screamed, it kind of-

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.600
 Was that the echo of your own screaming? We were traveling so fast, sound couldn't keep up with it.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.240
 Yeah. No, this guy was yelling and he was yelling quite a few scary words. And so we were like,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.680
 oh my God, is this like a, is this a bombing? Is it a hijacking? Poltergeist!

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:56.880
 Loneliness. Yeah. And so everyone's terrified. Everyone's really scared, but clearly the people

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.720
 know what's going on. And suddenly flight attendants were all running to the back. Now it turns out it

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.760
 was a medical emergency. Right. But my last thought that I always think about this, my last thought

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.280
 that had the plane had blown up in that moment was that I watched a chef run back and all I could

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.160
 think was they have chefs up front. That's incredible. That was my final thought. How did

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.840
 you know was he a chef? How do you know he was a chef? He had a giant white hat. He saw what was

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:29.200
 going on with Mum, Mum here. A huge long mustache. Yeah, yeah. Flipping a pancake as he ran. He was

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.120
 slicing some tribes at the big knife in midair as he went. Incredible. They don't have chefs on

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.840
 planes. Yes, they do. Chef is the, that's a perfect disguise. He fooled you absolutely. He was an

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.080
 air marshal, but all air marshals these days stress as chefs. First class they have chefs. They do.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.000
 Can I tell you about an incident that happened? This is not a flight I was on, but it is in the

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.320
 great list of air rage incidents on Wikipedia. In 1995, a group of 18 British and Irish tourists

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.040
 got rowdy on a flight from London to Minneapolis. They started sending their children to steal

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.920
 food and drink from the flight attendants' carts. So causing trouble. What they didn't know is that

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.880
 several wrestlers from the US Olympic freestyle wrestling team were also on board the flight.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.520
 And did they take part or is it like a doctor? They're not allowed to intervene in situations

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.360
 otherwise they're liable. I can't do a triple suplex on this child. He is my son.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.520
 Yeah, they did know they piled in and they helped restrain the rowdy.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:32.080
 Every 30 seconds, he's getting out the train table.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.040
 Wait, doctors aren't allowed to intervene? No, they are.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.040
 Is there a doctor on board? Yes, great. Can you stay where you are?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.080
 Can literally anyone else perform surgery? At TMCBR. I mean, I don't know the details,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.200
 but there's a thing where if you intervene, you feel like you are liable or you could be liable

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.800
 for something. So obviously they do because they can save someone's life, but then if something

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.400
 goes wrong, then suddenly they're wearing their doctor's hat. Yeah, because they're not wearing

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:06.240
 their chef's hat. I was looking at some famous flight attendants. Kate Middleton's mum, Carol.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.520
 Carol Middleton. Yeah, I'd say famous. Oh, there was snobbery about her, wasn't there?

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.160
 Strawberry. Snobbery. She always keeps a strawberry about a person.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.320
 There was snobbery because they called her doors to manual or something, which is what you say

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.240
 when the plane lands, don't you think? I didn't know about that, yeah. Johanna Sigurthardotir,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.880
 who was Prime Minister of Iceland from 2009 to 2013, and the country's first female PM and the

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.760
 first openly LGBTQ head of government. She was a flight attendant. Marina Machete, who was the

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.120
 first transgender winner of Miss Portugal. Marina Machete. It's such a great name, isn't it?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.480
 You'd be too scared to take her on. Another one I was reading about was the first female

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:59.440
 steward in the Soviet Union called Elsa Garodetskaya, and she flew from Moscow to Ashkabat in Turkmenistan,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.720
 and it took 13 hours. And if you went by train, it would take 129 hours and 30 minutes.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.360
 So the flights were really important in the Soviet Union because these places are so far apart.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.480
 And the best version of this I found was in Kazakhstan, there was a flight from Almaty to

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:23.520
 Balcash, okay, and it was a two-hour flight, but if you wanted to go by train, it would take 157

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:31.280
 hours because there was no direct train between the two cities. So you had to go from Kazakhstan,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:38.000
 from Almaty, all the way up to Novosibirsk in Siberia, and all the way back down again,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.560
 and it would take about a week. And we regret to announce there's a five-minute delay to today's

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:50.720
 journey. Wow. Some flight attendant codes, a bit of language, so do you know what they say if they

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.040
 find you attractive? No, and nor do you, and they be honest. As in they say it to you directly?

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.800
 No, so it's one of these silly little sort of things that gets put into click-baity articles

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.400
 online. I'm going back in there already. No, so right, you can either say "Bob" about someone.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.600
 How would you say it? Like, what's the context? Best on board. Yeah, exactly.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.000
 When do you sort of shout "Bob" up the plane? Why do you need a code?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.960
 You must be saying to your fellow attendants, "Oh, there's a Bob in World 13 CB."

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:30.400
 Or, as people get off the plane, you say "Cheerio" to them instead of "Goodbye,"

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.960
 or "Thank you for flying with us," or whatever. There'll be a word that you say, you know.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.280
 That's interesting. Toodaloo, or something.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.680
 Don't take this as gospel and humiliate yourself in front of just a perfectly

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.320
 polite vice-attendant. It's not my sweet.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.920
 Cheerio. You just grab them like that guy at the end of World War II.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:55.120
 I have a favourite flight attendant story, a story of honey traps, very topical.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.920
 In the 1960s, the KGB was trying to blackmail the Indonesian president,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.040
 the guy called Ahmad Sukarno. And the way that the KGB blackmailed him was that they had their

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.640
 agents on one of his flights, a private flight, disguise themselves as flight attendants and,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.520
 you know, serve him drinks and stuff and look sexy. And they flirted with him to the extent

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.080
 that eventually he invited them to his hotel room when he landed. And they had a big old orgy,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.640
 not knowing that the Soviets had hidden a camera behind the mirror in the room and filmed the

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.720
 entire orgy. And then, later on, the Soviets called him to a private cinema and gave him a

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.960
 private showing of himself having an orgy with these flight attendants who were in fact agents.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.640
 And so, do you know what he did?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.400
 Had a wink.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:48.400
 Bad news, there's another camera in the cinema. He's filming that.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.080
 And he just kept happening again and again.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.480
 He's still there? That didn't happen. But he did ask for more copies that he could take home

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.120
 to his homeland because he said the people would love him for it.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.560
 That's very... I mean, that is funny.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.600
 Completely backfired.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:15.040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.920
 My fact this week is that a team of ecologists have been studying the health of the oceans

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.000
 by dissecting leftover tins of fish from the 1980s.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.800
 All these fish are dead!

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.760
 Yeah, it's quite... It's quite a roundabout way of doing it.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.520
 It seems like half of the ocean was made of brine, but the other half was made out of

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.040
 olive oil. What about the spicy tomato sauce? That was Mediterranean.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.280
 So what? Yeah, what's that?

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.920
 Well, this is really ingenious. It's actually been published now.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.640
 It's a paper in the Ecology and Evolution Journal, and it's research done by Chelsea Wood

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.600
 and Natalie Mastic, who were looking into the health of marine mammals specifically.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.080
 So there's quite a few links in this chain.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.520
 They were looking at seals and whales and how their health had been over time.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.120
 But to do that, they wanted to know what parasites have been in the ocean,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.880
 because parasites get into salmon and cause disease in salmon,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.960
 and then seals and whales eat salmon.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.800
 And then you know what kind of diseases seals and whales would have been getting,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.960
 because these parasites will give them certain diseases.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.600
 So how did they find out what parasites were in the ocean 40 years ago?

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.040
 Well, they didn't know, and then suddenly out of the blue,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.480
 they got a call from a seafood products association in Seattle,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.400
 saying they were cleaning out their basement, had loads of long expired tins of salmon.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.840
 Did she want them?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.440
 And she said, that's actually a great idea. Yeah, let's do it.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.320
 Does it work?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.400
 It worked. There were tins of tins of salmon.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.360
 So can I just say, so this was 40 years ago, so just before you were born, Anna?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.120
 Just ages before I was born, yeah.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.080
 Ages before you were born.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.040
 But does that mean that anyone eating salmon 40 years ago might have had parasites in their salmon?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.680
 None of the parasites, when they opened the cans were alive,

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.080
 nor they'd been alive once they'd been canned.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.920
 So they'd burrow into salmon's muscle.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.000
 They're right inside these muscle pockets,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.480
 and they said they could pick through the tinned muscle tissue with forceps,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.680
 and see the worms like spring out of their muscles.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.520
 What? That's disgusting.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.240
 It's so disgusting.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.920
 So if I eat salmon, that's not happening today, is it?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.120
 Yeah, you've got what?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.560
 Yeah, a magnifying glass on it.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.280
 Salmon do have a lot of problems with, especially the farmed ones,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.080
 because they're in such a tight proximity to each other.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.440
 Sorry, I'm really putting you off here.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.960
 But they're so close that they get more, obviously they get more lice.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.360
 Yeah, I know of that, but I've never seen worms in salmon.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.160
 Yeah, they're there.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.800
 You've got to maybe get a magnifying glass to them.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.160
 Don't put a magnifying glass on anything.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.280
 It's the basic rule of food.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.160
 It's just that you're so off-put by whatever you see.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.640
 You're right.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.040
 So the cans ranged from expired cans from 1979 to 2021,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.680
 and they were literally able to plot the health can by can year by year.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.680
 The parasite thing, I just found that really interesting.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.120
 I don't fully understand the science of it,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.160
 but basically the parasite in order to reproduce,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.840
 it needed to be eaten by something.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.720
 That then is eaten.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.000
 So it's eaten by krill.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.160
 The krill is then eaten by salmon.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.800
 The salmon is then eaten by a marine mammal.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.920
 And once it gets to the mammal,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.920
 that's when it can reproduce and put its stuff back out.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.200
 And the cycle starts again.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.520
 So are you saying that these parasites don't survive

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.880
 unless they end up in a mammal?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.560
 They can't reproduce.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.000
 It's like the old woman who swallows a fly,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.040
 but at the end, a giant fly bursts out of the horse.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.240
 It's sort of that disgusting.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.160
 I wouldn't make such an appealing children's book, but yeah.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.040
 Canned din food.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.120
 We have briefly mentioned Nicholas Appere,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.160
 who discovered it.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.920
 There was a big competition in France

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.440
 to find a way of preserving food

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.640
 so that Napoleon could basically feed his armies overseas

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.240
 and at long distances.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.640
 And it took 15 years and he won it.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.160
 What we didn't say, I love this.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.360
 He originally used ceramic container sealed with cork,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.920
 but he's basically the father of canned food.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.200
 The process was called, he was called Nicholas Appere.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.960
 It was called Appertising.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.520
 Spooky.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.400
 That is good.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.040
 It's appetising.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.160
 It's good branding.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:00.800
 Yeah.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 Is it a pun or is that there's no correlation?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.840
 No, it's one work in French.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.920
 His name is Appere and it's appetising.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.360
 An accidental pun.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.240
 Isn't that mad?

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.040
 Wow.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.240
 Let's type.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.680
 He was so convinced about his work.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.640
 He published a book about it in 1810.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.760
 He was so confident about it.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.520
 He attached a small note to every copy with his address on it

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.120
 so you could turn up at his house.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.640
 That's a great idea.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.320
 Andy, have you considered that for your novel

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.600
 for anyone who doesn't like it?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.040
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.080
 I will do anything.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.600
 But his thing didn't really work that well, did it?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.240
 Oh, it did look.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.680
 No, all the jars exploded.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.000
 Some of the jars, come on.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.040
 They didn't well explode.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.600
 Yeah, no.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.320
 What happens is you heat up the food

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320
 so that it kills all the bacteria and stuff.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.560
 But if you don't do it well enough,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.880
 the bacteria will create gases

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.640
 and the gases will get more and more and more

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.920
 and eventually bang.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.720
 Right.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.880
 Quite exciting opening the pantry, isn't it, every day?

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.440
 You had to wear face masks.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.320
 I quite like that the original tins were champagne bottles.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.720
 Because the first thing that he can stuff in

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.400
 was empty champagne bottles.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:04.880
 Really?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.520
 Yeah.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.320
 And there were champagne bottles corked with cheese.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.840
 What a disgusting image of the cork pops.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.360
 It's just this foaming cheese.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.240
 Are you joking?

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.280
 Like, it's cheese and wine together at last.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.600
 Yeah.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.040
 Only a French inventor would have come up

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.480
 with the empty champagne bottles of the cheese.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.360
 How the hell do you shove a whole duck into a champagne bottle?

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.640
 Well, I'm delighted that you've asked.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.240
 He found this a bit of a problem at first.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.600
 And he found, surprisingly enough,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.000
 they weren't wide enough to fit a lot of foods in them.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.760
 But he doctored them so that they cut off the top

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.000
 so that it widened the neck.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.480
 And then, yeah, stuffed it with cheese and lime

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.080
 wrapped in cloth to cork it.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.800
 I assume it's lime as in the stone.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.600
 Quick lime.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.120
 Yeah, quick lime as opposed to--

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.440
 Not to squeeze of lime, just to squeeze.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.960
 But then it was a guy called Philip de Gérard

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.880
 who came up with the tin can,

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.200
 which is closer to what we have today.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.400
 He was also French,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.480
 but he actually sold it to the British.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.560
 He gave the patent to a guy called Peter Durand.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.680
 And Peter Durand--

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.280
 Who also sounds French, do you?

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.960
 Yes, he does.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.800
 Yeah, but he was Durand.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.280
 Yeah.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.600
 Durand.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.080
 There you go.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.080
 And basically became part of the British army,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.600
 then started using the tins.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.120
 And actually, at the Battle of Waterloo,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.600
 the British army had loads of these French tins,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.160
 which must have seemed a bit off to the French.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.880
 It's so weird that he was the front man, Peter Durand,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.240
 because he was completely the front man.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.360
 He did not come up with the idea.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.840
 And it was also that Gérard could get his thing through.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.720
 One reason, because the English didn't trust the French.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.520
 So if a Frenchman came over with these tins of food

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.280
 and said, "Hey, everyone, buy these,"

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.040
 no one would believe him because he was French.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.400
 So he needed someone with a French-sounding name.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.880
 But then Durand sold the patent after a couple of years

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.120
 to a man who I think we've mentioned it once before,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.920
 Brian Duncan.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.680
 That is a solid English name, isn't it?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.640
 Brian Duncan.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.920
 You don't get more English than that.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.840
 God, I've had a throwback to like 10 years

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.320
 of you constantly going, "Donk, donk, donk, donk."

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.280
 What was that?

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.360
 Well, that was just an old music style donk.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.400
 Yeah, donk.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.680
 Do you not remember that?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.960
 James had always mentioned that.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.080
 It's honestly like 10 years ago.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.520
 It was like a northern music style where it was like dance

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.520
 music, but it would be like, "Donk, donk, donk, donk,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.320
 put a donk on it."

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.400
 You take a normal tune and you put a donk on it.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.960
 It's like a remix.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.560
 But I once got Stephen Fry to say,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560
 "Put a donk on it on QI as part of a bet."

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.440
 That's it.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.400
 Yeah.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.000
 Did he also invent the music, Brian Duncan,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.040
 or was he just the front man for that?

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.840
 Duncan invented the donk, and he made it big on that.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.440
 No, so he was an amazing engineer.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.240
 It's from Northumbria.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.360
 He was a metalworker.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.600
 He had a paper-making machine business.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.520
 He patented the first steel pen,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.840
 and then he starts making corned beef in his preservatory.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.280
 He's just a legend this guy.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.240
 And then in 1813, he presented his beef to the Duke of Kent,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.040
 not a euphemism.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:55.440
 He got a letter back from Four Royals saying the Queen herself

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.840
 had tasted and enjoyed his canned beef again,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.760
 and he got the patent.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.440
 And he's so popular.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.160
 He was so popular.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.000
 There is a cove in Chile, which is called Catela Donkin,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.880
 because the crew had loved their Donkin-tinned meat so much.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.880
 We already have Donkin statues now,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.640
 and maybe there are some in Northumbria,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.680
 but I've never-- like, he should be a national hero.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.880
 And he's completely forgotten.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.640
 There was an amazing BBC article.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.520
 It was really, really a long one about his life and canned food,

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.040
 but Donkin is a huge part of it.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.600
 He's buried in Nunhead Cemetery, which is in South London,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.920
 and his name is a footnote beneath three other guys

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.760
 all called Brian Duncan, who--

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.560
 Who are related to him?

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.440
 Who are related to him?

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.400
 He's put all the random Donkins in one place.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.720
 It's a mass Donkin grave, wasn't it?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.920
 It was called Donkin Donkins.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.280
 There's one angry guy trying to kill Brian Duncan,

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.520
 got it wrong three times, finally got it right.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.000
 I know.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.600
 He did do lots of other stuff, didn't he?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.600
 He worked with Brunel, Brunel's son, on the Thames Tunnel.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.360
 He worked on Charles Babbage's computer.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.120
 He was multi-talented.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.440
 And as John Nutting of the Cannes--

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.680
 It's just a great name.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.000
 John Nutting, editor of the Cannes Maker magazine.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.480
 Never go to the cinema alone with John Nutting.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.200
 Wait, why not?

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200
 It's euphemism for masturbating.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.720
 Right, I just thought it was headbutting someone.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.760
 So I think that could have led to all sorts of confusion

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.240
 in my life.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:23.200
 Anyway, he's editor of the Cannes Maker magazine.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.040
 Either way, we'll get you kicked out of a weather spoon

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.840
 for the Friday night.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.120
 The double nutting, that's why you're getting arrested.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.640
 He's just a big fan of Duncan, Duncan and Nutting.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.600
 He said, lamented that he's forgotten by the wider world,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.200
 which I always think when people say,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.880
 "Can we believe he's lost to history?"

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.560
 I can believe it.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.240
 I agree he's done an important thing.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.320
 He's come up with sort of tin canning

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.400
 or like commercialized the process.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.360
 What do you expect for that to be a household name?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.160
 200 years later?

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.120
 No, no, no.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.400
 I mean, it's been sad truth.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.080
 Well, anyway, nice to dust off the donk.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.080
 There's a really old fact on QI

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.320
 that it took 50 years after the invention of the Cannes

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:02.960
 to invent the Cannes.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.480
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 I'm sure we've said that before on this show as well.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.920
 I didn't realize that there are actually

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.520
 really good reasons for that.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.200
 Firstly, the first process,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.600
 there were only six Cannes made an hour.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.440
 So, you know, there wasn't the mass market.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.040
 If you invent a tin opener,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.040
 they're going to open them quicker than you can make them.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.680
 Exactly.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.840
 It's not worth it.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.840
 And secondly, they were made of wrought iron

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.640
 and lined with tin.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.360
 They were thick.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.560
 No modern Cannes opener would have possibly

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.000
 been able to crack into this.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.760
 What was the method back then to get into them?

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.120
 Just chisel, hammer and chisel.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.200
 I mean, very few, in my experience,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.520
 very few modern Cannes openers can open modern Cannes.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.440
 So, modern ones are steel and they're incredibly thin.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.080
 But the original ones were just so thick.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.640
 I love this.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.240
 In 1860s America, shop grocery clerks

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.880
 would open your cans for you to take home.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.360
 Yeah.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.720
 They would open it in the shop.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.560
 You would have your cans open for you.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.440
 That's quite nice.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.800
 Actually, I quite like that with jars.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.840
 Like a jar of pickles, just go to the person

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.800
 who's scattered in the street.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.120
 Well, you wouldn't mind losing in the bar, would you say?

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.360
 Slowly walking back along the high street.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.760
 Imagine you're in the queue.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.520
 Like, there's always so many different reasons

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.040
 that it's going to take ages at the counter

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.000
 when someone's in front of you

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.160
 and you just see the person who's scanning all the stuff

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.760
 heads off to get a chisel and a hammer.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.480
 And you're like, oh, shit, cashier off the cashier.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.520
 Jimmy with the big wrists is trying to open your cans for you.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.720
 Jimmy big wrists.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720
 Jimmy nutting.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.360
 I found out about an invention in canopening

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.640
 that I didn't know about, and it was almost 100 years ago.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.040
 Wow.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.240
 So just before you were born.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.960
 So she was before I was born.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.640
 So the electric canopener.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.920
 Did you guys know this was a thing?

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.400
 Was it my room?

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.440
 I own one.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.960
 Why have I been struggling away

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.040
 with these coffee plastic things?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.880
 This is no exaggeration.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.360
 My electric can opener is probably the best thing

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.320
 I've ever bought.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.200
 Wow.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.520
 I think it's a genius thing.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.360
 You just put it on, you press a button,

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.400
 and then it opens the can.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.520
 That's so good.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.960
 Invented in 1931.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.080
 Why didn't they all have them by 1932?

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.760
 Why don't I have one today?

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.760
 I mean, it sounds like they are readily available to buy.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.240
 They are.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.080
 You could just go to a shop and buy them.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.640
 Well, we don't all have James's secret sources.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.760
 You guys heard it here first.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.960
 I've actually never heard one.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.840
 And it does sound like a...

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.440
 I mean, James has given it at the hard sale.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.120
 Genuinely, I would say it is one of my favorite items

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.160
 in my entire house.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.360
 Wow.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.720
 Including his wife and child.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.160
 The only thing that obviously puts them out of business

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.040
 a little bit at the moment is those ring pull tins

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.200
 that you get, like a lot of them are ring pull.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.760
 So I will deliberately buy tins

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.040
 that don't have the ring pull on,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.720
 so I can use my tin opener.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.840
 In the aftertimes, once the food's run out

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.920
 and everyone has used up all the ring pull cans,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.880
 you're going to be the king.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.480
 Exactly, until the batteries run out.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.360
 Oh, yeah, then your stuff.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.520
 A glorious two and a half weeks.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.680
 I will be the king of the world.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.840
 Does it have a manual setting?

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.160
 Like, can you do it if the batteries run out?

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.680
 Yeah, if the batteries run out, you're knackered.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.240
 Wow.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.280
 Um, yeah.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.520
 You should just pull all the rings off your cans

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.080
 when you buy them.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.520
 Yeah, I do ask the person in the shop to do that for me.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.920
 Funny.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.080
 Yeah, electric can open it.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.200
 Is it big?

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.560
 Does it have to sit on the counter?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.120
 Or is it not?

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.560
 No, it's this big.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.200
 If it was solar-

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.760
 It's a bit chunky.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.080
 If it was solar-powered, you could have permanent-

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.800
 Yeah, it's not.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.720
 Yeah, it's not, I'm not, I'm afraid.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.400
 It's probably not very good for the environment.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.000
 But I find them so useful.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.480
 Yeah, that is good.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.440
 I think that's not a big cost for the environment, frankly.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.680
 I've got, but I've got solar on my roof.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.960
 So if you come round,

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.120
 we could form a power couple in the aftertimes.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.520
 The original power couple, the opposite of the original.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.600
 The post-apocalyptic power couple.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.000
 He can harness the sun.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.040
 He can open your tins.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.080
 Right, you're sort of giving yourself the main part in that, aren't you?

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:10.720
 And Dan and Anna will find some jobs for you, you know?

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.440
 I'm good, thanks.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.920
 Cansardines.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.800
 This is a nice thing.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.600
 I didn't know this.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.280
 They have their own kind of connoisseurs

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.400
 and vintage years.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.920
 No.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.480
 Oh, wow.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.040
 If you buy an expensive can of sardines,

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.080
 you might prefer to get a 2004 vintage

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.000
 compared to a 2008 vintage.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.880
 That's incredible, right?

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.960
 Are there people at the restaurant who send them back?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.400
 So this is a 1993.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.800
 Ask specifically for the '97.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.520
 This is corks.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.240
 This is tinned.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.480
 It's absolutely amazing.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.640
 So there are like companies like,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.440
 who I'd never heard of,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.960
 like Rodel and Connoitabla in France.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.640
 And they sell these sardines.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.440
 And the thing is, apparently sardines get better

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.640
 the longer they're in the can,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.440
 up to a certain number of years.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.840
 But what happens is the flesh becomes much smoother

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.720
 and more tender and the bones eventually kind of disappear,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.840
 the tiny bones that you get in your sardines.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.320
 Eventually it just becomes a mush of sardine.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.440
 And that's the absolute best time to buy them.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.360
 And you get people who just buy them

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.040
 and then just keep them for 10 years

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.800
 until they're exactly the right moment

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.160
 and then they'll eat the sardines.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.200
 Again, that'll be funny for the prepping.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.920
 Don't have that.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.000
 Exactly when the nuclear war happened.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.560
 We need to keep that another seven years.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.640
 And apparently you have to flip the tins every six months.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.440
 Like a mattress.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.560
 Like a mattress.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.840
 Just, I don't know,

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.480
 I think it's so that the oil or whatever

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.400
 gets nicely distributed and doesn't settle.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.440
 This is really interesting, James,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.600
 because my mum went to Portugal last year

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.880
 and she brought back tinned,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.200
 because Portugal, they're obsessed with canned fish, aren't they?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.440
 And they have these really beautiful tins.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.000
 And she brought back cans for each of her children,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.040
 of which I am one,

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.960
 with our year of birth written on them.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.440
 Really?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.720
 And mine just said 1986.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.160
 And I just thought that's a nice design

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.760
 and cracked into it and had it on toast.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.800
 But I suspect that was actually a 1986 vintage.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.520
 Did it taste better than any other sardines you'd ever eaten?

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.920
 It was sort of full of crawling maggots.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.000
 But aside from that, it was actually delicious, yeah.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Did you just, as we know, your mum would go,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.880
 "Oh, what?

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.680
 "Crawling maggots?

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.600
 "We used to eat those every single week."

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.200
 Exactly, it's a delicacy.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.720
 Also, did you just slip in your birth year

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.720
 to prove that you're not 100 years old?

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.360
 God damn it, cut that out, edit it out.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:34.400
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.800
 Okay, my fact this week is that German writer

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.440
 Christoph Friedrich Nicolai treated his visions of ghosts

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.080
 by applying leeches to his anus.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.240
 Really built that fight, doesn't it?

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.160
 Did it work?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.200
 Yeah.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.080
 How's it worked?

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.120
 Okay, come on.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.160
 Explain yourself.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.120
 So, he had previously suffered from something

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.800
 that he called a violent giddiness.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.360
 And he was treated by leeches.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.440
 And he was kept having these treatments.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.440
 And then one time he missed his treatment,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.560
 and he started seeing what he thought was ghosts.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.960
 He said, "I observed at a distance of 10 paces

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.880
 "the figure of a deceased person.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.880
 "I asked my wife whether she saw it.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.360
 "She saw nothing, but being much alarmed

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.480
 "sent for the physician."

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.160
 Okay, and so then what he did was, he decided,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.400
 he was a bit of a skeptic, a bit of a scientist,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.560
 so he decided he would not take any more leeches for a while,

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.920
 put up with the ghosts, and then after a while,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.880
 he would try the leeches and see if it got rid of the ghosts.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.280
 And sure enough, a bit later he presented

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.400
 is what he called his memoir on the appearance of spectres

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.800
 or phantoms occasioned by disease

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.040
 to the Berlin Academy of Sciences.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.640
 And he said that he applied the leeches to the anus,

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.640
 and they went away, the ghosts.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.440
 And he concluded that the ghosts originated

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.080
 in my internal consciousness alone,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.920
 a consciousness that was disordered.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.880
 So, he was kind of disproving the ghosts existed

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.400
 by saying there was a physical treatment for these ghosts,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.920
 and that means there's no such thing as a ghost,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.040
 it was all in my head.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.600
 Yeah.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.560
 And was there a reason he had to apply it to his anus?

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.920
 Why his anus?

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.080
 I think it was an easy way to get up blood.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.520
 It's easy access, isn't it?

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.240
 It is, yeah.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.640
 It's sort of easy access.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.960
 I think your hand is even easier access.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.800
 No, a leech is better than your hand,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.120
 for getting blood out of your anus.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.400
 I believe that there was like a relatively common place

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.240
 to put leeches back in the day.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.960
 Well, King George III used to put them on his temples

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.800
 when he was suffering from his bouts of depression and so on.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.400
 So, when was this guy?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.200
 When was this paper?

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.160
 Sorry, I should say who Christoph Friedrich Nicolai was.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.000
 So, this problem that he had was in 1799.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.600
 He was German, he was around at the same time

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.560
 as lots of other German writers that you would know,

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.600
 such as Goethe, and in fact he had a...

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.680
 You've listed all the German writers I would know.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.800
 I might come to some more.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.240
 So, he had a big argument with Goethe, actually.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.320
 So, Goethe wrote a book called The Sorrows of Jungwurther,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.840
 which we have mentioned before,

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.280
 which was about a depressed young man,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.600
 and actually a lot of people copied this young man

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.840
 and dressed like him and committed suicide and so on.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.200
 So, it was like a real massive, massive deal in Germany.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.560
 And Nicolai wrote The Joys of Jungwurther,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.400
 which was kind of a slam on the sorrows of Jungwurther.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.000
 And then Goethe, in response, composed a poem

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.760
 where Nicolai stood next to Wurther's grave and defecates on it.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.440
 And he also put him in Faust.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.520
 Not one of his most famous works, was it?

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.800
 Faust is one of his...

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.920
 It sure is, yeah, there's very little defecating in Faust, is there?

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.160
 There isn't, but there is a character called the Proctofantasmist,

00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.240
 who was actually Nicolai in disguise who put leeches on his bum.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.720
 And in Faust, Goethe says he is about to sit down in a puddle.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.480
 That's the way his soul acts.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.480
 And when leeches feast on his rump,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.800
 he is cured of ghosts and ghouls.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.760
 Wow.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.160
 I mean, it must have been a big deal at the time.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.960
 He's made it into that.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.520
 That's not the only work of fiction that he's made it into.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.800
 He also was in a story called Mrs. Zant and the Ghost,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.360
 which was written by friend of the podcast, Wilkie Collins.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.160
 Really?

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:24.880
 Yeah.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.240
 And so, and in reference to the hallucinations and so on.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.080
 So, it must have been the talk of the town.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.320
 Yeah, ETA Hoffman wrote about him.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.760
 Schlegel wrote about him.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.880
 Not Schlegel.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.160
 Schlegel, you know Schlegel.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.040
 I've heard the name.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.640
 You know him from the philosopher's song.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.560
 That's literally what I was about to say.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.920
 I was saying Monty Python's.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.920
 Yeah, he's just as drunk as Schlegel.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.800
 But yeah, Schlegel was a linguist,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.200
 basically, who's a philosopher as well and stuff.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.000
 ETA Hoffman wrote the Nutcracker, I think.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.960
 Oh, wow.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.600
 That's big news.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.080
 So, you know, they are big names who were,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.000
 as well as writing all these big things,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.080
 also writing about this guy's rectum.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:00.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.400
 And Tchaikovsky wrote the music to the Nutcracker.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.240
 But he wrote the story.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.360
 Well, Schlegel actually wrote,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.360
 in response to the Nutcracker,

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.560
 he wrote The Can Opener,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.320
 which is a very beautiful...

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:16.160
 So, it was huge leeches for thousands of years, wasn't it?

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.560
 You hear about old treatments that come and go,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.920
 but leeches just came about 2,500 years ago

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.640
 and then stuck around until the 19th century,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.400
 when finally they went out of fashion,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.240
 because it was thought to be unscientific,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.920
 and then came back into fashion.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.840
 But the way you treat people with leeches is,

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.400
 they, you attach them to someone and they make you bleed.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.640
 Their saliva has an anticoagulant in it,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.960
 and they also put a chemical into you

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.120
 that widens up your blood vessels,

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.800
 and they put an anesthetic into you.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.160
 They're great surgeons.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.560
 I think I can drink about a thumb full of,

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.120
 or a thumb's size of blood, you know, from an area.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.200
 Yeah, they can drink five times more than their own body size,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.240
 I think, which is a lot.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.440
 But you don't normally leech to death,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.160
 unless the doctors have put dozens of leeches on you,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.040
 which is pretty rare.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.560
 You're definitely not going to leech to death.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.480
 No, it'll just be like an annoying little pinprick

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.760
 in your finger for a day.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.600
 I've sometimes had to like a blood sample

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.520
 from my fingers at home,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.880
 and you get these little sort of pinprick things, don't you?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.200
 Yeah.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 And I just can't get them to work.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.920
 Really?

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.520
 Yeah, last time I had to do it, they gave me two,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.280
 and I couldn't get it to work,

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.600
 and so I had to go and buy some more.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.320
 But you could only buy them from the pharmacist

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.400
 in boxes of 500.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.000
 So I now have about 495 of these at home,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.320
 which I literally, if anyone wants to buy them, I'll think.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.000
 Well, in the aftertimes, those will probably come in handy,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.160
 those will be a way for you to test the faith of the elect.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.200
 You could probably gradually open a can

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.760
 with one of those actually, because you're an online battery.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.200
 Have you used 20 of them?

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.160
 Have you heard of the Birmingham Leech Centre?

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.440
 No.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.520
 This is run by Bridget Croft, who is a nurse,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.480
 and she is the only nurse in the UK

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.200
 who is qualified to do private leaching.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.480
 So everyone else is, all the other leaching is on the NHS,

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.600
 and it's to repair joints and after microsurgery

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.040
 and help blood vessels heal.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.920
 She does it privately, and she says,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.520
 in some areas of Eastern Europe,

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.000
 it is looked on in the same way as going to a spa.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.080
 What is she using it for, though,

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.720
 because it's not for sewing fingers back on?

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.800
 No, so that would be on the NHS or whatever.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.680
 This is pain relief, gout, baldness, all sorts of stuff.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.680
 Oh, so is this stuff that doesn't work?

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.280
 Because it doesn't work for those things.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.120
 I don't know about baldness.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.480
 Is it just that people see you from a distance

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.080
 with all the leeches on your head?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.320
 I think, oh, he's got a full head of hair.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.120
 That's two pays moving around the world, isn't it?

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.160
 It works from across a dimly lit bar,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.280
 but up close, the results do fall off.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.160
 I mean, that does sound like old school leech work to me.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.720
 It does, yeah.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.880
 Whereas modern leech work is quite specifically

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.920
 for the getting body parts back on, isn't it?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.680
 Leeches, they share something in common with tinned salmon,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.680
 which is then now being used to tell us about the environment.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.040
 So in China, they took 700 terrestrial leeches

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.560
 that they found, all the same species,

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.360
 and they are going and taking the blood out of them

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.440
 and diagnosing what animal it was taken from.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.520
 A question, sorry, that's when I interrupt.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.000
 Terrestrial leech, is that something that's not an alien?

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.200
 You have to listen to Dan's other podcast

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.280
 to find out about terrestrial leeches.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.680
 And the ones that you won't find in the water of bogs and stuff,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.480
 they're land-based.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.920
 Land-based, that's cool.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.640
 That's all you do?

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.520
 That's me guessing.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.360
 Yeah, so some of them feed on deer, for example.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.360
 The story of how they came back into use is a pretty amazing one.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.360
 I actually listened to a podcast on leeches,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.520
 an episode of Sideways, which I love, by the way,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.040
 you should listen to it, Matthew Side.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.680
 And he was talking about this story.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.200
 So in 1985, there's a four-year-old called Guy Condelli,

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.120
 whose ear is bitten off by his grandparents dog.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.080
 And as the surgeon remembers it,

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.240
 the surgeon Joe Upton remembers it,

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.320
 the ear arrived in the emergency room

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.240
 half an hour before the boy.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.560
 So I don't know what kind of thing happened there.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.800
 I said, we're going to reattach you to the boy.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.520
 So they've got this here.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.560
 They've got this boy.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.480
 And they can repair the arteries fine.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.000
 This is where leeches come in so useful.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.200
 It's for vein repair.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.280
 Because as Joe Upton described it,

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.120
 to try and sew veins back on,

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.520
 imagine sewing wet toilet paper together.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.520
 They're so floppy, they just keep flopping,

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.040
 and they kept on reattaching the ear,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.760
 and it kept on going purple and black as it filled with blood,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.840
 because the veins couldn't carry it away.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.480
 Old Upton, he'd read about leeches as a treatment.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.760
 And he tracked down the Welsh biopharma place

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.200
 where they bred them for use in pharmaceuticals,

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.840
 so they hadn't been used actually the way they are now.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.920
 And he got some scent to him.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.920
 And this is a completely new idea.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.880
 He's just thought, you know what,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.120
 let's attach a leech to this guy's ear and see if it works.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.120
 That's amazing.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.920
 So amazing.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.920
 And he just about gets the leeches out in time

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.040
 and says literally as soon as he puts them on this boy's ear,

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.240
 the ear goes from black to a lovely pink ear colour,

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.480
 as the leech basically repairs the veins,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.720
 or it allows the blood to flow through the veins.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.000
 It widens the veins.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.680
 It means that the blood can flow freely,

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.520
 which gives them chance to repair themselves.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.800
 The body's very good at repairing itself.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.760
 It just needed a rest.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.800
 The ear just needed a rest.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.000
 So apparently now these days,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.960
 if you have finger or ear or penis surgery,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.640
 what they'll do is for the 10 days afterwards,

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.040
 you keep getting a leech just put onto the place

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.760
 that needs repairing.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.920
 So over the 10 days, that's how they fix it.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.400
 That's just incredible.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:40.960
 Yeah, they are.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.920
 They're amazing.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.200
 Have you heard of the B-dale leech house?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.840
 This is in North Yorkshire.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.720
 I know, B-dale.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.280
 Yeah.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.240
 So Yorkshire, and it's a little building,

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.480
 but it looks like a miniature fortress

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.480
 because it's got crenellations on the top,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.680
 or castellations, you know.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.640
 So it looks like a castle.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.760
 I love that you just corrected crenellations to castellations,

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.960
 and I think people appreciate that.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.840
 It's just absolutely just...

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.760
 Because people will have been listening to it and gone,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.360
 "Oh, I don't know what a crenellation is."

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.600
 And then you started to repeat yourself.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.800
 They'll have gone, "Oh, thank God."

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.960
 He's repeating himself and telling me what it is.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.200
 And then you said an even more skill word.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.920
 Like these bits.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.360
 I've just drawn them from the back there.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.400
 Yeah, these kind of things.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.760
 Look at all that more crenellation is.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.880
 I thought that was a crenellation,

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.680
 not a castellation in that.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.880
 That's what I thought as well.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.560
 I'm not sure it's the form,

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.680
 but it's definitely the latter.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.320
 I don't know.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.760
 So I think we've got distracted from the fact

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.680
 this is a house built for leeches.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.560
 So they would be kept in there

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.560
 because to collect leeches for the market,

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.760
 you collect them from the wild,

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.800
 you collect them from rivers,

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.160
 and from bogs and swamps,

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.120
 and you normally just walk through barefoot,

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.960
 and you come out and you've got a load of leeches on you,

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.240
 and that's the leech collector's job.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.040
 And then you take them to the leech house

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.080
 and drop them off there.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.120
 So they'd be kept alive,

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.080
 and then there's a sort of staging post for them.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.120
 And this is the last leech house in the UK,

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:57.840
 and it's still there,

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.760
 and it's got a stream diverted to run through it.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.760
 It's on the banks of a little beck.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.440
 It doesn't still house leeches, does it?

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.560
 It doesn't still house leeches,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.960
 but it had a fire to keep them warm in winter,

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.000
 and it had...

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.320
 There were special containers of moist turf and moss

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.200
 for the leeches to live in.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.000
 Oh, here we go.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.320
 How'd I find this bag?

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.200
 She went search.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.760
 It's amazing how Andy searches on Google for moss leeches,

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.280
 and Dan searches for extraterrestrial leeches,

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.920
 and he goes, "Did you mean terrestrial leeches?"

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.840
 Ah, I didn't, but okay, yes, what is it?

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:35.920
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.600
 and that is Andy.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.680
 My fact is that in some American states and cities

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.560
 in the late 80s,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.400
 children could be sent to prison for six months

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.640
 for the crime of owning a pager.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.320
 What's a pager, Granddad?

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.040
 I don't know, Anna, you're 100 years old.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.360
 So, this is from a great...

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.440
 A swimmer newsletter called "Pessimists Archive"

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.240
 by Louis Anslow.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.280
 It's a brilliant article,

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.800
 and it was all about how there was this panic about pagers,

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.960
 which are electronic devices.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.800
 Can you tell us a bit more about them?

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.240
 Yeah, you can do very, very primitive texting

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.600
 on advanced models.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.200
 In the early ones, you just got a beep,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.560
 and you knew that you had to do something

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.120
 in response to the beep.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.880
 So, like a doctor might have them,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.920
 it would beep, and they're like,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.280
 "I have to go to the hospital."

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:19.600
 Exactly, that.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.440
 But then later, they would be able to send you

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.160
 like a couple of words or numbers or something.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.480
 You wouldn't be able to send a message back.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.920
 It's purely receiving.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.480
 To send the message, someone had to pick up a phone,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.280
 call a number,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.160
 and kind of direct your pager to be beeped.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.200
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.120
 So, there were all these headlines in the '80s

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.280
 about these powering the drug trade.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.960
 Maybe youths who own pagers are getting paged,

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.600
 and they're going to pick up the drugs or whatever.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.320
 And they probably were useful for drug dealers, to be honest.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:48.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.080
 But it probably wasn't most pagers in schools

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.120
 being used to pick up cocaine.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.840
 I think what it was is that most drug dealers

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.960
 did use pagers,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.200
 but not most pagers were used by drug dealers.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.880
 Exactly that, it's exactly that.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.680
 That wasn't necessarily what the right-wing press thought.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.320
 No.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.440
 And so, New Jersey banned them for under 18s

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.600
 on the pain of six months in Choke,

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.320
 which is such a long time for owning a pager.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.520
 Michigan did the same,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.720
 and thousands of young people were arrested and suspended

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.400
 and handcuffed and things.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.520
 I couldn't find anyone who was sent to prison for that.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.880
 But in one year alone,

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.880
 there were a thousand arrests in Chicago schools

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.000
 solely for owning pagers, arrests.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.080
 Because your fact, it kind of reads like one of those,

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.760
 like, there's a law in Mississippi

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.920
 that you can't let your horse open your can.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.000
 You're saying, "You're flying over New Jersey,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.600
 everyone put your pagers away."

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:43.280
 But then, as you say, 700 school kids were arrested in 1994.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.520
 And weird kids, because if they're not dealing drugs,

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.720
 which as we say, some of them were,

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.560
 but if they're not, they're just losers.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.720
 Because I'm going to associate owning a pager

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.800
 with, like, nerdy businessmen.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800
 What I associated with actually is Ross and Friends,

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.840
 who famously has one in series one.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.960
 Oh, does he?

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.200
 And so, what kind of kid owns a pager?

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.960
 In the 80s, they were so cool.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.920
 They were so cool.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.040
 Oh, were they cool in the 80s?

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.360
 Because drug dealers use them, right?

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.120
 And because your parents hated them,

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.040
 and because politicians hated them,

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.000
 to have one was the ultimate status symbol.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.520
 James is speaking, as if.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.160
 I was alive.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.880
 You were desperate for a pager.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.640
 Yeah, this is in America.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.080
 It wasn't in the UK as far as I could remember/read.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.840
 But basically, the reason they were good

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.600
 for drug dealers is before you had them,

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.280
 if you wanted to get in contact with someone

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.560
 to buy your drugs, you had to give them

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.520
 your landline number.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.360
 And now you're giving them,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.720
 effectively, a mobile number,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.120
 so the cops wouldn't know where you are.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.160
 But because they became associated with the bad guy,

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.400
 kids were wearing them round their necks,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.760
 as like a status symbol.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.320
 Wow.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.680
 And they were so cool,

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.000
 there was a market for fake pagers.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.800
 So you could buy a cheaper pager

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.400
 that didn't do anything, didn't send,

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.120
 or anything like that,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.480
 but you would just wear it around your neck

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.600
 and say, "Look, I've got a pager."

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.640
 When it wasn't real.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.320
 Would you occasionally have to say "beep"

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.280
 to make people think you're getting a mouse, my dealer?

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.640
 But I read an article that was written

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.720
 in 1977 about pagers,

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.800
 just talking about how awesome they were.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.320
 They would say that if you were in a queue

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.520
 for a restaurant,

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.400
 and the Matredease saw a pager on your belt,

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.560
 you would be able to go up the line.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.720
 There's stories of parties

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.240
 where the hostess of a party,

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.760
 and this was in Washington,

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.080
 became nervous that she hadn't invited

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.160
 the best people in her social group there,

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.000
 because she couldn't hear the beep of pagers

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.280
 at her party.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.320
 "These pagers are fakes!"

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.880
 Well, what then became even cooler

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.040
 than the beeping pager was the wiggler,

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.000
 and the wiggler was the one that doesn't beep out loud,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.400
 but like a phone on silent vibrates.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.480
 So she thought, "Okay, maybe if that's not beeping,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.080
 it's because I've got the extra cool new kicks here."

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:44.560
 "I've got the wiggles."

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.440
 "I've got the wigglers."

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.000
 Yeah.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.400
 It is interesting how transformative that is.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.200
 Just what you said, James,

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.360
 about it going from a landline to a mobile,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.200
 people communicating in new ways

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.280
 that cannot be tracked as easily.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.880
 Yeah, maybe a huge difference.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.040
 And then I read one article in 1993

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.000
 that was talking about the drug business using pagers.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.600
 They interviewed a cop, and they said,

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.320
 "Now we're finding dealers with flip phones.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.000
 Maybe that will be the next rage."

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.360
 Maybe.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:09.840
 Wow.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.880
 Who's to say?

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.560
 Which we probably should say.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.320
 Pagers are still in use.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.480
 Well, they were until a couple of years ago.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.720
 No, well, there's this old factoid about,

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.720
 the NHS is the only place where you still get

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.160
 faxes and pagers used.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.400
 They were slated to be phased out in 2021, but--

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.400
 Matt Hancock said that was going to happen, didn't they?

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.680
 Matt Hancock.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.800
 And if you're outside the UK

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.480
 and you don't know who Matt Hancock is,

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.440
 good for you.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.960
 And still, I think about 80,000 being used in the NHS

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.160
 as of last summer.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:40.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.640
 Because they still kind of work.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.520
 Yeah, really.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.400
 And if you're in a hospital

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.120
 and there's no reception in a room, it's useful.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.120
 And it is, obviously, it's used for the doctors

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.440
 who are in rooms where there's incredibly thick walls

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.360
 because of x-ray and all sorts of...

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.600
 All that stuff is what they're basically fighting

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.800
 further than a mobile signal.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.280
 So it's--

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.520
 Add a lot of NHS stuff, deal a crack.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:06.160
 But we're also using pagers in ways

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.200
 that we don't realize.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.160
 All of us.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.640
 All of us have had--

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.280
 What's that?

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.320
 All of us have had, probably, our hands on a pager

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.520
 and not known it in the last few months.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.400
 This thing got my bottom up.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.120
 Keeps on floating.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.640
 Anytime you go to a restaurant

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.840
 and you order up at the bar

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.120
 and they give you an item

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.880
 that says when this buzzes, come back.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.080
 That's when your meal is ready.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.960
 That's a pager.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.280
 No.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.560
 Yeah, that's pager technology.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.680
 Just using a different form.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.360
 I have one of those that I hang around my neck.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.640
 And you get a beep on it

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.160
 and it lets you know that your cans have been opened.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.880
 Do you know what they stopped doing?

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.880
 Because they've been around for decades, actually.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.400
 I think they've stopped doing this.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.440
 Although I've never tested it,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.360
 they obviously have a range that you can't go out of.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.520
 And they used to shout at you.

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.160
 So pagers often used to speak instead of beeping.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.320
 And if you went more than 100 feet away, they'd shout,

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.080
 "You are out of range."

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.080
 So it was just so embarrassing

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.240
 if you go and try and sneak into the shop next door.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.600
 Actually, just a normal one.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.120
 I can't say this is true of all of them,

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.880
 but they have a range of about half a mile.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.640
 So that's quite long.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.840
 That means in most restaurants,

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.280
 you could just go to the pub.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.800
 Near as pub, in London anyway.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.760
 That's around the middle of nowhere.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.880
 So sometimes pagers would have a thing

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.040
 in the '70s, '80s, '90s,

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.760
 where if you wanted to contact someone on their pager,

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.880
 you would call a number

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.080
 and you'd get through to a switchboard.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.720
 And you'd say, "Can you contact this pager?"

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.840
 And it's from this number.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.160
 And then the person would send a message to the pager,

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.160
 and they'd have a series of messages that they could send.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.680
 So if you were the wife calling,

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.440
 the message would be programmed to come up,

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.240
 "Call your wife."

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.000
 Or if you were work calling, it would be,

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.720
 "Go to the office."

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.920
 Or if you're a doctor, it would be,

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.960
 "Go to the hospital."

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.000
 Which is also your work.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.200
 Yeah, so you don't need those two messages

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.320
 if you are a doctor.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.960
 But if you're not, you know, useful.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.600
 Anyway, it was reading a really good article

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.000
 in The New York Times from 1976.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.880
 Which is talking about the pros and cons of pagers.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.240
 And it does say,

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.800
 "The problem is almost every beeper wearer

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.560
 has a story to tell of the beeper going off

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.680
 at the wrong time."

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.120
 And this is an issue with them.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.600
 So for instance, a salesman we spoke to

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.400
 said that one evening,

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.240
 he was having a very pleasant conversation

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.200
 with a young woman.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.440
 And just when he felt that he was making an impression

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.640
 and he was getting somewhere,

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.400
 his pager blared out,

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.440
 "Call your wife."

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.280
 Honestly, what a nightmare.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.360
 The pager is definitely the bad guy in this article.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.120
 And they did actually speak to an answering service

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:25.680
 in New Orleans,

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.920
 one of the interchange services,

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.480
 which said,

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.280
 "We have 1,400 pagers in our system

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.840
 and not a single one when the wife calls

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.000
 asks them to say the message, "Call your wife."

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.800
 They all said,

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.200
 "I'd like the message, "Call your answering service."

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.280
 Please, to come up."

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.840
 Or just, you know, go to work.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.000
 Every man thinks there might be a situation

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.080
 where I don't want the message to come up,

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.040
 "Call your wife."

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.000
 That is outrageous.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:50.800
 That is men.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.320
 Answering service.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.800
 It's such an awful euphemism for life.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.120
 So I think of myself.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.400
 Have you guys heard of gaydar?

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.240
 Heard of it?

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.680
 Yes, I have.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.360
 The idea that gay people can tell whether other people are gay.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.800
 Yeah, but in 1999,

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.400
 someone invented a device

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.600
 which has been described as a kind of electronic pager,

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.840
 which was called gaydar.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.240
 And what it would be was for guys

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.480
 who were walking through big parks

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.800
 and if they saw someone that looked good looking

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.160
 and they didn't want to embarrass themselves

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.040
 by hitting on them,

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.440
 they would have their gaydar go off

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.280
 because they had a gaydar as well.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:29.760
 What?

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.840
 So it was an electronic device that you kept on you.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.040
 Well, what if I'm with my wife?

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:37.040
 What's that coming from your ass, Andy?

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:42.800
 Yeah, so they invented it.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.760
 And this guy called Graham Lees was one of the inventors.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.760
 And so he went to test it out in a park

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.200
 and he walked through the park.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200
 And unfortunately, they discovered quite quickly...

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.080
 No one else had one.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.320
 Buzzing around the park, crying.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.400
 Well, I assume there must have been someone else

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.440
 that was in the park.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.960
 And he didn't know they were testing it.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.600
 Unfortunately, they hadn't fully tested out the frequencies

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.120
 and it was at the wrong frequency.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.640
 So instead of spotting someone else

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.320
 who was wearing one of the gaydars,

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.560
 he was suddenly chased by a horny badger.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.240
 There was squirrels.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.240
 There were squirrels that were coming after him.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:16.800
 What?

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.240
 He then, as he was running away from them...

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.440
 Sorry, no badger.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.320
 Has ever hornily chased a person with a vibrating tail?

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.920
 We all have vibrating phones now.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.360
 We've all been chased by badgers every day.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.480
 The frequency is a specific frequency.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.480
 There's a love note for badgers, is what you'll say.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.040
 Exactly.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.280
 He set off car alarms as he walked by

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.440
 because the frequency just met a certain tone

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.400
 that made them erupt.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.080
 It's the one special frequency

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.160
 that works for all cars and all badgers.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.640
 Yeah, badgers, squirrels and car alarms.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.080
 No, you all can come back to your car.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.200
 There's a badger humping it.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.320
 No arms going up.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.760
 OK, that's it.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.720
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.920
