00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:19,00:00:24,"from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:24,00:00:29,"Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray, and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that in 1950s America,"
00:00:41,00:00:46,flight attendants consulted an alcohol chart of the sky so they knew when they were allowed to
00:00:46,00:00:53,"serve booze. Wow. Yeah. So is that because, it must be because some parts of America you can't drink,"
00:00:53,00:01:00,but does that mean Colorado goes all the way up to the top of the universe? Where does it end? Does
00:01:00,00:01:06,"the ISS, are they not allowed to drink their snuck up portions of booze that they hide? Yeah."
00:01:06,00:01:12,"This is the 1950s where there were a lot of dry states in America, and that dry ban expanded"
00:01:12,00:01:16,"all the way up to 30,000 feet into the air. I suppose it makes sense, because let's say you"
00:01:16,00:01:21,"lived in a dry county, and you thought, well I'm gonna get out of this, I'm gonna hire a hot air"
00:01:21,00:01:26,"balloon, and I'm just gonna float off the ground and drink a load of booze. It makes sense that"
00:01:26,00:01:30,they stopped that from happening. That would be my first thought. Exactly. But you used to be
00:01:30,00:01:34,"able to go off short, didn't you? That's true. And that's how people would get around it. But so"
00:01:34,00:01:37,"this is the issue, is that obviously you're in a plane that's flying over multiple states. Do all"
00:01:37,00:01:42,"laws apply above all this? You know there's like 12 weird laws, and it's like you're not allowed to"
00:01:42,00:01:48,"kick a horse in a higher on a Sunday. And you're flying over in a plane, and you're like stop kicking"
00:01:48,00:01:54,that horse. Anyone intending to marry a second wife is now allowed for the next 30 minutes.
00:01:54,00:02:00,"Was it the case that you'd have to say quickly down it, we're about to hit Pennsylvania?"
00:02:00,00:02:04,"Yeah, it's really odd. What I couldn't find was if it's the sale of alcohol, because they used to"
00:02:04,00:02:09,"sell the alcohol on board there, or whether or not. So exactly, we're approaching Pennsylvania,"
00:02:09,00:02:14,"quick everyone. And so, yes, skull, skull, skull. And the way that it was done is the flight attendants"
00:02:14,00:02:18,"would look out the windows for monuments, so they'd be like, oh okay, we're coming up for that now."
00:02:19,00:02:23,"What? Yeah, yeah, there was so many restrictions. How can you tell you're in Pennsylvania from the air?"
00:02:23,00:02:28,"Well, just to say this, surely the pilot had a better way of knowing where they were going,"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"the muttering down, saying look, there's a church that I recognize. Well, remember back in the 50s,"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"with mail delivery, they just had big arrows on the ground. Concrete arrows. Yeah, to point that side."
00:02:37,00:02:41,"Yeah, I don't know what it was like. Having been in a helicopter with my wife flying, it's only a"
00:02:41,00:02:45,"small helicopter, so we don't have that much instruments and stuff. But you do, like you have"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"a map and it's like, there's a golf course here and you're like, my wife's like, can you check"
00:02:49,00:02:52,"there's a golf course on the left hand side? Yes, there is. Okay, we're going in the right"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"direction. Yeah, unfortunately, you always get lost because you're only looking for the next golf course."
00:02:56,00:03:03,"But it wasn't just that. The attendant would have to know, is this state allowing drinking on a Sunday"
00:03:03,00:03:07,or an election day? What are the hour restrictions? Because sometimes they're just restricted for
00:03:07,00:03:12,"certain hours. So yeah, certain holidays that are being celebrated there, are we allowed to drink"
00:03:12,00:03:18,"then or not? So question, yeah, there are still dry states in America. Why did they not do this"
00:03:18,00:03:27,"anymore? I guess maybe they've realized. It was weird being an air stewardess in the 1950s, wasn't"
00:03:27,00:03:32,"it? Sorry, the fact that I paused at air stewardess does remind me how weird it also is that I still"
00:03:32,00:03:37,"think of air stewardess as the terminology, even though it stopped being the term in the 70s."
00:03:37,00:03:41,"Yeah, before you were born, in fact. Way before I was born. Wait, I just want to emphasize way"
00:03:41,00:03:49,"before I was born. Does everyone else do that? I cycle through them in my head, you know."
00:03:49,00:03:55,"Like hostess, stewardess, trolley dolly. I actually don't even think trolley dolly anymore,"
00:03:55,00:04:01,"I'd like to point out. It's so woke, Andy. I think we can call them flight attendants, can we?"
00:04:01,00:04:08,"Well, it was weird being a flight attendant in the 1950s and it was explicitly just for women."
00:04:08,00:04:13,"I hadn't quite realized how all flights in America, pretty much all airlines, stated men need not"
00:04:13,00:04:20,"apply, to the extent that there was a completely transformative lawsuit in 1971, which was brought"
00:04:20,00:04:26,"by a man who wanted to be a flight attendant, a guy called Celio Diaz, and they had a witness"
00:04:26,00:04:32,"for the airline, who was a guy called Eric Byrne, a psychiatrist, and he testified that"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"a flight attendant who was male would make passengers really uncomfortable. And he said,"
00:04:36,00:04:41,"you know, because you'll be effeminate. And he said it'll make male passengers uneasy,"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"as it might arouse feelings in him, he would rather not have aroused."
00:04:45,00:04:48,"Oh, there are definitely some states in America that you won't be able to do that."
00:04:48,00:04:54,"How interesting. And we've said before, I think, that the reason that they were women to start off"
00:04:54,00:05:00,"with is because they were nurses. Yeah, Ellen Church was, she wanted to become a pilot. They"
00:05:00,00:05:06,"said you can't. She made a case of saying, what if then you need a nurse on board? And while I'm"
00:05:06,00:05:13,"there, I can serve some drinks, I can, I can refuel the plane, just like a nurse. But her biggest"
00:05:13,00:05:18,"argument, I think, was that she said, if you have a woman on board, you're not going to have scared"
00:05:18,00:05:22,passengers because the men will be too afraid to admit that they're scared when there's a woman
00:05:22,00:05:28,"who's not scared on board. That was her pitch. And I think before that it was children, basically,"
00:05:28,00:05:32,"right? It was teenagers. Yeah. And again, it's like, you know, if the teenager's not scared,"
00:05:32,00:05:35,then we probably won't be scared. That's good logic. I think that would work for me.
00:05:35,00:05:40,Teenagers famously have no sense of risk. They have absolutely no clue whether something is
00:05:40,00:05:43,harmful or dangerous behaviour. That's true. Maybe it's more like the protective instinct.
00:05:43,00:05:47,You can't show you're afraid in front of a teenager because you're the grown up in the room.
00:05:47,00:05:51,"To be honest, one of the main reasons they were teenagers is because teenagers were a bit smaller"
00:05:51,00:05:58,"than adults. I'm talking now about the 1920s. There was an airline called Daimler Airway,"
00:05:58,00:06:04,"which went from Manchester to London in a biplane, which could carry nine passengers."
00:06:04,00:06:11,But this was a route you could take. And they had these cabin boys whose job was to hand out hot
00:06:11,00:06:16,"water bottles and earplugs and reassure you during the flight saying, don't worry, it's supposed to"
00:06:16,00:06:21,"be falling apart. It's the only days of flying. In 50 years, if it makes you feel better, this"
00:06:21,00:06:25,will be totally safe. I should just finish what I was saying about the guy who brought the lawsuit
00:06:25,00:06:31,"to say that in 1971, four years after he brought it, it was ruled that airlines could not discriminate"
00:06:31,00:06:35,against men. And it obviously also was a very homophobic thing. So we think of the fight
00:06:35,00:06:39,"tendons rules as being sexist, but it was also really homophobic. The idea was that these men"
00:06:39,00:06:44,would be effeminate and there'd be arousing homosexual feelings in other men that they didn't
00:06:44,00:06:50,"want to have. And in 1971, you weren't allowed to do that. Sadly, this poor guy who brought the"
00:06:50,00:06:55,"lawsuit was at that point too old to become an air steward. Oh, so it was Aegis as well."
00:06:55,00:07:01,"It was Aegis and he'd hit 35, yes. And women, we should also specify, were employed at first as"
00:07:01,00:07:05,nurses. But the reason that they employed only women after that was because they were fair
00:07:05,00:07:08,and they wanted the male passengers to be attracted to them. It was. And it's really
00:07:08,00:07:16,"interesting. Like until 1978 in America, if you took a plane from, let's say, Detroit to Chicago,"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"you had to charge a certain amount, no matter what. Do you mean ticket price, sorry?"
00:07:20,00:07:25,"Ticket price, yeah. Right. Exactly. So it was all dependent on the route and it was not dependent"
00:07:25,00:07:29,on anything else. And so you had to attract customers. So what would you do? You would
00:07:29,00:07:34,make it really attractive. So you would have like piano bars on your plane. You would have
00:07:34,00:07:40,"fillet stakes on your menu. You would have very attractive cabin crew, stuff like that."
00:07:40,00:07:46,"And then in 1978, they increased competition, complete race to the bottom, cheaper the better."
00:07:46,00:07:50,"They got rid of all the frills, no more pianos on planes, no more fillet steak,"
00:07:50,00:07:56,"hideous stuff at every turn, unbelievably ugly stuff. But what it meant was the race to the"
00:07:56,00:07:59,bottom meant that a lot of companies went out of business. So you had much fewer companies
00:07:59,00:08:04,who are running those routes. And it meant that the cabin crew had less sort of chance to move
00:08:04,00:08:10,"between different jobs. Right. Anyway, that's my rant against capitalism. Please enjoy my next"
00:08:10,00:08:16,TED talk. So you just want posh fillet stakes on your first class flights? First class for everyone.
00:08:16,00:08:21,Yeah. I remember I was on a flight coming back from Dubai and we were going through the craziest
00:08:21,00:08:25,"turbulence I've ever felt. You guys know I'm a nervous flyer. So that was, I was petrified."
00:08:25,00:08:31,"Were you? Yeah. And someone started screaming in the back, screaming. And it screamed, it kind of-"
00:08:31,00:08:37,"Was that the echo of your own screaming? We were traveling so fast, sound couldn't keep up with it."
00:08:37,00:08:42,"Yeah. No, this guy was yelling and he was yelling quite a few scary words. And so we were like,"
00:08:42,00:08:45,"oh my God, is this like a, is this a bombing? Is it a hijacking? Poltergeist!"
00:08:48,00:08:56,"Loneliness. Yeah. And so everyone's terrified. Everyone's really scared, but clearly the people"
00:08:56,00:09:00,know what's going on. And suddenly flight attendants were all running to the back. Now it turns out it
00:09:00,00:09:05,"was a medical emergency. Right. But my last thought that I always think about this, my last thought"
00:09:05,00:09:11,that had the plane had blown up in that moment was that I watched a chef run back and all I could
00:09:11,00:09:16,think was they have chefs up front. That's incredible. That was my final thought. How did
00:09:16,00:09:21,you know was he a chef? How do you know he was a chef? He had a giant white hat. He saw what was
00:09:21,00:09:29,"going on with Mum, Mum here. A huge long mustache. Yeah, yeah. Flipping a pancake as he ran. He was"
00:09:29,00:09:35,slicing some tribes at the big knife in midair as he went. Incredible. They don't have chefs on
00:09:35,00:09:39,"planes. Yes, they do. Chef is the, that's a perfect disguise. He fooled you absolutely. He was an"
00:09:39,00:09:46,"air marshal, but all air marshals these days stress as chefs. First class they have chefs. They do."
00:09:46,00:09:50,"Can I tell you about an incident that happened? This is not a flight I was on, but it is in the"
00:09:50,00:09:56,"great list of air rage incidents on Wikipedia. In 1995, a group of 18 British and Irish tourists"
00:09:56,00:10:01,got rowdy on a flight from London to Minneapolis. They started sending their children to steal
00:10:01,00:10:05,food and drink from the flight attendants' carts. So causing trouble. What they didn't know is that
00:10:05,00:10:10,several wrestlers from the US Olympic freestyle wrestling team were also on board the flight.
00:10:10,00:10:15,And did they take part or is it like a doctor? They're not allowed to intervene in situations
00:10:15,00:10:19,otherwise they're liable. I can't do a triple suplex on this child. He is my son.
00:10:19,00:10:25,"Yeah, they did know they piled in and they helped restrain the rowdy."
00:10:25,00:10:32,"Every 30 seconds, he's getting out the train table."
00:10:33,00:10:37,"Wait, doctors aren't allowed to intervene? No, they are."
00:10:37,00:10:43,"Is there a doctor on board? Yes, great. Can you stay where you are?"
00:10:43,00:10:48,"Can literally anyone else perform surgery? At TMCBR. I mean, I don't know the details,"
00:10:48,00:10:51,"but there's a thing where if you intervene, you feel like you are liable or you could be liable"
00:10:51,00:10:54,"for something. So obviously they do because they can save someone's life, but then if something"
00:10:54,00:10:58,"goes wrong, then suddenly they're wearing their doctor's hat. Yeah, because they're not wearing"
00:10:58,00:11:06,"their chef's hat. I was looking at some famous flight attendants. Kate Middleton's mum, Carol."
00:11:06,00:11:11,"Carol Middleton. Yeah, I'd say famous. Oh, there was snobbery about her, wasn't there?"
00:11:11,00:11:16,Strawberry. Snobbery. She always keeps a strawberry about a person.
00:11:16,00:11:22,"There was snobbery because they called her doors to manual or something, which is what you say"
00:11:22,00:11:28,"when the plane lands, don't you think? I didn't know about that, yeah. Johanna Sigurthardotir,"
00:11:28,00:11:34,"who was Prime Minister of Iceland from 2009 to 2013, and the country's first female PM and the"
00:11:34,00:11:41,"first openly LGBTQ head of government. She was a flight attendant. Marina Machete, who was the"
00:11:41,00:11:47,"first transgender winner of Miss Portugal. Marina Machete. It's such a great name, isn't it?"
00:11:47,00:11:50,You'd be too scared to take her on. Another one I was reading about was the first female
00:11:50,00:11:59,"steward in the Soviet Union called Elsa Garodetskaya, and she flew from Moscow to Ashkabat in Turkmenistan,"
00:11:59,00:12:04,"and it took 13 hours. And if you went by train, it would take 129 hours and 30 minutes."
00:12:04,00:12:09,So the flights were really important in the Soviet Union because these places are so far apart.
00:12:09,00:12:16,"And the best version of this I found was in Kazakhstan, there was a flight from Almaty to"
00:12:16,00:12:23,"Balcash, okay, and it was a two-hour flight, but if you wanted to go by train, it would take 157"
00:12:23,00:12:31,"hours because there was no direct train between the two cities. So you had to go from Kazakhstan,"
00:12:31,00:12:38,"from Almaty, all the way up to Novosibirsk in Siberia, and all the way back down again,"
00:12:38,00:12:42,and it would take about a week. And we regret to announce there's a five-minute delay to today's
00:12:42,00:12:50,"journey. Wow. Some flight attendant codes, a bit of language, so do you know what they say if they"
00:12:50,00:12:57,"find you attractive? No, and nor do you, and they be honest. As in they say it to you directly?"
00:12:57,00:13:02,"No, so it's one of these silly little sort of things that gets put into click-baity articles"
00:13:02,00:13:08,"online. I'm going back in there already. No, so right, you can either say ""Bob"" about someone."
00:13:08,00:13:11,"How would you say it? Like, what's the context? Best on board. Yeah, exactly."
00:13:12,00:13:18,"When do you sort of shout ""Bob"" up the plane? Why do you need a code?"
00:13:18,00:13:22,"You must be saying to your fellow attendants, ""Oh, there's a Bob in World 13 CB."""
00:13:22,00:13:30,"Or, as people get off the plane, you say ""Cheerio"" to them instead of ""Goodbye,"""
00:13:30,00:13:34,"or ""Thank you for flying with us,"" or whatever. There'll be a word that you say, you know."
00:13:34,00:13:37,"That's interesting. Toodaloo, or something."
00:13:37,00:13:41,Don't take this as gospel and humiliate yourself in front of just a perfectly
00:13:41,00:13:44,polite vice-attendant. It's not my sweet.
00:13:44,00:13:47,Cheerio. You just grab them like that guy at the end of World War II.
00:13:47,00:13:55,"I have a favourite flight attendant story, a story of honey traps, very topical."
00:13:55,00:13:59,"In the 1960s, the KGB was trying to blackmail the Indonesian president,"
00:13:59,00:14:05,the guy called Ahmad Sukarno. And the way that the KGB blackmailed him was that they had their
00:14:05,00:14:10,"agents on one of his flights, a private flight, disguise themselves as flight attendants and,"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"you know, serve him drinks and stuff and look sexy. And they flirted with him to the extent"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"that eventually he invited them to his hotel room when he landed. And they had a big old orgy,"
00:14:20,00:14:24,not knowing that the Soviets had hidden a camera behind the mirror in the room and filmed the
00:14:24,00:14:30,"entire orgy. And then, later on, the Soviets called him to a private cinema and gave him a"
00:14:30,00:14:36,private showing of himself having an orgy with these flight attendants who were in fact agents.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"And so, do you know what he did?"
00:14:39,00:14:40,Had a wink.
00:14:40,00:14:48,"Bad news, there's another camera in the cinema. He's filming that."
00:14:48,00:14:54,And he just kept happening again and again.
00:14:54,00:15:00,He's still there? That didn't happen. But he did ask for more copies that he could take home
00:15:00,00:15:03,to his homeland because he said the people would love him for it.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"That's very... I mean, that is funny."
00:15:04,00:15:05,Completely backfired.
00:15:06,00:15:15,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:15:15,00:15:19,My fact this week is that a team of ecologists have been studying the health of the oceans
00:15:19,00:15:24,by dissecting leftover tins of fish from the 1980s.
00:15:24,00:15:26,All these fish are dead!
00:15:26,00:15:31,"Yeah, it's quite... It's quite a roundabout way of doing it."
00:15:31,00:15:35,"It seems like half of the ocean was made of brine, but the other half was made out of"
00:15:35,00:15:41,olive oil. What about the spicy tomato sauce? That was Mediterranean.
00:15:41,00:15:43,"So what? Yeah, what's that?"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"Well, this is really ingenious. It's actually been published now."
00:15:45,00:15:50,"It's a paper in the Ecology and Evolution Journal, and it's research done by Chelsea Wood"
00:15:50,00:15:55,"and Natalie Mastic, who were looking into the health of marine mammals specifically."
00:15:55,00:15:58,So there's quite a few links in this chain.
00:15:58,00:16:01,They were looking at seals and whales and how their health had been over time.
00:16:01,00:16:05,"But to do that, they wanted to know what parasites have been in the ocean,"
00:16:05,00:16:08,"because parasites get into salmon and cause disease in salmon,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,and then seals and whales eat salmon.
00:16:10,00:16:14,"And then you know what kind of diseases seals and whales would have been getting,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,because these parasites will give them certain diseases.
00:16:16,00:16:21,So how did they find out what parasites were in the ocean 40 years ago?
00:16:21,00:16:25,"Well, they didn't know, and then suddenly out of the blue,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,"they got a call from a seafood products association in Seattle,"
00:16:28,00:16:32,"saying they were cleaning out their basement, had loads of long expired tins of salmon."
00:16:32,00:16:33,Did she want them?
00:16:33,00:16:37,"And she said, that's actually a great idea. Yeah, let's do it."
00:16:37,00:16:38,Does it work?
00:16:38,00:16:40,It worked. There were tins of tins of salmon.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"So can I just say, so this was 40 years ago, so just before you were born, Anna?"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"Just ages before I was born, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:48,Ages before you were born.
00:16:48,00:16:53,But does that mean that anyone eating salmon 40 years ago might have had parasites in their salmon?
00:16:53,00:16:55,"None of the parasites, when they opened the cans were alive,"
00:16:55,00:16:58,nor they'd been alive once they'd been canned.
00:16:58,00:16:59,So they'd burrow into salmon's muscle.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"They're right inside these muscle pockets,"
00:17:02,00:17:06,"and they said they could pick through the tinned muscle tissue with forceps,"
00:17:06,00:17:09,and see the worms like spring out of their muscles.
00:17:09,00:17:11,What? That's disgusting.
00:17:11,00:17:12,It's so disgusting.
00:17:12,00:17:15,"So if I eat salmon, that's not happening today, is it?"
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Yeah, you've got what?"
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Yeah, a magnifying glass on it."
00:17:18,00:17:21,"Salmon do have a lot of problems with, especially the farmed ones,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,because they're in such a tight proximity to each other.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Sorry, I'm really putting you off here."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"But they're so close that they get more, obviously they get more lice."
00:17:28,00:17:31,"Yeah, I know of that, but I've never seen worms in salmon."
00:17:31,00:17:32,"Yeah, they're there."
00:17:32,00:17:34,You've got to maybe get a magnifying glass to them.
00:17:34,00:17:36,Don't put a magnifying glass on anything.
00:17:36,00:17:37,It's the basic rule of food.
00:17:37,00:17:40,It's just that you're so off-put by whatever you see.
00:17:40,00:17:40,You're right.
00:17:40,00:17:47,"So the cans ranged from expired cans from 1979 to 2021,"
00:17:47,00:17:51,and they were literally able to plot the health can by can year by year.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"The parasite thing, I just found that really interesting."
00:17:53,00:17:55,"I don't fully understand the science of it,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"but basically the parasite in order to reproduce,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,it needed to be eaten by something.
00:17:59,00:18:00,That then is eaten.
00:18:00,00:18:02,So it's eaten by krill.
00:18:02,00:18:04,The krill is then eaten by salmon.
00:18:04,00:18:06,The salmon is then eaten by a marine mammal.
00:18:06,00:18:07,"And once it gets to the mammal,"
00:18:07,00:18:09,that's when it can reproduce and put its stuff back out.
00:18:09,00:18:11,And the cycle starts again.
00:18:11,00:18:13,So are you saying that these parasites don't survive
00:18:13,00:18:14,unless they end up in a mammal?
00:18:14,00:18:15,"Yeah, exactly."
00:18:15,00:18:16,They can't reproduce.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"It's like the old woman who swallows a fly,"
00:18:18,00:18:21,"but at the end, a giant fly bursts out of the horse."
00:18:21,00:18:22,It's sort of that disgusting.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"I wouldn't make such an appealing children's book, but yeah."
00:18:26,00:18:27,Canned din food.
00:18:27,00:18:31,"We have briefly mentioned Nicholas Appere,"
00:18:31,00:18:34,who discovered it.
00:18:34,00:18:35,There was a big competition in France
00:18:35,00:18:37,to find a way of preserving food
00:18:37,00:18:40,so that Napoleon could basically feed his armies overseas
00:18:40,00:18:42,and at long distances.
00:18:42,00:18:44,And it took 15 years and he won it.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"What we didn't say, I love this."
00:18:46,00:18:49,"He originally used ceramic container sealed with cork,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,but he's basically the father of canned food.
00:18:51,00:18:55,"The process was called, he was called Nicholas Appere."
00:18:55,00:18:56,It was called Appertising.
00:18:56,00:18:57,Spooky.
00:18:57,00:18:58,That is good.
00:18:58,00:18:59,It's appetising.
00:18:59,00:19:00,It's good branding.
00:19:00,00:19:00,Yeah.
00:19:00,00:19:02,Is it a pun or is that there's no correlation?
00:19:02,00:19:03,"No, it's one work in French."
00:19:03,00:19:04,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:04,00:19:05,His name is Appere and it's appetising.
00:19:05,00:19:07,An accidental pun.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Isn't that mad?
00:19:08,00:19:09,Wow.
00:19:09,00:19:10,Let's type.
00:19:10,00:19:11,He was so convinced about his work.
00:19:11,00:19:14,He published a book about it in 1810.
00:19:14,00:19:15,He was so confident about it.
00:19:15,00:19:19,He attached a small note to every copy with his address on it
00:19:19,00:19:21,so you could turn up at his house.
00:19:21,00:19:22,That's a great idea.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Andy, have you considered that for your novel"
00:19:24,00:19:25,for anyone who doesn't like it?
00:19:25,00:19:27,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:19:27,00:19:28,I will do anything.
00:19:28,00:19:31,"But his thing didn't really work that well, did it?"
00:19:31,00:19:32,"Oh, it did look."
00:19:32,00:19:33,"No, all the jars exploded."
00:19:33,00:19:36,"Some of the jars, come on."
00:19:36,00:19:37,They didn't well explode.
00:19:37,00:19:37,"Yeah, no."
00:19:37,00:19:40,What happens is you heat up the food
00:19:40,00:19:42,so that it kills all the bacteria and stuff.
00:19:42,00:19:44,"But if you don't do it well enough,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,the bacteria will create gases
00:19:46,00:19:48,and the gases will get more and more and more
00:19:48,00:19:49,and eventually bang.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Right.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Quite exciting opening the pantry, isn't it, every day?"
00:19:52,00:19:55,You had to wear face masks.
00:19:55,00:19:58,I quite like that the original tins were champagne bottles.
00:19:58,00:20:02,Because the first thing that he can stuff in
00:20:02,00:20:04,was empty champagne bottles.
00:20:04,00:20:04,Really?
00:20:04,00:20:05,Yeah.
00:20:05,00:20:08,And there were champagne bottles corked with cheese.
00:20:08,00:20:11,What a disgusting image of the cork pops.
00:20:11,00:20:13,It's just this foaming cheese.
00:20:13,00:20:14,Are you joking?
00:20:14,00:20:17,"Like, it's cheese and wine together at last."
00:20:17,00:20:17,Yeah.
00:20:19,00:20:21,Only a French inventor would have come up
00:20:21,00:20:22,with the empty champagne bottles of the cheese.
00:20:22,00:20:25,How the hell do you shove a whole duck into a champagne bottle?
00:20:25,00:20:26,"Well, I'm delighted that you've asked."
00:20:26,00:20:28,He found this a bit of a problem at first.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"And he found, surprisingly enough,"
00:20:29,00:20:32,they weren't wide enough to fit a lot of foods in them.
00:20:32,00:20:35,But he doctored them so that they cut off the top
00:20:35,00:20:38,so that it widened the neck.
00:20:38,00:20:40,"And then, yeah, stuffed it with cheese and lime"
00:20:40,00:20:42,wrapped in cloth to cork it.
00:20:42,00:20:44,I assume it's lime as in the stone.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Quick lime.
00:20:45,00:20:47,"Yeah, quick lime as opposed to--"
00:20:47,00:20:49,"Not to squeeze of lime, just to squeeze."
00:20:49,00:20:52,But then it was a guy called Philip de Gérard
00:20:52,00:20:54,"who came up with the tin can,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,which is closer to what we have today.
00:20:57,00:20:58,"He was also French,"
00:20:58,00:21:00,but he actually sold it to the British.
00:21:00,00:21:04,He gave the patent to a guy called Peter Durand.
00:21:04,00:21:05,And Peter Durand--
00:21:05,00:21:07,"Who also sounds French, do you?"
00:21:07,00:21:08,"Yes, he does."
00:21:08,00:21:10,"Yeah, but he was Durand."
00:21:10,00:21:11,Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:11,Durand.
00:21:11,00:21:12,There you go.
00:21:12,00:21:16,"And basically became part of the British army,"
00:21:16,00:21:17,then started using the tins.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"And actually, at the Battle of Waterloo,"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"the British army had loads of these French tins,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,which must have seemed a bit off to the French.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"It's so weird that he was the front man, Peter Durand,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,because he was completely the front man.
00:21:28,00:21:29,He did not come up with the idea.
00:21:29,00:21:31,And it was also that Gérard could get his thing through.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"One reason, because the English didn't trust the French."
00:21:34,00:21:37,So if a Frenchman came over with these tins of food
00:21:37,00:21:39,"and said, ""Hey, everyone, buy these,"""
00:21:39,00:21:41,no one would believe him because he was French.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:42,00:21:44,So he needed someone with a French-sounding name.
00:21:45,00:21:48,But then Durand sold the patent after a couple of years
00:21:48,00:21:51,"to a man who I think we've mentioned it once before,"
00:21:51,00:21:51,Brian Duncan.
00:21:51,00:21:55,"That is a solid English name, isn't it?"
00:21:55,00:21:56,Brian Duncan.
00:21:56,00:21:57,You don't get more English than that.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"God, I've had a throwback to like 10 years"
00:21:59,00:22:02,"of you constantly going, ""Donk, donk, donk, donk."""
00:22:02,00:22:03,What was that?
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Well, that was just an old music style donk."
00:22:05,00:22:06,"Yeah, donk."
00:22:06,00:22:07,Do you not remember that?
00:22:07,00:22:08,James had always mentioned that.
00:22:08,00:22:10,It's honestly like 10 years ago.
00:22:10,00:22:13,It was like a northern music style where it was like dance
00:22:13,00:22:15,"music, but it would be like, ""Donk, donk, donk, donk,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,"put a donk on it."""
00:22:16,00:22:18,You take a normal tune and you put a donk on it.
00:22:18,00:22:20,It's like a remix.
00:22:20,00:22:22,"But I once got Stephen Fry to say,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,"""Put a donk on it on QI as part of a bet."""
00:22:24,00:22:25,That's it.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Yeah.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"Did he also invent the music, Brian Duncan,"
00:22:28,00:22:29,or was he just the front man for that?
00:22:29,00:22:31,"Duncan invented the donk, and he made it big on that."
00:22:31,00:22:33,"No, so he was an amazing engineer."
00:22:33,00:22:34,It's from Northumbria.
00:22:34,00:22:35,He was a metalworker.
00:22:35,00:22:37,He had a paper-making machine business.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"He patented the first steel pen,"
00:22:40,00:22:43,and then he starts making corned beef in his preservatory.
00:22:43,00:22:45,He's just a legend this guy.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"And then in 1813, he presented his beef to the Duke of Kent,"
00:22:48,00:22:49,not a euphemism.
00:22:49,00:22:55,He got a letter back from Four Royals saying the Queen herself
00:22:55,00:22:57,"had tasted and enjoyed his canned beef again,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,and he got the patent.
00:22:59,00:23:01,And he's so popular.
00:23:01,00:23:02,He was so popular.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"There is a cove in Chile, which is called Catela Donkin,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,because the crew had loved their Donkin-tinned meat so much.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"We already have Donkin statues now,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,"and maybe there are some in Northumbria,"
00:23:12,00:23:15,"but I've never-- like, he should be a national hero."
00:23:15,00:23:16,And he's completely forgotten.
00:23:16,00:23:18,There was an amazing BBC article.
00:23:18,00:23:21,"It was really, really a long one about his life and canned food,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,but Donkin is a huge part of it.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"He's buried in Nunhead Cemetery, which is in South London,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,and his name is a footnote beneath three other guys
00:23:27,00:23:29,"all called Brian Duncan, who--"
00:23:29,00:23:30,Who are related to him?
00:23:30,00:23:31,Who are related to him?
00:23:31,00:23:34,He's put all the random Donkins in one place.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"It's a mass Donkin grave, wasn't it?"
00:23:36,00:23:37,It was called Donkin Donkins.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"There's one angry guy trying to kill Brian Duncan,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"got it wrong three times, finally got it right."
00:23:43,00:23:44,I know.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"He did do lots of other stuff, didn't he?"
00:23:45,00:23:49,"He worked with Brunel, Brunel's son, on the Thames Tunnel."
00:23:49,00:23:51,He worked on Charles Babbage's computer.
00:23:51,00:23:53,He was multi-talented.
00:23:53,00:23:55,And as John Nutting of the Cannes--
00:23:55,00:23:59,It's just a great name.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"John Nutting, editor of the Cannes Maker magazine."
00:24:02,00:24:04,Never go to the cinema alone with John Nutting.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"Wait, why not?"
00:24:07,00:24:09,It's euphemism for masturbating.
00:24:09,00:24:12,"Right, I just thought it was headbutting someone."
00:24:12,00:24:15,So I think that could have led to all sorts of confusion
00:24:15,00:24:16,in my life.
00:24:16,00:24:23,"Anyway, he's editor of the Cannes Maker magazine."
00:24:23,00:24:25,"Either way, we'll get you kicked out of a weather spoon"
00:24:25,00:24:25,for the Friday night.
00:24:25,00:24:31,"The double nutting, that's why you're getting arrested."
00:24:31,00:24:34,"He's just a big fan of Duncan, Duncan and Nutting."
00:24:34,00:24:37,"He said, lamented that he's forgotten by the wider world,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,"which I always think when people say,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,"""Can we believe he's lost to history?"""
00:24:40,00:24:42,I can believe it.
00:24:42,00:24:44,I agree he's done an important thing.
00:24:44,00:24:46,He's come up with sort of tin canning
00:24:46,00:24:48,or like commercialized the process.
00:24:48,00:24:51,What do you expect for that to be a household name?
00:24:51,00:24:52,200 years later?
00:24:52,00:24:53,"No, no, no."
00:24:53,00:24:54,"I mean, it's been sad truth."
00:24:54,00:24:56,"Well, anyway, nice to dust off the donk."
00:24:56,00:25:00,There's a really old fact on QI
00:25:00,00:25:02,that it took 50 years after the invention of the Cannes
00:25:02,00:25:02,to invent the Cannes.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Oh yeah, oh yeah."
00:25:04,00:25:06,I'm sure we've said that before on this show as well.
00:25:06,00:25:07,I didn't realize that there are actually
00:25:07,00:25:09,really good reasons for that.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"Firstly, the first process,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,there were only six Cannes made an hour.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"So, you know, there wasn't the mass market."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"If you invent a tin opener,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,they're going to open them quicker than you can make them.
00:25:19,00:25:19,Exactly.
00:25:19,00:25:23,It's not worth it.
00:25:23,00:25:25,"And secondly, they were made of wrought iron"
00:25:25,00:25:26,and lined with tin.
00:25:26,00:25:27,They were thick.
00:25:27,00:25:30,No modern Cannes opener would have possibly
00:25:30,00:25:32,been able to crack into this.
00:25:32,00:25:33,What was the method back then to get into them?
00:25:33,00:25:35,"Just chisel, hammer and chisel."
00:25:35,00:25:37,"I mean, very few, in my experience,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,very few modern Cannes openers can open modern Cannes.
00:25:39,00:25:43,"So, modern ones are steel and they're incredibly thin."
00:25:43,00:25:46,But the original ones were just so thick.
00:25:46,00:25:46,I love this.
00:25:46,00:25:50,"In 1860s America, shop grocery clerks"
00:25:50,00:25:52,would open your cans for you to take home.
00:25:52,00:25:53,Yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:54,They would open it in the shop.
00:25:54,00:25:56,You would have your cans open for you.
00:25:56,00:25:57,That's quite nice.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"Actually, I quite like that with jars."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"Like a jar of pickles, just go to the person"
00:26:03,00:26:04,who's scattered in the street.
00:26:04,00:26:07,"Well, you wouldn't mind losing in the bar, would you say?"
00:26:07,00:26:09,Slowly walking back along the high street.
00:26:09,00:26:11,Imagine you're in the queue.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Like, there's always so many different reasons"
00:26:13,00:26:15,that it's going to take ages at the counter
00:26:15,00:26:16,when someone's in front of you
00:26:16,00:26:18,and you just see the person who's scanning all the stuff
00:26:18,00:26:19,heads off to get a chisel and a hammer.
00:26:19,00:26:22,"And you're like, oh, shit, cashier off the cashier."
00:26:22,00:26:25,Jimmy with the big wrists is trying to open your cans for you.
00:26:25,00:26:26,Jimmy big wrists.
00:26:26,00:26:28,Jimmy nutting.
00:26:29,00:26:35,I found out about an invention in canopening
00:26:35,00:26:38,"that I didn't know about, and it was almost 100 years ago."
00:26:38,00:26:39,Wow.
00:26:39,00:26:40,So just before you were born.
00:26:40,00:26:42,So she was before I was born.
00:26:42,00:26:44,So the electric canopener.
00:26:44,00:26:45,Did you guys know this was a thing?
00:26:45,00:26:46,Was it my room?
00:26:46,00:26:47,I own one.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Why have I been struggling away
00:26:48,00:26:51,with these coffee plastic things?
00:26:51,00:26:52,This is no exaggeration.
00:26:52,00:26:55,My electric can opener is probably the best thing
00:26:55,00:26:56,I've ever bought.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Wow.
00:26:57,00:26:59,I think it's a genius thing.
00:26:59,00:27:01,"You just put it on, you press a button,"
00:27:01,00:27:02,and then it opens the can.
00:27:02,00:27:03,That's so good.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Invented in 1931.
00:27:04,00:27:08,Why didn't they all have them by 1932?
00:27:08,00:27:09,Why don't I have one today?
00:27:09,00:27:11,"I mean, it sounds like they are readily available to buy."
00:27:11,00:27:12,They are.
00:27:12,00:27:14,You could just go to a shop and buy them.
00:27:14,00:27:16,"Well, we don't all have James's secret sources."
00:27:16,00:27:19,You guys heard it here first.
00:27:19,00:27:20,I've actually never heard one.
00:27:20,00:27:21,And it does sound like a...
00:27:21,00:27:23,"I mean, James has given it at the hard sale."
00:27:23,00:27:27,"Genuinely, I would say it is one of my favorite items"
00:27:27,00:27:28,in my entire house.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Wow.
00:27:29,00:27:30,Including his wife and child.
00:27:30,00:27:34,The only thing that obviously puts them out of business
00:27:34,00:27:37,a little bit at the moment is those ring pull tins
00:27:37,00:27:39,"that you get, like a lot of them are ring pull."
00:27:39,00:27:41,So I will deliberately buy tins
00:27:41,00:27:43,"that don't have the ring pull on,"
00:27:43,00:27:44,so I can use my tin opener.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"In the aftertimes, once the food's run out"
00:27:47,00:27:49,"and everyone has used up all the ring pull cans,"
00:27:49,00:27:50,you're going to be the king.
00:27:50,00:27:52,"Exactly, until the batteries run out."
00:27:52,00:27:53,"Oh, yeah, then your stuff."
00:27:53,00:27:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:55,00:27:57,A glorious two and a half weeks.
00:27:57,00:27:59,I will be the king of the world.
00:27:59,00:28:01,Does it have a manual setting?
00:28:01,00:28:04,"Like, can you do it if the batteries run out?"
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Yeah, if the batteries run out, you're knackered."
00:28:05,00:28:06,Wow.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Um, yeah."
00:28:07,00:28:09,You should just pull all the rings off your cans
00:28:09,00:28:10,when you buy them.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"Yeah, I do ask the person in the shop to do that for me."
00:28:13,00:28:17,Funny.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"Yeah, electric can open it."
00:28:20,00:28:21,Is it big?
00:28:21,00:28:22,Does it have to sit on the counter?
00:28:22,00:28:23,Or is it not?
00:28:23,00:28:24,"No, it's this big."
00:28:24,00:28:25,If it was solar-
00:28:25,00:28:25,It's a bit chunky.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"If it was solar-powered, you could have permanent-"
00:28:28,00:28:28,"Yeah, it's not."
00:28:28,00:28:30,"Yeah, it's not, I'm not, I'm afraid."
00:28:30,00:28:32,It's probably not very good for the environment.
00:28:32,00:28:36,But I find them so useful.
00:28:36,00:28:36,"Yeah, that is good."
00:28:36,00:28:39,"I think that's not a big cost for the environment, frankly."
00:28:39,00:28:41,"I've got, but I've got solar on my roof."
00:28:41,00:28:42,"So if you come round,"
00:28:42,00:28:45,we could form a power couple in the aftertimes.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"The original power couple, the opposite of the original."
00:28:50,00:28:51,The post-apocalyptic power couple.
00:28:51,00:28:54,He can harness the sun.
00:28:54,00:28:55,He can open your tins.
00:28:55,00:29:00,"Right, you're sort of giving yourself the main part in that, aren't you?"
00:29:00,00:29:10,"And Dan and Anna will find some jobs for you, you know?"
00:29:10,00:29:11,"I'm good, thanks."
00:29:11,00:29:13,Cansardines.
00:29:13,00:29:14,This is a nice thing.
00:29:14,00:29:15,I didn't know this.
00:29:15,00:29:19,They have their own kind of connoisseurs
00:29:19,00:29:20,and vintage years.
00:29:20,00:29:21,No.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"Oh, wow."
00:29:22,00:29:25,"If you buy an expensive can of sardines,"
00:29:25,00:29:28,you might prefer to get a 2004 vintage
00:29:28,00:29:30,compared to a 2008 vintage.
00:29:30,00:29:30,"That's incredible, right?"
00:29:30,00:29:32,Are there people at the restaurant who send them back?
00:29:32,00:29:34,So this is a 1993.
00:29:34,00:29:36,Ask specifically for the '97.
00:29:36,00:29:37,This is corks.
00:29:37,00:29:38,This is tinned.
00:29:38,00:29:40,It's absolutely amazing.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"So there are like companies like,"
00:29:42,00:29:43,"who I'd never heard of,"
00:29:43,00:29:46,like Rodel and Connoitabla in France.
00:29:46,00:29:48,And they sell these sardines.
00:29:48,00:29:51,"And the thing is, apparently sardines get better"
00:29:51,00:29:52,"the longer they're in the can,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,up to a certain number of years.
00:29:55,00:29:57,But what happens is the flesh becomes much smoother
00:29:57,00:30:00,"and more tender and the bones eventually kind of disappear,"
00:30:00,00:30:03,the tiny bones that you get in your sardines.
00:30:03,00:30:06,Eventually it just becomes a mush of sardine.
00:30:06,00:30:09,And that's the absolute best time to buy them.
00:30:09,00:30:11,And you get people who just buy them
00:30:11,00:30:13,and then just keep them for 10 years
00:30:13,00:30:14,until they're exactly the right moment
00:30:14,00:30:16,and then they'll eat the sardines.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"Again, that'll be funny for the prepping."
00:30:19,00:30:19,Don't have that.
00:30:19,00:30:22,Exactly when the nuclear war happened.
00:30:22,00:30:22,"Yeah, exactly."
00:30:22,00:30:24,We need to keep that another seven years.
00:30:24,00:30:28,And apparently you have to flip the tins every six months.
00:30:28,00:30:29,Like a mattress.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Like a mattress.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"Just, I don't know,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,I think it's so that the oil or whatever
00:30:36,00:30:40,gets nicely distributed and doesn't settle.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"This is really interesting, James,"
00:30:41,00:30:43,because my mum went to Portugal last year
00:30:43,00:30:44,"and she brought back tinned,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"because Portugal, they're obsessed with canned fish, aren't they?"
00:30:47,00:30:49,And they have these really beautiful tins.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"And she brought back cans for each of her children,"
00:30:52,00:30:53,"of which I am one,"
00:30:53,00:30:54,with our year of birth written on them.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Really?
00:30:55,00:30:56,And mine just said 1986.
00:30:56,00:30:58,And I just thought that's a nice design
00:30:58,00:30:59,and cracked into it and had it on toast.
00:30:59,00:31:02,But I suspect that was actually a 1986 vintage.
00:31:02,00:31:05,Did it taste better than any other sardines you'd ever eaten?
00:31:05,00:31:07,It was sort of full of crawling maggots.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"But aside from that, it was actually delicious, yeah."
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Did you just, as we know, your mum would go,"
00:31:12,00:31:12,"""Oh, what?"
00:31:12,00:31:13,"""Crawling maggots?"
00:31:13,00:31:15,"""We used to eat those every single week."""
00:31:15,00:31:17,"Exactly, it's a delicacy."
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Also, did you just slip in your birth year"
00:31:18,00:31:20,to prove that you're not 100 years old?
00:31:20,00:31:25,"God damn it, cut that out, edit it out."
00:31:25,00:31:34,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:31:34,00:31:36,"Okay, my fact this week is that German writer"
00:31:36,00:31:41,Christoph Friedrich Nicolai treated his visions of ghosts
00:31:41,00:31:44,by applying leeches to his anus.
00:31:44,00:31:48,"Really built that fight, doesn't it?"
00:31:48,00:31:50,Did it work?
00:31:50,00:31:51,Yeah.
00:31:51,00:31:54,How's it worked?
00:31:54,00:31:57,"Okay, come on."
00:31:57,00:31:58,Explain yourself.
00:31:58,00:32:01,"So, he had previously suffered from something"
00:32:01,00:32:02,that he called a violent giddiness.
00:32:02,00:32:05,And he was treated by leeches.
00:32:05,00:32:09,And he was kept having these treatments.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"And then one time he missed his treatment,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,and he started seeing what he thought was ghosts.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"He said, ""I observed at a distance of 10 paces"
00:32:16,00:32:18,"""the figure of a deceased person."
00:32:18,00:32:20,"""I asked my wife whether she saw it."
00:32:20,00:32:23,"""She saw nothing, but being much alarmed"
00:32:23,00:32:24,"""sent for the physician."""
00:32:24,00:32:28,"Okay, and so then what he did was, he decided,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,"he was a bit of a skeptic, a bit of a scientist,"
00:32:30,00:32:34,"so he decided he would not take any more leeches for a while,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"put up with the ghosts, and then after a while,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,he would try the leeches and see if it got rid of the ghosts.
00:32:40,00:32:43,"And sure enough, a bit later he presented"
00:32:43,00:32:46,is what he called his memoir on the appearance of spectres
00:32:46,00:32:48,or phantoms occasioned by disease
00:32:48,00:32:51,to the Berlin Academy of Sciences.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"And he said that he applied the leeches to the anus,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,"and they went away, the ghosts."
00:32:56,00:32:59,And he concluded that the ghosts originated
00:32:59,00:33:02,"in my internal consciousness alone,"
00:33:02,00:33:03,a consciousness that was disordered.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"So, he was kind of disproving the ghosts existed"
00:33:06,00:33:10,"by saying there was a physical treatment for these ghosts,"
00:33:10,00:33:11,"and that means there's no such thing as a ghost,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,it was all in my head.
00:33:13,00:33:13,Yeah.
00:33:13,00:33:16,And was there a reason he had to apply it to his anus?
00:33:16,00:33:17,Why his anus?
00:33:17,00:33:20,I think it was an easy way to get up blood.
00:33:20,00:33:21,"It's easy access, isn't it?"
00:33:21,00:33:22,"It is, yeah."
00:33:22,00:33:24,It's sort of easy access.
00:33:24,00:33:26,I think your hand is even easier access.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"No, a leech is better than your hand,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,for getting blood out of your anus.
00:33:31,00:33:34,I believe that there was like a relatively common place
00:33:34,00:33:36,to put leeches back in the day.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"Well, King George III used to put them on his temples"
00:33:38,00:33:42,when he was suffering from his bouts of depression and so on.
00:33:42,00:33:44,"So, when was this guy?"
00:33:44,00:33:45,When was this paper?
00:33:45,00:33:48,"Sorry, I should say who Christoph Friedrich Nicolai was."
00:33:48,00:33:52,"So, this problem that he had was in 1799."
00:33:52,00:33:55,"He was German, he was around at the same time"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"as lots of other German writers that you would know,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"such as Goethe, and in fact he had a..."
00:34:01,00:34:03,You've listed all the German writers I would know.
00:34:03,00:34:04,I might come to some more.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"So, he had a big argument with Goethe, actually."
00:34:08,00:34:12,"So, Goethe wrote a book called The Sorrows of Jungwurther,"
00:34:12,00:34:13,"which we have mentioned before,"
00:34:13,00:34:17,"which was about a depressed young man,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,and actually a lot of people copied this young man
00:34:19,00:34:21,and dressed like him and committed suicide and so on.
00:34:21,00:34:25,"So, it was like a real massive, massive deal in Germany."
00:34:25,00:34:28,"And Nicolai wrote The Joys of Jungwurther,"
00:34:28,00:34:32,which was kind of a slam on the sorrows of Jungwurther.
00:34:32,00:34:36,"And then Goethe, in response, composed a poem"
00:34:36,00:34:39,where Nicolai stood next to Wurther's grave and defecates on it.
00:34:39,00:34:43,And he also put him in Faust.
00:34:43,00:34:45,"Not one of his most famous works, was it?"
00:34:45,00:34:46,Faust is one of his...
00:34:46,00:34:49,"It sure is, yeah, there's very little defecating in Faust, is there?"
00:34:49,00:34:54,"There isn't, but there is a character called the Proctofantasmist,"
00:34:54,00:35:00,who was actually Nicolai in disguise who put leeches on his bum.
00:35:00,00:35:04,"And in Faust, Goethe says he is about to sit down in a puddle."
00:35:04,00:35:06,That's the way his soul acts.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"And when leeches feast on his rump,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,he is cured of ghosts and ghouls.
00:35:10,00:35:11,Wow.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"I mean, it must have been a big deal at the time."
00:35:14,00:35:14,He's made it into that.
00:35:14,00:35:17,That's not the only work of fiction that he's made it into.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"He also was in a story called Mrs. Zant and the Ghost,"
00:35:20,00:35:23,"which was written by friend of the podcast, Wilkie Collins."
00:35:23,00:35:24,Really?
00:35:24,00:35:24,Yeah.
00:35:24,00:35:28,"And so, and in reference to the hallucinations and so on."
00:35:28,00:35:30,"So, it must have been the talk of the town."
00:35:30,00:35:32,"Yeah, ETA Hoffman wrote about him."
00:35:32,00:35:33,Schlegel wrote about him.
00:35:33,00:35:34,Not Schlegel.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"Schlegel, you know Schlegel."
00:35:36,00:35:37,I've heard the name.
00:35:37,00:35:38,You know him from the philosopher's song.
00:35:38,00:35:40,That's literally what I was about to say.
00:35:40,00:35:41,I was saying Monty Python's.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"Yeah, he's just as drunk as Schlegel."
00:35:43,00:35:46,"But yeah, Schlegel was a linguist,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,"basically, who's a philosopher as well and stuff."
00:35:49,00:35:52,"ETA Hoffman wrote the Nutcracker, I think."
00:35:52,00:35:52,"Oh, wow."
00:35:52,00:35:53,That's big news.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"So, you know, they are big names who were,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"as well as writing all these big things,"
00:35:58,00:36:00,also writing about this guy's rectum.
00:36:00,00:36:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:00,00:36:02,And Tchaikovsky wrote the music to the Nutcracker.
00:36:02,00:36:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:02,00:36:04,But he wrote the story.
00:36:04,00:36:05,"Well, Schlegel actually wrote,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,"in response to the Nutcracker,"
00:36:07,00:36:08,"he wrote The Can Opener,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,which is a very beautiful...
00:36:10,00:36:16,"So, it was huge leeches for thousands of years, wasn't it?"
00:36:16,00:36:20,"You hear about old treatments that come and go,"
00:36:20,00:36:23,"but leeches just came about 2,500 years ago"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"and then stuck around until the 19th century,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,"when finally they went out of fashion,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,"because it was thought to be unscientific,"
00:36:30,00:36:31,and then came back into fashion.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"But the way you treat people with leeches is,"
00:36:33,00:36:36,"they, you attach them to someone and they make you bleed."
00:36:36,00:36:38,"Their saliva has an anticoagulant in it,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,and they also put a chemical into you
00:36:40,00:36:43,"that widens up your blood vessels,"
00:36:43,00:36:44,and they put an anesthetic into you.
00:36:44,00:36:46,They're great surgeons.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"I think I can drink about a thumb full of,"
00:36:48,00:36:51,"or a thumb's size of blood, you know, from an area."
00:36:51,00:36:55,"Yeah, they can drink five times more than their own body size,"
00:36:55,00:36:56,"I think, which is a lot."
00:36:56,00:36:59,"But you don't normally leech to death,"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"unless the doctors have put dozens of leeches on you,"
00:37:02,00:37:03,which is pretty rare.
00:37:03,00:37:04,You're definitely not going to leech to death.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"No, it'll just be like an annoying little pinprick"
00:37:06,00:37:07,in your finger for a day.
00:37:07,00:37:11,I've sometimes had to like a blood sample
00:37:11,00:37:13,"from my fingers at home,"
00:37:13,00:37:16,"and you get these little sort of pinprick things, don't you?"
00:37:16,00:37:17,Yeah.
00:37:17,00:37:19,And I just can't get them to work.
00:37:19,00:37:19,Really?
00:37:19,00:37:23,"Yeah, last time I had to do it, they gave me two,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,"and I couldn't get it to work,"
00:37:25,00:37:27,and so I had to go and buy some more.
00:37:27,00:37:30,But you could only buy them from the pharmacist
00:37:30,00:37:32,in boxes of 500.
00:37:32,00:37:38,"So I now have about 495 of these at home,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"which I literally, if anyone wants to buy them, I'll think."
00:37:40,00:37:44,"Well, in the aftertimes, those will probably come in handy,"
00:37:44,00:37:46,those will be a way for you to test the faith of the elect.
00:37:46,00:37:49,You could probably gradually open a can
00:37:49,00:37:51,"with one of those actually, because you're an online battery."
00:37:51,00:37:53,Have you used 20 of them?
00:37:54,00:37:56,Have you heard of the Birmingham Leech Centre?
00:37:56,00:37:57,No.
00:37:57,00:38:01,"This is run by Bridget Croft, who is a nurse,"
00:38:01,00:38:04,and she is the only nurse in the UK
00:38:04,00:38:07,who is qualified to do private leaching.
00:38:07,00:38:10,"So everyone else is, all the other leaching is on the NHS,"
00:38:10,00:38:13,and it's to repair joints and after microsurgery
00:38:13,00:38:15,and help blood vessels heal.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"She does it privately, and she says,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"in some areas of Eastern Europe,"
00:38:19,00:38:22,it is looked on in the same way as going to a spa.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"What is she using it for, though,"
00:38:26,00:38:28,because it's not for sewing fingers back on?
00:38:28,00:38:30,"No, so that would be on the NHS or whatever."
00:38:30,00:38:33,"This is pain relief, gout, baldness, all sorts of stuff."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"Oh, so is this stuff that doesn't work?"
00:38:35,00:38:37,Because it doesn't work for those things.
00:38:37,00:38:39,I don't know about baldness.
00:38:39,00:38:42,Is it just that people see you from a distance
00:38:42,00:38:44,with all the leeches on your head?
00:38:44,00:38:46,"I think, oh, he's got a full head of hair."
00:38:46,00:38:49,"That's two pays moving around the world, isn't it?"
00:38:49,00:38:52,"It works from across a dimly lit bar,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,"but up close, the results do fall off."
00:38:55,00:39:00,"I mean, that does sound like old school leech work to me."
00:39:00,00:39:00,"It does, yeah."
00:39:00,00:39:02,Whereas modern leech work is quite specifically
00:39:02,00:39:05,"for the getting body parts back on, isn't it?"
00:39:05,00:39:09,"Leeches, they share something in common with tinned salmon,"
00:39:09,00:39:13,which is then now being used to tell us about the environment.
00:39:13,00:39:17,"So in China, they took 700 terrestrial leeches"
00:39:17,00:39:18,"that they found, all the same species,"
00:39:18,00:39:21,and they are going and taking the blood out of them
00:39:21,00:39:23,and diagnosing what animal it was taken from.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"A question, sorry, that's when I interrupt."
00:39:25,00:39:30,"Terrestrial leech, is that something that's not an alien?"
00:39:30,00:39:33,You have to listen to Dan's other podcast
00:39:33,00:39:35,to find out about terrestrial leeches.
00:39:35,00:39:39,"And the ones that you won't find in the water of bogs and stuff,"
00:39:39,00:39:40,they're land-based.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"Land-based, that's cool."
00:39:41,00:39:42,That's all you do?
00:39:42,00:39:43,That's me guessing.
00:39:43,00:39:47,"Yeah, so some of them feed on deer, for example."
00:39:47,00:39:51,The story of how they came back into use is a pretty amazing one.
00:39:51,00:39:53,"I actually listened to a podcast on leeches,"
00:39:53,00:39:55,"an episode of Sideways, which I love, by the way,"
00:39:55,00:39:57,"you should listen to it, Matthew Side."
00:39:57,00:39:59,And he was talking about this story.
00:39:59,00:40:03,"So in 1985, there's a four-year-old called Guy Condelli,"
00:40:03,00:40:05,whose ear is bitten off by his grandparents dog.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"And as the surgeon remembers it,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"the surgeon Joe Upton remembers it,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,the ear arrived in the emergency room
00:40:12,00:40:14,half an hour before the boy.
00:40:14,00:40:16,So I don't know what kind of thing happened there.
00:40:16,00:40:18,"I said, we're going to reattach you to the boy."
00:40:18,00:40:23,So they've got this here.
00:40:23,00:40:24,They've got this boy.
00:40:24,00:40:26,And they can repair the arteries fine.
00:40:26,00:40:28,This is where leeches come in so useful.
00:40:28,00:40:29,It's for vein repair.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"Because as Joe Upton described it,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"to try and sew veins back on,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,imagine sewing wet toilet paper together.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"They're so floppy, they just keep flopping,"
00:40:37,00:40:39,"and they kept on reattaching the ear,"
00:40:39,00:40:41,"and it kept on going purple and black as it filled with blood,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,because the veins couldn't carry it away.
00:40:43,00:40:46,"Old Upton, he'd read about leeches as a treatment."
00:40:46,00:40:49,And he tracked down the Welsh biopharma place
00:40:49,00:40:53,"where they bred them for use in pharmaceuticals,"
00:40:53,00:40:55,so they hadn't been used actually the way they are now.
00:40:55,00:40:57,And he got some scent to him.
00:40:57,00:40:59,And this is a completely new idea.
00:40:59,00:41:00,"He's just thought, you know what,"
00:41:00,00:41:03,let's attach a leech to this guy's ear and see if it works.
00:41:03,00:41:05,That's amazing.
00:41:05,00:41:05,So amazing.
00:41:05,00:41:07,And he just about gets the leeches out in time
00:41:07,00:41:11,"and says literally as soon as he puts them on this boy's ear,"
00:41:11,00:41:14,"the ear goes from black to a lovely pink ear colour,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,"as the leech basically repairs the veins,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,or it allows the blood to flow through the veins.
00:41:18,00:41:20,It widens the veins.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"It means that the blood can flow freely,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,which gives them chance to repair themselves.
00:41:23,00:41:24,The body's very good at repairing itself.
00:41:24,00:41:25,It just needed a rest.
00:41:25,00:41:26,The ear just needed a rest.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"So apparently now these days,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"if you have finger or ear or penis surgery,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"what they'll do is for the 10 days afterwards,"
00:41:32,00:41:35,you keep getting a leech just put onto the place
00:41:35,00:41:35,that needs repairing.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"So over the 10 days, that's how they fix it."
00:41:37,00:41:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:38,00:41:40,That's just incredible.
00:41:40,00:41:40,"Yeah, they are."
00:41:40,00:41:41,They're amazing.
00:41:41,00:41:45,Have you heard of the B-dale leech house?
00:41:45,00:41:47,This is in North Yorkshire.
00:41:47,00:41:48,"I know, B-dale."
00:41:48,00:41:49,Yeah.
00:41:49,00:41:52,"So Yorkshire, and it's a little building,"
00:41:52,00:41:54,but it looks like a miniature fortress
00:41:54,00:41:56,"because it's got crenellations on the top,"
00:41:56,00:41:57,"or castellations, you know."
00:41:57,00:41:58,So it looks like a castle.
00:41:58,00:41:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:59,00:42:01,"I love that you just corrected crenellations to castellations,"
00:42:01,00:42:02,and I think people appreciate that.
00:42:02,00:42:03,It's just absolutely just...
00:42:03,00:42:05,"Because people will have been listening to it and gone,"
00:42:05,00:42:07,"""Oh, I don't know what a crenellation is."""
00:42:07,00:42:09,And then you started to repeat yourself.
00:42:09,00:42:10,"They'll have gone, ""Oh, thank God."""
00:42:10,00:42:12,He's repeating himself and telling me what it is.
00:42:12,00:42:15,And then you said an even more skill word.
00:42:15,00:42:17,Like these bits.
00:42:17,00:42:19,I've just drawn them from the back there.
00:42:19,00:42:20,"Yeah, these kind of things."
00:42:20,00:42:21,Look at all that more crenellation is.
00:42:21,00:42:22,"I thought that was a crenellation,"
00:42:22,00:42:23,not a castellation in that.
00:42:23,00:42:24,That's what I thought as well.
00:42:24,00:42:26,"I'm not sure it's the form,"
00:42:26,00:42:27,but it's definitely the latter.
00:42:27,00:42:28,I don't know.
00:42:28,00:42:29,So I think we've got distracted from the fact
00:42:29,00:42:31,this is a house built for leeches.
00:42:31,00:42:34,So they would be kept in there
00:42:34,00:42:36,"because to collect leeches for the market,"
00:42:36,00:42:37,"you collect them from the wild,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,"you collect them from rivers,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,"and from bogs and swamps,"
00:42:40,00:42:43,"and you normally just walk through barefoot,"
00:42:43,00:42:44,"and you come out and you've got a load of leeches on you,"
00:42:44,00:42:46,and that's the leech collector's job.
00:42:46,00:42:49,And then you take them to the leech house
00:42:49,00:42:50,and drop them off there.
00:42:50,00:42:51,"So they'd be kept alive,"
00:42:51,00:42:54,and then there's a sort of staging post for them.
00:42:54,00:42:57,"And this is the last leech house in the UK,"
00:42:57,00:42:57,"and it's still there,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,and it's got a stream diverted to run through it.
00:42:59,00:43:01,It's on the banks of a little beck.
00:43:01,00:43:03,"It doesn't still house leeches, does it?"
00:43:03,00:43:04,"It doesn't still house leeches,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"but it had a fire to keep them warm in winter,"
00:43:06,00:43:08,and it had...
00:43:08,00:43:10,There were special containers of moist turf and moss
00:43:10,00:43:11,for the leeches to live in.
00:43:11,00:43:12,"Oh, here we go."
00:43:12,00:43:14,How'd I find this bag?
00:43:14,00:43:15,She went search.
00:43:15,00:43:19,"It's amazing how Andy searches on Google for moss leeches,"
00:43:19,00:43:23,"and Dan searches for extraterrestrial leeches,"
00:43:23,00:43:25,"and he goes, ""Did you mean terrestrial leeches?"""
00:43:25,00:43:27,"Ah, I didn't, but okay, yes, what is it?"
00:43:27,00:43:35,"Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,and that is Andy.
00:43:37,00:43:39,My fact is that in some American states and cities
00:43:39,00:43:40,"in the late 80s,"
00:43:40,00:43:42,children could be sent to prison for six months
00:43:42,00:43:44,for the crime of owning a pager.
00:43:44,00:43:48,"What's a pager, Granddad?"
00:43:48,00:43:51,"I don't know, Anna, you're 100 years old."
00:43:51,00:43:55,"So, this is from a great..."
00:43:55,00:43:57,"A swimmer newsletter called ""Pessimists Archive"""
00:43:57,00:43:58,by Louis Anslow.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"It's a brilliant article,"
00:43:59,00:44:02,"and it was all about how there was this panic about pagers,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,which are electronic devices.
00:44:04,00:44:06,Can you tell us a bit more about them?
00:44:06,00:44:10,"Yeah, you can do very, very primitive texting"
00:44:10,00:44:11,on advanced models.
00:44:11,00:44:13,"In the early ones, you just got a beep,"
00:44:13,00:44:14,and you knew that you had to do something
00:44:14,00:44:15,in response to the beep.
00:44:15,00:44:16,"So, like a doctor might have them,"
00:44:16,00:44:17,"it would beep, and they're like,"
00:44:17,00:44:19,"""I have to go to the hospital."""
00:44:19,00:44:19,"Exactly, that."
00:44:19,00:44:21,"But then later, they would be able to send you"
00:44:21,00:44:24,like a couple of words or numbers or something.
00:44:24,00:44:26,You wouldn't be able to send a message back.
00:44:26,00:44:27,It's purely receiving.
00:44:27,00:44:30,"To send the message, someone had to pick up a phone,"
00:44:30,00:44:31,"call a number,"
00:44:31,00:44:34,and kind of direct your pager to be beeped.
00:44:34,00:44:35,"Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:44:35,00:44:37,"So, there were all these headlines in the '80s"
00:44:37,00:44:39,about these powering the drug trade.
00:44:39,00:44:42,"Maybe youths who own pagers are getting paged,"
00:44:42,00:44:45,and they're going to pick up the drugs or whatever.
00:44:45,00:44:48,"And they probably were useful for drug dealers, to be honest."
00:44:48,00:44:48,"Yeah, exactly."
00:44:48,00:44:52,But it probably wasn't most pagers in schools
00:44:52,00:44:53,being used to pick up cocaine.
00:44:53,00:44:55,I think what it was is that most drug dealers
00:44:55,00:44:56,"did use pagers,"
00:44:56,00:44:59,but not most pagers were used by drug dealers.
00:44:59,00:45:00,"Exactly that, it's exactly that."
00:45:00,00:45:03,That wasn't necessarily what the right-wing press thought.
00:45:03,00:45:04,No.
00:45:04,00:45:07,"And so, New Jersey banned them for under 18s"
00:45:07,00:45:09,"on the pain of six months in Choke,"
00:45:09,00:45:12,which is such a long time for owning a pager.
00:45:12,00:45:13,"Michigan did the same,"
00:45:13,00:45:16,and thousands of young people were arrested and suspended
00:45:16,00:45:18,and handcuffed and things.
00:45:18,00:45:21,I couldn't find anyone who was sent to prison for that.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"But in one year alone,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,there were a thousand arrests in Chicago schools
00:45:24,00:45:28,"solely for owning pagers, arrests."
00:45:28,00:45:30,"Because your fact, it kind of reads like one of those,"
00:45:30,00:45:31,"like, there's a law in Mississippi"
00:45:31,00:45:33,that you can't let your horse open your can.
00:45:33,00:45:36,"You're saying, ""You're flying over New Jersey,"
00:45:36,00:45:37,"everyone put your pagers away."""
00:45:37,00:45:43,"But then, as you say, 700 school kids were arrested in 1994."
00:45:43,00:45:45,"And weird kids, because if they're not dealing drugs,"
00:45:45,00:45:46,"which as we say, some of them were,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,"but if they're not, they're just losers."
00:45:48,00:45:50,Because I'm going to associate owning a pager
00:45:50,00:45:52,"with, like, nerdy businessmen."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"What I associated with actually is Ross and Friends,"
00:45:54,00:45:55,who famously has one in series one.
00:45:55,00:45:56,"Oh, does he?"
00:45:56,00:45:59,"And so, what kind of kid owns a pager?"
00:45:59,00:46:00,"In the 80s, they were so cool."
00:46:00,00:46:01,They were so cool.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"Oh, were they cool in the 80s?"
00:46:03,00:46:05,"Because drug dealers use them, right?"
00:46:05,00:46:07,"And because your parents hated them,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,"and because politicians hated them,"
00:46:09,00:46:12,to have one was the ultimate status symbol.
00:46:12,00:46:13,"James is speaking, as if."
00:46:13,00:46:14,I was alive.
00:46:14,00:46:16,You were desperate for a pager.
00:46:16,00:46:18,"Yeah, this is in America."
00:46:18,00:46:22,It wasn't in the UK as far as I could remember/read.
00:46:22,00:46:25,"But basically, the reason they were good"
00:46:25,00:46:27,"for drug dealers is before you had them,"
00:46:27,00:46:29,if you wanted to get in contact with someone
00:46:29,00:46:30,"to buy your drugs, you had to give them"
00:46:30,00:46:31,your landline number.
00:46:31,00:46:33,"And now you're giving them,"
00:46:33,00:46:34,"effectively, a mobile number,"
00:46:34,00:46:37,so the cops wouldn't know where you are.
00:46:37,00:46:40,"But because they became associated with the bad guy,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,"kids were wearing them round their necks,"
00:46:42,00:46:43,as like a status symbol.
00:46:43,00:46:44,Wow.
00:46:44,00:46:45,"And they were so cool,"
00:46:45,00:46:48,there was a market for fake pagers.
00:46:48,00:46:50,So you could buy a cheaper pager
00:46:50,00:46:52,"that didn't do anything, didn't send,"
00:46:52,00:46:53,"or anything like that,"
00:46:53,00:46:54,but you would just wear it around your neck
00:46:54,00:46:55,"and say, ""Look, I've got a pager."""
00:46:55,00:46:56,When it wasn't real.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"Would you occasionally have to say ""beep"""
00:46:58,00:47:01,"to make people think you're getting a mouse, my dealer?"
00:47:01,00:47:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:02,00:47:04,But I read an article that was written
00:47:04,00:47:06,"in 1977 about pagers,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,just talking about how awesome they were.
00:47:08,00:47:10,They would say that if you were in a queue
00:47:10,00:47:11,"for a restaurant,"
00:47:11,00:47:14,"and the Matredease saw a pager on your belt,"
00:47:14,00:47:16,you would be able to go up the line.
00:47:16,00:47:18,There's stories of parties
00:47:18,00:47:20,"where the hostess of a party,"
00:47:20,00:47:21,"and this was in Washington,"
00:47:21,00:47:24,became nervous that she hadn't invited
00:47:24,00:47:26,"the best people in her social group there,"
00:47:26,00:47:28,because she couldn't hear the beep of pagers
00:47:28,00:47:29,at her party.
00:47:29,00:47:30,"""These pagers are fakes!"""
00:47:30,00:47:32,"Well, what then became even cooler"
00:47:32,00:47:35,"than the beeping pager was the wiggler,"
00:47:35,00:47:38,"and the wiggler was the one that doesn't beep out loud,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,but like a phone on silent vibrates.
00:47:40,00:47:42,"So she thought, ""Okay, maybe if that's not beeping,"
00:47:42,00:47:44,"it's because I've got the extra cool new kicks here."""
00:47:44,00:47:44,"""I've got the wiggles."""
00:47:44,00:47:45,"""I've got the wigglers."""
00:47:45,00:47:46,Yeah.
00:47:46,00:47:48,It is interesting how transformative that is.
00:47:48,00:47:49,"Just what you said, James,"
00:47:49,00:47:51,"about it going from a landline to a mobile,"
00:47:51,00:47:53,people communicating in new ways
00:47:53,00:47:55,that cannot be tracked as easily.
00:47:55,00:47:56,"Yeah, maybe a huge difference."
00:47:56,00:47:59,And then I read one article in 1993
00:47:59,00:48:02,that was talking about the drug business using pagers.
00:48:02,00:48:03,"They interviewed a cop, and they said,"
00:48:03,00:48:06,"""Now we're finding dealers with flip phones."
00:48:06,00:48:08,"Maybe that will be the next rage."""
00:48:08,00:48:09,Maybe.
00:48:09,00:48:09,Wow.
00:48:09,00:48:10,Who's to say?
00:48:10,00:48:14,Which we probably should say.
00:48:14,00:48:16,Pagers are still in use.
00:48:16,00:48:18,"Well, they were until a couple of years ago."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"No, well, there's this old factoid about,"
00:48:20,00:48:22,the NHS is the only place where you still get
00:48:22,00:48:24,faxes and pagers used.
00:48:24,00:48:28,"They were slated to be phased out in 2021, but--"
00:48:28,00:48:30,"Matt Hancock said that was going to happen, didn't they?"
00:48:30,00:48:31,Matt Hancock.
00:48:31,00:48:32,And if you're outside the UK
00:48:32,00:48:34,"and you don't know who Matt Hancock is,"
00:48:34,00:48:35,good for you.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"And still, I think about 80,000 being used in the NHS"
00:48:38,00:48:40,as of last summer.
00:48:40,00:48:40,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:40,00:48:42,Because they still kind of work.
00:48:42,00:48:43,"Yeah, really."
00:48:43,00:48:44,And if you're in a hospital
00:48:44,00:48:47,"and there's no reception in a room, it's useful."
00:48:47,00:48:49,"And it is, obviously, it's used for the doctors"
00:48:49,00:48:51,who are in rooms where there's incredibly thick walls
00:48:51,00:48:53,because of x-ray and all sorts of...
00:48:53,00:48:55,All that stuff is what they're basically fighting
00:48:55,00:48:56,further than a mobile signal.
00:48:56,00:48:57,So it's--
00:48:57,00:48:59,"Add a lot of NHS stuff, deal a crack."
00:48:59,00:49:06,But we're also using pagers in ways
00:49:06,00:49:07,that we don't realize.
00:49:07,00:49:08,All of us.
00:49:08,00:49:08,All of us have had--
00:49:08,00:49:09,What's that?
00:49:09,00:49:12,"All of us have had, probably, our hands on a pager"
00:49:12,00:49:13,and not known it in the last few months.
00:49:13,00:49:14,This thing got my bottom up.
00:49:14,00:49:15,Keeps on floating.
00:49:15,00:49:20,Anytime you go to a restaurant
00:49:20,00:49:21,and you order up at the bar
00:49:21,00:49:23,and they give you an item
00:49:23,00:49:24,"that says when this buzzes, come back."
00:49:24,00:49:26,That's when your meal is ready.
00:49:26,00:49:26,That's a pager.
00:49:26,00:49:27,No.
00:49:27,00:49:28,"Yeah, that's pager technology."
00:49:28,00:49:29,Just using a different form.
00:49:29,00:49:31,I have one of those that I hang around my neck.
00:49:31,00:49:34,And you get a beep on it
00:49:34,00:49:36,and it lets you know that your cans have been opened.
00:49:36,00:49:38,Do you know what they stopped doing?
00:49:38,00:49:40,"Because they've been around for decades, actually."
00:49:40,00:49:42,I think they've stopped doing this.
00:49:42,00:49:43,"Although I've never tested it,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,they obviously have a range that you can't go out of.
00:49:45,00:49:47,And they used to shout at you.
00:49:47,00:49:50,So pagers often used to speak instead of beeping.
00:49:50,00:49:52,"And if you went more than 100 feet away, they'd shout,"
00:49:52,00:49:54,"""You are out of range."""
00:49:54,00:49:56,So it was just so embarrassing
00:49:56,00:49:58,if you go and try and sneak into the shop next door.
00:49:58,00:49:59,"Actually, just a normal one."
00:49:59,00:50:01,"I can't say this is true of all of them,"
00:50:01,00:50:02,but they have a range of about half a mile.
00:50:02,00:50:04,So that's quite long.
00:50:04,00:50:05,"That means in most restaurants,"
00:50:05,00:50:07,you could just go to the pub.
00:50:07,00:50:08,"Near as pub, in London anyway."
00:50:08,00:50:09,That's around the middle of nowhere.
00:50:09,00:50:12,So sometimes pagers would have a thing
00:50:12,00:50:15,"in the '70s, '80s, '90s,"
00:50:15,00:50:17,"where if you wanted to contact someone on their pager,"
00:50:17,00:50:18,you would call a number
00:50:18,00:50:22,and you'd get through to a switchboard.
00:50:22,00:50:24,"And you'd say, ""Can you contact this pager?"""
00:50:24,00:50:25,And it's from this number.
00:50:25,00:50:28,"And then the person would send a message to the pager,"
00:50:28,00:50:30,and they'd have a series of messages that they could send.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"So if you were the wife calling,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,"the message would be programmed to come up,"
00:50:33,00:50:34,"""Call your wife."""
00:50:34,00:50:36,"Or if you were work calling, it would be,"
00:50:36,00:50:36,"""Go to the office."""
00:50:36,00:50:37,"Or if you're a doctor, it would be,"
00:50:37,00:50:38,"""Go to the hospital."""
00:50:38,00:50:40,Which is also your work.
00:50:40,00:50:43,"Yeah, so you don't need those two messages"
00:50:43,00:50:44,if you are a doctor.
00:50:44,00:50:46,"But if you're not, you know, useful."
00:50:46,00:50:49,"Anyway, it was reading a really good article"
00:50:49,00:50:52,in The New York Times from 1976.
00:50:52,00:50:54,Which is talking about the pros and cons of pagers.
00:50:54,00:50:56,"And it does say,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,"""The problem is almost every beeper wearer"
00:50:58,00:51:00,has a story to tell of the beeper going off
00:51:00,00:51:01,"at the wrong time."""
00:51:01,00:51:03,And this is an issue with them.
00:51:03,00:51:05,"So for instance, a salesman we spoke to"
00:51:05,00:51:06,"said that one evening,"
00:51:06,00:51:08,he was having a very pleasant conversation
00:51:08,00:51:09,with a young woman.
00:51:09,00:51:11,And just when he felt that he was making an impression
00:51:11,00:51:12,"and he was getting somewhere,"
00:51:12,00:51:14,"his pager blared out,"
00:51:14,00:51:15,"""Call your wife."""
00:51:15,00:51:19,"Honestly, what a nightmare."
00:51:19,00:51:21,The pager is definitely the bad guy in this article.
00:51:21,00:51:25,And they did actually speak to an answering service
00:51:25,00:51:25,"in New Orleans,"
00:51:25,00:51:27,"one of the interchange services,"
00:51:27,00:51:28,"which said,"
00:51:28,00:51:31,"""We have 1,400 pagers in our system"
00:51:31,00:51:33,and not a single one when the wife calls
00:51:33,00:51:36,"asks them to say the message, ""Call your wife."""
00:51:36,00:51:36,"They all said,"
00:51:36,00:51:39,"""I'd like the message, ""Call your answering service."""
00:51:39,00:51:41,"Please, to come up."""
00:51:41,00:51:43,"Or just, you know, go to work."
00:51:43,00:51:46,Every man thinks there might be a situation
00:51:46,00:51:48,"where I don't want the message to come up,"
00:51:48,00:51:49,"""Call your wife."""
00:51:49,00:51:50,That is outrageous.
00:51:50,00:51:50,That is men.
00:51:51,00:51:52,Answering service.
00:51:52,00:51:54,It's such an awful euphemism for life.
00:51:54,00:51:59,So I think of myself.
00:51:59,00:52:00,Have you guys heard of gaydar?
00:52:00,00:52:02,Heard of it?
00:52:02,00:52:03,"Yes, I have."
00:52:03,00:52:07,The idea that gay people can tell whether other people are gay.
00:52:07,00:52:08,"Yeah, but in 1999,"
00:52:08,00:52:10,someone invented a device
00:52:10,00:52:13,"which has been described as a kind of electronic pager,"
00:52:13,00:52:15,which was called gaydar.
00:52:15,00:52:18,And what it would be was for guys
00:52:18,00:52:20,who were walking through big parks
00:52:20,00:52:22,and if they saw someone that looked good looking
00:52:22,00:52:24,and they didn't want to embarrass themselves
00:52:24,00:52:25,"by hitting on them,"
00:52:25,00:52:27,they would have their gaydar go off
00:52:27,00:52:29,because they had a gaydar as well.
00:52:29,00:52:29,What?
00:52:29,00:52:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:52:30,00:52:31,So it was an electronic device that you kept on you.
00:52:31,00:52:33,"Well, what if I'm with my wife?"
00:52:33,00:52:37,"What's that coming from your ass, Andy?"
00:52:37,00:52:42,"Yeah, so they invented it."
00:52:42,00:52:47,And this guy called Graham Lees was one of the inventors.
00:52:47,00:52:49,And so he went to test it out in a park
00:52:49,00:52:51,and he walked through the park.
00:52:51,00:52:53,"And unfortunately, they discovered quite quickly..."
00:52:53,00:52:54,No one else had one.
00:52:54,00:52:58,"Buzzing around the park, crying."
00:52:58,00:53:00,"Well, I assume there must have been someone else"
00:53:00,00:53:01,that was in the park.
00:53:01,00:53:02,And he didn't know they were testing it.
00:53:02,00:53:05,"Unfortunately, they hadn't fully tested out the frequencies"
00:53:05,00:53:07,and it was at the wrong frequency.
00:53:07,00:53:08,So instead of spotting someone else
00:53:08,00:53:10,"who was wearing one of the gaydars,"
00:53:10,00:53:12,he was suddenly chased by a horny badger.
00:53:12,00:53:14,There was squirrels.
00:53:14,00:53:16,There were squirrels that were coming after him.
00:53:16,00:53:16,What?
00:53:16,00:53:18,"He then, as he was running away from them..."
00:53:18,00:53:19,"Sorry, no badger."
00:53:19,00:53:22,Has ever hornily chased a person with a vibrating tail?
00:53:22,00:53:23,We all have vibrating phones now.
00:53:23,00:53:25,We've all been chased by badgers every day.
00:53:25,00:53:28,The frequency is a specific frequency.
00:53:28,00:53:30,"There's a love note for badgers, is what you'll say."
