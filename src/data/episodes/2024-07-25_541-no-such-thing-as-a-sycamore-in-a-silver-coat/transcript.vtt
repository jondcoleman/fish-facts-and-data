00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:13.200
 joined by the history guy himself, Mr Dan Snow. If you are a person in the UK who likes

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.720
 to watch history documentaries, you will know all about Dan. If you are a podcast fan, you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.040
 may well know his podcast, History Hit, which is an absolutely brilliant history podcast

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.720
 that both myself and Anna and Dan have recently appeared on. So do look for his podcast and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 listen to our episodes and indeed all of the episodes of that brilliant show. Actually,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.320
 while you're on the podcast app of your choice, why not find mine and Anna's new podcast.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.800
 It's called Quite a Good Sport and I'll tell you some more about that in a minute because

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.400
 I should also say we're going on tour. The tour which we booked so many months ago and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.160
 felt like it was so far in the future is just around the corner. Ah, if you live in Edinburgh,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.080
 that will be our first date and we'll be playing there on the 14th of August 2024. You can

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.840
 see a live podcast recording including all the bits that I normally cut out because we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.880
 can't possibly broadcast them. It will all be there in Edinburgh. I really hope you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 can make it. We love doing these shows and we love meeting everyone afterwards. If you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.680
 live in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London or Manchester or the environs

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.600
 of those cities, then do go to no6thingsforfish.com/live and find out how to get tickets for the shows

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.800
 that are near you. Anyway, just quickly back to that new podcast of mine and Anna's. What

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.760
 I think I'll do rather than explaining what happens, I'm going to put a little teaser

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.280
 at the end of this week's episode. So once the show's finished, if you listen on for

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.720
 another minute or so, you'll get a really good idea of the show. It's basically me

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.080
 and Anna speaking to Olympians and then trying out the sport ourselves. So in the latest

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.920
 episode, we speak to a couple of TGB's rowers and then we get on the terms and see which

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.800
 of her and I is the best at rowing. I really think you'll enjoy it. It would mean the world

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.920
 to us if you could click follow on your podcast app of choice. It would mean even more if

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.200
 you could find the time to listen and it would mean more still if you actually managed to

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 give us a review. Anyway, stay tuned for the little teaser of quite a good sport. Go to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.720
 no6thingsforfish.com/live for details of our tour and sit back, relax and enjoy our latest

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:49.800
 episode with the history guy, Dan Snow. On with the podcast.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.920
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.080
 Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Dan Snow. And once again, we have gathered around the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.400
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.760
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Dan. When Captain Scott, the infamous

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.640
 British expedition leader, got to the South Pole, he saw in the distance little flag fluttering

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.560
 in his heart sank and then he saw a tent and inside that tent, there was a letter and that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.120
 letter was addressed very neatly to King Harkon of Norway. It was a letter from an explorer,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.160
 Rold Amundsen, who'd arrived at the South Pole a month before Scott, breaking the records,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.280
 the first human being to reach South Pole and he'd left a little tent and a letter saying,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.000
 "Hey Scott, would you mind posting this to the King just to tell him I got here?" I mean,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.800
 a shade throne. That's great. It's a great prank, except it's one of those pranks that

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.200
 have gone wrong because he would have been back at home and they went, "You know he died."

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.640
 He's going, "Oh my God, someone, don't find the letter. Don't find my cheeky prank."

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.480
 You're so right. I read one theory, right, that the reason

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.400
 that he put the letter there is to prove that he got there because let's say he gets down

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.800
 there and he writes the letter and says, "I got to the South Pole" and then he gives

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.960
 it to the King while it's just his word against anyone else's. But if he puts a letter there

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.800
 and Scott picks it up and takes it back, then that's evidence because it's another person

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.560
 who's seen where this letter got to.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.360
 You're right. Yeah, you've got to leave something.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.520
 I don't know. I think that's his excuse when he gets to down fly, but, you know, Scott's

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 dead now in news.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.160
 No, there's already a serious context. I just love the fact. There's those pictures

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.880
 of it. And it's just a… The Antarctic environment is a featureless, white, icy football field.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.920
 And so they could have taken that picture anywhere. I say, "You're right. I guess

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.560
 you are right. You've got to leave something there." And also, Scott literally slept there

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.400
 and then went and started off the next day. It is the most extraordinary box-ticking exercise.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.240
 You know what? I did that when I went to Bangladesh because I tried to go to as many countries

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.480
 as I can. And I stopped over in Bangladesh, slept there one night and then left, but I

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.760
 counted as going there.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 The airport hotel?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760
 Yeah.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760
 I'm not sure that counts.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760
 Yeah, of course it does.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.400
 It's kind of like touring, isn't it? I watched a Celine Dion documentary recently.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.000
 She says exactly that. She says, "I've been around the world. I've been everywhere

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.080
 in the world, but I've never seen anywhere." Because she was in and out.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080
 Yeah, it was very…

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.480
 She is the cat to the Scott of the Pop World.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480
 She is, right?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.480
 Yeah.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.680
 I really thought you were going to say, "I watched a Celine Dion documentary and I

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.760
 was able to tick off my 100 Celine Dion documentary."

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.120
 I only watched the second.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.120
 Yeah, it still counts.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.160
 The other thing, we in Britain talk about Scott a lot, obviously, and we ignore Amundsen,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 by the way, who didn't just get to the South Pole first. He's an absolute legend.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.680
 He was the first man through the Northwest Passage and the first person to get to the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.400
 North Pole as well, albeit in an airship.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 Absolutely.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.480
 Does that count? That's the thing. Because, yeah, it was the 1920s, wasn't it?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480
 Yeah.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.920
 He decided to fly over the North Pole. Do we count that?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920
 I think it counts.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
 Okay.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.400
 Well, I think it counts. If I'd been to Bangladesh, then I think that counts.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 Oh.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.200
 But also, didn't he… he was going to walk to the North Pole and then he got news that

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.560
 Peary had allegedly done the same. And then that was when he decided to go to the South

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560
 Pole, is that right?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.960
 I think so. There was a failed expression to get to the North Pole for sure. I'm not

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.280
 sure why he turned around.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.400
 That's a hell of a turnaround in terms of the distance.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 Yeah.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.800
 Well, I believe that's the case. And I believe all of the people who were on the ship thought

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.080
 they were going to the North Pole.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080
 Really?

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.440
 And then they started going down, down, down. And they stopped off at Funchal, which is in…

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440
 Where is that?

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440
 Portugal, I think?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.600
 Yeah, one of the islands off Portugal.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 Yeah.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.000
 And they kind of then said to the crew, they said, "Okay, by the way, we're not going

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.360
 to the North Pole. After all, we're going to the South Pole."

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.440
 And it is a dick move, much like the letter. And yeah, he was a legend. I like him, but

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.680
 he was a cheeky legend. I mean, he really did do that because he'd been told to go

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.880
 to the North Pole, but he just wanted to be the first somewhere.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.840
 So, as James says, thought someone else had got there and turned around his boat just

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.280
 to beat Scott. And the thing was, and again, this could be, Lady Duff protest too much after

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.600
 the event, but Scott insisted he was never racing.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.760
 Oh, I know. Brilliant, isn't it? It's so good.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.200
 He was there for a scientific expedition.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.520
 He wrote in a letter, "Oh, God, I've heard Amundsen is trying to get there before me.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.280
 That's fine. He probably will. You know, he's got dogs. I've got horses. He'll go

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.960
 faster. I'm not interested in that."

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:21.120
 Cut a picture of Scott trampling the weak, hurdling the dead, flogging his men ever further

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.040
 south. I read a history once of Amundsen. It said, "The trip to the South Pole was smooth

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040
 and uneventful."

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.840
 I was like, "Oh, wow. Don't bother reading off."

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.440
 And when they got back, they'd put on weight. British expeditions anywhere, be it desert,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.120
 rainforest, arctic, high latitude. The lads arrived back, shadowed them for the cells.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.680
 They got eaten each other, broken. These Norwegians get back. Many of their dogs are still alive.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.760
 And they're just like, "All right, lads, here we are. We're actually ahead of schedule

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 as well."

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.120
 I mean, it's too cruel.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.160
 But I think the thing of saying, "Does it count?" because it was done by Plaint. That's

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.200
 a thing that Amundsen had his whole life after that trip, right? People didn't accept, particularly

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
 the British.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.720
 Yeah, it was like, "You didn't do this. You had skis. You did it the improper way."

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.120
 When he got back, he was at a dinner at the Royal Geographical Society. This is in 1912.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.360
 And the president, Lord Curzon, offered a toast, but not to him, but to the dog team.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.520
 Because he was like, "They're the ones who got there."

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.280
 And also, he did eat a few of his dogs, didn't he?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280
 Yeah, right.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280
 So, I think that's, you know...

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280
 Yeah.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.800
 If I'm going to die, that's fine. I'm eating my dogs first.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.400
 Oh, yeah. Anna, I'd eat you.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.440
 Like, it's like... Okay, that escalated quickly.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.600
 Dan, why did you come back a lot heavier than when you left? And with none of your friends?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 You've only been to Exeter.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.800
 Yeah, one-man podcast from now on, no such thing as a fish.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.840
 The dogs, to be fair, were mobile food storage units. I mean, they were meant to be eaten

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.280
 and then fed to each other, and then fed to the humans.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280
 Literally, dog eat dog.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280
 Wow.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.720
 I think that trip, it also, as well as being an eventful, just sounded quite fun. Like,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.760
 they were just reading about it. They did things like, "Guess the temperature contests."

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.600
 Well, this is not the track to the poll, is it? This is when they were overwintering.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.680
 So, I think a lot of people don't focus on that bit. And when they were overwintering,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.840
 they're in a hut. There were lots more of them, not just the guys who then tracked to

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.560
 the poll. And they had plenty of supplies, and it does sound super fun. You know, they

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.400
 had hot toddies, cigars, lots of music. They played this fun "Guess the temperature" game.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.640
 They had lots of puzzles they played.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640
 Yeah.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.520
 Scott and they overwintering fell out massively with Evans, who was his second in command.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.560
 They decided they absolutely despised each other, and that could be the reason that they

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560
 didn't make it to the poll.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.560
 Oh, really?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560
 Oh.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.760
 Back from the poll the following year because of the kind of terrible divisions within the

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.760
 world.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760
 Really?

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.760
 Right.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.760
 Do we know why?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.480
 Well, it's that word, because I think spending a long time in a hut, I mean, you three spend

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.360
 a lot of time together, and you all seem to be on fine. But, you know, add an Antarctic

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.760
 winter, no daylights. You know, you might fall out with each other as well. And so, I think

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.080
 it would break any team apart, but those two just were just incompatible.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080
 And the diarising.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.200
 A lot of diarising.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.400
 Because you would look at Scott going, "What are you writing?"

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 Stop it!

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400
 "What are you writing?"

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.000
 That's what, whenever Andy's on his laptop, you're always like that to me, aren't you?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 "What are you writing?"

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 "What are you writing?"

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 "I'll eat you."

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.480
 Are you bitching about me? Are you bitching about me in there?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.560
 I can't help it. Anyone who has a diary that I've ever met, I hate it.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560
 Really?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560
 Do you think they're writing about you?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560
 Yeah.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560
 I get paranoid.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.560
 You are not the main character.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.920
 You wish they're writing about you. Had some sushi, went home, didn't do much else.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.480
 That's what's pissing me off, but I'm not being ridden about.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.640
 Didn't see Dan today, that was a shame. Hopefully tomorrow.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.280
 But yeah, it's why they, it's why whenever they send people to space or on these long

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.640
 expeditions, they often look for the most boring characters possible. Who don't want

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.320
 to talk, who have zero, like, anger temperaments. They're just, like, Tim Peake is such a pleasant

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.640
 man. We met Tim Peake.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.800
 Yeah, pleasant, not boring. I noticed you switched.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.560
 I think Dan Schleiber, is that the application for the European Space Agency? I see lying

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.320
 in the bin there with a rejected stamp on it. Apparently they're saying it's super

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320
 boring, guys.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.320
 It's interesting.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320
 Oh, my God.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:14.000
 Well, Anton was not boring at all. Obviously, he was a character.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Yeah.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.920
 He, in fact, I think he started his journey to the Northwest Passage at midnight because

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.720
 he had to escape gambling debts.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720
 I think.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
 Really?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.520
 He sailed the boat off because the, the people that he owed were threatening to, like, impound

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520
 his boat.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.840
 But it is funny this, we talked about this heroic age of exploration. I mean, so many

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.560
 of them were absolute clowns in chat. I mean, Shackleton is astonishing in a crisis, but

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.520
 also he needs to be because he was prone to get in crises the whole time.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520
 Right.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.040
 He bespeared absolute legend when everything goes wrong because you're going to make everything

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 go wrong.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.320
 So he, I mean, he would leave with sort of creditors running on the key side, roaring

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.960
 at him and sort of also cuckolded husbands shaking their fists. I mean, it's complete

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960
 chaos.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960
 Wow.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.240
 But he, but he was good leading guys on the ice, you know, that, I guess, they're different

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240
 skills.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.160
 And he was the next person to try, wasn't he, after Scott Adams?

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.400
 So brilliantly. So he went, he had a nervous breakdown and then went, you know what, she

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.600
 was never about going to South Pole.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.000
 It's actually the greatest prize is crossing the continent from one side to the other via

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 the South Pole.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.320
 So he managed to flog this to a bunch of old, old heiresses, widowed heiresses who then

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.080
 gave him money for his famous expedition to the Trans-Antarctic expedition, which did

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.080
 not set foot on the mainland, but led to his eternal heroism because in getting them out

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.320
 of the mess he'd got them into, he obviously, you know, won great claim and was brilliant.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320
 But yeah.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.160
 So that was his big scheme was, oh, you know, it's not about South Pole.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.160
 But what I find kind of interesting is Scott and Amundsen got there, you think, right?

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.440
 So and then Shackleton sort of said he was going to do his thing, but actually no one

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
 else really bothered.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440
 Yeah, it took a while.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440
 They took a while.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
 They were like, well, someone's done it now.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.440
 Well, in a way, why would you?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440
 Yeah.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.080
 In fact, wasn't the next person to get there, or was it the North Pole, Edmund Hillary went

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080
 to one of them.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.120
 Hillary was the next person to walk to the South Pole.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.760
 He was the next South Pole, wasn't he?

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:07.800
 Yeah, there was a guy called George Dufek who flew there and this was in 1956 and he,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.720
 they interviewed him on the ice.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.260
 So they actually had a video camera there, apart from they didn't have any of the images

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.880
 because the film froze solid.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
 Oh, no.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880
 Oh, really?

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.440
 So they took it home, tried to develop it, actually it was frozen.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440
 So they got no images.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.320
 Oh, that's not going to be a great episode for you guys.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.680
 Pictures that we know were taken and then didn't make it.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
 Yeah.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680
 That got ruined.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.880
 Like the famous D-Day shots and I'm like, like the ones that we have are just a fragment

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.800
 of the ones that he took that day.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800
 Yeah.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.680
 And the British beach shots were destroyed on the way back as well.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680
 That would be great, wouldn't it?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680
 Yeah.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.000
 And the photos that are sort of currently sitting held on ice.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.520
 So Mallory, Mallory and Irvin.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.520
 Well, that camera.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520
 Yeah, that camera is still missing.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.720
 Kodak have said that they still think because of the cold conditions that they would be

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.320
 able to develop the film.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320
 Should we ever find a camera?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320
 Yeah.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.720
 But I've had some photos sent to Kodak where I was just facing slightly towards the sun

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.080
 and they couldn't develop those.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.080
 Yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080
 Yeah.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.400
 One, one more point about Scott is that Scott also is technically in that territory of the

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.520
 Mallory and Amundsen and Mealy Earhart because we don't know where he is, but we roughly

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.920
 know where he might be because he was left in the tent.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.400
 They pack the tent over with snow and they say it will be something like 20 feet below

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.280
 the surface now with the amount of snow that's on top of it.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.600
 So we don't know where he is, but there's an estimate that within the next couple of

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.560
 centuries, the bit that he's in might snap off from the side and float down to the sea.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.160
 So one of his wishes would have been as a captain, his burial at sea.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.280
 And so in 200 years, he might get his wish, which is a little nice.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.280
 That's nice.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.760
 And that's how different we are.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.880
 I thought immediately as an archaeologist, finally we can get a hold of him, have a good

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880
 old look at him.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880
 Yeah.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880
 Yeah.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.320
 Yeah, you're just like, "Oh, it'd be so nice to bury it at sea," and I'm like, "Let's

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320
 get in there."

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320
 That lasts.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320
 Let's get investigated.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.040
 I only have one thing on letters now.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.240
 This original thought was about sort of letters, really throwing some shade.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.720
 And I found something I didn't know about Winston Churchill.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:14.680
 This letter he wrote when he was imprisoned in the Bull War, so 1899, and he's been taken

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.560
 as a prisoner for, he was only 25 years old, and him and two much older guys in the prison

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.080
 decided they were going to escape.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.680
 They hatched this really elaborate plan, and they didn't really want Churchill with them

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.280
 because he was a bit famous, he was a massive loudmouth, and he was quite overweight and

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 not very fit.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.640
 He couldn't speak Dutch or Afrikaans or Zulu, and they could.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.640
 Got it.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.920
 Anyway, Churchill was like, "I'm going to tag along," and then he just went off on

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.440
 his own and did it on a night that they didn't want to escape, jumped over the prison walls,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.840
 had no plan, no maps, couldn't speak any languages, somehow stumbled into another British guy who

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.180
 rescued him, a classic Churchill always falling into a lap of luck.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.960
 But the letter he left behind in the prison was so good, he left a letter of apology on

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.880
 his bed to Louis de Souza, who was the Boer Secretary for War, and it just said, "I have

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.680
 the honour to inform you that as I do not consider that your government have any right

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.480
 to detain me as a military prisoner, I have decided to escape from your custody."

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 Wow.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.440
 "Regressing I am unable to bid you a more ceremonious or personal farewell, I have

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.440
 the honour to be your most obedient servant, Winston Churchill."

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440
 Wow.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440
 That's great.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.280
 Yes, I always include a little bit about Dan Shriver in my letters, and didn't meet

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:30.440
 him today, but I'm sure I will tomorrow.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.200
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.200
 My fact this week is that Eleanor of Aquitaine gave us fireplaces.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200
 Nice.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 Did she?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.080
 Well, this is my claim, and I'm going to stand by it.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.080
 So, oh, I didn't realise how late it was that we really started building fireplaces, chimneys

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.680
 into our homes, but it was certainly after the Norman invasion in Britain.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:00.040
 And anyway, Eleanor of Aquitaine is around in the 12th century, and she marries Louis

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.640
 the 7th in 1137, and that meant she had to move from the south of France, which is nice

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.760
 and hot to Paris, the Île de la Cité, where she had a castle, and it was all cold and

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.480
 bare, so she refurbished, and really stripped everything down, redid it, loads of colourful

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.800
 tapestries on the wall, widened the slits, I guess I've got arrow slits.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800
 She's like, "What's the point of these arrow slits?

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.280
 I'm going to turn them into big old windows."

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.480
 Made it nice and homey, and she was really cold, so she had the masons build in fireplaces,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.120
 and there doesn't seem to be, as far as I can tell, evidence of places really having

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.800
 these built-in fireplaces, like a proper hearth, as we know today.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.640
 So, people would always have a fire in the middle of a hut with a hole in the roof, or

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.640
 not, or might build a chimney outside a house.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.280
 But look, it's spurious.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.800
 And then she married Henry II of England, and brought them over here.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800
 Is that what we're saying?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.440
 And then, I know that she did extensive refurbishments on all the places that she lived over here

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.240
 as well, the palaces, so, I mean, she must have.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.360
 OK, well, we have a historian on the show.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.000
 Well, if only fireplaces were my speciality, however, I have been to the White Tower, the

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.480
 great, most magnificent donjons in Europe, at the centre of the Tower of London, and there

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.920
 are fireplaces in the Tower of London, in the White Tower.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.920
 And that was built in the 11th century, almost 100 years before her.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
 Now, they could...

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.080
 Were they domestic fireplaces?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080
 Oh, I see.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080
 It's domestic fireplaces.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.080
 Why not say that in my original?

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.240
 Changing the rules here.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.360
 It's not in race, everyone.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
 They are.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360
 Yes.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.600
 This night, I think Ella Rackertrain is one of the most exciting and magical figures

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 in our history, and she deserves to be on this podcast.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.600
 I'm just not sure she deserves to be on.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.600
 She's in five places.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600
 This is it.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.920
 This is the only reason we're talking about her.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.400
 I refuse to stray from her connection to five places.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.640
 She was, I will allow us to stray into just her being a big interior designer, if you

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.800
 want to broaden the element of that same chat, because she did, she revamped so much that

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.080
 I think her mother-in-law refused to live with her, which is kind of sad, but I really

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.920
 liked the idea of her moving in with the king, who she thought was really monkish.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920
 This is her first marriage.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920
 Oh, he was a muppet.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920
 Yeah.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.040
 I think that those were the words, weren't they, because that's the translation.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.840
 Then the mother-in-law just thought, "This woman is taking over, making it all gaudy."

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.260
 She moved in really good musicians, feels like she really created an interesting, intelligent

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.200
 culture in this palace, which she then brought to Britain.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200
 She certainly did.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.280
 I love the story about her.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.240
 She went on crusade with the said monkish husband.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.440
 You know, they always say, my grandma used to say, "Go traveling with your girlfriend

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.840
 before you marry someone."

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.120
 You really see them for who they are, when you're traveling, when you have a bit of

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.360
 doing kind of annoying admin, you got stuck with logistics, you get a bit of tummy problems,

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.180
 and you know if this is the one.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.320
 Spending one night in an airport hotel just so you could take off a country.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320
 Indeed.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320
 I do.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320
 Murdering some non-Christians.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.320
 Well, yes.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.040
 Well, no, in the case of her, of course, he was insufficiently forward in murdering non-Christians,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.760
 because she thought he was wet, she thought he was a bit useless.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.760
 They go away on crusade.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.240
 It's the ultimate sort of travel, get to know your partner, travel to adventure, and just

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.040
 comes back and she just goes, "I'm dumping you.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.360
 You are a spectacular useless human being."

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.960
 And they get it all annulled in the way that aristocrats managed to do.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.280
 It took a while, didn't it?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.840
 They kept asking the Pope, they kept telling them to keep shocking each other and try to

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.840
 make an air, I think.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840
 And that did not work.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.360
 The Pope supposedly made them a special bed to sleep in to make them more likely to have

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360
 sex with each other.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.360
 No way.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360
 Apparently.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360
 What's a bed that makes you more likely to have sex with someone?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360
 You know, they're a fireplace, presumably.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360
 Yeah?

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360
 Yeah.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.360
 It's nice.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.960
 But it didn't work because the year she got divorced from him, she married the very hunky

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.000
 young Duke of Normandy, Henry, who then became Henry II of England.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 And so she...

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.560
 And everyone goes, "Henry, the second is a great empire."

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.200
 And I always think it's odd that we don't call it, perhaps it's not odd, given me.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
 Yeah.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.800
 It's too short for such a name, but that actually is kind of her empire in a way.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.600
 She's the one who brings all these massive French possessions.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.480
 So basically she and Henry end up owning more of France than the King of France.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.360
 And then her absolutely useless sons just spunk the whole lot of it.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.400
 But only after she dies.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.560
 Basically, if you look at the history of that empire, it essentially lasts for the course

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.560
 of her life.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.560
 Right.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560
 And then her...

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.680
 The most useless son in English history, which is up against their composition, John.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.680
 You don't like John?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680
 Oh, okay.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680
 I don't...

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680
 You don't like John?

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680
 Sorry.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680
 I'm fond...

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.680
 I'm fond of John.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680
 What are we talking about?

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680
 He gets a bad rep, doesn't he, Anna?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680
 He's got...

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.680
 My God.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680
 Elevator was an extraordinary mother, wasn't she?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680
 Elevator on the broadcast.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.680
 I've always wanted to meet one.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680
 Here we are, friends.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680
 So...

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680
 What's like John of England?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.600
 Is of England necessary?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.600
 He's not from anywhere else.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.200
 He doesn't have any other nickname.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200
 It's not John that...

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.200
 Oh, he does have other names.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200
 Oh, yes.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.960
 And you know what they are because you're grimacing.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.920
 The other nicknames are Lackland and Softsword.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920
 Yeah.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.480
 Which basically all that means is poor guy didn't inherit any land and Softsword didn't

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.320
 really want to be too fighty.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.320
 Does it not mean impotent?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320
 Oh.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.780
 Like all of this sort of seemed to say Softsword genuinely is about his military power.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.780
 Really?

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.780
 He lost the empire.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.800
 He only inherited the throne by possibly starving his nephew to death.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.000
 He controlled an empire that stretched through much of what is now France, Ireland and England.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.960
 And by the time he died, his empire was the East Midlands.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.960
 That's a nice part of England.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.960
 That's part of the world.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960
 Don't get me wrong.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960
 That's part of the world.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960
 Lucky, I would be very happy to have an empire there.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.680
 Just before he died, when he contracted dysentery, he lost the crown jewels while crossing the

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.800
 wash two set aforementioned East Midlands.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.000
 So he lost the crown jewels, arrived in the East Midlands and died.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Yeah.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.440
 And then his, luckily for that benighted family, his dysentery saved the dynasty because his

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.280
 son, they stuck his son on the throne because he was so young and they worked out they

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280
 could just manipulate him.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.640
 That's a nice multiple, isn't it?

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.640
 Dysentery saved the dynasty.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640
 Yeah.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.520
 The reason I like King John is because we don't mind about owning empires.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 What we mind is about being good to your mum and I think a lot of us don't know they got

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 on well.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.520
 They did.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.520
 And also well done him because her favourite was famously Richard the Lionheart who everyone

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.120
 loves and Richard the Lionheart dies and she becomes very fond of John.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.080
 And actually I think the only time that he really showed true courage and desire to defeat

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.960
 the opposition is when she was abducted by her grandson, I believe when she was about

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.960
 80.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.080
 And that was when John was like, no way, you're not abducting my mum.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.680
 And he probably went and defeated him and rescued her because was Richard the Lionheart that

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680
 good?

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680
 Yeah.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.160
 I think he was less good than his statue outside the House of Lords deserves.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.640
 I mean, he didn't show any interest in England.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.000
 He just was off on Crusades and then he got captured to his cave where they kept him.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Yeah.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.200
 It's in, it's, it's a 20 minute drive from where my family grew up in Austria.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200
 Am I right in saying that?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200
 Or did they?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200
 That sounds right.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200
 Yeah.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 Yeah.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.200
 It was down there.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:53.120
 And they asked for 150,000 silver marks, which was at the time, three times the annual income

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120
 of England.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.320
 And today that would probably be in the trillion.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.320
 It's about 1.5 trillion something like that, maybe around 2 trillion pounds that they asked.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.400
 So how do you get that money?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.960
 She basically just had to tax the hell out of the entire country, Eleanor of Aquitaine.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960
 Right.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.240
 So he's a good mother, bad leader maybe.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240
 Good mother.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240
 Yeah.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.440
 There's a great quote about King John.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.200
 He was a very bad man, more cruel than all the others.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.560
 He lost after beautiful women and because of this, he shamed the high men of the land

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.680
 for which reason he was greatly hated.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.640
 Whenever he could, he told lies rather than the truth.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.640
 Yeah.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.640
 But who wrote this?

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640
 This wasn't his mate who wrote this, was it?

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.160
 It was, it was possibly not his.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160
 And snow.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160
 It is.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
 I will, I will agree.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160
 I will admit it.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
 It's an anonymous chronicle.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 Anonymous of betune.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.480
 I didn't realise how fun bitching about historical figures is.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.800
 I'm having so much fun.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.440
 Well, welcome to my world.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.800
 A costume about dead people, so we do for you.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.040
 Well, what do you think then of her second husband?

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.600
 Because that, he was more fiery, wasn't he?

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.840
 It was like she went from the monk to the player.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840
 Spunk.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.840
 Spunk.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840
 Spunk, that's better.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.280
 Henry II, sort of, almost the great king of English history.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.560
 He had a young, his uncle Henry unimaginatively and he rebelled against him, Richard rebelled

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.560
 against him.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.080
 So he was very bad at managing his sons.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.440
 Well, but they rebelled because Eleanor was very good at managing her sons, right?

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.660
 So Eleanor sort of persuaded all her sons to rebel against him.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:18.880
 I'm basically in a grump, a sort of 700 year or 800 year-long grump because if he'd managed

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.760
 to cement that empire, can you imagine what a great country this has been stretching from

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.760
 the Pyrenees to Carlisle?

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.720
 Do you think Mbappe could have played for England?

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720
 Exactly.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720
 Oh my God.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720
 Right.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.760
 It'd just been glorious and, you know, that's why I often, you know, it's like Henry V didn't

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.480
 wash his goddamn hands, got this entry and died, you know?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.560
 I mean, it's like, sort it out, Harry, England, twat.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560
 Wow.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.880
 Born in the water before, we're drinking it, you muppet guy.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.920
 But Harry, for England, that's what.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.480
 But also that reminds, yeah, that reminds, and then that reminds me of the last chance,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.760
 the last best chance we had of this glorious Anglo-French nation, which is the most extraordinary

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.000
 thing when Winston Churchill offered a full union of Britain, UK and France.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 In 1940, when the Germans were overrunning France, desperate to keep their more, particularly

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.920
 their navy and their colonies in the war, Churchill goes, which is always brilliant when the brakes

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:16.080
 it had bangers on too much out, he goes, Britain and France, full union, bang, one insoluble

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.600
 country, let's do it.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 Let's do it.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600
 And the French said no.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.280
 Was there any possibility that was going to happen?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.600
 It doesn't feel like it was a likely historical.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.080
 It wasn't likely, but I mean, you know, lots of things are likely.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.080
 Yeah.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.160
 Getting shot, getting shot in the ear isn't very likely.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.240
 I mean, like the two most consequential presidents of the 20th century, FDR and Reagan, FDR survived

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.360
 at about a six foot range.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.400
 He's fired five shots being fired at him, which killed the guy next to him and other

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400
 people around him.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.240
 Before he'd even put at the height of the depression, before he'd been inaugurated to

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.200
 his present elect, Reagan was killed about two months into his first term, no Reagan,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200
 no Roosevelt.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200
 He was killed.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.200
 Sorry.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200
 Almost killed.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 Almost killed.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.400
 He was like, "Bite a fragment of a, you know, the bullet had been a few millimeters, you

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400
 know, Reagan would have been killed."

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.280
 The two most consequential presidents of the 20th century had absolutely no right to survive,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.280
 under pure luck.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.760
 That's this mad journey we're on, folks.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.760
 Yeah.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760
 It's crazy.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.240
 Something about Eleanor of Aquitaine that is not often said, so Queen of France, Queen

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.240
 of England.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.240
 Yeah.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.240
 Not many people have done the double.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.240
 Not many people.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240
 I think the only one.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.320
 Mary Queen of Scots claimed it, controversially, you know, sort of could have claimed it.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.320
 Yeah.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.320
 All right.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320
 How would followers might have claimed it?

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320
 What do we know about her grandmother?

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320
 Dangerous.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320
 Dangerous.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.320
 Dangerous.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.320
 Yeah.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.060
 Her grandmother's called Dangerous.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.060
 That's all we know, right?

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.060
 Is there much?

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.060
 No one knows her real name.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060
 That was a nickname, I think.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.060
 Yeah.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.120
 But no one knows what her real name was.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.360
 We think it's Amadege.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360
 Right.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.760
 But yeah, she was known by everyone as dangerous.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.960
 That's so cool.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.080
 Because she was such a...

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080
 Player.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080
 ...Ductrix.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.080
 Yeah.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.540
 And you know, I didn't know that Eleanor just means other anal.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.540
 So anal is a name.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.540
 Sorry.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.960
 No, you said other anal.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960
 Yes, no.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.600
 I didn't know that would be Eleanor.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600
 Right.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.280
 So I think her mum was called anal.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280
 But...

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280
 It's this word you keep saying.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280
 Right.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280
 So think of how Eleanor's spelled.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.280
 Yeah.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.280
 Well, it's alienor.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280
 Yeah.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280
 It's how it's spelled.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.360
 You knock off the E-L and swap round the A-E. So A-E-N-O-R was a name.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.360
 Okay.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.280
 And you're called Eleanor if you're the other anal.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.680
 So her mum was called anal, or anal.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.200
 But now we only have Eleanor.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.200
 We only have other anals.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200
 Why is the name anal?

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200
 Well, I think we've...

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.420
 We've got to prove that in this podcast.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420
 Why are we...

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.420
 Why are we not...

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.420
 Other people called anal.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.420
 Yeah, she answered this.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.420
 I guess.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.920
 I didn't know as long on debate as I was expecting.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.920
 I mean...

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920
 A-N-O-R...

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920
 I always thought that when you write it down...

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.420
 It's not when you speak it, is it?

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.020
 It becomes clear.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.900
 I think it's weird not to wear the courts of love.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.900
 Oh, okay.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.900
 Okay.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.460
 Can we just ask Dan if he believes the courts of love existed?

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.460
 Okay.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.460
 Okay.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:00.100
 So the courts of love was the idea that Eleanor had this special court for women who had

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.620
 fallen out with their husbands and they would give them a base and stuff, right?

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.620
 Yeah.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.620
 It sounds great.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.620
 It's like a problem page.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.620
 You meant the other dad.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:13.200
 I was like, "Why do you think I know anything about that?"

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.520
 You love resolving people's romantic issues.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520
 It's so confused.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.520
 Yeah.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.520
 Sorry.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.520
 Other dad.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.520
 I just think it's cool that this is an idea.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.600
 I think it was written down by Eleanor's daughter and no one knows if it's made up

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.200
 fantasy or if it really happened.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200
 And what was it?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.920
 That a bunch of noble women including Eleanor, her daughter and some other noble women would

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:35.380
 have nights turn up with their romantic problems like, "Hey, I fancy this woman, but there's

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.580
 this other woman who fancies me.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.940
 Who should I get with?"

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:38.940
 And they would arbitrate.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.940
 It's not cool.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.940
 Have you tried Eleanor?

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.940
 God.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:53.980
 As someone with a very, very formidable mother-in-law, I can imagine that's the kind of stuff that

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.980
 they'd get up to.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.980
 Is that how you were selected a court of love?

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.980
 No.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.240
 I would have never have made it through that process, obviously.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.560
 But no, I think if you're a very impressive, powerful old woman in the Middle Ages, I can

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:12.080
 imagine that you would knock heads together and sort out your love lives in your retinue.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.080
 Sort out the men.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.080
 Yeah.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080
 Filthy men in the palace.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.960
 But I think the jury's out in general, right?

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960
 Yeah.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.960
 I'm not sure.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.960
 The jury of the courts of love.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.960
 Well, that is also medieval history.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.960
 Full stop.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960
 Yeah.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960
 It's all just jury's out.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960
 Really?

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
 Oh, annoying.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.900
 The only thing that I can say, certainly, is that Eleanor of Aquatown did not invent

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.900
 the fireplace.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.900
 Oh, I cannot believe.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.900
 I know that's going to be the ending to this section, and I'm furious.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:44.020
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.020
 Okay.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.660
 My fact this week is that when the Romans defeated barbarian tribes, they would often

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.780
 send them to Britain as punishment.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.540
 Well, in their faces, because Britain is great.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.540
 Yeah.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.540
 Great Britain, exactly.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.540
 Right.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.540
 I'm looking at that in case you could say it's wrong.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.540
 Yeah, you look at me.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.540
 This is nervous, look.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.540
 I mean, it's definitely true.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.540
 We know, for example, there were Syrians.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.560
 They were, "Cool, there's a thing on Hadrian's wall about the Euphrates boatmen that were

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.040
 brought up to work on the tine."

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 Can you imagine?

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040
 Oh, my God.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.640
 And it's also true that the Romans did regard Britain as the end of the godhammer.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.800
 Although there were periods when the emperor was in Britain, and it was like the heart

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800
 of the empire.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.800
 But for long periods, you're probably like, "You're going to get sent to the furthest

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800
 frontier."

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.800
 I can imagine that.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.800
 That is true.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.780
 There's a great line that a poet wrote to Hadrian, he says, "I don't want to be Caesar,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:32.860
 i.e. the emperor, stroll about among the Britons and endure the Scythian winters."

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.540
 So he's comparing being among the Britons as winter on the Ukrainian steppe.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.380
 Like that, those are the two worst things you can imagine as a Roman.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.940
 Well, what was it like when they got here?

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.940
 Would it have been nice?

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.760
 Well, I mean, it's much as it is now.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.420
 I mean, it's the weather is average.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.420
 You know, what can I say?

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.780
 I think the truth is that only Romans wrote this history, right, the barbarians.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.000
 And so we have no idea really what stuff was like, but you're just saying the Romans hated

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.760
 Caesar was really mean about it himself and said, "The Brits are the most ignorant people

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.760
 I've ever conquered."

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.940
 And Cicero said, "They're the ugliest, most stupid race I ever saw."

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.320
 And there also seems to be, I was going through the sources of what Romans said about Brits.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.900
 It seems like we were always naked, and that doesn't make sense to me, because it's fricking

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900
 cold here.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.420
 Well, one Roman source says the reason we were naked is because it was so wet.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.500
 So this one Roman source said, "Most of Britain is marshland, because it's flooded by the

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.700
 continual ocean tithes.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.700
 Barbarians usually swim in these swamps or run around with them, submerge the waste."

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.340
 Of course, they're practically naked and don't mind the mud, because they're unfamiliar

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.340
 with the use of clothing.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.460
 And actually the sense is that wearing loads of trousers and things, you just end up just

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.920
 getting wet and muddy all the time, so let it all hang out.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.100
 I've also been out on a night out in Newcastle in February, and they still don't wear clothes

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.100
 up there.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.100
 Yeah, no true.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.100
 I guess they were made of hardier stuff.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.860
 I did swim in the river at the weekend, and I thought I wouldn't be able to wade around

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.820
 in this all day, every day, come rain or shine naked, but well done, those early Brits.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.260
 That's just as tough as Amundsen.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:02.220
 So there was a thing called Deportatio in Inselam, which apparently means exile to an island.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:07.140
 Sometimes you go to Britain, if you've been particularly bad, Tiberias exile to Rhodes,

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.900
 which must have been quite nice in comparison, I'd say.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:18.060
 But then Nacatius Dio wrote about 5,000 Sarmatian cavalry who were sent to Britain after the

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.380
 Romans had taken them over.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:26.100
 Britain was just a nightmare for the Romans, so unending ulcer and pain and suffering.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.020
 They did not conquer the whole archipelago, right?

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.500
 So you've got Ireland and you've got Amundsen, Scotland, for much of the period was unconquered.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.420
 And as a result, you cannot expend the resources required to fully conquer the archipelago,

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:41.220
 given its geographical and weather and nightmarish difficulty of doing so.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.140
 But then it's too embarrassing to leave the bit that you have conquered, but then that's

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:51.340
 almost untenable because your entire coastline from Cornwall to Carlisle across to Newcastle,

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:57.020
 it's just vulnerable to these unending incessant raids by these lunatics.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.380
 And then the north coast exposed to the unconquered Baltics and stuff.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.380
 So it's a nightmare.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.380
 It's a nightmare.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.860
 When did they, was it like 300s?

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.580
 When did they finally bugger off?

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:10.140
 They sort of pack up shop at about 405, 410.

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.740
 The biggest concentration of coin hordes in our history is from that period.

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.740
 It's quite interesting.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:19.580
 So you, you bury your money when you're very, very pessimistic about the immediate future,

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.580
 right?

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.580
 Yeah.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.580
 Like, let's get them.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.980
 And so we've just got this massive spike of coin hordes.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.980
 It's kind of scary.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.980
 Oh really?

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.980
 It's all the Romans burying their money as they do.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.580
 All of these Romans, the villas, just everyone burying it, of course, it also means those

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.580
 people didn't come back for it.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.780
 Now, maybe they escaped, but it often, occasionally, would have meant they would have killed and

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.780
 stuff.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.700
 So, so those coin hordes have been buried and no one's come back from.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.180
 So there's just a sense of just society just kind of collapsing in the early 5th century.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.660
 The kind of Romano-British that were left, the sort of Roman elite that were still there.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.980
 We get letters written from the Romans going, "Please, the Romans come and help."

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.980
 And it's like the barbarians push us into the sea and the sea pushed us back onto lands

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.980
 we have to choose whether to drown or be murdered.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.980
 Oh God.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.820
 You know, it's like, it is just, it's full, full Armageddon.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:58.820
 Yeah.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.820
 It's crazy.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.220
 So that's the thing that we still seem to have from the barbarians.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:08.500
 Any time someone says, "Bla, bla, bla," supposedly that has come from the word "barbarian" itself.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.380
 So the word "barbarian" supposedly comes from ancient Greek.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.380
 And it was taken.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.380
 That definitely comes from ancient Greek.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.380
 Yeah.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.380
 Sorry.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.380
 Sorry.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380
 It supposedly comes from the fact that when foreigners were speaking and you didn't understand,

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.500
 you would say, "Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba."

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.500
 That's what it sounds like to us.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:26.460
 And that has evolved to, "Bla, bla, bla," so anytime we say, "Bla, bla, bla," we're

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.460
 barbarians.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.460
 Yeah.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.340
 It's literally anyone who's not Roman and sort of Greek, isn't it?

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.340
 Yeah.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.340
 And it covers, covers a lot.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.780
 The biggest barbarians of them all, the Goths, probably.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.780
 The Goths.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.780
 Okay.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.780
 Yes.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.780
 Yeah.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.780
 Because they were like, sort of stimulated.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.780
 Umi and all.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.780
 The ball of Rome.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.780
 War of Black.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.780
 Oh yeah.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.780
 Oh sorry, Anne, war lots of Black.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.780
 And we'll really miss it all the time.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.780
 Most of my chemical romance.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780
 Yeah.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.780
 So yeah.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.780
 Retopping Whitby.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.780
 Yeah.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.260
 The Goths crossed the Danube, didn't they, in like the three seventies.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.780
 And it seemed to work incredibly well, the Roman policy towards barbarians for hundreds

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.780
 of years.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.500
 So people would knock at the door and say, "Hey, we want to be part of Rome, please."

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.980
 They might be fleeing, you know, other forces or whatever, which want to be part of Rome.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.180
 We want to be part of Rome.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.160
 And so they'd be split up, tribes would be split up.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.020
 They'd have to abandon all loyalty to tribal chieftains, give some of their military to

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.300
 the Romans.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.820
 And then they were sort of allowed to stay in mind their own business, I think, basically.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.900
 They messed it up a bit when the Goths came over.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.180
 I think they let too many over, then they stopped letting other people.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.180
 And then basically...

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.180
 All right, Nigel.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:32.060
 They didn't know enough food to feed them all, so then they got upset.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.020
 And then they threw this dinner party.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.540
 And I think Rome fell because of a cocked up dinner party.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.540
 Really?

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.340
 Because it was this Roman general, Lupi Kinnis, who realized the Goths were coming over, invited

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.820
 a couple of their leaders.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.460
 He was getting really drunk with them.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.860
 He told his men to go and kind of besiege the Goths.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.020
 And word got back to the dinner party and it all kind of kicked off.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.460
 And was a bit pissed by then.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.100
 So Lupi Kinnis was probably a bit loose with his instructions and started killing some

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.980
 of the people who'd come with them.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.260
 And that was kind of the beginning.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.420
 And then the Goths got together fought against him.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.220
 And that was when the Roman Empire started.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.220
 It's very...

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.220
 When was that?

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.220
 376.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.140
 It's a catastrophic battle at Adrianople, one of the worst defeats in Roman history where

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.340
 the Eastern Emperor takes on the Goths.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.740
 The Western Emperor's coming to help him, but he wants the glory for himself, doesn't he?

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.180
 So he attacked too early, just got totally annihilated.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.940
 And then the Goths just went on this rampage all the way through the Western Empire.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.940
 Right.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:32.180
 I think the only time the Romans really got defeated by barbarians until this period was

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.300
 the battle of Teutoburg, which we mentioned, which was all in this forest.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.300
 And they basically want to take on the Germans.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.740
 So the Germans attacked the Romans, didn't they, in the forest and turned out the Romans

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.860
 couldn't hack it basically and were absolutely vanquished.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:51.540
 So I think they killed 10% of their military and they never tried to go into Germany again,

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.540
 really.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:58.060
 And that is basically why we have that division today between Latin languages and German languages.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.060
 Oh, really.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.060
 Yeah, it's one of my significant defeats here.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.060
 Yeah.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.780
 Augustus ran around the palace in Rome, shouting, "Varus, give me back my legions!"

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.020
 I was like, it was one of the worst defeats.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.940
 But then they did sort of nibble into bits, Joey, but effectively, yeah, that policy of

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.380
 just permanent expansion was sort of brought to a halt at that point.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.380
 Just like that.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.260
 Today, that's why we basically have two big language groups in that moment.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.980
 If you ever want to depress yourself, read about that, it was a torrential rain in a

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.020
 dark German wood and the Romans marching along and their guide, their German guide, a guy

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.860
 called Arminius, and he sort of disappeared.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.420
 And it turns out he's actually was guiding them in this terrible trap.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.980
 He had been a collaborator, but in fact, he didn't have to be the leader of the resistance.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.740
 And then just ambushed repeatedly, the general commits suicide.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.860
 I mean, it's just this total annihilation of a once mighty force.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.140
 I can't bring myself to get depressed about something that happened 2000 years ago.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:54.020
 There's just enough today, or in the last hundred years, "I let myself get over that,

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.060
 and I think you need to work on it."

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.220
 What's the big one that wakes you up at night?

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.220
 This is very personal.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.580
 I mean, I have an overactive imagination.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.940
 At night, I do kind of read about the first emperor of China, Chinchuan, the most powerful

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.820
 man in the world, builds China extraordinary dynasty that's going to last a thousand years.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.780
 Within three years, his children and grandchildren are enslaved and murdered in the streets.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:15.780
 Being hand dynasty.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.260
 And you think, "If that can happen to him, it can happen to anybody.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.460
 I'm just, it's just terrifying."

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.900
 Are you ready for history here to be toppled and your kids attacked either successive?

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.900
 Indeed.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.060
 But I just, the horror of somebody, you know, the peak of their powers, like Cresus in Lidia,

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.540
 you know, the rich man in the world, little did he know the fate that was waiting for

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.540
 him.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.860
 "Oh, wait, we can wait for all of us too."

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.820
 And so you feel you might be now at the peak of your powers, you're at the most dangerous

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.820
 level.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.820
 That's even sadder.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.820
 I'll see if this is as good as it gets for me.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.020
 It's a sad indictment of my life.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.460
 Yes, relatively speaking, I'm probably at the peak of my powers.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.420
 And then one day I might, you know, I might be standing there with a kitchen knife defending

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.420
 my house.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.420
 Yeah.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.700
 So they'll be talking about the fall of Dan Snow's empire a thousand years.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.820
 They'll be talking about sort of the coinhold of the south coast as the Danes pulled up

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.820
 on the beach.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:13.380
 And then Harland comes over the hedge, I'm there, having to defend my family.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.260
 Anyway, that's the kind of thing I worry about.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.260
 I'm glad you asked.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.820
 It's kind of, I wasn't hoping, I was hoping to share that.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:28.660
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.940
 And that is my fact.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:35.220
 My fact this week is that America has a witness protection program for their trees.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.220
 Oh, okay.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.260
 So this is a really cool idea, I think.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.820
 There's a lot of historical spots in America where battles, civil wars would have been

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.100
 fought and so on.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:48.180
 And often when the landscape is done of all the debris of whatever happened there, the

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.540
 trees will remain and they're technically witnesses to history.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.700
 In many cases, these trees might have taken bullets in from the wars and the bark would

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.460
 have grown over and embedded in these things.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.500
 So they're actually literally holding history inside of them that we don't yet know about.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.660
 And so this was an idea that was set up by the Chief of the National Park Services and

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:11.020
 they decided, let's start designating trees, a witness protection, whereby you can't

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.180
 chop them down, you can't harm them, but they're archived in the Congress library and so on.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.180
 And yeah.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.980
 That's just a classic American.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:22.460
 For something that we have here called a tree protection order, they just have a much cooler

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.460
 name for it.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.460
 Yeah.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.100
 When you said that, I did think they sort of hide them, they move them, they get the

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.020
 Gettysburg trees and they move them up to Saratoga, they give them a new name.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.300
 Why is there a bunch of birch trees here, a one sycamore tree in the middle disguised,

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.820
 a little swearing of silver coat.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.820
 Yeah.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.460
 This is brother, shut up.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.900
 Are people trying to harm these trees because that's what you expect?

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.860
 I think I just think they just want to be nice to trees, don't they?

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.860
 Yeah.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.620
 Well, I guess we do accidentally hurt trees, I guess, you know, we do accidentally chop

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.620
 them down.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.220
 Yeah, I've always accidentally, I don't think anyone's ever accidentally chopped down a

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.220
 tree.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.220
 Yeah.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.220
 But there's a sign up.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.260
 So like the loggers will go around a forest presumably and then there'll be a big sign

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.260
 that's like this tree.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.540
 Oh, which we have in this great country as well.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.540
 Yeah.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.540
 But we don't have a cool name.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.060
 So you might be chopping down a load of trees and accidentally chop down an important one.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.060
 Absolutely.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.060
 Is an example of that.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.060
 Yeah.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.500
 And do we have it in this country for sort of trees that have witnessed great historic

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.500
 events?

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.500
 Well, we should do.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.020
 We did chop down the Royal Oak.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.020
 Yeah.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.020
 Great story.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.980
 So there was a Royal Oak that Charles, well, when he was then Charles Stewart was hiding

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:35.540
 in and the Parliamentarian forces were rummaging around beneath the canopy and he dined out

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.020
 in the story for the rest of his life.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.660
 Anyway, he then came down, went over to France and then the Royal Oak became, he became back

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.540
 as king, pubs reopened, lots of pubs called the Royal Oak, sort of it became a meme.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.060
 And then in the 19th century, lots of people started visiting and like chopping bits off

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.820
 and traipsing across this guy's farm.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:58.020
 And this lunatic farmer's chopped the tree down, zero respect for trees or witnesses

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.020
 to history.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.020
 Trumbling his crops.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.020
 Trumbling his crops.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:09.580
 But there is now a daughter or a son of that tree, which was sort of recovered and grown.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.380
 And then that one was hit by lightning and now, and Prince Charles, that made him a bit

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.380
 sweaty.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.740
 So he went and planted another tree, so there's now a grandchild.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.820
 The main one's looking a bit, it's like it's been hit by oiling.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.340
 And then the other one's looking quite verdant and fresh and it's small.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.340
 It's about six foot high.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.140
 So there's three or there's two generations there on that spot.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.340
 It's in Shropshire.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.220
 There's the, the Newton apple tree, which is both in the garden of where Newton live.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.420
 But they also took a cutting and made a, I guess a daughter or a son of, they say it's

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.420
 a clone.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.980
 So I don't know if it means it just is the exact tree.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.180
 I don't know what that terminology is, but it's growing outside on one of the colleges

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180
 at Cambridge.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.820
 And I was reading in Merlin Sheldrake's book.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.300
 He wrote this incredible book about fungi and how it works in the world.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.500
 And he said that he wanted to grab some of the apples off it because he was interested

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.100
 in making a cider.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.580
 And the tour guide said, you are not allowed to take apples off this tree.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.620
 The apples are here specifically for all the tourists to see them fall to the ground so

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.820
 they can experience gravity as it was first discovered.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.820
 Jesus.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.140
 You're going to be sitting and waiting a long time on you.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.100
 It's pretty rare you actually see an apple fall off the tree.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.460
 Pretty cool though to see an apple fall off the tree.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.460
 On windy days, the tourism sort of quadrupled.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.460
 Get together.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.460
 Get to the tree.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:28.340
 I was, I went to a historically important trees child today on the way to work.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.340
 Did you?

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:30.340
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:36.300
 And Frank, when she was in her hiding spot, she described a horse chestnut tree that was

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.540
 just outside the building and it was, in 2005 they found it was suffering from a fungal

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.980
 disease and so they decided to take cuttings and they planted it all over the world and

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.340
 there's one of them in hybrid fields just near my house.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.820
 And you saw that today?

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.820
 Yeah.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.820
 That's amazing.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.220
 Has her one's toppled, hasn't it?

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.220
 I think it has.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.220
 Yeah.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.220
 Not long ago.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.220
 It's not long ago.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.220
 There's a tree and winds a great part.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.820
 There's a oak tree and winds a great part that they think has been there since before

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.820
 the Norman Conqueror.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.820
 So before...

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.820
 Before fireplaces.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.820
 Before fireplaces.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.300
 And so William the Conqueror would have passed that tree.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.300
 No way.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.300
 No way.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.300
 Oh my gosh.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.300
 You see?

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.900
 The oak trees in churchyards are said to be thousands of years old, right?

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.900
 Yes.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.860
 I think there's one that's claimed to be over 4,000 years old.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.860
 They're pretty amazing.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:28.020
 I've got a friend who eats you berries, sort of like does while foraging and the thing

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.620
 about you berries is, which people may know, a seed of the you berry, which is inside the

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.380
 berry, is incredibly poisonous.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.380
 So...

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.380
 So he spits the seed out.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.380
 Absolutely.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.580
 So I went on a walk with him once and it was me and another friend and him and you know,

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.140
 my other friend said, "All right, I'll taste it."

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.740
 Put it in his mouth, chewing around for a while and my friend said to him, "And you spat

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.740
 the seed out, right?"

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.740
 Like poor mate.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:48.740
 It was like, "No, what do you mean?

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:49.740
 Spit it out!

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.740
 Spit it out!"

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.740
 And it's...

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.740
 Yeah, he just sucks the fruit off.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.500
 But if you accidentally swallow the seed, you will die.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.940
 I think we'd like to just say, "Public service to our listeners.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.580
 Do not eat you berries."

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.580
 Don't.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.580
 That's a metaphor for so much of life, isn't it?

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:07.460
 The sweet, sweet outer layer, the poisonous death-giving fruit within.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.460
 Okay.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.020
 No more of your weird nightmares.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.020
 I'm not.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.020
 I'm just kidding you.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.020
 I don't know.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.020
 I want to workshop that.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.780
 It's interesting that you know about fruit on a U-Tree.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.980
 I've never thought about that because I just think about U-Trees as a source of longbows.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:20.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.820
 They're sort of stretchy and squashy in exactly the right parts, basically.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:34.060
 There was a famous tree, the sycamore tree in Tollpuddle where the Tollpuddle 6 began

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:39.660
 and started the friendly society of agricultural labours which eventually led to the beginning

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.220
 of trade unionism and stuff like that.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.580
 The story is very interesting, but I'm not going to go into it because the interesting

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.260
 thing is that Tollpuddle used to be called Tollpiddle.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.260
 I know.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.140
 They rebranded, didn't they?

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.140
 They rebranded.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.140
 It just sounds so crap.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.620
 Well, they embarrassed by Tollpiddle.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.460
 I think, well, we're not exactly sure why they rebranded, but it seems likely.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:05.620
 So there was a river piddle that went by this town and the Tollpiddle is named after there.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:11.820
 And then in 1934, locals were still calling it Tollpiddle and a journalist from the Daily

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.420
 Worker went there and said, "Is this Tollpuddle?"

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:19.260
 And they went, "Oh, nobody around here don't know no such name as Tollpuddle."

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.540
 And it does seem that maybe because it had to be more respectable and because it's such

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.420
 an important place for the trade union movement that they didn't think Tollpiddle was a proper

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420
 name for it.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.420
 So they remember Tollpuddle?

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.420
 Maybe.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.420
 Call it Toll Ocean.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.100
 Call it Toll Waterfall.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.700
 One of the theories that Queen Victoria visited and they changed it for her, but we don't

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.700
 really know why.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.500
 It might have just evolved that way.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.740
 You can still go and have a picnic underneath the oak tree at the vine, the house in Basingstoke,

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.980
 where Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn used to go when they were lovers.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.980
 No.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.980
 It's great.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.820
 If you want to really condemn a relationship that you have.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.820
 Well, just think about the tasty fruit with the poisonous...

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.820
 Yeah.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.820
 Yeah.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.820
 Does it have, like, Henry Hart?

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:02.820
 Yeah, it probably does.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.980
 You know, Catherine crossed out, sharing the cross now.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.140
 Have you heard of the Sheffield chainsaw massacre?

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.820
 Is that the original title?

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:19.420
 This was very recently in the 2010s and Sheffield Council basically cut down thousands of trees.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.420
 Oh, of course.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.420
 It was really controversial, wasn't it?

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.420
 Really controversial.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.340
 There was, like, a 450-year-old Melbourne oak that was cut down.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.420
 There was loads of historical trees that were cut down.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.500
 And basically, the council signed a contract with an infrastructure company saying every

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.140
 time you cut down a tree, we'll give you some money.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:41.780
 Maybe they're too old, or maybe they're dangerous, or maybe they're digging up the pavement so

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.580
 people might trip over it or something, and then they got another consultancy to submit

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:52.540
 a report on how many of the trees needed felling, and there was a big mistake in that second

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.540
 report.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:59.020
 And so they cut down thousands and thousands of these trees in Sheffield for no reason whatsoever.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.620
 So it is just gross incompetence.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.620
 I'm afraid so, yeah.

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.100
 Have they planted some trees?

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.140
 Oh, they will replant them, yeah.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.140
 Wow, that's bad.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.700
 I hope someone's head was chopped.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:12.700
 I was on HMS Victory the other day, and they are looking, they're doing a refurb.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.700
 It's like Triggers broom.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.900
 They're basically entirely rebuilding it every so often.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.900
 Where is it?

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:17.900
 Where is it?

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:18.900
 In Portsmouth.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.900
 And they are using oak from France, because there aren't enough old oak trees.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.340
 They just go to Sheffield and say, "I hear you've got loads of oak."

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.580
 So I might have to put them in touch.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.580
 Wow.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.540
 I mean, but France basically is England before and after.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.540
 Exactly.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.420
 And the curator there was like, kind of come up with this real sophistry about it's great

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:42.020
 that we're taking supplies from the old enemy, I'm like, "Look mate, just like it."

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.020
 We're working together now.

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020
 Yeah, yeah.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.020
 It's a shocker.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.020
 We don't have oaks in this country.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.020
 Come on, just admit it.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.940
 But yeah, they used to go around the forests when they're building things out of wood.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.060
 And they would actually find the trees that were the right shape for the bit that they

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.060
 need to build.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.460
 So if you wanted something called a knee on a ship, which has a sort of vaguely right

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:03.180
 angle sort of bracket, you'd just go, "That tree's got some, that one's perfect."

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.060
 And you'd go and sort of scribble it out, and then they'd know to chop down that tree.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.020
 And then the carter would be like, "We'd have to do much work with that."

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020
 Oh, that's great.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.020
 You could just cut that midsection where it's already at.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.020
 So clever, isn't it?

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.020
 That's great.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.740
 So there's always images in the 18th century of people hanging these weird sort of cutouts

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:21.300
 on the side of trees to show the shapes that people make so much sense, doesn't it?

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.860
 Then did they actually, the new forest was just planted for boats, wasn't it?

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:26.860
 Yeah, a lot of it.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:27.860
 Yeah.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:31.140
 The new forest, I live there, so I'm going to buy a new forest.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.140
 Forest does not designate woodland.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.140
 Oh, right.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.780
 It's just a legal designation of forest, a royal forest, a piece of ground on which

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.980
 certain different types of law apply.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:40.980
 Really?

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:45.140
 And there is obviously forestry in woodland within it, but yeah, lots of it's more in

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.140
 open grounds.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.300
 And that's true of the word forest.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.300
 Yeah.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.380
 Forest kind of means this has this legal meaning.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.380
 That's so interesting.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.380
 It's weird, isn't it?

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.500
 So all the ancient woodland in Britain tragically I think has been cut down, but so a lot of

00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.340
 the trees in the new forest now were planted at various times in the national crisis, whether

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.020
 it was by any date for a navy or the Georgians or the Commonwealth war, obviously lots of

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.220
 pines, but to pick props for when they're running out of woods.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.540
 The new forest does commoning, doesn't it?

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.540
 Oh, yeah, we do, yeah.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.540
 Do you, are you a commoner?

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.660
 I'm not a commoner, unfortunately, because my house is outside the cattle graze.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660
 Oh, sorry.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:22.940
 Because I'm often told when I roll about on the common, but yes, you can put your animals

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.380
 out, which is what the most of the country used to be like before the enclosures came.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.380
 Yes.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.380
 All these hedges and fields.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.380
 That's the man.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.980
 Everyone thinks it's beautiful English scenery.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.500
 That's an industrial farming landscape.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.500
 The man enclosed that.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.500
 Oh, no, I'm asking you closure.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.500
 Forced us off it.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.500
 And you had two hedges.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.500
 Oh, God, I love hedges.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.500
 We don't mind it.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.500
 We don't mind it.

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.500
 That's true.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.900
 Yeah, so you can still go and you put your pigs out there when the acorns fall.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.460
 Yes, I think because there are various rights you have and you have to live in the right

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.460
 house.

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:53.460
 I'm so sorry that you're outside the cattle graze.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.460
 It's a traumatic episode.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.460
 This has been today.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.460
 Yeah, I know.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.460
 Tucked up.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.460
 Dan's there with his pigs in his front room going up.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.460
 No, it's so sad.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.780
 You've opened up something because my wife is desperate to be a commoner and we have,

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.780
 we've failed.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.780
 So anyway.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:08.700
 I think we need more because house prices in the New Forest have gone up quite a lot.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.580
 So quite a lot of people are buying these houses that have the right of commenting, but

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.580
 they are not interested.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.580
 Yeah, they're not real commoners.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:15.580
 They're not real commoners.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.260
 That's why you're done, right?

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.340
 I'm going to test you on the rights that you'd have as a commoner then.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:24.060
 You've got the right pasture, which as you said, is grazing your ponies, cattle, donkeys.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.980
 You've got the right of sheep, which is grazing your sheep.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.860
 Are you allowed to pick up sticks or something?

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.860
 Firewoods, yes.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.860
 Firewoods, yes.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.980
 I actually think that they sort of give you firewood because they don't massively want

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.300
 you chopping it down anymore.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.540
 But yeah, it's called estavas.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.540
 Yes, that's right.

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.540
 Estavas.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.540
 Estavas.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.540
 The right of turboree.

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.540
 Yes, what's that?

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.540
 Is that turboree?

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.540
 It's like the fish.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:48.380
 The right of catching turboree, it's the right of cutting turfs for fuel.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.380
 Yes, it's a turf.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.380
 Yes.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.220
 Not a good idea nowadays, but yeah.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.340
 No, you're not supposed to do that anymore, actually.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.660
 And actually, the right of turning your pigs out is called mast.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.980
 Is that a mast?

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.180
 Yeah, apparently turning pigs out to...

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.180
 Yeah, it's funny.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.100
 At that time of year, there's just loads of pigs all over the roads and you've got to

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.100
 have a swat.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100
 Really?

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100
 Yeah, when the acorns fall.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.940
 What I didn't get is, yeah, when the acorns fall, the pigs are supposed to eat them because

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.020
 they're poisonous to other stuff.

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:16.940
 So are the pigs rushing around as a horse goes towards an acorn and pigs bit him underneath

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:17.940
 them?

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.340
 Like, "Y'all mate, if I try and eat you, Barry," he's like, "Raps it out of my

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:22.340
 hashing."

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:29.740
 OK, that's it.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.220
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.260
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.060
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on various social media accounts.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.260
 I'm on Instagram, on @shriberland, James.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.940
 My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.940
 And Dan.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.940
 The History Guy.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.940
 On Instagram.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.940
 That's just who he is.

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.020
 Shout out to the History Guy.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.580
 No, on Twitter, on various platforms.

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.580
 Nice.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.100
 And Anna, to get us as a group.

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:02.100
 You can go to @nosuchthing on Twitter or @nosuchthingasafish on Instagram or you can email podcast@qi.com.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.860
 Yep, or you can go to our website, nosuchthingasafish.com.

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.340
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.460
 There's a link to our upcoming tour.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.020
 Get some tickets for that now.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:16.540
 And also, Join Club Fish, which is our behind-the-scenes area, where we post lots of bonus content.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.860
 Most importantly of all, check out all of Dan's stuff.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.060
 The History Hit channel, as well as Dan Snow's History Hit show.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.060
 We've been on it.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.140
 I did an episode with Dan all about mysteries of history.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.220
 You, James and Anna, you did a sporting episode recently.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.220
 Yeah, we did.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.220
 Which is better than Dan's.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.220
 So that one hurts.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.900
 That's what I heard from Dan himself.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.780
 So not true.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.780
 Not true.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.780
 He didn't say that.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.780
 He didn't say that.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.340
 But yeah, do check that out.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.300
 It's all available wherever you get your podcasts.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.780
 We will be back again next week.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:45.780
 We'll see you then.

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.780
 Goodbye.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.860
 Welcome to Quite a Good Sport, the very first episode.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.780
 So what are we talking about today?

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:59.500
 Well, today we're going to talk about the great spot of rowing and we're going to speak to

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:06.060
 Imogen Grant and Eve Stewart, who are two of our Team GB medal hopefuls for Paris.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.700
 I thought rowing was a stupid sport.

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.700
 It's cold.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.700
 It's wet.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:11.700
 You have to get up really early.

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.780
 You get blisters on your hands and you can't see where you're going.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.840
 We are going to be chucking in a few interesting facts that we've learned along the way.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:23.620
 Because Adolf Hitler was seething from the stands in the despotic way that he does.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.980
 Oh, Moustache twitching away.

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.700
 And we will be trying our hand on the River Thames to see which of you and I is going

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.100
 to be the greatest rower.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.500
 OK, we're ready to do the first time trial.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.800
 Ready, go.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.780
 This is a pretty steady start from Anna.

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.260
 Now she's really getting her rhythm.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.740
 We're actually going at a proper pace.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:50.240
 We're approaching the finish line, the red boy.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.860
 Who will be victorious?

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:56.540
 The only way to find out is to listen to episode one of Quite a Good Sport.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.580
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.640
 you
