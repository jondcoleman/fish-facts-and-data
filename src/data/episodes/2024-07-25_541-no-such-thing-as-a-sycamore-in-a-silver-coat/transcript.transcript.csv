00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were"
00:00:04,00:00:13,"joined by the history guy himself, Mr Dan Snow. If you are a person in the UK who likes"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"to watch history documentaries, you will know all about Dan. If you are a podcast fan, you"
00:00:18,00:00:24,"may well know his podcast, History Hit, which is an absolutely brilliant history podcast"
00:00:24,00:00:30,that both myself and Anna and Dan have recently appeared on. So do look for his podcast and
00:00:30,00:00:36,"listen to our episodes and indeed all of the episodes of that brilliant show. Actually,"
00:00:36,00:00:42,"while you're on the podcast app of your choice, why not find mine and Anna's new podcast."
00:00:42,00:00:47,It's called Quite a Good Sport and I'll tell you some more about that in a minute because
00:00:47,00:00:53,I should also say we're going on tour. The tour which we booked so many months ago and
00:00:53,00:01:00,"felt like it was so far in the future is just around the corner. Ah, if you live in Edinburgh,"
00:01:00,00:01:05,that will be our first date and we'll be playing there on the 14th of August 2024. You can
00:01:05,00:01:09,see a live podcast recording including all the bits that I normally cut out because we
00:01:09,00:01:13,can't possibly broadcast them. It will all be there in Edinburgh. I really hope you
00:01:13,00:01:18,can make it. We love doing these shows and we love meeting everyone afterwards. If you
00:01:18,00:01:24,"live in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London or Manchester or the environs"
00:01:24,00:01:31,"of those cities, then do go to no6thingsforfish.com/live and find out how to get tickets for the shows"
00:01:31,00:01:36,"that are near you. Anyway, just quickly back to that new podcast of mine and Anna's. What"
00:01:36,00:01:40,"I think I'll do rather than explaining what happens, I'm going to put a little teaser"
00:01:40,00:01:45,"at the end of this week's episode. So once the show's finished, if you listen on for"
00:01:45,00:01:49,"another minute or so, you'll get a really good idea of the show. It's basically me"
00:01:49,00:01:56,and Anna speaking to Olympians and then trying out the sport ourselves. So in the latest
00:01:56,00:02:00,"episode, we speak to a couple of TGB's rowers and then we get on the terms and see which"
00:02:00,00:02:05,of her and I is the best at rowing. I really think you'll enjoy it. It would mean the world
00:02:05,00:02:10,to us if you could click follow on your podcast app of choice. It would mean even more if
00:02:10,00:02:15,you could find the time to listen and it would mean more still if you actually managed to
00:02:15,00:02:20,"give us a review. Anyway, stay tuned for the little teaser of quite a good sport. Go to"
00:02:20,00:02:27,"no6thingsforfish.com/live for details of our tour and sit back, relax and enjoy our latest"
00:02:27,00:02:49,"episode with the history guy, Dan Snow. On with the podcast."
00:02:49,00:02:55,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:02:55,00:02:59,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with
00:02:59,00:03:05,"Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Dan Snow. And once again, we have gathered around the"
00:03:05,00:03:09,microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:03:09,00:03:17,"order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Dan. When Captain Scott, the infamous"
00:03:17,00:03:23,"British expedition leader, got to the South Pole, he saw in the distance little flag fluttering"
00:03:23,00:03:29,"in his heart sank and then he saw a tent and inside that tent, there was a letter and that"
00:03:29,00:03:35,"letter was addressed very neatly to King Harkon of Norway. It was a letter from an explorer,"
00:03:35,00:03:40,"Rold Amundsen, who'd arrived at the South Pole a month before Scott, breaking the records,"
00:03:40,00:03:44,"the first human being to reach South Pole and he'd left a little tent and a letter saying,"
00:03:44,00:03:50,"""Hey Scott, would you mind posting this to the King just to tell him I got here?"" I mean,"
00:03:50,00:03:53,"a shade throne. That's great. It's a great prank, except it's one of those pranks that"
00:03:53,00:03:57,"have gone wrong because he would have been back at home and they went, ""You know he died."""
00:03:57,00:04:02,"He's going, ""Oh my God, someone, don't find the letter. Don't find my cheeky prank."""
00:04:02,00:04:05,"You're so right. I read one theory, right, that the reason"
00:04:05,00:04:11,that he put the letter there is to prove that he got there because let's say he gets down
00:04:11,00:04:14,"there and he writes the letter and says, ""I got to the South Pole"" and then he gives"
00:04:14,00:04:19,it to the King while it's just his word against anyone else's. But if he puts a letter there
00:04:19,00:04:24,"and Scott picks it up and takes it back, then that's evidence because it's another person"
00:04:24,00:04:26,who's seen where this letter got to.
00:04:26,00:04:28,"You're right. Yeah, you've got to leave something."
00:04:28,00:04:31,"I don't know. I think that's his excuse when he gets to down fly, but, you know, Scott's"
00:04:31,00:04:32,dead now in news.
00:04:32,00:04:37,"No, there's already a serious context. I just love the fact. There's those pictures"
00:04:37,00:04:43,"of it. And it's just a… The Antarctic environment is a featureless, white, icy football field."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"And so they could have taken that picture anywhere. I say, ""You're right. I guess"
00:04:46,00:04:50,"you are right. You've got to leave something there."" And also, Scott literally slept there"
00:04:50,00:04:55,and then went and started off the next day. It is the most extraordinary box-ticking exercise.
00:04:55,00:04:59,You know what? I did that when I went to Bangladesh because I tried to go to as many countries
00:04:59,00:05:03,"as I can. And I stopped over in Bangladesh, slept there one night and then left, but I"
00:05:03,00:05:04,counted as going there.
00:05:04,00:05:05,The airport hotel?
00:05:05,00:05:06,Yeah.
00:05:06,00:05:07,I'm not sure that counts.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"Yeah, of course it does."
00:05:08,00:05:12,"It's kind of like touring, isn't it? I watched a Celine Dion documentary recently."
00:05:12,00:05:15,"She says exactly that. She says, ""I've been around the world. I've been everywhere"
00:05:15,00:05:18,"in the world, but I've never seen anywhere."" Because she was in and out."
00:05:18,00:05:19,"Yeah, it was very…"
00:05:19,00:05:20,She is the cat to the Scott of the Pop World.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"She is, right?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,Yeah.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"I really thought you were going to say, ""I watched a Celine Dion documentary and I"
00:05:24,00:05:27,"was able to tick off my 100 Celine Dion documentary."""
00:05:27,00:05:30,I only watched the second.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"Yeah, it still counts."
00:05:32,00:05:37,"The other thing, we in Britain talk about Scott a lot, obviously, and we ignore Amundsen,"
00:05:37,00:05:41,"by the way, who didn't just get to the South Pole first. He's an absolute legend."
00:05:41,00:05:44,He was the first man through the Northwest Passage and the first person to get to the
00:05:44,00:05:47,"North Pole as well, albeit in an airship."
00:05:47,00:05:48,Absolutely.
00:05:48,00:05:51,"Does that count? That's the thing. Because, yeah, it was the 1920s, wasn't it?"
00:05:51,00:05:52,Yeah.
00:05:52,00:05:54,He decided to fly over the North Pole. Do we count that?
00:05:54,00:05:55,I think it counts.
00:05:55,00:05:56,Okay.
00:05:56,00:05:59,"Well, I think it counts. If I'd been to Bangladesh, then I think that counts."
00:05:59,00:06:00,Oh.
00:06:00,00:06:05,"But also, didn't he… he was going to walk to the North Pole and then he got news that"
00:06:05,00:06:09,Peary had allegedly done the same. And then that was when he decided to go to the South
00:06:09,00:06:10,"Pole, is that right?"
00:06:10,00:06:12,I think so. There was a failed expression to get to the North Pole for sure. I'm not
00:06:12,00:06:14,sure why he turned around.
00:06:14,00:06:16,That's a hell of a turnaround in terms of the distance.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"Well, I believe that's the case. And I believe all of the people who were on the ship thought"
00:06:20,00:06:22,they were going to the North Pole.
00:06:22,00:06:23,Really?
00:06:23,00:06:27,"And then they started going down, down, down. And they stopped off at Funchal, which is in…"
00:06:27,00:06:28,Where is that?
00:06:28,00:06:29,"Portugal, I think?"
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Yeah, one of the islands off Portugal."
00:06:30,00:06:31,Yeah.
00:06:31,00:06:35,"And they kind of then said to the crew, they said, ""Okay, by the way, we're not going"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"to the North Pole. After all, we're going to the South Pole."""
00:06:37,00:06:42,"And it is a dick move, much like the letter. And yeah, he was a legend. I like him, but"
00:06:42,00:06:46,"he was a cheeky legend. I mean, he really did do that because he'd been told to go"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"to the North Pole, but he just wanted to be the first somewhere."
00:06:48,00:06:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:49,00:06:52,"So, as James says, thought someone else had got there and turned around his boat just"
00:06:52,00:06:57,"to beat Scott. And the thing was, and again, this could be, Lady Duff protest too much after"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"the event, but Scott insisted he was never racing."
00:07:00,00:07:02,"Oh, I know. Brilliant, isn't it? It's so good."
00:07:02,00:07:05,He was there for a scientific expedition.
00:07:05,00:07:08,"He wrote in a letter, ""Oh, God, I've heard Amundsen is trying to get there before me."
00:07:08,00:07:12,"That's fine. He probably will. You know, he's got dogs. I've got horses. He'll go"
00:07:12,00:07:13,"faster. I'm not interested in that."""
00:07:13,00:07:21,"Cut a picture of Scott trampling the weak, hurdling the dead, flogging his men ever further"
00:07:21,00:07:26,"south. I read a history once of Amundsen. It said, ""The trip to the South Pole was smooth"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"and uneventful."""
00:07:27,00:07:30,"I was like, ""Oh, wow. Don't bother reading off."""
00:07:30,00:07:37,"And when they got back, they'd put on weight. British expeditions anywhere, be it desert,"
00:07:37,00:07:43,"rainforest, arctic, high latitude. The lads arrived back, shadowed them for the cells."
00:07:43,00:07:48,"They got eaten each other, broken. These Norwegians get back. Many of their dogs are still alive."
00:07:48,00:07:51,"And they're just like, ""All right, lads, here we are. We're actually ahead of schedule"
00:07:51,00:07:52,"as well."""
00:07:52,00:07:55,"I mean, it's too cruel."
00:07:55,00:07:59,"But I think the thing of saying, ""Does it count?"" because it was done by Plaint. That's"
00:07:59,00:08:04,"a thing that Amundsen had his whole life after that trip, right? People didn't accept, particularly"
00:08:04,00:08:05,the British.
00:08:05,00:08:10,"Yeah, it was like, ""You didn't do this. You had skis. You did it the improper way."""
00:08:10,00:08:15,"When he got back, he was at a dinner at the Royal Geographical Society. This is in 1912."
00:08:15,00:08:20,"And the president, Lord Curzon, offered a toast, but not to him, but to the dog team."
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Because he was like, ""They're the ones who got there."""
00:08:22,00:08:25,"And also, he did eat a few of his dogs, didn't he?"
00:08:25,00:08:26,"Yeah, right."
00:08:26,00:08:27,"So, I think that's, you know..."
00:08:27,00:08:28,Yeah.
00:08:28,00:08:29,"If I'm going to die, that's fine. I'm eating my dogs first."
00:08:29,00:08:31,"Oh, yeah. Anna, I'd eat you."
00:08:31,00:08:36,"Like, it's like... Okay, that escalated quickly."
00:08:36,00:08:41,"Dan, why did you come back a lot heavier than when you left? And with none of your friends?"
00:08:41,00:08:43,You've only been to Exeter.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"Yeah, one-man podcast from now on, no such thing as a fish."
00:08:46,00:08:50,"The dogs, to be fair, were mobile food storage units. I mean, they were meant to be eaten"
00:08:50,00:08:54,"and then fed to each other, and then fed to the humans."
00:08:54,00:08:55,"Literally, dog eat dog."
00:08:55,00:08:56,Wow.
00:08:56,00:09:00,"I think that trip, it also, as well as being an eventful, just sounded quite fun. Like,"
00:09:00,00:09:05,"they were just reading about it. They did things like, ""Guess the temperature contests."""
00:09:05,00:09:09,"Well, this is not the track to the poll, is it? This is when they were overwintering."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"So, I think a lot of people don't focus on that bit. And when they were overwintering,"
00:09:12,00:09:15,"they're in a hut. There were lots more of them, not just the guys who then tracked to"
00:09:15,00:09:20,"the poll. And they had plenty of supplies, and it does sound super fun. You know, they"
00:09:20,00:09:26,"had hot toddies, cigars, lots of music. They played this fun ""Guess the temperature"" game."
00:09:26,00:09:28,They had lots of puzzles they played.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:33,"Scott and they overwintering fell out massively with Evans, who was his second in command."
00:09:33,00:09:36,"They decided they absolutely despised each other, and that could be the reason that they"
00:09:36,00:09:37,didn't make it to the poll.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"Oh, really?"
00:09:38,00:09:39,Oh.
00:09:39,00:09:41,Back from the poll the following year because of the kind of terrible divisions within the
00:09:41,00:09:42,world.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Really?
00:09:43,00:09:44,Right.
00:09:44,00:09:45,Do we know why?
00:09:45,00:09:48,"Well, it's that word, because I think spending a long time in a hut, I mean, you three spend"
00:09:48,00:09:51,"a lot of time together, and you all seem to be on fine. But, you know, add an Antarctic"
00:09:51,00:09:54,"winter, no daylights. You know, you might fall out with each other as well. And so, I think"
00:09:54,00:09:59,"it would break any team apart, but those two just were just incompatible."
00:09:59,00:10:00,And the diarising.
00:10:00,00:10:01,A lot of diarising.
00:10:01,00:10:03,"Because you would look at Scott going, ""What are you writing?"""
00:10:03,00:10:04,Stop it!
00:10:04,00:10:05,"""What are you writing?"""
00:10:05,00:10:10,"That's what, whenever Andy's on his laptop, you're always like that to me, aren't you?"
00:10:10,00:10:11,"""What are you writing?"""
00:10:11,00:10:12,"""What are you writing?"""
00:10:12,00:10:13,"""I'll eat you."""
00:10:13,00:10:15,Are you bitching about me? Are you bitching about me in there?
00:10:15,00:10:18,"I can't help it. Anyone who has a diary that I've ever met, I hate it."
00:10:18,00:10:19,Really?
00:10:19,00:10:20,Do you think they're writing about you?
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:21,00:10:22,I get paranoid.
00:10:22,00:10:23,You are not the main character.
00:10:23,00:10:29,"You wish they're writing about you. Had some sushi, went home, didn't do much else."
00:10:29,00:10:32,"That's what's pissing me off, but I'm not being ridden about."
00:10:32,00:10:35,"Didn't see Dan today, that was a shame. Hopefully tomorrow."
00:10:35,00:10:41,"But yeah, it's why they, it's why whenever they send people to space or on these long"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"expeditions, they often look for the most boring characters possible. Who don't want"
00:10:44,00:10:49,"to talk, who have zero, like, anger temperaments. They're just, like, Tim Peake is such a pleasant"
00:10:49,00:10:50,man. We met Tim Peake.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"Yeah, pleasant, not boring. I noticed you switched."
00:10:52,00:10:59,"I think Dan Schleiber, is that the application for the European Space Agency? I see lying"
00:10:59,00:11:04,in the bin there with a rejected stamp on it. Apparently they're saying it's super
00:11:04,00:11:05,"boring, guys."
00:11:05,00:11:06,It's interesting.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"Oh, my God."
00:11:07,00:11:14,"Well, Anton was not boring at all. Obviously, he was a character."
00:11:14,00:11:15,Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"He, in fact, I think he started his journey to the Northwest Passage at midnight because"
00:11:17,00:11:19,he had to escape gambling debts.
00:11:19,00:11:20,I think.
00:11:20,00:11:21,Really?
00:11:21,00:11:25,"He sailed the boat off because the, the people that he owed were threatening to, like, impound"
00:11:25,00:11:26,his boat.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"But it is funny this, we talked about this heroic age of exploration. I mean, so many"
00:11:29,00:11:34,"of them were absolute clowns in chat. I mean, Shackleton is astonishing in a crisis, but"
00:11:34,00:11:38,also he needs to be because he was prone to get in crises the whole time.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Right.
00:11:39,00:11:42,He bespeared absolute legend when everything goes wrong because you're going to make everything
00:11:42,00:11:43,go wrong.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"So he, I mean, he would leave with sort of creditors running on the key side, roaring"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"at him and sort of also cuckolded husbands shaking their fists. I mean, it's complete"
00:11:50,00:11:51,chaos.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Wow.
00:11:52,00:11:56,"But he, but he was good leading guys on the ice, you know, that, I guess, they're different"
00:11:56,00:11:57,skills.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"And he was the next person to try, wasn't he, after Scott Adams?"
00:12:00,00:12:04,"So brilliantly. So he went, he had a nervous breakdown and then went, you know what, she"
00:12:04,00:12:05,was never about going to South Pole.
00:12:05,00:12:10,It's actually the greatest prize is crossing the continent from one side to the other via
00:12:10,00:12:11,the South Pole.
00:12:11,00:12:15,"So he managed to flog this to a bunch of old, old heiresses, widowed heiresses who then"
00:12:15,00:12:20,"gave him money for his famous expedition to the Trans-Antarctic expedition, which did"
00:12:20,00:12:25,"not set foot on the mainland, but led to his eternal heroism because in getting them out"
00:12:25,00:12:29,"of the mess he'd got them into, he obviously, you know, won great claim and was brilliant."
00:12:29,00:12:30,But yeah.
00:12:30,00:12:33,"So that was his big scheme was, oh, you know, it's not about South Pole."
00:12:33,00:12:38,"But what I find kind of interesting is Scott and Amundsen got there, you think, right?"
00:12:38,00:12:42,"So and then Shackleton sort of said he was going to do his thing, but actually no one"
00:12:42,00:12:43,else really bothered.
00:12:43,00:12:44,"Yeah, it took a while."
00:12:44,00:12:45,They took a while.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"They were like, well, someone's done it now."
00:12:46,00:12:48,"Well, in a way, why would you?"
00:12:48,00:12:49,Yeah.
00:12:49,00:12:54,"In fact, wasn't the next person to get there, or was it the North Pole, Edmund Hillary went"
00:12:54,00:12:55,to one of them.
00:12:55,00:12:58,Hillary was the next person to walk to the South Pole.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"He was the next South Pole, wasn't he?"
00:12:59,00:13:07,"Yeah, there was a guy called George Dufek who flew there and this was in 1956 and he,"
00:13:07,00:13:09,they interviewed him on the ice.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"So they actually had a video camera there, apart from they didn't have any of the images"
00:13:13,00:13:14,because the film froze solid.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"Oh, no."
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Oh, really?"
00:13:16,00:13:19,"So they took it home, tried to develop it, actually it was frozen."
00:13:19,00:13:20,So they got no images.
00:13:20,00:13:23,"Oh, that's not going to be a great episode for you guys."
00:13:23,00:13:26,Pictures that we know were taken and then didn't make it.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Yeah.
00:13:27,00:13:28,That got ruined.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"Like the famous D-Day shots and I'm like, like the ones that we have are just a fragment"
00:13:31,00:13:33,of the ones that he took that day.
00:13:33,00:13:34,Yeah.
00:13:34,00:13:37,And the British beach shots were destroyed on the way back as well.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"That would be great, wouldn't it?"
00:13:38,00:13:39,Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:43,And the photos that are sort of currently sitting held on ice.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"So Mallory, Mallory and Irvin."
00:13:45,00:13:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:46,00:13:47,"Well, that camera."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"Yeah, that camera is still missing."
00:13:48,00:13:52,Kodak have said that they still think because of the cold conditions that they would be
00:13:52,00:13:54,able to develop the film.
00:13:54,00:13:55,Should we ever find a camera?
00:13:55,00:13:56,Yeah.
00:13:56,00:13:59,But I've had some photos sent to Kodak where I was just facing slightly towards the sun
00:13:59,00:14:01,and they couldn't develop those.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"Yeah, yeah, that's true."
00:14:03,00:14:04,Yeah.
00:14:04,00:14:10,"One, one more point about Scott is that Scott also is technically in that territory of the"
00:14:10,00:14:16,"Mallory and Amundsen and Mealy Earhart because we don't know where he is, but we roughly"
00:14:16,00:14:19,know where he might be because he was left in the tent.
00:14:19,00:14:25,They pack the tent over with snow and they say it will be something like 20 feet below
00:14:25,00:14:28,the surface now with the amount of snow that's on top of it.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"So we don't know where he is, but there's an estimate that within the next couple of"
00:14:31,00:14:36,"centuries, the bit that he's in might snap off from the side and float down to the sea."
00:14:36,00:14:40,"So one of his wishes would have been as a captain, his burial at sea."
00:14:40,00:14:44,"And so in 200 years, he might get his wish, which is a little nice."
00:14:44,00:14:45,That's nice.
00:14:45,00:14:46,And that's how different we are.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"I thought immediately as an archaeologist, finally we can get a hold of him, have a good"
00:14:49,00:14:50,old look at him.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yeah.
00:14:51,00:14:52,Yeah.
00:14:52,00:14:55,"Yeah, you're just like, ""Oh, it'd be so nice to bury it at sea,"" and I'm like, ""Let's"
00:14:55,00:14:56,"get in there."""
00:14:56,00:14:57,That lasts.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Let's get investigated.
00:14:58,00:15:01,I only have one thing on letters now.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"This original thought was about sort of letters, really throwing some shade."
00:15:04,00:15:07,And I found something I didn't know about Winston Churchill.
00:15:07,00:15:14,"This letter he wrote when he was imprisoned in the Bull War, so 1899, and he's been taken"
00:15:14,00:15:20,"as a prisoner for, he was only 25 years old, and him and two much older guys in the prison"
00:15:20,00:15:22,decided they were going to escape.
00:15:22,00:15:25,"They hatched this really elaborate plan, and they didn't really want Churchill with them"
00:15:25,00:15:29,"because he was a bit famous, he was a massive loudmouth, and he was quite overweight and"
00:15:29,00:15:30,not very fit.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"He couldn't speak Dutch or Afrikaans or Zulu, and they could."
00:15:33,00:15:34,Got it.
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Anyway, Churchill was like, ""I'm going to tag along,"" and then he just went off on"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"his own and did it on a night that they didn't want to escape, jumped over the prison walls,"
00:15:41,00:15:46,"had no plan, no maps, couldn't speak any languages, somehow stumbled into another British guy who"
00:15:46,00:15:51,"rescued him, a classic Churchill always falling into a lap of luck."
00:15:51,00:15:55,"But the letter he left behind in the prison was so good, he left a letter of apology on"
00:15:55,00:16:00,"his bed to Louis de Souza, who was the Boer Secretary for War, and it just said, ""I have"
00:16:00,00:16:04,the honour to inform you that as I do not consider that your government have any right
00:16:04,00:16:08,"to detain me as a military prisoner, I have decided to escape from your custody."""
00:16:08,00:16:09,Wow.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"""Regressing I am unable to bid you a more ceremonious or personal farewell, I have"
00:16:13,00:16:16,"the honour to be your most obedient servant, Winston Churchill."""
00:16:16,00:16:17,Wow.
00:16:17,00:16:18,That's great.
00:16:18,00:16:22,"Yes, I always include a little bit about Dan Shriver in my letters, and didn't meet"
00:16:22,00:16:30,"him today, but I'm sure I will tomorrow."
00:16:30,00:16:34,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:16:34,00:16:38,My fact this week is that Eleanor of Aquitaine gave us fireplaces.
00:16:38,00:16:39,Nice.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Did she?
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Well, this is my claim, and I'm going to stand by it."
00:16:43,00:16:48,"So, oh, I didn't realise how late it was that we really started building fireplaces, chimneys"
00:16:48,00:16:53,"into our homes, but it was certainly after the Norman invasion in Britain."
00:16:53,00:17:00,"And anyway, Eleanor of Aquitaine is around in the 12th century, and she marries Louis"
00:17:00,00:17:04,"the 7th in 1137, and that meant she had to move from the south of France, which is nice"
00:17:04,00:17:10,"and hot to Paris, the Île de la Cité, where she had a castle, and it was all cold and"
00:17:10,00:17:15,"bare, so she refurbished, and really stripped everything down, redid it, loads of colourful"
00:17:15,00:17:18,"tapestries on the wall, widened the slits, I guess I've got arrow slits."
00:17:18,00:17:19,"She's like, ""What's the point of these arrow slits?"
00:17:19,00:17:22,"I'm going to turn them into big old windows."""
00:17:22,00:17:27,"Made it nice and homey, and she was really cold, so she had the masons build in fireplaces,"
00:17:27,00:17:31,"and there doesn't seem to be, as far as I can tell, evidence of places really having"
00:17:31,00:17:34,"these built-in fireplaces, like a proper hearth, as we know today."
00:17:34,00:17:39,"So, people would always have a fire in the middle of a hut with a hole in the roof, or"
00:17:39,00:17:43,"not, or might build a chimney outside a house."
00:17:43,00:17:45,"But look, it's spurious."
00:17:45,00:17:48,"And then she married Henry II of England, and brought them over here."
00:17:48,00:17:49,Is that what we're saying?
00:17:49,00:17:54,"And then, I know that she did extensive refurbishments on all the places that she lived over here"
00:17:54,00:17:57,"as well, the palaces, so, I mean, she must have."
00:17:57,00:17:59,"OK, well, we have a historian on the show."
00:17:59,00:18:05,"Well, if only fireplaces were my speciality, however, I have been to the White Tower, the"
00:18:05,00:18:10,"great, most magnificent donjons in Europe, at the centre of the Tower of London, and there"
00:18:10,00:18:13,"are fireplaces in the Tower of London, in the White Tower."
00:18:13,00:18:17,"And that was built in the 11th century, almost 100 years before her."
00:18:17,00:18:18,"Now, they could..."
00:18:18,00:18:20,Were they domestic fireplaces?
00:18:20,00:18:21,"Oh, I see."
00:18:21,00:18:22,It's domestic fireplaces.
00:18:22,00:18:24,Why not say that in my original?
00:18:24,00:18:26,Changing the rules here.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"It's not in race, everyone."
00:18:28,00:18:29,They are.
00:18:29,00:18:30,Yes.
00:18:30,00:18:35,"This night, I think Ella Rackertrain is one of the most exciting and magical figures"
00:18:35,00:18:37,"in our history, and she deserves to be on this podcast."
00:18:37,00:18:39,I'm just not sure she deserves to be on.
00:18:39,00:18:40,She's in five places.
00:18:40,00:18:41,This is it.
00:18:41,00:18:42,This is the only reason we're talking about her.
00:18:42,00:18:48,I refuse to stray from her connection to five places.
00:18:48,00:18:52,"She was, I will allow us to stray into just her being a big interior designer, if you"
00:18:52,00:18:56,"want to broaden the element of that same chat, because she did, she revamped so much that"
00:18:56,00:19:00,"I think her mother-in-law refused to live with her, which is kind of sad, but I really"
00:19:00,00:19:03,"liked the idea of her moving in with the king, who she thought was really monkish."
00:19:03,00:19:04,This is her first marriage.
00:19:04,00:19:05,"Oh, he was a muppet."
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:11,"I think that those were the words, weren't they, because that's the translation."
00:19:11,00:19:14,"Then the mother-in-law just thought, ""This woman is taking over, making it all gaudy."""
00:19:14,00:19:20,"She moved in really good musicians, feels like she really created an interesting, intelligent"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"culture in this palace, which she then brought to Britain."
00:19:23,00:19:24,She certainly did.
00:19:24,00:19:25,I love the story about her.
00:19:25,00:19:29,She went on crusade with the said monkish husband.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"You know, they always say, my grandma used to say, ""Go traveling with your girlfriend"
00:19:32,00:19:33,"before you marry someone."""
00:19:33,00:19:37,"You really see them for who they are, when you're traveling, when you have a bit of"
00:19:37,00:19:42,"doing kind of annoying admin, you got stuck with logistics, you get a bit of tummy problems,"
00:19:42,00:19:44,and you know if this is the one.
00:19:44,00:19:47,Spending one night in an airport hotel just so you could take off a country.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Indeed.
00:19:48,00:19:49,I do.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Murdering some non-Christians.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Well, yes."
00:19:51,00:19:56,"Well, no, in the case of her, of course, he was insufficiently forward in murdering non-Christians,"
00:19:56,00:19:58,"because she thought he was wet, she thought he was a bit useless."
00:19:58,00:19:59,They go away on crusade.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"It's the ultimate sort of travel, get to know your partner, travel to adventure, and just"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"comes back and she just goes, ""I'm dumping you."
00:20:07,00:20:10,"You are a spectacular useless human being."""
00:20:10,00:20:13,And they get it all annulled in the way that aristocrats managed to do.
00:20:13,00:20:15,"It took a while, didn't it?"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"They kept asking the Pope, they kept telling them to keep shocking each other and try to"
00:20:18,00:20:20,"make an air, I think."
00:20:20,00:20:21,And that did not work.
00:20:21,00:20:25,The Pope supposedly made them a special bed to sleep in to make them more likely to have
00:20:25,00:20:26,sex with each other.
00:20:26,00:20:27,No way.
00:20:27,00:20:28,Apparently.
00:20:28,00:20:29,What's a bed that makes you more likely to have sex with someone?
00:20:29,00:20:30,"You know, they're a fireplace, presumably."
00:20:30,00:20:31,Yeah?
00:20:31,00:20:32,Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:33,It's nice.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"But it didn't work because the year she got divorced from him, she married the very hunky"
00:20:35,00:20:39,"young Duke of Normandy, Henry, who then became Henry II of England."
00:20:39,00:20:40,And so she...
00:20:40,00:20:41,"And everyone goes, ""Henry, the second is a great empire."""
00:20:41,00:20:45,"And I always think it's odd that we don't call it, perhaps it's not odd, given me."
00:20:45,00:20:46,Yeah.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"It's too short for such a name, but that actually is kind of her empire in a way."
00:20:49,00:20:52,She's the one who brings all these massive French possessions.
00:20:52,00:20:56,So basically she and Henry end up owning more of France than the King of France.
00:20:56,00:21:02,And then her absolutely useless sons just spunk the whole lot of it.
00:21:02,00:21:03,But only after she dies.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"Basically, if you look at the history of that empire, it essentially lasts for the course"
00:21:06,00:21:07,of her life.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Right.
00:21:08,00:21:09,And then her...
00:21:09,00:21:12,"The most useless son in English history, which is up against their composition, John."
00:21:12,00:21:13,You don't like John?
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Oh, okay."
00:21:14,00:21:15,I don't...
00:21:15,00:21:16,You don't like John?
00:21:16,00:21:17,Sorry.
00:21:17,00:21:18,I'm fond...
00:21:18,00:21:19,I'm fond of John.
00:21:19,00:21:20,What are we talking about?
00:21:20,00:21:21,"He gets a bad rep, doesn't he, Anna?"
00:21:21,00:21:22,He's got...
00:21:22,00:21:23,My God.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"Elevator was an extraordinary mother, wasn't she?"
00:21:24,00:21:25,Elevator on the broadcast.
00:21:25,00:21:27,I've always wanted to meet one.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"Here we are, friends."
00:21:28,00:21:29,So...
00:21:29,00:21:30,What's like John of England?
00:21:30,00:21:32,Is of England necessary?
00:21:32,00:21:33,He's not from anywhere else.
00:21:33,00:21:35,He doesn't have any other nickname.
00:21:35,00:21:36,It's not John that...
00:21:36,00:21:37,"Oh, he does have other names."
00:21:37,00:21:38,"Oh, yes."
00:21:38,00:21:39,And you know what they are because you're grimacing.
00:21:39,00:21:43,The other nicknames are Lackland and Softsword.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Yeah.
00:21:44,00:21:50,Which basically all that means is poor guy didn't inherit any land and Softsword didn't
00:21:50,00:21:52,really want to be too fighty.
00:21:52,00:21:53,Does it not mean impotent?
00:21:53,00:21:54,Oh.
00:21:54,00:21:58,Like all of this sort of seemed to say Softsword genuinely is about his military power.
00:21:58,00:21:59,Really?
00:21:59,00:22:00,He lost the empire.
00:22:00,00:22:04,He only inherited the throne by possibly starving his nephew to death.
00:22:04,00:22:11,"He controlled an empire that stretched through much of what is now France, Ireland and England."
00:22:11,00:22:14,"And by the time he died, his empire was the East Midlands."
00:22:14,00:22:16,That's a nice part of England.
00:22:16,00:22:17,That's part of the world.
00:22:17,00:22:18,Don't get me wrong.
00:22:18,00:22:19,That's part of the world.
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Lucky, I would be very happy to have an empire there."
00:22:20,00:22:25,"Just before he died, when he contracted dysentery, he lost the crown jewels while crossing the"
00:22:25,00:22:27,wash two set aforementioned East Midlands.
00:22:27,00:22:32,"So he lost the crown jewels, arrived in the East Midlands and died."
00:22:32,00:22:33,Yeah.
00:22:33,00:22:38,"And then his, luckily for that benighted family, his dysentery saved the dynasty because his"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"son, they stuck his son on the throne because he was so young and they worked out they"
00:22:41,00:22:42,could just manipulate him.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"That's a nice multiple, isn't it?"
00:22:43,00:22:44,Dysentery saved the dynasty.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Yeah.
00:22:45,00:22:48,The reason I like King John is because we don't mind about owning empires.
00:22:48,00:22:53,What we mind is about being good to your mum and I think a lot of us don't know they got
00:22:53,00:22:54,on well.
00:22:54,00:22:55,They did.
00:22:55,00:22:58,And also well done him because her favourite was famously Richard the Lionheart who everyone
00:22:58,00:23:04,loves and Richard the Lionheart dies and she becomes very fond of John.
00:23:04,00:23:09,And actually I think the only time that he really showed true courage and desire to defeat
00:23:09,00:23:13,"the opposition is when she was abducted by her grandson, I believe when she was about"
00:23:13,00:23:14,80.
00:23:14,00:23:18,"And that was when John was like, no way, you're not abducting my mum."
00:23:18,00:23:22,And he probably went and defeated him and rescued her because was Richard the Lionheart that
00:23:22,00:23:23,good?
00:23:23,00:23:24,Yeah.
00:23:24,00:23:27,I think he was less good than his statue outside the House of Lords deserves.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"I mean, he didn't show any interest in England."
00:23:29,00:23:35,He just was off on Crusades and then he got captured to his cave where they kept him.
00:23:35,00:23:36,Yeah.
00:23:36,00:23:40,"It's in, it's, it's a 20 minute drive from where my family grew up in Austria."
00:23:40,00:23:41,Am I right in saying that?
00:23:41,00:23:42,Or did they?
00:23:42,00:23:43,That sounds right.
00:23:43,00:23:44,Yeah.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Yeah.
00:23:45,00:23:46,It was down there.
00:23:46,00:23:53,"And they asked for 150,000 silver marks, which was at the time, three times the annual income"
00:23:53,00:23:54,of England.
00:23:54,00:23:57,And today that would probably be in the trillion.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"It's about 1.5 trillion something like that, maybe around 2 trillion pounds that they asked."
00:24:01,00:24:03,So how do you get that money?
00:24:03,00:24:07,"She basically just had to tax the hell out of the entire country, Eleanor of Aquitaine."
00:24:07,00:24:08,Right.
00:24:08,00:24:11,"So he's a good mother, bad leader maybe."
00:24:11,00:24:12,Good mother.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:14,There's a great quote about King John.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"He was a very bad man, more cruel than all the others."
00:24:17,00:24:20,"He lost after beautiful women and because of this, he shamed the high men of the land"
00:24:20,00:24:22,for which reason he was greatly hated.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"Whenever he could, he told lies rather than the truth."
00:24:24,00:24:25,Yeah.
00:24:25,00:24:26,But who wrote this?
00:24:26,00:24:27,"This wasn't his mate who wrote this, was it?"
00:24:27,00:24:29,"It was, it was possibly not his."
00:24:29,00:24:30,And snow.
00:24:30,00:24:31,It is.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"I will, I will agree."
00:24:32,00:24:33,I will admit it.
00:24:33,00:24:34,It's an anonymous chronicle.
00:24:34,00:24:35,Anonymous of betune.
00:24:35,00:24:39,I didn't realise how fun bitching about historical figures is.
00:24:39,00:24:40,I'm having so much fun.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"Well, welcome to my world."
00:24:42,00:24:45,"A costume about dead people, so we do for you."
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Well, what do you think then of her second husband?"
00:24:48,00:24:49,"Because that, he was more fiery, wasn't he?"
00:24:49,00:24:51,It was like she went from the monk to the player.
00:24:51,00:24:52,Spunk.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Spunk.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Spunk, that's better."
00:24:54,00:24:58,"Henry II, sort of, almost the great king of English history."
00:24:58,00:25:03,"He had a young, his uncle Henry unimaginatively and he rebelled against him, Richard rebelled"
00:25:03,00:25:04,against him.
00:25:04,00:25:06,So he was very bad at managing his sons.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"Well, but they rebelled because Eleanor was very good at managing her sons, right?"
00:25:09,00:25:12,So Eleanor sort of persuaded all her sons to rebel against him.
00:25:12,00:25:18,"I'm basically in a grump, a sort of 700 year or 800 year-long grump because if he'd managed"
00:25:18,00:25:23,"to cement that empire, can you imagine what a great country this has been stretching from"
00:25:23,00:25:26,the Pyrenees to Carlisle?
00:25:26,00:25:28,Do you think Mbappe could have played for England?
00:25:28,00:25:29,Exactly.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Oh my God.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Right.
00:25:31,00:25:35,"It'd just been glorious and, you know, that's why I often, you know, it's like Henry V didn't"
00:25:35,00:25:38,"wash his goddamn hands, got this entry and died, you know?"
00:25:38,00:25:41,"I mean, it's like, sort it out, Harry, England, twat."
00:25:41,00:25:42,Wow.
00:25:42,00:25:46,"Born in the water before, we're drinking it, you muppet guy."
00:25:46,00:25:48,"But Harry, for England, that's what."
00:25:48,00:25:53,"But also that reminds, yeah, that reminds, and then that reminds me of the last chance,"
00:25:53,00:25:57,"the last best chance we had of this glorious Anglo-French nation, which is the most extraordinary"
00:25:57,00:26:02,"thing when Winston Churchill offered a full union of Britain, UK and France."
00:26:02,00:26:07,"In 1940, when the Germans were overrunning France, desperate to keep their more, particularly"
00:26:07,00:26:10,"their navy and their colonies in the war, Churchill goes, which is always brilliant when the brakes"
00:26:10,00:26:16,"it had bangers on too much out, he goes, Britain and France, full union, bang, one insoluble"
00:26:16,00:26:17,"country, let's do it."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Let's do it.
00:26:18,00:26:19,And the French said no.
00:26:19,00:26:21,Was there any possibility that was going to happen?
00:26:21,00:26:23,It doesn't feel like it was a likely historical.
00:26:23,00:26:27,"It wasn't likely, but I mean, you know, lots of things are likely."
00:26:27,00:26:28,Yeah.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"Getting shot, getting shot in the ear isn't very likely."
00:26:30,00:26:36,"I mean, like the two most consequential presidents of the 20th century, FDR and Reagan, FDR survived"
00:26:36,00:26:38,at about a six foot range.
00:26:38,00:26:42,"He's fired five shots being fired at him, which killed the guy next to him and other"
00:26:42,00:26:43,people around him.
00:26:43,00:26:48,"Before he'd even put at the height of the depression, before he'd been inaugurated to"
00:26:48,00:26:53,"his present elect, Reagan was killed about two months into his first term, no Reagan,"
00:26:53,00:26:54,no Roosevelt.
00:26:54,00:26:55,He was killed.
00:26:55,00:26:56,Sorry.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Almost killed.
00:26:57,00:26:58,Almost killed.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"He was like, ""Bite a fragment of a, you know, the bullet had been a few millimeters, you"
00:27:01,00:27:02,"know, Reagan would have been killed."""
00:27:02,00:27:07,"The two most consequential presidents of the 20th century had absolutely no right to survive,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,under pure luck.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"That's this mad journey we're on, folks."
00:27:10,00:27:11,Yeah.
00:27:11,00:27:12,It's crazy.
00:27:12,00:27:17,"Something about Eleanor of Aquitaine that is not often said, so Queen of France, Queen"
00:27:17,00:27:18,of England.
00:27:18,00:27:19,Yeah.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Not many people have done the double.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Not many people.
00:27:21,00:27:22,I think the only one.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"Mary Queen of Scots claimed it, controversially, you know, sort of could have claimed it."
00:27:26,00:27:27,Yeah.
00:27:27,00:27:28,All right.
00:27:28,00:27:29,How would followers might have claimed it?
00:27:29,00:27:30,What do we know about her grandmother?
00:27:30,00:27:31,Dangerous.
00:27:31,00:27:32,Dangerous.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Dangerous.
00:27:33,00:27:34,Yeah.
00:27:34,00:27:37,Her grandmother's called Dangerous.
00:27:37,00:27:38,"That's all we know, right?"
00:27:38,00:27:39,Is there much?
00:27:39,00:27:40,No one knows her real name.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"That was a nickname, I think."
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:43,But no one knows what her real name was.
00:27:43,00:27:44,We think it's Amadege.
00:27:44,00:27:45,Right.
00:27:45,00:27:48,"But yeah, she was known by everyone as dangerous."
00:27:48,00:27:49,That's so cool.
00:27:49,00:27:51,Because she was such a...
00:27:51,00:27:52,Player.
00:27:52,00:27:53,...Ductrix.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Yeah.
00:27:54,00:27:58,"And you know, I didn't know that Eleanor just means other anal."
00:27:58,00:27:59,So anal is a name.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Sorry.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"No, you said other anal."
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yes, no."
00:28:03,00:28:05,I didn't know that would be Eleanor.
00:28:05,00:28:06,Right.
00:28:06,00:28:09,So I think her mum was called anal.
00:28:09,00:28:10,But...
00:28:10,00:28:11,It's this word you keep saying.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Right.
00:28:12,00:28:13,So think of how Eleanor's spelled.
00:28:13,00:28:14,Yeah.
00:28:14,00:28:15,"Well, it's alienor."
00:28:15,00:28:16,Yeah.
00:28:16,00:28:17,It's how it's spelled.
00:28:17,00:28:20,You knock off the E-L and swap round the A-E. So A-E-N-O-R was a name.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Okay.
00:28:21,00:28:23,And you're called Eleanor if you're the other anal.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"So her mum was called anal, or anal."
00:28:25,00:28:27,But now we only have Eleanor.
00:28:27,00:28:28,We only have other anals.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Why is the name anal?
00:28:29,00:28:30,"Well, I think we've..."
00:28:30,00:28:32,We've got to prove that in this podcast.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Why are we...
00:28:33,00:28:34,Why are we not...
00:28:34,00:28:35,Other people called anal.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"Yeah, she answered this."
00:28:36,00:28:37,I guess.
00:28:37,00:28:38,I didn't know as long on debate as I was expecting.
00:28:38,00:28:39,I mean...
00:28:39,00:28:40,A-N-O-R...
00:28:40,00:28:41,I always thought that when you write it down...
00:28:41,00:28:44,"It's not when you speak it, is it?"
00:28:44,00:28:46,It becomes clear.
00:28:46,00:28:47,I think it's weird not to wear the courts of love.
00:28:47,00:28:48,"Oh, okay."
00:28:48,00:28:49,Okay.
00:28:49,00:28:52,Can we just ask Dan if he believes the courts of love existed?
00:28:52,00:28:53,Okay.
00:28:53,00:28:54,Okay.
00:28:54,00:29:00,So the courts of love was the idea that Eleanor had this special court for women who had
00:29:00,00:29:03,"fallen out with their husbands and they would give them a base and stuff, right?"
00:29:03,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:05,It sounds great.
00:29:05,00:29:06,It's like a problem page.
00:29:06,00:29:07,You meant the other dad.
00:29:07,00:29:13,"I was like, ""Why do you think I know anything about that?"""
00:29:13,00:29:15,You love resolving people's romantic issues.
00:29:15,00:29:16,It's so confused.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Yeah.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Sorry.
00:29:18,00:29:19,Other dad.
00:29:19,00:29:20,I just think it's cool that this is an idea.
00:29:20,00:29:23,I think it was written down by Eleanor's daughter and no one knows if it's made up
00:29:23,00:29:25,fantasy or if it really happened.
00:29:25,00:29:26,And what was it?
00:29:26,00:29:29,"That a bunch of noble women including Eleanor, her daughter and some other noble women would"
00:29:29,00:29:35,"have nights turn up with their romantic problems like, ""Hey, I fancy this woman, but there's"
00:29:35,00:29:36,this other woman who fancies me.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"Who should I get with?"""
00:29:37,00:29:38,And they would arbitrate.
00:29:38,00:29:39,It's not cool.
00:29:39,00:29:41,Have you tried Eleanor?
00:29:41,00:29:42,God.
00:29:42,00:29:53,"As someone with a very, very formidable mother-in-law, I can imagine that's the kind of stuff that"
00:29:53,00:29:54,they'd get up to.
00:29:54,00:29:56,Is that how you were selected a court of love?
00:29:56,00:29:57,No.
00:29:57,00:30:01,"I would have never have made it through that process, obviously."
00:30:01,00:30:06,"But no, I think if you're a very impressive, powerful old woman in the Middle Ages, I can"
00:30:06,00:30:12,imagine that you would knock heads together and sort out your love lives in your retinue.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Sort out the men.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Filthy men in the palace.
00:30:15,00:30:16,"But I think the jury's out in general, right?"
00:30:16,00:30:17,Yeah.
00:30:17,00:30:18,I'm not sure.
00:30:18,00:30:19,The jury of the courts of love.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Well, that is also medieval history."
00:30:20,00:30:21,Full stop.
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:23,It's all just jury's out.
00:30:23,00:30:24,Really?
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Oh, annoying."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"The only thing that I can say, certainly, is that Eleanor of Aquatown did not invent"
00:30:28,00:30:29,the fireplace.
00:30:29,00:30:30,"Oh, I cannot believe."
00:30:30,00:30:34,"I know that's going to be the ending to this section, and I'm furious."
00:30:34,00:30:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:30:44,00:30:45,Okay.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"My fact this week is that when the Romans defeated barbarian tribes, they would often"
00:30:48,00:30:50,send them to Britain as punishment.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"Well, in their faces, because Britain is great."
00:30:53,00:30:54,Yeah.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"Great Britain, exactly."
00:30:55,00:30:56,Right.
00:30:56,00:30:57,I'm looking at that in case you could say it's wrong.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"Yeah, you look at me."
00:30:58,00:30:59,"This is nervous, look."
00:30:59,00:31:00,"I mean, it's definitely true."
00:31:00,00:31:01,"We know, for example, there were Syrians."
00:31:01,00:31:04,"They were, ""Cool, there's a thing on Hadrian's wall about the Euphrates boatmen that were"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"brought up to work on the tine."""
00:31:06,00:31:07,Can you imagine?
00:31:07,00:31:08,"Oh, my God."
00:31:08,00:31:11,And it's also true that the Romans did regard Britain as the end of the godhammer.
00:31:11,00:31:15,"Although there were periods when the emperor was in Britain, and it was like the heart"
00:31:15,00:31:16,of the empire.
00:31:16,00:31:19,"But for long periods, you're probably like, ""You're going to get sent to the furthest"
00:31:19,00:31:20,"frontier."""
00:31:20,00:31:21,I can imagine that.
00:31:21,00:31:22,That is true.
00:31:22,00:31:26,"There's a great line that a poet wrote to Hadrian, he says, ""I don't want to be Caesar,"
00:31:26,00:31:32,"i.e. the emperor, stroll about among the Britons and endure the Scythian winters."""
00:31:32,00:31:37,So he's comparing being among the Britons as winter on the Ukrainian steppe.
00:31:37,00:31:41,"Like that, those are the two worst things you can imagine as a Roman."
00:31:41,00:31:42,"Well, what was it like when they got here?"
00:31:42,00:31:43,Would it have been nice?
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Well, I mean, it's much as it is now."
00:31:45,00:31:47,"I mean, it's the weather is average."
00:31:47,00:31:48,"You know, what can I say?"
00:31:48,00:31:52,"I think the truth is that only Romans wrote this history, right, the barbarians."
00:31:52,00:31:56,"And so we have no idea really what stuff was like, but you're just saying the Romans hated"
00:31:56,00:31:57,it.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Caesar was really mean about it himself and said, ""The Brits are the most ignorant people"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"I've ever conquered."""
00:32:01,00:32:04,"And Cicero said, ""They're the ugliest, most stupid race I ever saw."""
00:32:04,00:32:08,"And there also seems to be, I was going through the sources of what Romans said about Brits."
00:32:08,00:32:12,"It seems like we were always naked, and that doesn't make sense to me, because it's fricking"
00:32:12,00:32:13,cold here.
00:32:13,00:32:18,"Well, one Roman source says the reason we were naked is because it was so wet."
00:32:18,00:32:21,"So this one Roman source said, ""Most of Britain is marshland, because it's flooded by the"
00:32:21,00:32:23,continual ocean tithes.
00:32:23,00:32:26,"Barbarians usually swim in these swamps or run around with them, submerge the waste."""
00:32:26,00:32:29,"Of course, they're practically naked and don't mind the mud, because they're unfamiliar"
00:32:29,00:32:31,with the use of clothing.
00:32:31,00:32:35,"And actually the sense is that wearing loads of trousers and things, you just end up just"
00:32:35,00:32:38,"getting wet and muddy all the time, so let it all hang out."
00:32:38,00:32:43,"I've also been out on a night out in Newcastle in February, and they still don't wear clothes"
00:32:43,00:32:44,up there.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Yeah, no true."
00:32:45,00:32:46,I guess they were made of hardier stuff.
00:32:46,00:32:49,"I did swim in the river at the weekend, and I thought I wouldn't be able to wade around"
00:32:49,00:32:53,"in this all day, every day, come rain or shine naked, but well done, those early Brits."
00:32:53,00:32:55,That's just as tough as Amundsen.
00:32:55,00:33:02,"So there was a thing called Deportatio in Inselam, which apparently means exile to an island."
00:33:02,00:33:07,"Sometimes you go to Britain, if you've been particularly bad, Tiberias exile to Rhodes,"
00:33:07,00:33:10,"which must have been quite nice in comparison, I'd say."
00:33:10,00:33:18,"But then Nacatius Dio wrote about 5,000 Sarmatian cavalry who were sent to Britain after the"
00:33:18,00:33:19,Romans had taken them over.
00:33:19,00:33:26,"Britain was just a nightmare for the Romans, so unending ulcer and pain and suffering."
00:33:26,00:33:28,"They did not conquer the whole archipelago, right?"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"So you've got Ireland and you've got Amundsen, Scotland, for much of the period was unconquered."
00:33:31,00:33:35,"And as a result, you cannot expend the resources required to fully conquer the archipelago,"
00:33:35,00:33:41,given its geographical and weather and nightmarish difficulty of doing so.
00:33:41,00:33:45,"But then it's too embarrassing to leave the bit that you have conquered, but then that's"
00:33:45,00:33:51,"almost untenable because your entire coastline from Cornwall to Carlisle across to Newcastle,"
00:33:51,00:33:57,it's just vulnerable to these unending incessant raids by these lunatics.
00:33:57,00:34:00,And then the north coast exposed to the unconquered Baltics and stuff.
00:34:00,00:34:01,So it's a nightmare.
00:34:01,00:34:02,It's a nightmare.
00:34:02,00:34:04,"When did they, was it like 300s?"
00:34:04,00:34:06,When did they finally bugger off?
00:34:06,00:34:10,"They sort of pack up shop at about 405, 410."
00:34:10,00:34:13,The biggest concentration of coin hordes in our history is from that period.
00:34:13,00:34:14,It's quite interesting.
00:34:14,00:34:19,"So you, you bury your money when you're very, very pessimistic about the immediate future,"
00:34:19,00:34:20,right?
00:34:20,00:34:21,Yeah.
00:34:21,00:34:22,"Like, let's get them."
00:34:22,00:34:24,And so we've just got this massive spike of coin hordes.
00:34:24,00:34:25,It's kind of scary.
00:34:25,00:34:26,Oh really?
00:34:26,00:34:27,It's all the Romans burying their money as they do.
00:34:27,00:34:30,"All of these Romans, the villas, just everyone burying it, of course, it also means those"
00:34:30,00:34:31,people didn't come back for it.
00:34:31,00:34:35,"Now, maybe they escaped, but it often, occasionally, would have meant they would have killed and"
00:34:35,00:34:36,stuff.
00:34:36,00:34:38,"So, so those coin hordes have been buried and no one's come back from."
00:34:38,00:34:42,So there's just a sense of just society just kind of collapsing in the early 5th century.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"The kind of Romano-British that were left, the sort of Roman elite that were still there."
00:34:45,00:34:47,"We get letters written from the Romans going, ""Please, the Romans come and help."""
00:34:47,00:34:51,And it's like the barbarians push us into the sea and the sea pushed us back onto lands
00:34:51,00:34:53,we have to choose whether to drown or be murdered.
00:34:53,00:34:54,Oh God.
00:34:54,00:34:57,"You know, it's like, it is just, it's full, full Armageddon."
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,It's crazy.
00:34:59,00:35:02,So that's the thing that we still seem to have from the barbarians.
00:35:02,00:35:08,"Any time someone says, ""Bla, bla, bla,"" supposedly that has come from the word ""barbarian"" itself."
00:35:08,00:35:12,"So the word ""barbarian"" supposedly comes from ancient Greek."
00:35:12,00:35:13,And it was taken.
00:35:13,00:35:14,That definitely comes from ancient Greek.
00:35:14,00:35:15,Yeah.
00:35:15,00:35:16,Sorry.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Sorry.
00:35:17,00:35:18,"It supposedly comes from the fact that when foreigners were speaking and you didn't understand,"
00:35:18,00:35:20,"you would say, ""Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba."""
00:35:20,00:35:21,That's what it sounds like to us.
00:35:21,00:35:26,"And that has evolved to, ""Bla, bla, bla,"" so anytime we say, ""Bla, bla, bla,"" we're"
00:35:26,00:35:27,barbarians.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Yeah.
00:35:28,00:35:32,"It's literally anyone who's not Roman and sort of Greek, isn't it?"
00:35:32,00:35:33,Yeah.
00:35:33,00:35:34,"And it covers, covers a lot."
00:35:34,00:35:36,"The biggest barbarians of them all, the Goths, probably."
00:35:36,00:35:37,The Goths.
00:35:37,00:35:38,Okay.
00:35:38,00:35:39,Yes.
00:35:39,00:35:40,Yeah.
00:35:40,00:35:41,"Because they were like, sort of stimulated."
00:35:41,00:35:42,Umi and all.
00:35:42,00:35:43,The ball of Rome.
00:35:43,00:35:44,War of Black.
00:35:44,00:35:45,Oh yeah.
00:35:45,00:35:46,"Oh sorry, Anne, war lots of Black."
00:35:46,00:35:47,And we'll really miss it all the time.
00:35:47,00:35:48,Most of my chemical romance.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Yeah.
00:35:49,00:35:50,So yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:51,Retopping Whitby.
00:35:51,00:35:52,Yeah.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"The Goths crossed the Danube, didn't they, in like the three seventies."
00:35:55,00:35:58,"And it seemed to work incredibly well, the Roman policy towards barbarians for hundreds"
00:35:58,00:35:59,of years.
00:35:59,00:36:02,"So people would knock at the door and say, ""Hey, we want to be part of Rome, please."""
00:36:02,00:36:05,"They might be fleeing, you know, other forces or whatever, which want to be part of Rome."
00:36:05,00:36:07,We want to be part of Rome.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"And so they'd be split up, tribes would be split up."
00:36:09,00:36:13,"They'd have to abandon all loyalty to tribal chieftains, give some of their military to"
00:36:13,00:36:14,the Romans.
00:36:14,00:36:18,"And then they were sort of allowed to stay in mind their own business, I think, basically."
00:36:18,00:36:20,They messed it up a bit when the Goths came over.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"I think they let too many over, then they stopped letting other people."
00:36:24,00:36:25,And then basically...
00:36:25,00:36:26,"All right, Nigel."
00:36:26,00:36:32,"They didn't know enough food to feed them all, so then they got upset."
00:36:32,00:36:34,And then they threw this dinner party.
00:36:34,00:36:37,And I think Rome fell because of a cocked up dinner party.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Really?
00:36:38,00:36:43,"Because it was this Roman general, Lupi Kinnis, who realized the Goths were coming over, invited"
00:36:43,00:36:44,a couple of their leaders.
00:36:44,00:36:46,He was getting really drunk with them.
00:36:46,00:36:49,He told his men to go and kind of besiege the Goths.
00:36:49,00:36:53,And word got back to the dinner party and it all kind of kicked off.
00:36:53,00:36:54,And was a bit pissed by then.
00:36:54,00:36:58,So Lupi Kinnis was probably a bit loose with his instructions and started killing some
00:36:58,00:36:59,of the people who'd come with them.
00:36:59,00:37:01,And that was kind of the beginning.
00:37:01,00:37:03,And then the Goths got together fought against him.
00:37:03,00:37:05,And that was when the Roman Empire started.
00:37:05,00:37:06,It's very...
00:37:06,00:37:07,When was that?
00:37:07,00:37:08,376.
00:37:08,00:37:13,"It's a catastrophic battle at Adrianople, one of the worst defeats in Roman history where"
00:37:13,00:37:15,the Eastern Emperor takes on the Goths.
00:37:15,00:37:18,"The Western Emperor's coming to help him, but he wants the glory for himself, doesn't he?"
00:37:18,00:37:23,"So he attacked too early, just got totally annihilated."
00:37:23,00:37:25,And then the Goths just went on this rampage all the way through the Western Empire.
00:37:25,00:37:26,Right.
00:37:26,00:37:32,I think the only time the Romans really got defeated by barbarians until this period was
00:37:32,00:37:36,"the battle of Teutoburg, which we mentioned, which was all in this forest."
00:37:36,00:37:38,And they basically want to take on the Germans.
00:37:38,00:37:42,"So the Germans attacked the Romans, didn't they, in the forest and turned out the Romans"
00:37:42,00:37:45,couldn't hack it basically and were absolutely vanquished.
00:37:45,00:37:51,"So I think they killed 10% of their military and they never tried to go into Germany again,"
00:37:51,00:37:52,really.
00:37:52,00:37:58,And that is basically why we have that division today between Latin languages and German languages.
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Oh, really."
00:37:59,00:38:00,"Yeah, it's one of my significant defeats here."
00:38:00,00:38:01,Yeah.
00:38:01,00:38:04,"Augustus ran around the palace in Rome, shouting, ""Varus, give me back my legions!"""
00:38:04,00:38:07,"I was like, it was one of the worst defeats."
00:38:07,00:38:10,"But then they did sort of nibble into bits, Joey, but effectively, yeah, that policy of"
00:38:10,00:38:15,just permanent expansion was sort of brought to a halt at that point.
00:38:15,00:38:16,Just like that.
00:38:16,00:38:20,"Today, that's why we basically have two big language groups in that moment."
00:38:20,00:38:23,"If you ever want to depress yourself, read about that, it was a torrential rain in a"
00:38:23,00:38:29,"dark German wood and the Romans marching along and their guide, their German guide, a guy"
00:38:29,00:38:30,"called Arminius, and he sort of disappeared."
00:38:30,00:38:33,And it turns out he's actually was guiding them in this terrible trap.
00:38:33,00:38:36,"He had been a collaborator, but in fact, he didn't have to be the leader of the resistance."
00:38:36,00:38:40,"And then just ambushed repeatedly, the general commits suicide."
00:38:40,00:38:44,"I mean, it's just this total annihilation of a once mighty force."
00:38:44,00:38:48,I can't bring myself to get depressed about something that happened 2000 years ago.
00:38:48,00:38:54,"There's just enough today, or in the last hundred years, ""I let myself get over that,"
00:38:54,00:38:57,"and I think you need to work on it."""
00:38:57,00:39:00,What's the big one that wakes you up at night?
00:39:00,00:39:01,This is very personal.
00:39:01,00:39:02,"I mean, I have an overactive imagination."
00:39:02,00:39:06,"At night, I do kind of read about the first emperor of China, Chinchuan, the most powerful"
00:39:06,00:39:09,"man in the world, builds China extraordinary dynasty that's going to last a thousand years."
00:39:09,00:39:14,"Within three years, his children and grandchildren are enslaved and murdered in the streets."
00:39:14,00:39:15,Being hand dynasty.
00:39:15,00:39:19,"And you think, ""If that can happen to him, it can happen to anybody."
00:39:19,00:39:21,"I'm just, it's just terrifying."""
00:39:21,00:39:25,Are you ready for history here to be toppled and your kids attacked either successive?
00:39:25,00:39:26,Indeed.
00:39:26,00:39:32,"But I just, the horror of somebody, you know, the peak of their powers, like Cresus in Lidia,"
00:39:32,00:39:35,"you know, the rich man in the world, little did he know the fate that was waiting for"
00:39:35,00:39:36,him.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"""Oh, wait, we can wait for all of us too."""
00:39:37,00:39:41,"And so you feel you might be now at the peak of your powers, you're at the most dangerous"
00:39:41,00:39:42,level.
00:39:42,00:39:43,That's even sadder.
00:39:43,00:39:45,I'll see if this is as good as it gets for me.
00:39:45,00:39:49,It's a sad indictment of my life.
00:39:49,00:39:52,"Yes, relatively speaking, I'm probably at the peak of my powers."
00:39:52,00:39:56,"And then one day I might, you know, I might be standing there with a kitchen knife defending"
00:39:56,00:39:57,my house.
00:39:57,00:39:58,Yeah.
00:39:58,00:40:00,So they'll be talking about the fall of Dan Snow's empire a thousand years.
00:40:00,00:40:05,They'll be talking about sort of the coinhold of the south coast as the Danes pulled up
00:40:05,00:40:06,on the beach.
00:40:06,00:40:13,"And then Harland comes over the hedge, I'm there, having to defend my family."
00:40:13,00:40:15,"Anyway, that's the kind of thing I worry about."
00:40:15,00:40:16,I'm glad you asked.
00:40:16,00:40:21,"It's kind of, I wasn't hoping, I was hoping to share that."
00:40:21,00:40:28,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:40:28,00:40:29,And that is my fact.
00:40:29,00:40:35,My fact this week is that America has a witness protection program for their trees.
00:40:35,00:40:36,"Oh, okay."
00:40:36,00:40:38,"So this is a really cool idea, I think."
00:40:38,00:40:41,"There's a lot of historical spots in America where battles, civil wars would have been"
00:40:41,00:40:43,fought and so on.
00:40:43,00:40:48,"And often when the landscape is done of all the debris of whatever happened there, the"
00:40:48,00:40:51,trees will remain and they're technically witnesses to history.
00:40:51,00:40:56,"In many cases, these trees might have taken bullets in from the wars and the bark would"
00:40:56,00:40:58,have grown over and embedded in these things.
00:40:58,00:41:02,So they're actually literally holding history inside of them that we don't yet know about.
00:41:02,00:41:06,And so this was an idea that was set up by the Chief of the National Park Services and
00:41:06,00:41:11,"they decided, let's start designating trees, a witness protection, whereby you can't"
00:41:11,00:41:15,"chop them down, you can't harm them, but they're archived in the Congress library and so on."
00:41:15,00:41:16,And yeah.
00:41:16,00:41:17,That's just a classic American.
00:41:17,00:41:22,"For something that we have here called a tree protection order, they just have a much cooler"
00:41:22,00:41:23,name for it.
00:41:23,00:41:24,Yeah.
00:41:24,00:41:28,"When you said that, I did think they sort of hide them, they move them, they get the"
00:41:28,00:41:33,"Gettysburg trees and they move them up to Saratoga, they give them a new name."
00:41:33,00:41:38,"Why is there a bunch of birch trees here, a one sycamore tree in the middle disguised,"
00:41:38,00:41:40,a little swearing of silver coat.
00:41:40,00:41:41,Yeah.
00:41:41,00:41:44,"This is brother, shut up."
00:41:44,00:41:46,Are people trying to harm these trees because that's what you expect?
00:41:46,00:41:50,"I think I just think they just want to be nice to trees, don't they?"
00:41:50,00:41:51,Yeah.
00:41:51,00:41:55,"Well, I guess we do accidentally hurt trees, I guess, you know, we do accidentally chop"
00:41:55,00:41:56,them down.
00:41:56,00:42:00,"Yeah, I've always accidentally, I don't think anyone's ever accidentally chopped down a"
00:42:00,00:42:01,tree.
00:42:01,00:42:02,Yeah.
00:42:02,00:42:03,But there's a sign up.
00:42:03,00:42:05,So like the loggers will go around a forest presumably and then there'll be a big sign
00:42:05,00:42:06,that's like this tree.
00:42:06,00:42:09,"Oh, which we have in this great country as well."
00:42:09,00:42:10,Yeah.
00:42:10,00:42:11,But we don't have a cool name.
00:42:11,00:42:16,So you might be chopping down a load of trees and accidentally chop down an important one.
00:42:16,00:42:17,Absolutely.
00:42:17,00:42:18,Is an example of that.
00:42:18,00:42:19,Yeah.
00:42:19,00:42:21,And do we have it in this country for sort of trees that have witnessed great historic
00:42:21,00:42:22,events?
00:42:22,00:42:23,"Well, we should do."
00:42:23,00:42:25,We did chop down the Royal Oak.
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yeah.
00:42:26,00:42:27,Great story.
00:42:27,00:42:29,"So there was a Royal Oak that Charles, well, when he was then Charles Stewart was hiding"
00:42:29,00:42:35,in and the Parliamentarian forces were rummaging around beneath the canopy and he dined out
00:42:35,00:42:37,in the story for the rest of his life.
00:42:37,00:42:40,"Anyway, he then came down, went over to France and then the Royal Oak became, he became back"
00:42:40,00:42:45,"as king, pubs reopened, lots of pubs called the Royal Oak, sort of it became a meme."
00:42:45,00:42:50,"And then in the 19th century, lots of people started visiting and like chopping bits off"
00:42:50,00:42:51,and traipsing across this guy's farm.
00:42:51,00:42:58,"And this lunatic farmer's chopped the tree down, zero respect for trees or witnesses"
00:42:58,00:42:59,to history.
00:42:59,00:43:00,Trumbling his crops.
00:43:00,00:43:01,Trumbling his crops.
00:43:01,00:43:09,"But there is now a daughter or a son of that tree, which was sort of recovered and grown."
00:43:09,00:43:13,"And then that one was hit by lightning and now, and Prince Charles, that made him a bit"
00:43:13,00:43:14,sweaty.
00:43:14,00:43:17,"So he went and planted another tree, so there's now a grandchild."
00:43:17,00:43:20,"The main one's looking a bit, it's like it's been hit by oiling."
00:43:20,00:43:24,And then the other one's looking quite verdant and fresh and it's small.
00:43:24,00:43:25,It's about six foot high.
00:43:25,00:43:29,So there's three or there's two generations there on that spot.
00:43:29,00:43:31,It's in Shropshire.
00:43:31,00:43:35,"There's the, the Newton apple tree, which is both in the garden of where Newton live."
00:43:35,00:43:40,"But they also took a cutting and made a, I guess a daughter or a son of, they say it's"
00:43:40,00:43:41,a clone.
00:43:41,00:43:42,So I don't know if it means it just is the exact tree.
00:43:42,00:43:46,"I don't know what that terminology is, but it's growing outside on one of the colleges"
00:43:46,00:43:47,at Cambridge.
00:43:47,00:43:48,And I was reading in Merlin Sheldrake's book.
00:43:48,00:43:53,He wrote this incredible book about fungi and how it works in the world.
00:43:53,00:43:56,And he said that he wanted to grab some of the apples off it because he was interested
00:43:56,00:43:58,in making a cider.
00:43:58,00:44:01,"And the tour guide said, you are not allowed to take apples off this tree."
00:44:01,00:44:05,The apples are here specifically for all the tourists to see them fall to the ground so
00:44:05,00:44:08,they can experience gravity as it was first discovered.
00:44:08,00:44:09,Jesus.
00:44:09,00:44:12,You're going to be sitting and waiting a long time on you.
00:44:12,00:44:15,It's pretty rare you actually see an apple fall off the tree.
00:44:15,00:44:17,Pretty cool though to see an apple fall off the tree.
00:44:17,00:44:20,"On windy days, the tourism sort of quadrupled."
00:44:20,00:44:21,Get together.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Get to the tree.
00:44:22,00:44:28,"I was, I went to a historically important trees child today on the way to work."
00:44:28,00:44:29,Did you?
00:44:29,00:44:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:30,00:44:36,"And Frank, when she was in her hiding spot, she described a horse chestnut tree that was"
00:44:36,00:44:41,"just outside the building and it was, in 2005 they found it was suffering from a fungal"
00:44:41,00:44:45,disease and so they decided to take cuttings and they planted it all over the world and
00:44:45,00:44:48,there's one of them in hybrid fields just near my house.
00:44:48,00:44:49,And you saw that today?
00:44:49,00:44:50,Yeah.
00:44:50,00:44:51,That's amazing.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"Has her one's toppled, hasn't it?"
00:44:53,00:44:54,I think it has.
00:44:54,00:44:55,Yeah.
00:44:55,00:44:56,Not long ago.
00:44:56,00:44:57,It's not long ago.
00:44:57,00:44:58,There's a tree and winds a great part.
00:44:58,00:44:59,There's a oak tree and winds a great part that they think has been there since before
00:44:59,00:45:00,the Norman Conqueror.
00:45:00,00:45:01,So before...
00:45:01,00:45:02,Before fireplaces.
00:45:02,00:45:03,Before fireplaces.
00:45:03,00:45:08,And so William the Conqueror would have passed that tree.
00:45:08,00:45:09,No way.
00:45:09,00:45:10,No way.
00:45:10,00:45:11,Oh my gosh.
00:45:11,00:45:12,You see?
00:45:12,00:45:15,"The oak trees in churchyards are said to be thousands of years old, right?"
00:45:15,00:45:16,Yes.
00:45:16,00:45:21,"I think there's one that's claimed to be over 4,000 years old."
00:45:21,00:45:22,They're pretty amazing.
00:45:22,00:45:28,"I've got a friend who eats you berries, sort of like does while foraging and the thing"
00:45:28,00:45:32,"about you berries is, which people may know, a seed of the you berry, which is inside the"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"berry, is incredibly poisonous."
00:45:34,00:45:35,So...
00:45:35,00:45:36,So he spits the seed out.
00:45:36,00:45:37,Absolutely.
00:45:37,00:45:40,"So I went on a walk with him once and it was me and another friend and him and you know,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,"my other friend said, ""All right, I'll taste it."""
00:45:42,00:45:45,"Put it in his mouth, chewing around for a while and my friend said to him, ""And you spat"
00:45:45,00:45:46,"the seed out, right?"""
00:45:46,00:45:47,Like poor mate.
00:45:47,00:45:48,"It was like, ""No, what do you mean?"
00:45:48,00:45:49,Spit it out!
00:45:49,00:45:50,"Spit it out!"""
00:45:50,00:45:51,And it's...
00:45:51,00:45:52,"Yeah, he just sucks the fruit off."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"But if you accidentally swallow the seed, you will die."
00:45:54,00:45:57,"I think we'd like to just say, ""Public service to our listeners."
00:45:57,00:45:59,"Do not eat you berries."""
00:45:59,00:46:00,Don't.
00:46:00,00:46:02,"That's a metaphor for so much of life, isn't it?"
00:46:02,00:46:07,"The sweet, sweet outer layer, the poisonous death-giving fruit within."
00:46:07,00:46:08,Okay.
00:46:08,00:46:10,No more of your weird nightmares.
00:46:10,00:46:11,I'm not.
00:46:11,00:46:12,I'm just kidding you.
00:46:12,00:46:13,I don't know.
00:46:13,00:46:14,I want to workshop that.
00:46:14,00:46:15,It's interesting that you know about fruit on a U-Tree.
00:46:15,00:46:18,I've never thought about that because I just think about U-Trees as a source of longbows.
00:46:18,00:46:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:19,00:46:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:20,00:46:25,"They're sort of stretchy and squashy in exactly the right parts, basically."
00:46:25,00:46:34,"There was a famous tree, the sycamore tree in Tollpuddle where the Tollpuddle 6 began"
00:46:34,00:46:39,and started the friendly society of agricultural labours which eventually led to the beginning
00:46:39,00:46:42,of trade unionism and stuff like that.
00:46:42,00:46:45,"The story is very interesting, but I'm not going to go into it because the interesting"
00:46:45,00:46:48,thing is that Tollpuddle used to be called Tollpiddle.
00:46:48,00:46:49,I know.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"They rebranded, didn't they?"
00:46:51,00:46:52,They rebranded.
00:46:52,00:46:53,It just sounds so crap.
00:46:53,00:46:54,"Well, they embarrassed by Tollpiddle."
00:46:54,00:46:58,"I think, well, we're not exactly sure why they rebranded, but it seems likely."
00:46:58,00:47:05,So there was a river piddle that went by this town and the Tollpiddle is named after there.
00:47:05,00:47:11,"And then in 1934, locals were still calling it Tollpiddle and a journalist from the Daily"
00:47:11,00:47:14,"Worker went there and said, ""Is this Tollpuddle?"""
00:47:14,00:47:19,"And they went, ""Oh, nobody around here don't know no such name as Tollpuddle."""
00:47:19,00:47:23,And it does seem that maybe because it had to be more respectable and because it's such
00:47:23,00:47:28,an important place for the trade union movement that they didn't think Tollpiddle was a proper
00:47:28,00:47:29,name for it.
00:47:29,00:47:30,So they remember Tollpuddle?
00:47:30,00:47:31,Maybe.
00:47:31,00:47:32,Call it Toll Ocean.
00:47:32,00:47:34,Call it Toll Waterfall.
00:47:34,00:47:37,"One of the theories that Queen Victoria visited and they changed it for her, but we don't"
00:47:37,00:47:38,really know why.
00:47:38,00:47:40,It might have just evolved that way.
00:47:40,00:47:45,"You can still go and have a picnic underneath the oak tree at the vine, the house in Basingstoke,"
00:47:45,00:47:48,where Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn used to go when they were lovers.
00:47:48,00:47:49,No.
00:47:49,00:47:50,It's great.
00:47:50,00:47:53,If you want to really condemn a relationship that you have.
00:47:53,00:47:57,"Well, just think about the tasty fruit with the poisonous..."
00:47:57,00:47:58,Yeah.
00:47:58,00:47:59,Yeah.
00:47:59,00:48:01,"Does it have, like, Henry Hart?"
00:48:01,00:48:02,"Yeah, it probably does."
00:48:02,00:48:05,"You know, Catherine crossed out, sharing the cross now."
00:48:05,00:48:09,Have you heard of the Sheffield chainsaw massacre?
00:48:09,00:48:13,Is that the original title?
00:48:13,00:48:19,This was very recently in the 2010s and Sheffield Council basically cut down thousands of trees.
00:48:19,00:48:20,"Oh, of course."
00:48:20,00:48:21,"It was really controversial, wasn't it?"
00:48:21,00:48:22,Really controversial.
00:48:22,00:48:26,"There was, like, a 450-year-old Melbourne oak that was cut down."
00:48:26,00:48:29,There was loads of historical trees that were cut down.
00:48:29,00:48:34,"And basically, the council signed a contract with an infrastructure company saying every"
00:48:34,00:48:37,"time you cut down a tree, we'll give you some money."
00:48:37,00:48:41,"Maybe they're too old, or maybe they're dangerous, or maybe they're digging up the pavement so"
00:48:41,00:48:46,"people might trip over it or something, and then they got another consultancy to submit"
00:48:46,00:48:52,"a report on how many of the trees needed felling, and there was a big mistake in that second"
00:48:52,00:48:53,report.
00:48:53,00:48:59,And so they cut down thousands and thousands of these trees in Sheffield for no reason whatsoever.
00:48:59,00:49:00,So it is just gross incompetence.
00:49:00,00:49:01,"I'm afraid so, yeah."
00:49:01,00:49:03,Have they planted some trees?
00:49:03,00:49:05,"Oh, they will replant them, yeah."
00:49:05,00:49:06,"Wow, that's bad."
00:49:06,00:49:07,I hope someone's head was chopped.
00:49:07,00:49:12,"I was on HMS Victory the other day, and they are looking, they're doing a refurb."
00:49:12,00:49:13,It's like Triggers broom.
00:49:13,00:49:15,They're basically entirely rebuilding it every so often.
00:49:15,00:49:16,Where is it?
00:49:16,00:49:17,Where is it?
00:49:17,00:49:18,In Portsmouth.
00:49:18,00:49:21,"And they are using oak from France, because there aren't enough old oak trees."
00:49:21,00:49:25,"They just go to Sheffield and say, ""I hear you've got loads of oak."""
00:49:25,00:49:28,So I might have to put them in touch.
00:49:28,00:49:29,Wow.
00:49:29,00:49:32,"I mean, but France basically is England before and after."
00:49:32,00:49:33,Exactly.
00:49:33,00:49:36,"And the curator there was like, kind of come up with this real sophistry about it's great"
00:49:36,00:49:42,"that we're taking supplies from the old enemy, I'm like, ""Look mate, just like it."""
00:49:42,00:49:43,We're working together now.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:49:44,00:49:45,It's a shocker.
00:49:45,00:49:46,We don't have oaks in this country.
00:49:46,00:49:47,"Come on, just admit it."
00:49:47,00:49:50,"But yeah, they used to go around the forests when they're building things out of wood."
00:49:50,00:49:54,And they would actually find the trees that were the right shape for the bit that they
00:49:54,00:49:55,need to build.
00:49:55,00:49:58,"So if you wanted something called a knee on a ship, which has a sort of vaguely right"
00:49:58,00:50:03,"angle sort of bracket, you'd just go, ""That tree's got some, that one's perfect."""
00:50:03,00:50:06,"And you'd go and sort of scribble it out, and then they'd know to chop down that tree."
00:50:06,00:50:09,"And then the carter would be like, ""We'd have to do much work with that."""
00:50:09,00:50:10,"Oh, that's great."
00:50:10,00:50:12,You could just cut that midsection where it's already at.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"So clever, isn't it?"
00:50:13,00:50:14,That's great.
00:50:14,00:50:16,So there's always images in the 18th century of people hanging these weird sort of cutouts
00:50:16,00:50:21,"on the side of trees to show the shapes that people make so much sense, doesn't it?"
00:50:21,00:50:25,"Then did they actually, the new forest was just planted for boats, wasn't it?"
00:50:25,00:50:26,"Yeah, a lot of it."
00:50:26,00:50:27,Yeah.
00:50:27,00:50:31,"The new forest, I live there, so I'm going to buy a new forest."
00:50:31,00:50:32,Forest does not designate woodland.
00:50:32,00:50:33,"Oh, right."
00:50:33,00:50:37,"It's just a legal designation of forest, a royal forest, a piece of ground on which"
00:50:37,00:50:39,certain different types of law apply.
00:50:39,00:50:40,Really?
00:50:40,00:50:45,"And there is obviously forestry in woodland within it, but yeah, lots of it's more in"
00:50:45,00:50:46,open grounds.
00:50:46,00:50:47,And that's true of the word forest.
00:50:47,00:50:48,Yeah.
00:50:48,00:50:51,Forest kind of means this has this legal meaning.
00:50:51,00:50:52,That's so interesting.
00:50:52,00:50:53,"It's weird, isn't it?"
00:50:53,00:50:56,"So all the ancient woodland in Britain tragically I think has been cut down, but so a lot of"
00:50:56,00:51:00,"the trees in the new forest now were planted at various times in the national crisis, whether"
00:51:00,00:51:04,"it was by any date for a navy or the Georgians or the Commonwealth war, obviously lots of"
00:51:04,00:51:07,"pines, but to pick props for when they're running out of woods."
00:51:07,00:51:09,"The new forest does commoning, doesn't it?"
00:51:09,00:51:10,"Oh, yeah, we do, yeah."
00:51:10,00:51:11,"Do you, are you a commoner?"
00:51:11,00:51:14,"I'm not a commoner, unfortunately, because my house is outside the cattle graze."
00:51:14,00:51:15,"Oh, sorry."
00:51:15,00:51:22,"Because I'm often told when I roll about on the common, but yes, you can put your animals"
00:51:22,00:51:26,"out, which is what the most of the country used to be like before the enclosures came."
00:51:26,00:51:27,Yes.
00:51:27,00:51:28,All these hedges and fields.
00:51:28,00:51:29,That's the man.
00:51:29,00:51:30,Everyone thinks it's beautiful English scenery.
00:51:30,00:51:32,That's an industrial farming landscape.
00:51:32,00:51:33,The man enclosed that.
00:51:33,00:51:34,"Oh, no, I'm asking you closure."
00:51:34,00:51:35,Forced us off it.
00:51:35,00:51:36,And you had two hedges.
00:51:36,00:51:37,"Oh, God, I love hedges."
00:51:37,00:51:38,We don't mind it.
00:51:38,00:51:39,We don't mind it.
00:51:39,00:51:40,That's true.
00:51:40,00:51:44,"Yeah, so you can still go and you put your pigs out there when the acorns fall."
00:51:44,00:51:48,"Yes, I think because there are various rights you have and you have to live in the right"
00:51:48,00:51:49,house.
00:51:49,00:51:53,I'm so sorry that you're outside the cattle graze.
00:51:53,00:51:54,It's a traumatic episode.
00:51:54,00:51:55,This has been today.
00:51:55,00:51:56,"Yeah, I know."
00:51:56,00:51:57,Tucked up.
00:51:57,00:51:58,Dan's there with his pigs in his front room going up.
00:51:58,00:51:59,"No, it's so sad."
00:51:59,00:52:02,"You've opened up something because my wife is desperate to be a commoner and we have,"
00:52:02,00:52:03,we've failed.
00:52:03,00:52:04,So anyway.
00:52:04,00:52:08,I think we need more because house prices in the New Forest have gone up quite a lot.
00:52:08,00:52:12,"So quite a lot of people are buying these houses that have the right of commenting, but"
00:52:12,00:52:13,they are not interested.
00:52:13,00:52:14,"Yeah, they're not real commoners."
00:52:14,00:52:15,They're not real commoners.
00:52:15,00:52:18,"That's why you're done, right?"
00:52:18,00:52:20,I'm going to test you on the rights that you'd have as a commoner then.
00:52:20,00:52:24,"You've got the right pasture, which as you said, is grazing your ponies, cattle, donkeys."
00:52:24,00:52:26,"You've got the right of sheep, which is grazing your sheep."
00:52:26,00:52:28,Are you allowed to pick up sticks or something?
00:52:28,00:52:29,"Firewoods, yes."
00:52:29,00:52:30,"Firewoods, yes."
00:52:30,00:52:33,I actually think that they sort of give you firewood because they don't massively want
00:52:33,00:52:35,you chopping it down anymore.
00:52:35,00:52:36,"But yeah, it's called estavas."
00:52:36,00:52:37,"Yes, that's right."
00:52:37,00:52:38,Estavas.
00:52:38,00:52:39,Estavas.
00:52:39,00:52:40,The right of turboree.
00:52:40,00:52:41,"Yes, what's that?"
00:52:41,00:52:42,Is that turboree?
00:52:42,00:52:43,It's like the fish.
00:52:43,00:52:48,"The right of catching turboree, it's the right of cutting turfs for fuel."
00:52:48,00:52:49,"Yes, it's a turf."
00:52:49,00:52:50,Yes.
00:52:50,00:52:52,"Not a good idea nowadays, but yeah."
00:52:52,00:52:54,"No, you're not supposed to do that anymore, actually."
00:52:54,00:52:56,"And actually, the right of turning your pigs out is called mast."
00:52:56,00:52:57,Is that a mast?
00:52:57,00:53:00,"Yeah, apparently turning pigs out to..."
00:53:00,00:53:01,"Yeah, it's funny."
00:53:01,00:53:04,"At that time of year, there's just loads of pigs all over the roads and you've got to"
00:53:04,00:53:05,have a swat.
00:53:05,00:53:06,Really?
00:53:06,00:53:07,"Yeah, when the acorns fall."
00:53:07,00:53:09,"What I didn't get is, yeah, when the acorns fall, the pigs are supposed to eat them because"
00:53:09,00:53:12,they're poisonous to other stuff.
00:53:12,00:53:16,So are the pigs rushing around as a horse goes towards an acorn and pigs bit him underneath
00:53:16,00:53:17,them?
00:53:17,00:53:21,"Like, ""Y'all mate, if I try and eat you, Barry,"" he's like, ""Raps it out of my"
00:53:21,00:53:22,"hashing."""
00:53:22,00:53:29,"OK, that's it."

00:54:29,00:54:30,"Yeah, we did."
00:54:30,00:54:31,Which is better than Dan's.
00:54:31,00:54:32,So that one hurts.
00:54:32,00:54:34,That's what I heard from Dan himself.
00:54:34,00:54:36,So not true.
00:54:36,00:54:37,Not true.
00:54:37,00:54:38,He didn't say that.

00:54:51,00:54:53,So what are we talking about today?
00:54:53,00:54:59,"Well, today we're going to talk about the great spot of rowing and we're going to speak to"
00:54:59,00:55:06,"Imogen Grant and Eve Stewart, who are two of our Team GB medal hopefuls for Paris."
00:55:06,00:55:08,I thought rowing was a stupid sport.
00:55:08,00:55:09,It's cold.
00:55:09,00:55:10,It's wet.
00:55:10,00:55:11,You have to get up really early.
00:55:11,00:55:12,You get blisters on your hands and you can't see where you're going.
00:55:12,00:55:16,We are going to be chucking in a few interesting facts that we've learned along the way.
00:55:16,00:55:23,Because Adolf Hitler was seething from the stands in the despotic way that he does.
00:55:23,00:55:25,"Oh, Moustache twitching away."
00:55:25,00:55:30,And we will be trying our hand on the River Thames to see which of you and I is going
00:55:30,00:55:32,to be the greatest rower.
00:55:32,00:55:35,"OK, we're ready to do the first time trial."
00:55:35,00:55:38,"Ready, go."
00:55:38,00:55:40,This is a pretty steady start from Anna.
00:55:40,00:55:42,Now she's really getting her rhythm.
00:55:42,00:55:44,We're actually going at a proper pace.
00:55:44,00:55:50,"We're approaching the finish line, the red boy."
00:55:50,00:55:51,Who will be victorious?
