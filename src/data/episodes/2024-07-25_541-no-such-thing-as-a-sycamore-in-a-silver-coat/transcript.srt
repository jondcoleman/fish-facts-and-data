00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:13,200
 joined by the history guy himself, Mr Dan Snow. If you are a person in the UK who likes

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,720
 to watch history documentaries, you will know all about Dan. If you are a podcast fan, you

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,040
 may well know his podcast, History Hit, which is an absolutely brilliant history podcast

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,720
 that both myself and Anna and Dan have recently appeared on. So do look for his podcast and

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,480
 listen to our episodes and indeed all of the episodes of that brilliant show. Actually,

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,320
 while you're on the podcast app of your choice, why not find mine and Anna's new podcast.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,800
 It's called Quite a Good Sport and I'll tell you some more about that in a minute because

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
 I should also say we're going on tour. The tour which we booked so many months ago and

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,160
 felt like it was so far in the future is just around the corner. Ah, if you live in Edinburgh,

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,080
 that will be our first date and we'll be playing there on the 14th of August 2024. You can

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,840
 see a live podcast recording including all the bits that I normally cut out because we

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,880
 can't possibly broadcast them. It will all be there in Edinburgh. I really hope you

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,880
 can make it. We love doing these shows and we love meeting everyone afterwards. If you

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,680
 live in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London or Manchester or the environs

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,600
 of those cities, then do go to no6thingsforfish.com/live and find out how to get tickets for the shows

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,800
 that are near you. Anyway, just quickly back to that new podcast of mine and Anna's. What

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,760
 I think I'll do rather than explaining what happens, I'm going to put a little teaser

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,280
 at the end of this week's episode. So once the show's finished, if you listen on for

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,720
 another minute or so, you'll get a really good idea of the show. It's basically me

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,080
 and Anna speaking to Olympians and then trying out the sport ourselves. So in the latest

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,920
 episode, we speak to a couple of TGB's rowers and then we get on the terms and see which

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,800
 of her and I is the best at rowing. I really think you'll enjoy it. It would mean the world

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,920
 to us if you could click follow on your podcast app of choice. It would mean even more if

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,200
 you could find the time to listen and it would mean more still if you actually managed to

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,400
 give us a review. Anyway, stay tuned for the little teaser of quite a good sport. Go to

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,720
 no6thingsforfish.com/live for details of our tour and sit back, relax and enjoy our latest

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:49,800
 episode with the history guy, Dan Snow. On with the podcast.

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,920
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,080
 Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Dan Snow. And once again, we have gathered around the

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,400
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,760
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Dan. When Captain Scott, the infamous

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,640
 British expedition leader, got to the South Pole, he saw in the distance little flag fluttering

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,560
 in his heart sank and then he saw a tent and inside that tent, there was a letter and that

36
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,120
 letter was addressed very neatly to King Harkon of Norway. It was a letter from an explorer,

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,160
 Rold Amundsen, who'd arrived at the South Pole a month before Scott, breaking the records,

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,280
 the first human being to reach South Pole and he'd left a little tent and a letter saying,

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,000
 "Hey Scott, would you mind posting this to the King just to tell him I got here?" I mean,

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,800
 a shade throne. That's great. It's a great prank, except it's one of those pranks that

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
 have gone wrong because he would have been back at home and they went, "You know he died."

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,640
 He's going, "Oh my God, someone, don't find the letter. Don't find my cheeky prank."

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,480
 You're so right. I read one theory, right, that the reason

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,400
 that he put the letter there is to prove that he got there because let's say he gets down

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,800
 there and he writes the letter and says, "I got to the South Pole" and then he gives

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,960
 it to the King while it's just his word against anyone else's. But if he puts a letter there

47
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,800
 and Scott picks it up and takes it back, then that's evidence because it's another person

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
 who's seen where this letter got to.

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,360
 You're right. Yeah, you've got to leave something.

50
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,520
 I don't know. I think that's his excuse when he gets to down fly, but, you know, Scott's

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
 dead now in news.

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,160
 No, there's already a serious context. I just love the fact. There's those pictures

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,880
 of it. And it's just a… The Antarctic environment is a featureless, white, icy football field.

54
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,920
 And so they could have taken that picture anywhere. I say, "You're right. I guess

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,560
 you are right. You've got to leave something there." And also, Scott literally slept there

56
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,400
 and then went and started off the next day. It is the most extraordinary box-ticking exercise.

57
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,240
 You know what? I did that when I went to Bangladesh because I tried to go to as many countries

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,480
 as I can. And I stopped over in Bangladesh, slept there one night and then left, but I

59
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
 counted as going there.

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 The airport hotel?

61
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 Yeah.

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 I'm not sure that counts.

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
 Yeah, of course it does.

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,400
 It's kind of like touring, isn't it? I watched a Celine Dion documentary recently.

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
 She says exactly that. She says, "I've been around the world. I've been everywhere

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,080
 in the world, but I've never seen anywhere." Because she was in and out.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
 Yeah, it was very…

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
 She is the cat to the Scott of the Pop World.

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 She is, right?

70
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
 Yeah.

71
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,680
 I really thought you were going to say, "I watched a Celine Dion documentary and I

72
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,760
 was able to tick off my 100 Celine Dion documentary."

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,120
 I only watched the second.

74
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
 Yeah, it still counts.

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,160
 The other thing, we in Britain talk about Scott a lot, obviously, and we ignore Amundsen,

76
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,160
 by the way, who didn't just get to the South Pole first. He's an absolute legend.

77
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,680
 He was the first man through the Northwest Passage and the first person to get to the

78
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,400
 North Pole as well, albeit in an airship.

79
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
 Absolutely.

80
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,480
 Does that count? That's the thing. Because, yeah, it was the 1920s, wasn't it?

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 Yeah.

82
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,920
 He decided to fly over the North Pole. Do we count that?

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
 I think it counts.

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 Okay.

85
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,400
 Well, I think it counts. If I'd been to Bangladesh, then I think that counts.

86
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 Oh.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,200
 But also, didn't he… he was going to walk to the North Pole and then he got news that

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,560
 Peary had allegedly done the same. And then that was when he decided to go to the South

89
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
 Pole, is that right?

90
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
 I think so. There was a failed expression to get to the North Pole for sure. I'm not

91
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
 sure why he turned around.

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,400
 That's a hell of a turnaround in terms of the distance.

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 Yeah.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,800
 Well, I believe that's the case. And I believe all of the people who were on the ship thought

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,080
 they were going to the North Pole.

96
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 Really?

97
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,440
 And then they started going down, down, down. And they stopped off at Funchal, which is in…

98
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
 Where is that?

99
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 Portugal, I think?

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,600
 Yeah, one of the islands off Portugal.

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
 Yeah.

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,000
 And they kind of then said to the crew, they said, "Okay, by the way, we're not going

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,360
 to the North Pole. After all, we're going to the South Pole."

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,440
 And it is a dick move, much like the letter. And yeah, he was a legend. I like him, but

105
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,680
 he was a cheeky legend. I mean, he really did do that because he'd been told to go

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,880
 to the North Pole, but he just wanted to be the first somewhere.

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
 Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,840
 So, as James says, thought someone else had got there and turned around his boat just

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,280
 to beat Scott. And the thing was, and again, this could be, Lady Duff protest too much after

110
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,600
 the event, but Scott insisted he was never racing.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,760
 Oh, I know. Brilliant, isn't it? It's so good.

112
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,200
 He was there for a scientific expedition.

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,520
 He wrote in a letter, "Oh, God, I've heard Amundsen is trying to get there before me.

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,280
 That's fine. He probably will. You know, he's got dogs. I've got horses. He'll go

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,960
 faster. I'm not interested in that."

116
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,120
 Cut a picture of Scott trampling the weak, hurdling the dead, flogging his men ever further

117
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,040
 south. I read a history once of Amundsen. It said, "The trip to the South Pole was smooth

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
 and uneventful."

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,840
 I was like, "Oh, wow. Don't bother reading off."

120
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,440
 And when they got back, they'd put on weight. British expeditions anywhere, be it desert,

121
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,120
 rainforest, arctic, high latitude. The lads arrived back, shadowed them for the cells.

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,680
 They got eaten each other, broken. These Norwegians get back. Many of their dogs are still alive.

123
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,760
 And they're just like, "All right, lads, here we are. We're actually ahead of schedule

124
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 as well."

125
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,120
 I mean, it's too cruel.

126
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,160
 But I think the thing of saying, "Does it count?" because it was done by Plaint. That's

127
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,200
 a thing that Amundsen had his whole life after that trip, right? People didn't accept, particularly

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 the British.

129
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,720
 Yeah, it was like, "You didn't do this. You had skis. You did it the improper way."

130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,120
 When he got back, he was at a dinner at the Royal Geographical Society. This is in 1912.

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,360
 And the president, Lord Curzon, offered a toast, but not to him, but to the dog team.

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,520
 Because he was like, "They're the ones who got there."

133
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,280
 And also, he did eat a few of his dogs, didn't he?

134
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
 Yeah, right.

135
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
 So, I think that's, you know...

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 Yeah.

137
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,800
 If I'm going to die, that's fine. I'm eating my dogs first.

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
 Oh, yeah. Anna, I'd eat you.

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,440
 Like, it's like... Okay, that escalated quickly.

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,600
 Dan, why did you come back a lot heavier than when you left? And with none of your friends?

141
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 You've only been to Exeter.

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,800
 Yeah, one-man podcast from now on, no such thing as a fish.

143
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,840
 The dogs, to be fair, were mobile food storage units. I mean, they were meant to be eaten

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,280
 and then fed to each other, and then fed to the humans.

145
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
 Literally, dog eat dog.

146
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
 Wow.

147
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,720
 I think that trip, it also, as well as being an eventful, just sounded quite fun. Like,

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
 they were just reading about it. They did things like, "Guess the temperature contests."

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,600
 Well, this is not the track to the poll, is it? This is when they were overwintering.

150
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,680
 So, I think a lot of people don't focus on that bit. And when they were overwintering,

151
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,840
 they're in a hut. There were lots more of them, not just the guys who then tracked to

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,560
 the poll. And they had plenty of supplies, and it does sound super fun. You know, they

153
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,400
 had hot toddies, cigars, lots of music. They played this fun "Guess the temperature" game.

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,640
 They had lots of puzzles they played.

155
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
 Yeah.

156
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,520
 Scott and they overwintering fell out massively with Evans, who was his second in command.

157
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,560
 They decided they absolutely despised each other, and that could be the reason that they

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
 didn't make it to the poll.

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
 Oh, really?

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Oh.

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,760
 Back from the poll the following year because of the kind of terrible divisions within the

162
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 world.

163
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
 Really?

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
 Right.

165
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
 Do we know why?

166
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,480
 Well, it's that word, because I think spending a long time in a hut, I mean, you three spend

167
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,360
 a lot of time together, and you all seem to be on fine. But, you know, add an Antarctic

168
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,760
 winter, no daylights. You know, you might fall out with each other as well. And so, I think

169
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,080
 it would break any team apart, but those two just were just incompatible.

170
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
 And the diarising.

171
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
 A lot of diarising.

172
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
 Because you would look at Scott going, "What are you writing?"

173
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
 Stop it!

174
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
 "What are you writing?"

175
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,000
 That's what, whenever Andy's on his laptop, you're always like that to me, aren't you?

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 "What are you writing?"

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 "What are you writing?"

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 "I'll eat you."

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,480
 Are you bitching about me? Are you bitching about me in there?

180
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,560
 I can't help it. Anyone who has a diary that I've ever met, I hate it.

181
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 Really?

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 Do you think they're writing about you?

183
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
 Yeah.

184
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
 I get paranoid.

185
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
 You are not the main character.

186
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,920
 You wish they're writing about you. Had some sushi, went home, didn't do much else.

187
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
 That's what's pissing me off, but I'm not being ridden about.

188
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,640
 Didn't see Dan today, that was a shame. Hopefully tomorrow.

189
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,280
 But yeah, it's why they, it's why whenever they send people to space or on these long

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,640
 expeditions, they often look for the most boring characters possible. Who don't want

191
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,320
 to talk, who have zero, like, anger temperaments. They're just, like, Tim Peake is such a pleasant

192
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
 man. We met Tim Peake.

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
 Yeah, pleasant, not boring. I noticed you switched.

194
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,560
 I think Dan Schleiber, is that the application for the European Space Agency? I see lying

195
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,320
 in the bin there with a rejected stamp on it. Apparently they're saying it's super

196
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 boring, guys.

197
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
 It's interesting.

198
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
 Oh, my God.

199
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,000
 Well, Anton was not boring at all. Obviously, he was a character.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Yeah.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,920
 He, in fact, I think he started his journey to the Northwest Passage at midnight because

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,720
 he had to escape gambling debts.

203
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 I think.

204
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
 Really?

205
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,520
 He sailed the boat off because the, the people that he owed were threatening to, like, impound

206
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
 his boat.

207
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,840
 But it is funny this, we talked about this heroic age of exploration. I mean, so many

208
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,560
 of them were absolute clowns in chat. I mean, Shackleton is astonishing in a crisis, but

209
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,520
 also he needs to be because he was prone to get in crises the whole time.

210
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
 Right.

211
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,040
 He bespeared absolute legend when everything goes wrong because you're going to make everything

212
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 go wrong.

213
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
 So he, I mean, he would leave with sort of creditors running on the key side, roaring

214
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,960
 at him and sort of also cuckolded husbands shaking their fists. I mean, it's complete

215
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
 chaos.

216
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
 Wow.

217
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,240
 But he, but he was good leading guys on the ice, you know, that, I guess, they're different

218
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
 skills.

219
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,160
 And he was the next person to try, wasn't he, after Scott Adams?

220
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,400
 So brilliantly. So he went, he had a nervous breakdown and then went, you know what, she

221
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
 was never about going to South Pole.

222
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's actually the greatest prize is crossing the continent from one side to the other via

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 the South Pole.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,320
 So he managed to flog this to a bunch of old, old heiresses, widowed heiresses who then

225
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,080
 gave him money for his famous expedition to the Trans-Antarctic expedition, which did

226
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 not set foot on the mainland, but led to his eternal heroism because in getting them out

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,320
 of the mess he'd got them into, he obviously, you know, won great claim and was brilliant.

228
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
 But yeah.

229
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,160
 So that was his big scheme was, oh, you know, it's not about South Pole.

230
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 But what I find kind of interesting is Scott and Amundsen got there, you think, right?

231
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,440
 So and then Shackleton sort of said he was going to do his thing, but actually no one

232
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
 else really bothered.

233
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
 Yeah, it took a while.

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
 They took a while.

235
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
 They were like, well, someone's done it now.

236
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
 Well, in a way, why would you?

237
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
 Yeah.

238
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,080
 In fact, wasn't the next person to get there, or was it the North Pole, Edmund Hillary went

239
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
 to one of them.

240
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,120
 Hillary was the next person to walk to the South Pole.

241
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,760
 He was the next South Pole, wasn't he?

242
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,800
 Yeah, there was a guy called George Dufek who flew there and this was in 1956 and he,

243
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,720
 they interviewed him on the ice.

244
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,260
 So they actually had a video camera there, apart from they didn't have any of the images

245
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,880
 because the film froze solid.

246
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
 Oh, no.

247
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 Oh, really?

248
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
 So they took it home, tried to develop it, actually it was frozen.

249
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
 So they got no images.

250
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,320
 Oh, that's not going to be a great episode for you guys.

251
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,680
 Pictures that we know were taken and then didn't make it.

252
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
 Yeah.

253
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
 That got ruined.

254
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,880
 Like the famous D-Day shots and I'm like, like the ones that we have are just a fragment

255
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,800
 of the ones that he took that day.

256
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 Yeah.

257
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
 And the British beach shots were destroyed on the way back as well.

258
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
 That would be great, wouldn't it?

259
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
 Yeah.

260
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,000
 And the photos that are sort of currently sitting held on ice.

261
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,520
 So Mallory, Mallory and Irvin.

262
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
 Oh, yeah.

263
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
 Well, that camera.

264
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 Yeah, that camera is still missing.

265
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,720
 Kodak have said that they still think because of the cold conditions that they would be

266
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
 able to develop the film.

267
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
 Should we ever find a camera?

268
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 Yeah.

269
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,720
 But I've had some photos sent to Kodak where I was just facing slightly towards the sun

270
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,080
 and they couldn't develop those.

271
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
 Yeah, yeah, that's true.

272
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
 Yeah.

273
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,400
 One, one more point about Scott is that Scott also is technically in that territory of the

274
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,520
 Mallory and Amundsen and Mealy Earhart because we don't know where he is, but we roughly

275
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,920
 know where he might be because he was left in the tent.

276
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,400
 They pack the tent over with snow and they say it will be something like 20 feet below

277
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,280
 the surface now with the amount of snow that's on top of it.

278
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,600
 So we don't know where he is, but there's an estimate that within the next couple of

279
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,560
 centuries, the bit that he's in might snap off from the side and float down to the sea.

280
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
 So one of his wishes would have been as a captain, his burial at sea.

281
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,280
 And so in 200 years, he might get his wish, which is a little nice.

282
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
 That's nice.

283
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,760
 And that's how different we are.

284
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,880
 I thought immediately as an archaeologist, finally we can get a hold of him, have a good

285
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 old look at him.

286
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
 Yeah.

287
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
 Yeah.

288
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,320
 Yeah, you're just like, "Oh, it'd be so nice to bury it at sea," and I'm like, "Let's

289
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
 get in there."

290
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
 That lasts.

291
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 Let's get investigated.

292
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
 I only have one thing on letters now.

293
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
 This original thought was about sort of letters, really throwing some shade.

294
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,720
 And I found something I didn't know about Winston Churchill.

295
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,680
 This letter he wrote when he was imprisoned in the Bull War, so 1899, and he's been taken

296
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,560
 as a prisoner for, he was only 25 years old, and him and two much older guys in the prison

297
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,080
 decided they were going to escape.

298
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,680
 They hatched this really elaborate plan, and they didn't really want Churchill with them

299
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,280
 because he was a bit famous, he was a massive loudmouth, and he was quite overweight and

300
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
 not very fit.

301
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,640
 He couldn't speak Dutch or Afrikaans or Zulu, and they could.

302
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
 Got it.

303
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,920
 Anyway, Churchill was like, "I'm going to tag along," and then he just went off on

304
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,440
 his own and did it on a night that they didn't want to escape, jumped over the prison walls,

305
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,840
 had no plan, no maps, couldn't speak any languages, somehow stumbled into another British guy who

306
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,180
 rescued him, a classic Churchill always falling into a lap of luck.

307
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,960
 But the letter he left behind in the prison was so good, he left a letter of apology on

308
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,880
 his bed to Louis de Souza, who was the Boer Secretary for War, and it just said, "I have

309
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,680
 the honour to inform you that as I do not consider that your government have any right

310
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,480
 to detain me as a military prisoner, I have decided to escape from your custody."

311
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 Wow.

312
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,440
 "Regressing I am unable to bid you a more ceremonious or personal farewell, I have

313
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
 the honour to be your most obedient servant, Winston Churchill."

314
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
 Wow.

315
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
 That's great.

316
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,280
 Yes, I always include a little bit about Dan Shriver in my letters, and didn't meet

317
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:30,440
 him today, but I'm sure I will tomorrow.

318
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,200
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

319
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,200
 My fact this week is that Eleanor of Aquitaine gave us fireplaces.

320
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 Nice.

321
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
 Did she?

322
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,080
 Well, this is my claim, and I'm going to stand by it.

323
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 So, oh, I didn't realise how late it was that we really started building fireplaces, chimneys

324
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,680
 into our homes, but it was certainly after the Norman invasion in Britain.

325
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,040
 And anyway, Eleanor of Aquitaine is around in the 12th century, and she marries Louis

326
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,640
 the 7th in 1137, and that meant she had to move from the south of France, which is nice

327
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,760
 and hot to Paris, the Île de la Cité, where she had a castle, and it was all cold and

328
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,480
 bare, so she refurbished, and really stripped everything down, redid it, loads of colourful

329
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,800
 tapestries on the wall, widened the slits, I guess I've got arrow slits.

330
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 She's like, "What's the point of these arrow slits?

331
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,280
 I'm going to turn them into big old windows."

332
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,480
 Made it nice and homey, and she was really cold, so she had the masons build in fireplaces,

333
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,120
 and there doesn't seem to be, as far as I can tell, evidence of places really having

334
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,800
 these built-in fireplaces, like a proper hearth, as we know today.

335
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,640
 So, people would always have a fire in the middle of a hut with a hole in the roof, or

336
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,640
 not, or might build a chimney outside a house.

337
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,280
 But look, it's spurious.

338
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,800
 And then she married Henry II of England, and brought them over here.

339
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 Is that what we're saying?

340
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,440
 And then, I know that she did extensive refurbishments on all the places that she lived over here

341
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,240
 as well, the palaces, so, I mean, she must have.

342
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,360
 OK, well, we have a historian on the show.

343
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,000
 Well, if only fireplaces were my speciality, however, I have been to the White Tower, the

344
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,480
 great, most magnificent donjons in Europe, at the centre of the Tower of London, and there

345
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,920
 are fireplaces in the Tower of London, in the White Tower.

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 And that was built in the 11th century, almost 100 years before her.

347
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
 Now, they could...

348
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,080
 Were they domestic fireplaces?

349
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
 Oh, I see.

350
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 It's domestic fireplaces.

351
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 Why not say that in my original?

352
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,240
 Changing the rules here.

353
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,360
 It's not in race, everyone.

354
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
 They are.

355
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
 Yes.

356
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,600
 This night, I think Ella Rackertrain is one of the most exciting and magical figures

357
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 in our history, and she deserves to be on this podcast.

358
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
 I'm just not sure she deserves to be on.

359
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 She's in five places.

360
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 This is it.

361
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,920
 This is the only reason we're talking about her.

362
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,400
 I refuse to stray from her connection to five places.

363
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
 She was, I will allow us to stray into just her being a big interior designer, if you

364
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,800
 want to broaden the element of that same chat, because she did, she revamped so much that

365
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,080
 I think her mother-in-law refused to live with her, which is kind of sad, but I really

366
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,920
 liked the idea of her moving in with the king, who she thought was really monkish.

367
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
 This is her first marriage.

368
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 Oh, he was a muppet.

369
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
 Yeah.

370
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,040
 I think that those were the words, weren't they, because that's the translation.

371
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,840
 Then the mother-in-law just thought, "This woman is taking over, making it all gaudy."

372
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,260
 She moved in really good musicians, feels like she really created an interesting, intelligent

373
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,200
 culture in this palace, which she then brought to Britain.

374
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
 She certainly did.

375
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,280
 I love the story about her.

376
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,240
 She went on crusade with the said monkish husband.

377
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,440
 You know, they always say, my grandma used to say, "Go traveling with your girlfriend

378
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,840
 before you marry someone."

379
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
 You really see them for who they are, when you're traveling, when you have a bit of

380
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,360
 doing kind of annoying admin, you got stuck with logistics, you get a bit of tummy problems,

381
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,180
 and you know if this is the one.

382
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,320
 Spending one night in an airport hotel just so you could take off a country.

383
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 Indeed.

384
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
 I do.

385
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 Murdering some non-Christians.

386
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
 Well, yes.

387
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,040
 Well, no, in the case of her, of course, he was insufficiently forward in murdering non-Christians,

388
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,760
 because she thought he was wet, she thought he was a bit useless.

389
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 They go away on crusade.

390
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,240
 It's the ultimate sort of travel, get to know your partner, travel to adventure, and just

391
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,040
 comes back and she just goes, "I'm dumping you.

392
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,360
 You are a spectacular useless human being."

393
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,960
 And they get it all annulled in the way that aristocrats managed to do.

394
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,280
 It took a while, didn't it?

395
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,840
 They kept asking the Pope, they kept telling them to keep shocking each other and try to

396
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
 make an air, I think.

397
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
 And that did not work.

398
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,360
 The Pope supposedly made them a special bed to sleep in to make them more likely to have

399
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 sex with each other.

400
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 No way.

401
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 Apparently.

402
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
 What's a bed that makes you more likely to have sex with someone?

403
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 You know, they're a fireplace, presumably.

404
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
 Yeah?

405
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 Yeah.

406
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
 It's nice.

407
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,960
 But it didn't work because the year she got divorced from him, she married the very hunky

408
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,000
 young Duke of Normandy, Henry, who then became Henry II of England.

409
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And so she...

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,560
 And everyone goes, "Henry, the second is a great empire."

411
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,200
 And I always think it's odd that we don't call it, perhaps it's not odd, given me.

412
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 Yeah.

413
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,800
 It's too short for such a name, but that actually is kind of her empire in a way.

414
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,600
 She's the one who brings all these massive French possessions.

415
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,480
 So basically she and Henry end up owning more of France than the King of France.

416
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,360
 And then her absolutely useless sons just spunk the whole lot of it.

417
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,400
 But only after she dies.

418
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,560
 Basically, if you look at the history of that empire, it essentially lasts for the course

419
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
 of her life.

420
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
 Right.

421
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
 And then her...

422
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,680
 The most useless son in English history, which is up against their composition, John.

423
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
 You don't like John?

424
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
 Oh, okay.

425
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
 I don't...

426
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 You don't like John?

427
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
 Sorry.

428
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
 I'm fond...

429
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
 I'm fond of John.

430
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
 What are we talking about?

431
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
 He gets a bad rep, doesn't he, Anna?

432
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
 He's got...

433
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
 My God.

434
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
 Elevator was an extraordinary mother, wasn't she?

435
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
 Elevator on the broadcast.

436
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
 I've always wanted to meet one.

437
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 Here we are, friends.

438
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
 So...

439
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 What's like John of England?

440
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,600
 Is of England necessary?

441
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 He's not from anywhere else.

442
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
 He doesn't have any other nickname.

443
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
 It's not John that...

444
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 Oh, he does have other names.

445
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
 Oh, yes.

446
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,960
 And you know what they are because you're grimacing.

447
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,920
 The other nicknames are Lackland and Softsword.

448
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
 Yeah.

449
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,480
 Which basically all that means is poor guy didn't inherit any land and Softsword didn't

450
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
 really want to be too fighty.

451
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
 Does it not mean impotent?

452
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 Oh.

453
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,780
 Like all of this sort of seemed to say Softsword genuinely is about his military power.

454
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
 Really?

455
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
 He lost the empire.

456
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,800
 He only inherited the throne by possibly starving his nephew to death.

457
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,000
 He controlled an empire that stretched through much of what is now France, Ireland and England.

458
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,960
 And by the time he died, his empire was the East Midlands.

459
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
 That's a nice part of England.

460
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
 That's part of the world.

461
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
 Don't get me wrong.

462
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
 That's part of the world.

463
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
 Lucky, I would be very happy to have an empire there.

464
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,680
 Just before he died, when he contracted dysentery, he lost the crown jewels while crossing the

465
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,800
 wash two set aforementioned East Midlands.

466
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,000
 So he lost the crown jewels, arrived in the East Midlands and died.

467
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Yeah.

468
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,440
 And then his, luckily for that benighted family, his dysentery saved the dynasty because his

469
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,280
 son, they stuck his son on the throne because he was so young and they worked out they

470
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
 could just manipulate him.

471
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,640
 That's a nice multiple, isn't it?

472
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
 Dysentery saved the dynasty.

473
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
 Yeah.

474
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,520
 The reason I like King John is because we don't mind about owning empires.

475
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,520
 What we mind is about being good to your mum and I think a lot of us don't know they got

476
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 on well.

477
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
 They did.

478
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
 And also well done him because her favourite was famously Richard the Lionheart who everyone

479
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,120
 loves and Richard the Lionheart dies and she becomes very fond of John.

480
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,080
 And actually I think the only time that he really showed true courage and desire to defeat

481
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,960
 the opposition is when she was abducted by her grandson, I believe when she was about

482
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
 80.

483
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
 And that was when John was like, no way, you're not abducting my mum.

484
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,680
 And he probably went and defeated him and rescued her because was Richard the Lionheart that

485
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
 good?

486
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
 Yeah.

487
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,160
 I think he was less good than his statue outside the House of Lords deserves.

488
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,640
 I mean, he didn't show any interest in England.

489
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,000
 He just was off on Crusades and then he got captured to his cave where they kept him.

490
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Yeah.

491
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,200
 It's in, it's, it's a 20 minute drive from where my family grew up in Austria.

492
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 Am I right in saying that?

493
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
 Or did they?

494
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 That sounds right.

495
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 Yeah.

496
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
 Yeah.

497
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
 It was down there.

498
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,120
 And they asked for 150,000 silver marks, which was at the time, three times the annual income

499
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
 of England.

500
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,320
 And today that would probably be in the trillion.

501
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 It's about 1.5 trillion something like that, maybe around 2 trillion pounds that they asked.

502
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,400
 So how do you get that money?

503
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,960
 She basically just had to tax the hell out of the entire country, Eleanor of Aquitaine.

504
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 Right.

505
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,240
 So he's a good mother, bad leader maybe.

506
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
 Good mother.

507
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
 Yeah.

508
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,440
 There's a great quote about King John.

509
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,200
 He was a very bad man, more cruel than all the others.

510
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,560
 He lost after beautiful women and because of this, he shamed the high men of the land

511
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,680
 for which reason he was greatly hated.

512
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,640
 Whenever he could, he told lies rather than the truth.

513
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 Yeah.

514
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
 But who wrote this?

515
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
 This wasn't his mate who wrote this, was it?

516
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
 It was, it was possibly not his.

517
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
 And snow.

518
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
 It is.

519
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
 I will, I will agree.

520
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
 I will admit it.

521
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
 It's an anonymous chronicle.

522
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
 Anonymous of betune.

523
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,480
 I didn't realise how fun bitching about historical figures is.

524
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,800
 I'm having so much fun.

525
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,440
 Well, welcome to my world.

526
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,800
 A costume about dead people, so we do for you.

527
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,040
 Well, what do you think then of her second husband?

528
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,600
 Because that, he was more fiery, wasn't he?

529
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
 It was like she went from the monk to the player.

530
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
 Spunk.

531
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
 Spunk.

532
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
 Spunk, that's better.

533
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,280
 Henry II, sort of, almost the great king of English history.

534
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,560
 He had a young, his uncle Henry unimaginatively and he rebelled against him, Richard rebelled

535
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
 against him.

536
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,080
 So he was very bad at managing his sons.

537
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
 Well, but they rebelled because Eleanor was very good at managing her sons, right?

538
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,660
 So Eleanor sort of persuaded all her sons to rebel against him.

539
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,880
 I'm basically in a grump, a sort of 700 year or 800 year-long grump because if he'd managed

540
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,760
 to cement that empire, can you imagine what a great country this has been stretching from

541
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,760
 the Pyrenees to Carlisle?

542
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,720
 Do you think Mbappe could have played for England?

543
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 Exactly.

544
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
 Oh my God.

545
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 Right.

546
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,760
 It'd just been glorious and, you know, that's why I often, you know, it's like Henry V didn't

547
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,480
 wash his goddamn hands, got this entry and died, you know?

548
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,560
 I mean, it's like, sort it out, Harry, England, twat.

549
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
 Wow.

550
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,880
 Born in the water before, we're drinking it, you muppet guy.

551
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,920
 But Harry, for England, that's what.

552
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,480
 But also that reminds, yeah, that reminds, and then that reminds me of the last chance,

553
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,760
 the last best chance we had of this glorious Anglo-French nation, which is the most extraordinary

554
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,000
 thing when Winston Churchill offered a full union of Britain, UK and France.

555
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 In 1940, when the Germans were overrunning France, desperate to keep their more, particularly

556
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,920
 their navy and their colonies in the war, Churchill goes, which is always brilliant when the brakes

557
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,080
 it had bangers on too much out, he goes, Britain and France, full union, bang, one insoluble

558
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
 country, let's do it.

559
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 Let's do it.

560
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 And the French said no.

561
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,280
 Was there any possibility that was going to happen?

562
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,600
 It doesn't feel like it was a likely historical.

563
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,080
 It wasn't likely, but I mean, you know, lots of things are likely.

564
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
 Yeah.

565
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,160
 Getting shot, getting shot in the ear isn't very likely.

566
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,240
 I mean, like the two most consequential presidents of the 20th century, FDR and Reagan, FDR survived

567
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,360
 at about a six foot range.

568
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,400
 He's fired five shots being fired at him, which killed the guy next to him and other

569
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
 people around him.

570
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,240
 Before he'd even put at the height of the depression, before he'd been inaugurated to

571
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,200
 his present elect, Reagan was killed about two months into his first term, no Reagan,

572
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
 no Roosevelt.

573
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
 He was killed.

574
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
 Sorry.

575
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
 Almost killed.

576
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 Almost killed.

577
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,400
 He was like, "Bite a fragment of a, you know, the bullet had been a few millimeters, you

578
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
 know, Reagan would have been killed."

579
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,280
 The two most consequential presidents of the 20th century had absolutely no right to survive,

580
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
 under pure luck.

581
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,760
 That's this mad journey we're on, folks.

582
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 Yeah.

583
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
 It's crazy.

584
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,240
 Something about Eleanor of Aquitaine that is not often said, so Queen of France, Queen

585
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
 of England.

586
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
 Yeah.

587
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
 Not many people have done the double.

588
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
 Not many people.

589
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
 I think the only one.

590
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,320
 Mary Queen of Scots claimed it, controversially, you know, sort of could have claimed it.

591
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 Yeah.

592
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
 All right.

593
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
 How would followers might have claimed it?

594
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 What do we know about her grandmother?

595
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
 Dangerous.

596
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
 Dangerous.

597
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
 Dangerous.

598
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
 Yeah.

599
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,060
 Her grandmother's called Dangerous.

600
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
 That's all we know, right?

601
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
 Is there much?

602
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
 No one knows her real name.

603
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
 That was a nickname, I think.

604
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
 Yeah.

605
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,120
 But no one knows what her real name was.

606
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
 We think it's Amadege.

607
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 Right.

608
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,760
 But yeah, she was known by everyone as dangerous.

609
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,960
 That's so cool.

610
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,080
 Because she was such a...

611
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
 Player.

612
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
 ...Ductrix.

613
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
 Yeah.

614
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,540
 And you know, I didn't know that Eleanor just means other anal.

615
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
 So anal is a name.

616
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
 Sorry.

617
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,960
 No, you said other anal.

618
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
 Yes, no.

619
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,600
 I didn't know that would be Eleanor.

620
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 Right.

621
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,280
 So I think her mum was called anal.

622
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
 But...

623
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
 It's this word you keep saying.

624
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
 Right.

625
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
 So think of how Eleanor's spelled.

626
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
 Yeah.

627
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
 Well, it's alienor.

628
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
 Yeah.

629
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
 It's how it's spelled.

630
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,360
 You knock off the E-L and swap round the A-E. So A-E-N-O-R was a name.

631
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
 Okay.

632
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,280
 And you're called Eleanor if you're the other anal.

633
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,680
 So her mum was called anal, or anal.

634
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,200
 But now we only have Eleanor.

635
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 We only have other anals.

636
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
 Why is the name anal?

637
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
 Well, I think we've...

638
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,420
 We've got to prove that in this podcast.

639
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
 Why are we...

640
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
 Why are we not...

641
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
 Other people called anal.

642
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
 Yeah, she answered this.

643
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
 I guess.

644
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,920
 I didn't know as long on debate as I was expecting.

645
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
 I mean...

646
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
 A-N-O-R...

647
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
 I always thought that when you write it down...

648
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,420
 It's not when you speak it, is it?

649
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,020
 It becomes clear.

650
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,900
 I think it's weird not to wear the courts of love.

651
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
 Oh, okay.

652
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
 Okay.

653
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,460
 Can we just ask Dan if he believes the courts of love existed?

654
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
 Okay.

655
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,460
 Okay.

656
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,100
 So the courts of love was the idea that Eleanor had this special court for women who had

657
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,620
 fallen out with their husbands and they would give them a base and stuff, right?

658
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
 Yeah.

659
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
 It sounds great.

660
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,620
 It's like a problem page.

661
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
 You meant the other dad.

662
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,200
 I was like, "Why do you think I know anything about that?"

663
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,520
 You love resolving people's romantic issues.

664
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
 It's so confused.

665
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
 Yeah.

666
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
 Sorry.

667
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
 Other dad.

668
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
 I just think it's cool that this is an idea.

669
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,600
 I think it was written down by Eleanor's daughter and no one knows if it's made up

670
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
 fantasy or if it really happened.

671
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
 And what was it?

672
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,920
 That a bunch of noble women including Eleanor, her daughter and some other noble women would

673
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,380
 have nights turn up with their romantic problems like, "Hey, I fancy this woman, but there's

674
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,580
 this other woman who fancies me.

675
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,940
 Who should I get with?"

676
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,940
 And they would arbitrate.

677
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
 It's not cool.

678
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
 Have you tried Eleanor?

679
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
 God.

680
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:53,980
 As someone with a very, very formidable mother-in-law, I can imagine that's the kind of stuff that

681
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
 they'd get up to.

682
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,980
 Is that how you were selected a court of love?

683
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
 No.

684
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,240
 I would have never have made it through that process, obviously.

685
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,560
 But no, I think if you're a very impressive, powerful old woman in the Middle Ages, I can

686
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,080
 imagine that you would knock heads together and sort out your love lives in your retinue.

687
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
 Sort out the men.

688
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
 Yeah.

689
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
 Filthy men in the palace.

690
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,960
 But I think the jury's out in general, right?

691
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
 Yeah.

692
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
 I'm not sure.

693
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
 The jury of the courts of love.

694
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
 Well, that is also medieval history.

695
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
 Full stop.

696
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
 Yeah.

697
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
 It's all just jury's out.

698
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
 Really?

699
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
 Oh, annoying.

700
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,900
 The only thing that I can say, certainly, is that Eleanor of Aquatown did not invent

701
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
 the fireplace.

702
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
 Oh, I cannot believe.

703
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,900
 I know that's going to be the ending to this section, and I'm furious.

704
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:44,020
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

705
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
 Okay.

706
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,660
 My fact this week is that when the Romans defeated barbarian tribes, they would often

707
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,780
 send them to Britain as punishment.

708
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,540
 Well, in their faces, because Britain is great.

709
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
 Yeah.

710
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
 Great Britain, exactly.

711
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
 Right.

712
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
 I'm looking at that in case you could say it's wrong.

713
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
 Yeah, you look at me.

714
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
 This is nervous, look.

715
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
 I mean, it's definitely true.

716
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
 We know, for example, there were Syrians.

717
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,560
 They were, "Cool, there's a thing on Hadrian's wall about the Euphrates boatmen that were

718
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,040
 brought up to work on the tine."

719
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 Can you imagine?

720
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
 Oh, my God.

721
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,640
 And it's also true that the Romans did regard Britain as the end of the godhammer.

722
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,800
 Although there were periods when the emperor was in Britain, and it was like the heart

723
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
 of the empire.

724
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,800
 But for long periods, you're probably like, "You're going to get sent to the furthest

725
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
 frontier."

726
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
 I can imagine that.

727
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
 That is true.

728
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,780
 There's a great line that a poet wrote to Hadrian, he says, "I don't want to be Caesar,

729
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,860
 i.e. the emperor, stroll about among the Britons and endure the Scythian winters."

730
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,540
 So he's comparing being among the Britons as winter on the Ukrainian steppe.

731
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,380
 Like that, those are the two worst things you can imagine as a Roman.

732
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,940
 Well, what was it like when they got here?

733
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
 Would it have been nice?

734
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,760
 Well, I mean, it's much as it is now.

735
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,420
 I mean, it's the weather is average.

736
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
 You know, what can I say?

737
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,780
 I think the truth is that only Romans wrote this history, right, the barbarians.

738
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,000
 And so we have no idea really what stuff was like, but you're just saying the Romans hated

739
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 it.

740
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,760
 Caesar was really mean about it himself and said, "The Brits are the most ignorant people

741
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
 I've ever conquered."

742
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,940
 And Cicero said, "They're the ugliest, most stupid race I ever saw."

743
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,320
 And there also seems to be, I was going through the sources of what Romans said about Brits.

744
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,900
 It seems like we were always naked, and that doesn't make sense to me, because it's fricking

745
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
 cold here.

746
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,420
 Well, one Roman source says the reason we were naked is because it was so wet.

747
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,500
 So this one Roman source said, "Most of Britain is marshland, because it's flooded by the

748
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,700
 continual ocean tithes.

749
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,700
 Barbarians usually swim in these swamps or run around with them, submerge the waste."

750
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,340
 Of course, they're practically naked and don't mind the mud, because they're unfamiliar

751
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
 with the use of clothing.

752
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,460
 And actually the sense is that wearing loads of trousers and things, you just end up just

753
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,920
 getting wet and muddy all the time, so let it all hang out.

754
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,100
 I've also been out on a night out in Newcastle in February, and they still don't wear clothes

755
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
 up there.

756
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
 Yeah, no true.

757
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
 I guess they were made of hardier stuff.

758
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,860
 I did swim in the river at the weekend, and I thought I wouldn't be able to wade around

759
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,820
 in this all day, every day, come rain or shine naked, but well done, those early Brits.

760
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,260
 That's just as tough as Amundsen.

761
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:02,220
 So there was a thing called Deportatio in Inselam, which apparently means exile to an island.

762
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,140
 Sometimes you go to Britain, if you've been particularly bad, Tiberias exile to Rhodes,

763
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,900
 which must have been quite nice in comparison, I'd say.

764
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:18,060
 But then Nacatius Dio wrote about 5,000 Sarmatian cavalry who were sent to Britain after the

765
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,380
 Romans had taken them over.

766
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:26,100
 Britain was just a nightmare for the Romans, so unending ulcer and pain and suffering.

767
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,020
 They did not conquer the whole archipelago, right?

768
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,500
 So you've got Ireland and you've got Amundsen, Scotland, for much of the period was unconquered.

769
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,420
 And as a result, you cannot expend the resources required to fully conquer the archipelago,

770
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:41,220
 given its geographical and weather and nightmarish difficulty of doing so.

771
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,140
 But then it's too embarrassing to leave the bit that you have conquered, but then that's

772
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:51,340
 almost untenable because your entire coastline from Cornwall to Carlisle across to Newcastle,

773
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:57,020
 it's just vulnerable to these unending incessant raids by these lunatics.

774
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,380
 And then the north coast exposed to the unconquered Baltics and stuff.

775
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
 So it's a nightmare.

776
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,380
 It's a nightmare.

777
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,860
 When did they, was it like 300s?

778
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,580
 When did they finally bugger off?

779
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,140
 They sort of pack up shop at about 405, 410.

780
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,740
 The biggest concentration of coin hordes in our history is from that period.

781
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
 It's quite interesting.

782
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,580
 So you, you bury your money when you're very, very pessimistic about the immediate future,

783
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
 right?

784
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,580
 Yeah.

785
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,580
 Like, let's get them.

786
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,980
 And so we've just got this massive spike of coin hordes.

787
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
 It's kind of scary.

788
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,980
 Oh really?

789
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
 It's all the Romans burying their money as they do.

790
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,580
 All of these Romans, the villas, just everyone burying it, of course, it also means those

791
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,580
 people didn't come back for it.

792
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,780
 Now, maybe they escaped, but it often, occasionally, would have meant they would have killed and

793
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
 stuff.

794
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,700
 So, so those coin hordes have been buried and no one's come back from.

795
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,180
 So there's just a sense of just society just kind of collapsing in the early 5th century.

796
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,660
 The kind of Romano-British that were left, the sort of Roman elite that were still there.

797
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,980
 We get letters written from the Romans going, "Please, the Romans come and help."

798
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,980
 And it's like the barbarians push us into the sea and the sea pushed us back onto lands

799
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,980
 we have to choose whether to drown or be murdered.

800
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
 Oh God.

801
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,820
 You know, it's like, it is just, it's full, full Armageddon.

802
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
 Yeah.

803
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
 It's crazy.

804
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,220
 So that's the thing that we still seem to have from the barbarians.

805
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,500
 Any time someone says, "Bla, bla, bla," supposedly that has come from the word "barbarian" itself.

806
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,380
 So the word "barbarian" supposedly comes from ancient Greek.

807
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
 And it was taken.

808
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
 That definitely comes from ancient Greek.

809
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,380
 Yeah.

810
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
 Sorry.

811
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
 Sorry.

812
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
 It supposedly comes from the fact that when foreigners were speaking and you didn't understand,

813
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,500
 you would say, "Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba."

814
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
 That's what it sounds like to us.

815
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,460
 And that has evolved to, "Bla, bla, bla," so anytime we say, "Bla, bla, bla," we're

816
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
 barbarians.

817
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,460
 Yeah.

818
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,340
 It's literally anyone who's not Roman and sort of Greek, isn't it?

819
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
 Yeah.

820
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
 And it covers, covers a lot.

821
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,780
 The biggest barbarians of them all, the Goths, probably.

822
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
 The Goths.

823
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
 Okay.

824
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
 Yes.

825
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
 Yeah.

826
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
 Because they were like, sort of stimulated.

827
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
 Umi and all.

828
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
 The ball of Rome.

829
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
 War of Black.

830
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
 Oh yeah.

831
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
 Oh sorry, Anne, war lots of Black.

832
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
 And we'll really miss it all the time.

833
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
 Most of my chemical romance.

834
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
 Yeah.

835
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
 So yeah.

836
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
 Retopping Whitby.

837
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
 Yeah.

838
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,260
 The Goths crossed the Danube, didn't they, in like the three seventies.

839
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,780
 And it seemed to work incredibly well, the Roman policy towards barbarians for hundreds

840
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
 of years.

841
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,500
 So people would knock at the door and say, "Hey, we want to be part of Rome, please."

842
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,980
 They might be fleeing, you know, other forces or whatever, which want to be part of Rome.

843
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,180
 We want to be part of Rome.

844
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,160
 And so they'd be split up, tribes would be split up.

845
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,020
 They'd have to abandon all loyalty to tribal chieftains, give some of their military to

846
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,300
 the Romans.

847
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,820
 And then they were sort of allowed to stay in mind their own business, I think, basically.

848
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,900
 They messed it up a bit when the Goths came over.

849
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,180
 I think they let too many over, then they stopped letting other people.

850
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
 And then basically...

851
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
 All right, Nigel.

852
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,060
 They didn't know enough food to feed them all, so then they got upset.

853
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,020
 And then they threw this dinner party.

854
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,540
 And I think Rome fell because of a cocked up dinner party.

855
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
 Really?

856
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,340
 Because it was this Roman general, Lupi Kinnis, who realized the Goths were coming over, invited

857
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,820
 a couple of their leaders.

858
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,460
 He was getting really drunk with them.

859
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,860
 He told his men to go and kind of besiege the Goths.

860
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,020
 And word got back to the dinner party and it all kind of kicked off.

861
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,460
 And was a bit pissed by then.

862
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,100
 So Lupi Kinnis was probably a bit loose with his instructions and started killing some

863
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,980
 of the people who'd come with them.

864
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,260
 And that was kind of the beginning.

865
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,420
 And then the Goths got together fought against him.

866
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,220
 And that was when the Roman Empire started.

867
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
 It's very...

868
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
 When was that?

869
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,220
 376.

870
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,140
 It's a catastrophic battle at Adrianople, one of the worst defeats in Roman history where

871
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,340
 the Eastern Emperor takes on the Goths.

872
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,740
 The Western Emperor's coming to help him, but he wants the glory for himself, doesn't he?

873
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,180
 So he attacked too early, just got totally annihilated.

874
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,940
 And then the Goths just went on this rampage all the way through the Western Empire.

875
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
 Right.

876
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,180
 I think the only time the Romans really got defeated by barbarians until this period was

877
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,300
 the battle of Teutoburg, which we mentioned, which was all in this forest.

878
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
 And they basically want to take on the Germans.

879
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,740
 So the Germans attacked the Romans, didn't they, in the forest and turned out the Romans

880
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,860
 couldn't hack it basically and were absolutely vanquished.

881
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,540
 So I think they killed 10% of their military and they never tried to go into Germany again,

882
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
 really.

883
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,060
 And that is basically why we have that division today between Latin languages and German languages.

884
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
 Oh, really.

885
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
 Yeah, it's one of my significant defeats here.

886
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
 Yeah.

887
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,780
 Augustus ran around the palace in Rome, shouting, "Varus, give me back my legions!"

888
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,020
 I was like, it was one of the worst defeats.

889
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,940
 But then they did sort of nibble into bits, Joey, but effectively, yeah, that policy of

890
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,380
 just permanent expansion was sort of brought to a halt at that point.

891
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
 Just like that.

892
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,260
 Today, that's why we basically have two big language groups in that moment.

893
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,980
 If you ever want to depress yourself, read about that, it was a torrential rain in a

894
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,020
 dark German wood and the Romans marching along and their guide, their German guide, a guy

895
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,860
 called Arminius, and he sort of disappeared.

896
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,420
 And it turns out he's actually was guiding them in this terrible trap.

897
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,980
 He had been a collaborator, but in fact, he didn't have to be the leader of the resistance.

898
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,740
 And then just ambushed repeatedly, the general commits suicide.

899
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,860
 I mean, it's just this total annihilation of a once mighty force.

900
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,140
 I can't bring myself to get depressed about something that happened 2000 years ago.

901
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:54,020
 There's just enough today, or in the last hundred years, "I let myself get over that,

902
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,060
 and I think you need to work on it."

903
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,220
 What's the big one that wakes you up at night?

904
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,220
 This is very personal.

905
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,580
 I mean, I have an overactive imagination.

906
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,940
 At night, I do kind of read about the first emperor of China, Chinchuan, the most powerful

907
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,820
 man in the world, builds China extraordinary dynasty that's going to last a thousand years.

908
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,780
 Within three years, his children and grandchildren are enslaved and murdered in the streets.

909
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
 Being hand dynasty.

910
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,260
 And you think, "If that can happen to him, it can happen to anybody.

911
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,460
 I'm just, it's just terrifying."

912
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,900
 Are you ready for history here to be toppled and your kids attacked either successive?

913
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
 Indeed.

914
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:32,060
 But I just, the horror of somebody, you know, the peak of their powers, like Cresus in Lidia,

915
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,540
 you know, the rich man in the world, little did he know the fate that was waiting for

916
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
 him.

917
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,860
 "Oh, wait, we can wait for all of us too."

918
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,820
 And so you feel you might be now at the peak of your powers, you're at the most dangerous

919
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,820
 level.

920
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
 That's even sadder.

921
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
 I'll see if this is as good as it gets for me.

922
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,020
 It's a sad indictment of my life.

923
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,460
 Yes, relatively speaking, I'm probably at the peak of my powers.

924
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,420
 And then one day I might, you know, I might be standing there with a kitchen knife defending

925
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
 my house.

926
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
 Yeah.

927
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,700
 So they'll be talking about the fall of Dan Snow's empire a thousand years.

928
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,820
 They'll be talking about sort of the coinhold of the south coast as the Danes pulled up

929
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
 on the beach.

930
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:13,380
 And then Harland comes over the hedge, I'm there, having to defend my family.

931
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,260
 Anyway, that's the kind of thing I worry about.

932
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
 I'm glad you asked.

933
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,820
 It's kind of, I wasn't hoping, I was hoping to share that.

934
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:28,660
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

935
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,940
 And that is my fact.

936
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,220
 My fact this week is that America has a witness protection program for their trees.

937
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,220
 Oh, okay.

938
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,260
 So this is a really cool idea, I think.

939
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,820
 There's a lot of historical spots in America where battles, civil wars would have been

940
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,100
 fought and so on.

941
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,180
 And often when the landscape is done of all the debris of whatever happened there, the

942
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,540
 trees will remain and they're technically witnesses to history.

943
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,700
 In many cases, these trees might have taken bullets in from the wars and the bark would

944
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,460
 have grown over and embedded in these things.

945
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,500
 So they're actually literally holding history inside of them that we don't yet know about.

946
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,660
 And so this was an idea that was set up by the Chief of the National Park Services and

947
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,020
 they decided, let's start designating trees, a witness protection, whereby you can't

948
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,180
 chop them down, you can't harm them, but they're archived in the Congress library and so on.

949
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,180
 And yeah.

950
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,980
 That's just a classic American.

951
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,460
 For something that we have here called a tree protection order, they just have a much cooler

952
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
 name for it.

953
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,460
 Yeah.

954
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,100
 When you said that, I did think they sort of hide them, they move them, they get the

955
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,020
 Gettysburg trees and they move them up to Saratoga, they give them a new name.

956
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,300
 Why is there a bunch of birch trees here, a one sycamore tree in the middle disguised,

957
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,820
 a little swearing of silver coat.

958
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,820
 Yeah.

959
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,460
 This is brother, shut up.

960
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,900
 Are people trying to harm these trees because that's what you expect?

961
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,860
 I think I just think they just want to be nice to trees, don't they?

962
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
 Yeah.

963
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,620
 Well, I guess we do accidentally hurt trees, I guess, you know, we do accidentally chop

964
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
 them down.

965
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,220
 Yeah, I've always accidentally, I don't think anyone's ever accidentally chopped down a

966
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
 tree.

967
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,220
 Yeah.

968
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,220
 But there's a sign up.

969
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,260
 So like the loggers will go around a forest presumably and then there'll be a big sign

970
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,260
 that's like this tree.

971
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,540
 Oh, which we have in this great country as well.

972
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
 Yeah.

973
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
 But we don't have a cool name.

974
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,060
 So you might be chopping down a load of trees and accidentally chop down an important one.

975
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
 Absolutely.

976
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,060
 Is an example of that.

977
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
 Yeah.

978
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,500
 And do we have it in this country for sort of trees that have witnessed great historic

979
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
 events?

980
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
 Well, we should do.

981
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,020
 We did chop down the Royal Oak.

982
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
 Yeah.

983
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,020
 Great story.

984
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,980
 So there was a Royal Oak that Charles, well, when he was then Charles Stewart was hiding

985
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:35,540
 in and the Parliamentarian forces were rummaging around beneath the canopy and he dined out

986
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,020
 in the story for the rest of his life.

987
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,660
 Anyway, he then came down, went over to France and then the Royal Oak became, he became back

988
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,540
 as king, pubs reopened, lots of pubs called the Royal Oak, sort of it became a meme.

989
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,060
 And then in the 19th century, lots of people started visiting and like chopping bits off

990
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,820
 and traipsing across this guy's farm.

991
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:58,020
 And this lunatic farmer's chopped the tree down, zero respect for trees or witnesses

992
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,020
 to history.

993
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
 Trumbling his crops.

994
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
 Trumbling his crops.

995
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:09,580
 But there is now a daughter or a son of that tree, which was sort of recovered and grown.

996
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,380
 And then that one was hit by lightning and now, and Prince Charles, that made him a bit

997
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
 sweaty.

998
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,740
 So he went and planted another tree, so there's now a grandchild.

999
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,820
 The main one's looking a bit, it's like it's been hit by oiling.

1000
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,340
 And then the other one's looking quite verdant and fresh and it's small.

1001
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
 It's about six foot high.

1002
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,140
 So there's three or there's two generations there on that spot.

1003
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,340
 It's in Shropshire.

1004
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,220
 There's the, the Newton apple tree, which is both in the garden of where Newton live.

1005
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,420
 But they also took a cutting and made a, I guess a daughter or a son of, they say it's

1006
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
 a clone.

1007
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,980
 So I don't know if it means it just is the exact tree.

1008
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,180
 I don't know what that terminology is, but it's growing outside on one of the colleges

1009
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
 at Cambridge.

1010
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,820
 And I was reading in Merlin Sheldrake's book.

1011
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:53,300
 He wrote this incredible book about fungi and how it works in the world.

1012
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,500
 And he said that he wanted to grab some of the apples off it because he was interested

1013
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,100
 in making a cider.

1014
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,580
 And the tour guide said, you are not allowed to take apples off this tree.

1015
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,620
 The apples are here specifically for all the tourists to see them fall to the ground so

1016
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,820
 they can experience gravity as it was first discovered.

1017
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,820
 Jesus.

1018
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,140
 You're going to be sitting and waiting a long time on you.

1019
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,100
 It's pretty rare you actually see an apple fall off the tree.

1020
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,460
 Pretty cool though to see an apple fall off the tree.

1021
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,460
 On windy days, the tourism sort of quadrupled.

1022
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,460
 Get together.

1023
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
 Get to the tree.

1024
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,340
 I was, I went to a historically important trees child today on the way to work.

1025
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,340
 Did you?

1026
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,340
 Yeah, yeah.

1027
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:36,300
 And Frank, when she was in her hiding spot, she described a horse chestnut tree that was

1028
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,540
 just outside the building and it was, in 2005 they found it was suffering from a fungal

1029
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,980
 disease and so they decided to take cuttings and they planted it all over the world and

1030
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,340
 there's one of them in hybrid fields just near my house.

1031
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,820
 And you saw that today?

1032
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,820
 Yeah.

1033
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
 That's amazing.

1034
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,220
 Has her one's toppled, hasn't it?

1035
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,220
 I think it has.

1036
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,220
 Yeah.

1037
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,220
 Not long ago.

1038
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,220
 It's not long ago.

1039
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,220
 There's a tree and winds a great part.

1040
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,820
 There's a oak tree and winds a great part that they think has been there since before

1041
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,820
 the Norman Conqueror.

1042
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,820
 So before...

1043
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,820
 Before fireplaces.

1044
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
 Before fireplaces.

1045
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,300
 And so William the Conqueror would have passed that tree.

1046
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,300
 No way.

1047
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,300
 No way.

1048
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,300
 Oh my gosh.

1049
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,300
 You see?

1050
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,900
 The oak trees in churchyards are said to be thousands of years old, right?

1051
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,900
 Yes.

1052
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,860
 I think there's one that's claimed to be over 4,000 years old.

1053
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,860
 They're pretty amazing.

1054
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,020
 I've got a friend who eats you berries, sort of like does while foraging and the thing

1055
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,620
 about you berries is, which people may know, a seed of the you berry, which is inside the

1056
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,380
 berry, is incredibly poisonous.

1057
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,380
 So...

1058
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,380
 So he spits the seed out.

1059
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,380
 Absolutely.

1060
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,580
 So I went on a walk with him once and it was me and another friend and him and you know,

1061
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,140
 my other friend said, "All right, I'll taste it."

1062
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,740
 Put it in his mouth, chewing around for a while and my friend said to him, "And you spat

1063
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,740
 the seed out, right?"

1064
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,740
 Like poor mate.

1065
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,740
 It was like, "No, what do you mean?

1066
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,740
 Spit it out!

1067
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
 Spit it out!"

1068
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
 And it's...

1069
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,740
 Yeah, he just sucks the fruit off.

1070
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,500
 But if you accidentally swallow the seed, you will die.

1071
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,940
 I think we'd like to just say, "Public service to our listeners.

1072
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,580
 Do not eat you berries."

1073
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,580
 Don't.

1074
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,580
 That's a metaphor for so much of life, isn't it?

1075
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,460
 The sweet, sweet outer layer, the poisonous death-giving fruit within.

1076
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,460
 Okay.

1077
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,020
 No more of your weird nightmares.

1078
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,020
 I'm not.

1079
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,020
 I'm just kidding you.

1080
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,020
 I don't know.

1081
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,020
 I want to workshop that.

1082
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,780
 It's interesting that you know about fruit on a U-Tree.

1083
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,980
 I've never thought about that because I just think about U-Trees as a source of longbows.

1084
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,980
 Oh, yeah.

1085
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,980
 Oh, yeah.

1086
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,820
 They're sort of stretchy and squashy in exactly the right parts, basically.

1087
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:34,060
 There was a famous tree, the sycamore tree in Tollpuddle where the Tollpuddle 6 began

1088
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,660
 and started the friendly society of agricultural labours which eventually led to the beginning

1089
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,220
 of trade unionism and stuff like that.

1090
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,580
 The story is very interesting, but I'm not going to go into it because the interesting

1091
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,260
 thing is that Tollpuddle used to be called Tollpiddle.

1092
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,260
 I know.

1093
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,140
 They rebranded, didn't they?

1094
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
 They rebranded.

1095
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,140
 It just sounds so crap.

1096
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,620
 Well, they embarrassed by Tollpiddle.

1097
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,460
 I think, well, we're not exactly sure why they rebranded, but it seems likely.

1098
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:05,620
 So there was a river piddle that went by this town and the Tollpiddle is named after there.

1099
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:11,820
 And then in 1934, locals were still calling it Tollpiddle and a journalist from the Daily

1100
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,420
 Worker went there and said, "Is this Tollpuddle?"

1101
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,260
 And they went, "Oh, nobody around here don't know no such name as Tollpuddle."

1102
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,540
 And it does seem that maybe because it had to be more respectable and because it's such

1103
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:28,420
 an important place for the trade union movement that they didn't think Tollpiddle was a proper

1104
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,420
 name for it.

1105
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,420
 So they remember Tollpuddle?

1106
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
 Maybe.

1107
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,420
 Call it Toll Ocean.

1108
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,100
 Call it Toll Waterfall.

1109
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,700
 One of the theories that Queen Victoria visited and they changed it for her, but we don't

1110
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,700
 really know why.

1111
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,500
 It might have just evolved that way.

1112
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,740
 You can still go and have a picnic underneath the oak tree at the vine, the house in Basingstoke,

1113
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,980
 where Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn used to go when they were lovers.

1114
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,980
 No.

1115
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,980
 It's great.

1116
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,820
 If you want to really condemn a relationship that you have.

1117
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,820
 Well, just think about the tasty fruit with the poisonous...

1118
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,820
 Yeah.

1119
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,820
 Yeah.

1120
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,820
 Does it have, like, Henry Hart?

1121
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,820
 Yeah, it probably does.

1122
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,980
 You know, Catherine crossed out, sharing the cross now.

1123
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,140
 Have you heard of the Sheffield chainsaw massacre?

1124
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,820
 Is that the original title?

1125
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:19,420
 This was very recently in the 2010s and Sheffield Council basically cut down thousands of trees.

1126
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,420
 Oh, of course.

1127
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,420
 It was really controversial, wasn't it?

1128
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,420
 Really controversial.

1129
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,340
 There was, like, a 450-year-old Melbourne oak that was cut down.

1130
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,420
 There was loads of historical trees that were cut down.

1131
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,500
 And basically, the council signed a contract with an infrastructure company saying every

1132
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,140
 time you cut down a tree, we'll give you some money.

1133
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:41,780
 Maybe they're too old, or maybe they're dangerous, or maybe they're digging up the pavement so

1134
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,580
 people might trip over it or something, and then they got another consultancy to submit

1135
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,540
 a report on how many of the trees needed felling, and there was a big mistake in that second

1136
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,540
 report.

1137
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:59,020
 And so they cut down thousands and thousands of these trees in Sheffield for no reason whatsoever.

1138
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,620
 So it is just gross incompetence.

1139
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,620
 I'm afraid so, yeah.

1140
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,100
 Have they planted some trees?

1141
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,140
 Oh, they will replant them, yeah.

1142
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,140
 Wow, that's bad.

1143
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,700
 I hope someone's head was chopped.

1144
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,700
 I was on HMS Victory the other day, and they are looking, they're doing a refurb.

1145
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,700
 It's like Triggers broom.

1146
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,900
 They're basically entirely rebuilding it every so often.

1147
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,900
 Where is it?

1148
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,900
 Where is it?

1149
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,900
 In Portsmouth.

1150
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,900
 And they are using oak from France, because there aren't enough old oak trees.

1151
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,340
 They just go to Sheffield and say, "I hear you've got loads of oak."

1152
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,580
 So I might have to put them in touch.

1153
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,580
 Wow.

1154
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,540
 I mean, but France basically is England before and after.

1155
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,540
 Exactly.

1156
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,420
 And the curator there was like, kind of come up with this real sophistry about it's great

1157
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,020
 that we're taking supplies from the old enemy, I'm like, "Look mate, just like it."

1158
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,020
 We're working together now.

1159
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,020
 Yeah, yeah.

1160
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,020
 It's a shocker.

1161
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,020
 We don't have oaks in this country.

1162
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,020
 Come on, just admit it.

1163
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,940
 But yeah, they used to go around the forests when they're building things out of wood.

1164
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,060
 And they would actually find the trees that were the right shape for the bit that they

1165
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,060
 need to build.

1166
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,460
 So if you wanted something called a knee on a ship, which has a sort of vaguely right

1167
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,180
 angle sort of bracket, you'd just go, "That tree's got some, that one's perfect."

1168
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,060
 And you'd go and sort of scribble it out, and then they'd know to chop down that tree.

1169
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,020
 And then the carter would be like, "We'd have to do much work with that."

1170
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
 Oh, that's great.

1171
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,020
 You could just cut that midsection where it's already at.

1172
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,020
 So clever, isn't it?

1173
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,020
 That's great.

1174
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,740
 So there's always images in the 18th century of people hanging these weird sort of cutouts

1175
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:21,300
 on the side of trees to show the shapes that people make so much sense, doesn't it?

1176
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,860
 Then did they actually, the new forest was just planted for boats, wasn't it?

1177
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,860
 Yeah, a lot of it.

1178
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,860
 Yeah.

1179
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,140
 The new forest, I live there, so I'm going to buy a new forest.

1180
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,140
 Forest does not designate woodland.

1181
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,140
 Oh, right.

1182
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:37,780
 It's just a legal designation of forest, a royal forest, a piece of ground on which

1183
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,980
 certain different types of law apply.

1184
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,980
 Really?

1185
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,140
 And there is obviously forestry in woodland within it, but yeah, lots of it's more in

1186
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,140
 open grounds.

1187
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,300
 And that's true of the word forest.

1188
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
 Yeah.

1189
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,380
 Forest kind of means this has this legal meaning.

1190
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,380
 That's so interesting.

1191
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,380
 It's weird, isn't it?

1192
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,500
 So all the ancient woodland in Britain tragically I think has been cut down, but so a lot of

1193
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,340
 the trees in the new forest now were planted at various times in the national crisis, whether

1194
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,020
 it was by any date for a navy or the Georgians or the Commonwealth war, obviously lots of

1195
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,220
 pines, but to pick props for when they're running out of woods.

1196
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,540
 The new forest does commoning, doesn't it?

1197
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,540
 Oh, yeah, we do, yeah.

1198
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,540
 Do you, are you a commoner?

1199
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,660
 I'm not a commoner, unfortunately, because my house is outside the cattle graze.

1200
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,660
 Oh, sorry.

1201
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:22,940
 Because I'm often told when I roll about on the common, but yes, you can put your animals

1202
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,380
 out, which is what the most of the country used to be like before the enclosures came.

1203
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,380
 Yes.

1204
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,380
 All these hedges and fields.

1205
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,380
 That's the man.

1206
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,980
 Everyone thinks it's beautiful English scenery.

1207
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,500
 That's an industrial farming landscape.

1208
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
 The man enclosed that.

1209
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
 Oh, no, I'm asking you closure.

1210
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
 Forced us off it.

1211
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
 And you had two hedges.

1212
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
 Oh, God, I love hedges.

1213
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
 We don't mind it.

1214
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
 We don't mind it.

1215
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
 That's true.

1216
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,900
 Yeah, so you can still go and you put your pigs out there when the acorns fall.

1217
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,460
 Yes, I think because there are various rights you have and you have to live in the right

1218
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,460
 house.

1219
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,460
 I'm so sorry that you're outside the cattle graze.

1220
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,460
 It's a traumatic episode.

1221
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,460
 This has been today.

1222
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,460
 Yeah, I know.

1223
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,460
 Tucked up.

1224
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,460
 Dan's there with his pigs in his front room going up.

1225
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,460
 No, it's so sad.

1226
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,780
 You've opened up something because my wife is desperate to be a commoner and we have,

1227
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
 we've failed.

1228
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,780
 So anyway.

1229
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,700
 I think we need more because house prices in the New Forest have gone up quite a lot.

1230
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,580
 So quite a lot of people are buying these houses that have the right of commenting, but

1231
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,580
 they are not interested.

1232
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,580
 Yeah, they're not real commoners.

1233
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,580
 They're not real commoners.

1234
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,260
 That's why you're done, right?

1235
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,340
 I'm going to test you on the rights that you'd have as a commoner then.

1236
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,060
 You've got the right pasture, which as you said, is grazing your ponies, cattle, donkeys.

1237
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,980
 You've got the right of sheep, which is grazing your sheep.

1238
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,860
 Are you allowed to pick up sticks or something?

1239
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,860
 Firewoods, yes.

1240
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
 Firewoods, yes.

1241
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,980
 I actually think that they sort of give you firewood because they don't massively want

1242
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,300
 you chopping it down anymore.

1243
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,540
 But yeah, it's called estavas.

1244
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,540
 Yes, that's right.

1245
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,540
 Estavas.

1246
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,540
 Estavas.

1247
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,540
 The right of turboree.

1248
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,540
 Yes, what's that?

1249
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,540
 Is that turboree?

1250
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,540
 It's like the fish.

1251
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:48,380
 The right of catching turboree, it's the right of cutting turfs for fuel.

1252
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,380
 Yes, it's a turf.

1253
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,380
 Yes.

1254
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,220
 Not a good idea nowadays, but yeah.

1255
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,340
 No, you're not supposed to do that anymore, actually.

1256
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,660
 And actually, the right of turning your pigs out is called mast.

1257
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,980
 Is that a mast?

1258
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,180
 Yeah, apparently turning pigs out to...

1259
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,180
 Yeah, it's funny.

1260
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,100
 At that time of year, there's just loads of pigs all over the roads and you've got to

1261
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
 have a swat.

1262
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,100
 Really?

1263
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,100
 Yeah, when the acorns fall.

1264
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,940
 What I didn't get is, yeah, when the acorns fall, the pigs are supposed to eat them because

1265
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,020
 they're poisonous to other stuff.

1266
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,940
 So are the pigs rushing around as a horse goes towards an acorn and pigs bit him underneath

1267
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
 them?

1268
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,340
 Like, "Y'all mate, if I try and eat you, Barry," he's like, "Raps it out of my

1269
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,340
 hashing."

1270
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:29,740
 OK, that's it.

1271
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,860
 That is all of our facts.

1272
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,220
 Thank you so much for listening.

1273
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,260

 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on various social media accounts.

1275
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,260

00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,940
 And Dan.

 That's just who he is.

1281
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,020
 Shout out to the History Guy.

1282
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,580
 No, on Twitter, on various platforms.

1283
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,580
 Nice.

1284
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,100
 And Anna, to get us as a group.

1291
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,860
 Most importantly of all, check out all of Dan's stuff.

1292
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,060
 The History Hit channel, as well as Dan Snow's History Hit show.

1293
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,060
 We've been on it.

1294
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,140
 I did an episode with Dan all about mysteries of history.

1295
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,220
 You, James and Anna, you did a sporting episode recently.

1296
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,220
 Yeah, we did.

1297
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220
 Which is better than Dan's.

1298
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,220
 So that one hurts.

1299
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,900
 That's what I heard from Dan himself.

1300
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,780
 So not true.

1301
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,780
 Not true.

1302
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,780
 He didn't say that.

1303
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,780
 He didn't say that.

1304
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,340
 But yeah, do check that out.

1305
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,300
 It's all available wherever you get your podcasts.

1306
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,780
 We will be back again next week.

1307
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
 We'll see you then.

1308
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,780
 Goodbye.

1309
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,860
 Welcome to Quite a Good Sport, the very first episode.

1310
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,780
 So what are we talking about today?

1311
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:59,500
 Well, today we're going to talk about the great spot of rowing and we're going to speak to

1312
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:06,060
 Imogen Grant and Eve Stewart, who are two of our Team GB medal hopefuls for Paris.

1313
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,700
 I thought rowing was a stupid sport.

1314
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,700
 It's cold.

1315
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,700
 It's wet.

1316
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
 You have to get up really early.

1317
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,780
 You get blisters on your hands and you can't see where you're going.

1318
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,840
 We are going to be chucking in a few interesting facts that we've learned along the way.

1319
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:23,620
 Because Adolf Hitler was seething from the stands in the despotic way that he does.

1320
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,980
 Oh, Moustache twitching away.

1321
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,700
 And we will be trying our hand on the River Thames to see which of you and I is going

1322
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,100
 to be the greatest rower.

1323
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,500
 OK, we're ready to do the first time trial.

1324
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,800
 Ready, go.

1325
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,780
 This is a pretty steady start from Anna.

1326
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,260
 Now she's really getting her rhythm.

1327
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,740
 We're actually going at a proper pace.

1328
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:50,240
 We're approaching the finish line, the red boy.

1329
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,860
 Who will be victorious?

1330
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,540
 The only way to find out is to listen to episode one of Quite a Good Sport.

1331
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,580
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1332
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,640
 you
