00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.680
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.760
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.820
 My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.700
 and once again we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.420
 and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.600
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Great Wall of China is held together by Sticky Rice.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 Right.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.900
 There's not sure. It's true. How's that possible?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.440
 Well, it's the mortar that holds the bricks together.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.740
 It must be extremely overcooks, because I don't think that's good Sticky Rice if it's like cement.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.500
 Well, what they found is that they've got this kind of mortar, which is half organic and half inorganic,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.560
 and the organic compounds in it is something called Amelou Pectin, which is like a starchy stuff

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.400
 that you would get if you cooked potatoes or rice or whatever.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.440
 And they're pretty certain that they got that through cooking Sticky Rice and then extracting this stach

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.000
 and then just mixing it with lime and making the mortar.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 Wow. That's really cool.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.200
 I've always thought food would make great cement, because have you ever left sort of the remnants of a wheat-a-bix bowl?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 Yeah, wheat-a-bix.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 Why are we not using wheat-a-bix to hold buildings together?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800
 You're right. You leave it five minutes. You cannot wash that up now.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 It's done. You might as well throw away the bowls.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 That is why we're out of croquerie in the office.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 It's very cool. So how much of the Great Wall was used?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 So the Great Wall started being built 2,200 years ago, and this mortar came in 1,500 years ago.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.300
 And so it's not all of the wall, but the main bit, which was built by the Ming Dynasty,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.800
 the bit that you kind of see in the photos, that has Sticky Rice in it.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 That's all the fancy towers and really good bits of wall.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 It's not the like earth and mountains.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Yeah, which aren't even really the Great Wall of China, are they?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 I had them described as the Qi Wall, which is about the Qi Wall, which is quite nice.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 But it was built in 500 BC, and it's mostly just earth.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 But it was really quite effective, because if you're an infantry army trying to cross that,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.800
 you can cross it, but A, it'll take loads of time and B, you'll probably have to leave some supplies behind, and it's just a pain.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800
 Yeah, the thing is, that is great, and it's a wall, and it's in China.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 So I think we should call that the Great Wall of China, as well.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 Yeah, and that was by the Emperor who kind of created China, modern day China, I guess,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 who was credible character.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 Emperor Qi, Emperor Qi.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800
 And he was a Terracotta warrior's guy.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.800
 He was amazing when you look at what he did in one lifetime.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.800
 I mean, he killed a lot of people in the process, but it's...

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 He shouldn't hold that against him.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 He had an army of 1.5 million men.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 Wow.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.800
 Imagine if the Grand Old Duke of York had an army of 1.5 million men.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 The hill would be full.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800
 It would be very, very hard.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800
 So we're going to go back down.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 Do you know that they've now, they've trying to combat the thing of everyone going on the wall and grafiting it?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 And so they've actually created a section that you can legally grafiting now on the Great Wall of China.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 Yeah, there's a graffiti corner.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 That seems a crazy idea.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 I saw that.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800
 I can't quite believe it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800
 It seems very...

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800
 But it does take the fun out of graffiti, though.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 Yeah, when it's allowed.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 Hey, guys.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 Welcome to the cool graffiti area where you can draw what you like on the wall.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.800
 So, you know, last week, I think I mentioned that they've just realised there are eight times as many trees as we thought they were on Earth.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800
 Which, if it was edited out, that's a fact for this week's podcast.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
 There are eight times as many trees as we thought they were.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 We've just miscounted.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.800
 So, in the same way, they recently measured the Great Wall of China, and it's like three times longer than we thought it was.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 We're all the trees behind it.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800
 It's not hiding.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 But how did we get that wrong?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.800
 So, we thought it was 9,000 kilometres, and then it turns out they've just announced it's 21,000.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 So cool. That's half way round the Earth.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800
 That's half the circumference of the Earth.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.800
 Wow.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 If stretched out.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.800
 And it's all sorts of different bits folded in and itself and so on, but yeah.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 Yeah, it's lots of different walls, isn't it? It's not actually one proper wall.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800
 Depending on whether you go with James, it's all definitely the Great Wall of China theory.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.800
 Every single wall in China, which I consider to be great.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.800
 Apparently, so I've been to the Great Wall of China.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 Have you?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 Yeah.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 It's all by.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 Have you?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 Yeah.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 I was reading.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 Actually, I wasn't reading.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 I saw this in a Carl Pilkington idiot abroad documentary episode where he visited there and he was reading a little pamphlet in it,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 where it said, basically, that section most people go to has been renovated so much that it's basically a whole new wall.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 It's just it's all new bricks.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 So since 1983, that's what people are visiting a sort of 1983 version of the Great Wall of China.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800
 Yeah.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800
 Which is probably safer because so many people are visiting it.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 I read somewhere saying it's really ironic that considering it was designed to keep people out,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 it's now what are trying as big as tourist attractions, attracts millions of people to it every year.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 Yeah.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 Was it definitely to keep people out?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 I remember once reading that it was a place to collect tax or something.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 Yeah, not sure.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 Do you know what you're thinking of?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 What?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 The great hedge of India.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 Am I?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 Yeah.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 Yeah.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 So there's India.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 There's a huge hedge that runs along and it was a borderline to collect tax on.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 And so you'd get to the hedge and there might be someone patrolling the hedge and they would collect tax, something like that.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 Did they call the tax the hedge fund?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
 Oh, nice.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 Yeah.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.800
 Do you guys know who the first person to be filmed on the Great Wall of China was?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 Just in Bieber.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 No.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 For a movie, sorry, I should say.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 Who's closer?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 James, James.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 Yes.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800
 Steven Segal.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.800
 It's so close.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 In name.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 Steven Segal.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 No, so.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 Okay.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 Steve Cougan.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800
 What?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 Steve Cougan was the first ever person to be filmed.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 He made a movie called Around the World in 80 Days.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 It was the Jules Verne movie.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 He's the first person to be filmed in it for a movie.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 They got access to it for the first time ever.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 It had never been featured in a film before.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 Like it had never been performed on it.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 Well, if it had been featured, it was just purely a shot as opposed to someone walking

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 and doing dialogue on it.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 Oh, it would have been a set or something.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 Exactly.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 Yeah.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 So on the Great Wall of China, you know the whole thing about whether you can see it from space or not.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 Yeah.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:25.800
 So in 2003, China sent its first astronaut, or as they call it, "tyco-nought," because "tyco" is Chinese for space.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800
 They sent the first astronaut up.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800
 Yang Liwei.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800
 And he said, "Guys, I can't see it."

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800
 It's never on panic.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.800
 And eventually they decided you could see it.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.800
 But actually, you can only see it from a really low orbit when the weather's good.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800
 And if you've got a powerful telephoto lens.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 They should paint it pink.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.800
 Yeah, they should do something different.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 Because it's quite, they do really care about it.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.800
 Every single Chinese astronaut that has been up has been given the role of looking for the Great Wall of China

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800
 and has failed to fight.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.800
 So the photos that they did get, the astronaut who took the photos where you could see it.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.800
 If you looked really closely and sort of blew it up quite to a big photo.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.800
 He said he just didn't know if it was in the photo at the time when he took it.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 So it was by coincidence that he managed to get it.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.800
 And in 2006, someone went on television in China associated with their space program.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.800
 And this is what he said.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.800
 He said, "We need to carry out more tests and improve astronaut training."

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 So that's like still their main focus.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
 No, we don't want to ride it off just yet.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 But do you know when it dates back to?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 Back to before.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800
 Astronauts.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800
 Well, the earliest I found is Ripley, I believe it or not, fame.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.800
 In 1932, he said that it's the mightiest work of man.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.800
 It was the only one that would be visible to the human eye from the moon, which it definitely isn't.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.800
 But there was a writer in 1754 called William Stukeley, who said, and this was about Hadrian's Wall,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800
 he said it's a mighty wall of four school miles in length,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.800
 which makes a considerable figure on the terrestrial globe and may be discerned at the moon.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800
 Wow.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.800
 And that was about Hadrian's Wall.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800
 I know.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.800
 But you can barely see from like standing on tibals.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.800
 I wonder if Helen Sharman had a look down to see if she could see Hadrian's Wall.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 Yeah.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800
 And if not, I think we need to send some more brits up to see if we can see it or not.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800
 Any more training.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
 Tim Peaks going up.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
 We could give him a special mission to do it.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800
 That's what I really like, by the way.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.800
 The first mention that you could see it from the moon was the Ripley's Believe in a Notbook.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.800
 And I didn't realize that Ripley's Believe in a Not was an actual question.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 And that's what it feels like.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800
 Okay, so not.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800
 I don't believe it.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800
 It feels like it's an actual.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.800
 God, is that what the whole, like 50% of that book we're saying is false.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
 Maybe we were all reading it wrong, yeah.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.800
 So I was looking at a sticky rice because I thought it's surely more interesting,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800
 the Great Wall of China.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.800
 So every year in Japan, they eat these sticky rice cakes.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.800
 And the health departments had to advise people that before they eat the cakes,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.800
 they need to cut them into small pieces, chew them slowly and learn how to perform basic first aid before indulging.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.800
 Because so many people keep choking on them.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800
 Wow.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800
 I think maybe it's the same substance that they used to build the Great Wall.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.800
 Because it's a big, but there's an epidemic.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.800
 Maybe it's trying up and lodging in their throat, like a concrete ball.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800
 Yeah.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.800
 You can't swallow it down.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800
 Did you know that an Italian bride recently was rushed to hospital

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.800
 because people were sharing her with rice as she was exiting the church.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.800
 And she got a bit of rice stuck in her ear.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.800
 And had to be hurried to the ER.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800
 She was okay.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.800
 And it was like a common myth that if you throw rice on the ground, then pigeon leaks it.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.800
 Pigeons explode, but it's not true.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800
 Ah!

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800
 Have we ever tested it?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800
 No, I don't really want to do that experiment.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.800
 It's just on the off chance that Snopes is wrong on this one.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800
 Yeah.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800
 We pause the podcast right now.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800
 It came back 20 minutes later.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 Oh my god, there it is.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 Plotting guts everywhere.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 The pulga square is a mess.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.800
 Should we move on soon to our next fact?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800
 Yeah, I have one more thing on the Great Wall.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800
 Yeah.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 Just going along the Steve Cougan line.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800
 Yeah.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.800
 The first man we think to walk the complete Great Wall of China was an American.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 It was an American eventually called William Edgar Gail.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800
 And he was a really incredible guy.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.800
 And he trekked across Africa and he traveled along the Yangtze River.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.800
 He did all these amazing expeditions.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.800
 And no one's heard of him these days.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.800
 He was late 19th century.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 And when he died, he left $3,000 to commission a biography of himself.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.800
 He wrote, "My life has been unusual and the story of it is likely to benefit young people."

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.800
 Which is very, very confident.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.800
 And he wrote the first ever book in the West about the Great Wall of China.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.800
 And he said he wanted it to be so good that any historians and future writing about it

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.800
 would find little to write about unless he pirated our notes.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800
 Just one more thing about rice.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.800
 Have you guys heard of Daki Gokuchi?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800
 And I don't know if that's how you pronounce it.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 Almost certainly not.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.800
 But in Japan, this was a tradition.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.800
 In 2008, Sonny became a craze where you get a rice filled bag

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800
 and you draw babies face on it.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.800
 If you've got a friend, you've had a baby.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.800
 And you present that to them as a gift.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 And so you try to draw the baby that they've had.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 Like an image of it on a bag of rice.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800
 And that's your baby warming present.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 That's weird, isn't it?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.800
 What purpose is that service?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.800
 Is it like in those sitcoms where they give a child like a bag of flour

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800
 to look after as if it was a baby?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 I had that at my school.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800
 Did you?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800
 Yeah, I went to a really backward school.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800
 It strikes me sometimes when I think,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 "Yeah, we had to care for a flower baby in year seven."

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800
 Yeah, so do you think maybe it's the same kind of thing

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.800
 if you look after the rice and don't accidentally boil it?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.800
 That means you're okay for looking after babies.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800
 Or if you must accidentally boil one of these two things

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800
 that you've just got, make sure it's the rice.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800
 That's very confusing though, because you think,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800
 "Well, I'll have that rice for my supper."

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800
 Oh no!

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.800
 Or it's like, "Well, I need some mortar to put up this brick wall."

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.800
 Oh no!

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.800
 Okay, time for fact number two.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.800
 My fact is that the world's largest single-celled organism

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800
 can get up to 12 inches long.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800
 That's great.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 That's incredible.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800
 What is it?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.800
 It's an algae or an algae.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800
 It's called caliper taxifulla.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 And it's a single cell.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800
 And yet it gets up to a foot long.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800
 And it has all these different things in it.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800
 So it looks like a plant.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.800
 It has these fronds, which look like leaves.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800
 And then it's got little root-like bits as well,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800
 which hold it in place.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800
 But it is one cell.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800
 Wow.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800
 It's so cool.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 Single-celled organisms, I've realised,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800
 are much more complicate.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800
 It can be much more complicated and interesting

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800
 than you would imagine.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800
 There's one that's recently been discovered

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800
 that has kind of what they think of eyes, isn't it?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 Which take up about a third of its body.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800
 And it is just one cell.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800
 It's talking about one or weeds.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800
 I sure am.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 Yeah.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800
 What are they called?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800
 Oceloids.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 Oceloids.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.800
 I like things.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.800
 Little black dots inside the single-celled organism.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.800
 And it seems like they appropriate bacteria

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800
 to be used as their eye.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800
 Yeah.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
 Wow.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.800
 Yeah, so the cornea, what you would count as a cornea,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800
 is actually a little bacterium.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.800
 And the retinob, which what you would think is similar

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800
 to a human retina, is actually another bacterium.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800
 That's amazing.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800
 I know.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.800
 But then how they become a multi-cellular organism.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 That's a good point.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800
 But this was discovered, wasn't it, more than a hundred years ago,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800
 by this guy who saw it under the microscope and said,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 "Look, this thing has eyes."

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 And no one believed him.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.800
 And so it was one of those things that we just assumed

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800
 it didn't have eyes for another hundred and twenty years.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800
 Do you think he went, "Believe it or not?"

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800
 This thing has eyes.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.800
 Okay, Frank, we don't believe it.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800
 I saw a fish today with four eyes.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800
 Did you?

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 What?

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800
 Yeah, it's called the four-eye fish.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.800
 And it has four eyes.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800
 Is this a beginning of a joke?

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800
 No.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.800
 Well, aren't you this morning?

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.800
 It was a query.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800
 I went to the Horniman Museum.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.800
 And which has got an aquarium in it.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.800
 And yeah, they have one of those things.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800
 There's a four eye fish.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 So I think the point is they have kind of two eyes,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800
 like a normal fish.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.800
 And the top of one eye is got certain lens.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.800
 And the bottom has a certain lens.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 So they can see outside the water as well as inside the water.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800
 Is that right?

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800
 This is insane.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800
 So cool.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800
 And the joke you were thinking of was I saw a fish with no eyes.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800
 A fish.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800
 Yes.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 That's what I thought you were screwing out there.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 But you weren't.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 It was just an interesting fact.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 What do you call a fish with four eyes?

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800
 A fish.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.800
 Actually, sorry, there's another amazing single-side organism

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.800
 which does a thing that's kind of similar to that.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.800
 And this is called the xenophio-freeze,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.800
 which I think was the biggest known single-side organism

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800
 before yours came along.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.800
 Xenophio-4 means bearer of foreign objects.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.800
 And that's because it sort of constructs its own body out of stuff

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800
 that's lying around.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.800
 So it kind of picks up bits of like dirt and dust

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800
 and material off the ground and bacteria.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
 Like a Mr. Potato Head.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.800
 It's exactly like a Mr. Potato Head.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 Yes.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.800
 Sorry, I just was talking about Mr. Potato Head just a little fact about that.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.800
 When Mr. Potato Head came out, it was during rationing in America

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 and no one wanted to advertise it.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800
 None of the advertisers would advertise it

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.800
 because they thought it would encourage children to play with their food.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 And so until the rationing stopped,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.800
 they couldn't really advertise it anywhere.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.800
 Or it could encourage children to eat plastic,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 which is not advisable.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800
 It had a face on it.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800
 I thought it was a baby.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800
 Sorry, Dan.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.800
 No, I was just going to say so there's a DIY living thing

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.800
 that builds itself as it goes.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.800
 Well, it gives itself extensions.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.800
 It kind of builds a house for itself.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.800
 But in the deep sea,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.800
 there are these Xenophio-4s.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.800
 There are up to 2,000 every 100 square meters on the sea bed.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 Wow.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 They're the kings down there.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800
 Yeah.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 The kings really once held organisms of the world.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.800
 They weigh out number multisallied organisms, don't they?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.800
 There are many more of them than there are of us.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800
 Yeah.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800
 So we're animals.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 And the very top level of taxonomy is domain.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 I think everyone else learned this in your 9 biology,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 and I snooze that lesson.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 But I don't know.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 There are three domains.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.800
 And every living thing that you know of fits into one.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 So animals, plants, fungi, everything you think of as an animal fits into one.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.800
 And then there are two whole different domains for just these bacteria, basically.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800
 Yeah.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.800
 Well, everyone else was learning that at school.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.800
 Anna was sweeping up flour from the flour.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.800
 Just on the idea of, so single-cell organisms,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.800
 when I think of that, I just think of the earliest of life.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.800
 That's how we all came about, right?

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.800
 So I was looking into early life and how we came about generally.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.800
 And I read about a thing that has been observed in deep space.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.800
 750 light years away from Earth.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.800
 It's a proto-star.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.800
 It's like a sun-like star shooting out these huge bullets of water.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.800
 And they actually think that that's how water is getting seeded around the universe

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800
 from these kind of stars.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 These huge, like, huge amounts of water.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.800
 And so they say that if we picture these jets as giant hoses,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.800
 and the water droplets as bullets,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.800
 the amount of shooting out equals 100 million times the water flowing through the Amazon river every second.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800
 Wow.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 And the velocities are reaching 200,000 kilometers per hour.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.800
 It's an 80 times faster than bullets flying out of a machine gun.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800
 And they've been observing this.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 These huge batches of water coming out of these stars.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.800
 And because I did read a long time ago,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.800
 there was a theory that maybe the way that Earth got water was from one of these

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800
 a huge, just whatever, bullet of water coming towards us.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800
 Wow.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800
 I guess.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.800
 Well, do they think maybe comets?

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800
 Because comets often have loads of ice on them.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.800
 I think an enormous comet might have provided a lot of...

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 I can't imagine that much water coming just from comets, though.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 It's controversial, I think.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800
 Yeah.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 Well, this is just a...

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.800
 This is quite a new report that's come out

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.800
 where they've observed a proto-star shooting out...

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.800
 A super-soaker, 59 million.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800
 That's way in the universe.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.800
 That's so amazing.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800
 Yeah, I know.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800
 I couldn't believe it.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.800
 But you think it's not fully a thing.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 I haven't read that.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800
 That's right.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.800
 But some people think that water came from space.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 Some people think it managed to be made on Earth.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.800
 But it might well be true for all I know.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.800
 Speaking of early life forms, do you guys know about the boring billion?

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.800
 No.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.800
 The boring billion is a period of time that scientists use to describe

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.800
 between 1.8 billion and 800 million years ago,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.800
 when life just stopped evolving completely

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 and the whole of Earth, the only life on Earth, was one huge layer of slime.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800
 That is so good.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.800
 For a billion years, the boring billion.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 Was it like slime mold kind of mebe kind of stuff?

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.800
 It was what's called a bacterial sheet.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800
 Like a mat kind of thing.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.800
 It was like a microbial mat.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.800
 Do you still get microbial mats today?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.800
 There's a huge patch of them, the size of grease, I think.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.800
 Yeah, there's one layer of microbial mats on the bottom of the ocean.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.800
 It's just off Venezuela and it's the size of grease

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800
 and it can be up to 7 centimeters thick as in bottom to top.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.800
 And it's just this incredible web of strands and filaments

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.800
 and microbes living in these.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 They look like little cowpats on the ocean floor.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 And there's an area at the size of grease under sea, which is these things.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800
 As excited as Andy is getting about this,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 I think he would have loved it in the boring billion.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.800
 You should have been living in that time.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.800
 I would have caught it in the brilliant billion.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.800
 I randomly was flicking through the other day a book by Michael Palin.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.800
 On his trip to Brazil and the book's called Brazil.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.800
 And he was talking to a guy in the Amazon about deforestation

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.800
 and so on and when they're actually just chopping down stuff.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.800
 And this guy said that the term that they all refer to

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.800
 when they talk about a size of area that they're deforesting in the Amazon.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.800
 They call it one Belgium or six Belgium.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800
 Oh, did I?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800
 Yeah, they use Belgium as the...

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800
 We would say Wales, I think.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.800
 Like the size of Wales is chopped down every two minutes or so.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800
 Right.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.800
 Yeah, so they seem to like, they'll say to each other.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.800
 So they kind of use it as an unofficial, it's really good.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800
 You note of measurement.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800
 Yeah.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800
 Something about bacteria.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.800
 So the largest bacterium is called Theomargarita Namibiancis.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.800
 That's actually quite a pretty name.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.800
 It sounds like a parent, it's actually named a child.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.800
 It is. I tried to look up if there was anyone called Theomargarita in the world.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.800
 There was one guy, he's a football agent or he signed up to be a football agent.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.800
 But there's not really much about him.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800
 He didn't seem that interesting.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.800
 But yeah, this is the biggest bacteria in the world.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.800
 It's big enough to be seen with a naked eye.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.800
 And its volume is three million times more than the average bacterium.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.800
 And I thought that if you had the average human,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.800
 and it was someone who was three million times bigger than that,

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.800
 it would be about ten times as large as the world's biggest tree.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 Wow.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800
 It would be human that size.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 Wow.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.800
 Yeah, you don't want to be bullied by that guy.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800
 No.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:53.800
 These things are so cool. So I think it's the thickness of seven pages in a book.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800
 If you hold those together, that's the width.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.800
 That's how long they get.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 So you can see them.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.800
 Another thing about them is that these bacteria,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.800
 the world's largest bacteria,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.800
 is the same size as the world's smallest snail.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.800
 Oh, do they hang out?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.800
 Well, that's called Acmella Nanna.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.800
 And it was only described this month, November 2015.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.800
 It was really you, that snail, and you're like,

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.800
 "Oh, I feel like I'm just coming down with a bit of a bug."

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.800
 That's actually the same size as me.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.800
 Cool.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.800
 And those two are both slightly larger than the very smallest plant in the world,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.800
 which is a duckweed, and it gets just 0.6 millimeters.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800
 That's an individual plant.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800
 Oh, wow.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800
 It's tiny.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.800
 So I like to imagine all three of them having a little patience.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800
 This is just one thing I like about, because you mentioned it,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.800
 giving things their scientific names, the binomial naming system.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 It just struck me the other day, when I read it in a book,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.800
 that it's one of the only, maybe the only, universal bit of language.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.800
 So wherever you go in the world, you're not going to be able to communicate with anyone,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.800
 who speaks language you don't, unless you need to describe a certain type of plant

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.800
 or a mole or something.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.800
 And then you just say, you know, puffinous, puffinous.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.800
 And they're going to know exactly what you mean.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800
 They're a zoologist.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.800
 I wonder about computer code, is it a bit similar to that, maybe?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800
 Yeah.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.800
 The other thing is, apparently, there's one word which is understood by everyone on Earth,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.800
 and that's "Huh?"

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.800
 There was a paper earlier this year saying that this word is "Everyone knows what that means."

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800
 "Huh?"

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.800
 Do you have to make that ridiculous face with it?

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.800
 But you just made it.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800
 I wish everyone could see.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 Huh?

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.800
 I started researching single-celled organisms,

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.800
 and then quickly stopped because I didn't understand anything about it.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.800
 So I looked at the rest of the fact, which is that the single-cell organism can be up to 12-inch as long.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800
 If you're going to name stuff that's 12-inch as long down,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.800
 I don't know if we want to put out this podcast.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.800
 Are you about to name other stuff that's 12-inch as long?

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800
 Yeah.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800
 Oh, God.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.800
 So I started looking into things that are 12-inch as long.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.800
 One of the things is that two years ago, Subway got sued,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.800
 because customers were complaining that their 12-inch foot-long sandwiches

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800
 weren't in fact 12-inch foot-longs.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800
 Wow.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.800
 And so you could bring in your single-celled organism to measure it again.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800
 Exactly.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.800
 And someone actually, there was a big-class action lawsuit,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.800
 and they were representing customers who'd purchased the six-inch foot-long sandwich.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.800
 There's any time between January the 1st, 2003, and October the 2nd, 2015.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.800
 So if anyone felt like they were juped and had a bit of proof they could come forward and say,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.800
 "Actually, six years ago, I was pretty sure that was a bit shorter than a foot-long."

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.800
 That was like 11.9 inches.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800
 And they had to pay up.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.800
 So Subway actually paid up with a settlement of $525,000 American.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.800
 And now they have to measure all of their bread.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800
 Okay.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.800
 But they could have just claimed that, oh, sorry.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.800
 When we said foot-long, we just meant as long as Michael's foot.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800
 It was Michael's foot.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.800
 Oh, Michael's foot was much bigger than that.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.800
 He was five or six feet, actually, so.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.800
 Could I give a really interesting theory, I think, about single-celled organisms that I read today?

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800
 It might be quite random.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800
 I only read it in this one study.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 Was it a Ripley's believe it or not?

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800
 It sure was.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800
 Was it in the second half of the book?

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.800
 So it's quite a mystery why animals happened.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 Why multi-celled organisms happened.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800
 What was it that made single-cells go to multi-cells?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800
 There are various theories.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.800
 I like this theory, which is that is because we're able to eat ourselves.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 So, so cells need organisms need food to survive, right?

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.800
 So they eat other cells, other things that are made of cells.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.800
 So when cells were all clustered together, if they got hungry, they could just eat their cell next to them.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800
 That they were attached to.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800
 So that meant they never got hungry.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 But the cells that were single-celled organisms couldn't fight.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.800
 If they got hungry and there wasn't another single-cell nearby, then they just starve to death.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.800
 And so suddenly it evolved that it's better to be, you know, multi-celled organisms happened.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.800
 Because you could just eat the other bits of yourself.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 So you can digest yourself easily without having to go out looking for food.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.800
 And that's why they came into being in Sark, the island of Sark.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.800
 There is a jail with a single-cell.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.800
 You can fit two prisoners in it at a push.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800
 And they have to be a meba.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.800
 Do you want to know a cool thing about what I think is the oldest animal on earth?

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.800
 So any guesses?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800
 It's a tortoise.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800
 Okay.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.800
 It was something ocean-based, right?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800
 So that's...

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800
 Yeah, like coral.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800
 Bruce Forsyth.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800
 I think.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 No, Dan's right on this one.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800
 Oh, Dan.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.800
 So sponges are technically animals, which never fails to surprise me.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800
 They are.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800
 In the animal kingdom.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.800
 And they look just like sponges.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.800
 But there are these giant barrel sponges, which can be up to two and a half meters tall,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.800
 and that much across as well, single animals.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.800
 And some of those, they think, could be up to 2,400 years old.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800
 Yeah.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.800
 Which outstrips anything else.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.800
 So you know that you couldn't kill a sponge with your bare hands?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800
 I disagree.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.800
 Because if you kind of try and rip it apart or pull it or anything like that, it will just regrow.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 So how can they be killed?

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800
 Probably.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.800
 Let's say with fire.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.800
 I thought we were actually bringing them close to extinction because back in the day,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.800
 before we used toilet paper, people used sponges.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.800
 So we were sort of bottom wiping them to death, basically, as a species.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.800
 As in bacteria would then get into the ecosystem.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800
 Is that right?

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800
 I don't know.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.800
 That implies that we didn't take it off to wipe our asses.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800
 We just sat on a huge lot of sponge on the ocean.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.800
 Or you took it out and put it back.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800
 Put it back in.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.800
 Okay, reattached it.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.800
 In the old days, you had to swim to the bottom of the sea to wipe your bum.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.800
 It was so well for the people living next to the Marianas trench.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.800
 They called it the Marianas trench.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.800
 I've got quite a cool thing on Amoeba, actually, just that.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.800
 So there's an Amoeba called the Chaos Amoeba, which I think is quite cool.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.800
 Or it's a chaos as a genus of Amoeba.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.800
 And it was named by Leneas.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.800
 And I think it was the first Amoeba to be seen and named.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.800
 And then this reminded me, so Leneas obviously was responsible for seeing a lot of these little species

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800
 and naming them for the first time.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 And I was reading a book the other day by Colin Tudge, who's amazing, and you should all read his books.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.800
 That Leneas, when he went on botanical expeditions, would have a musical band leading the way

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.800
 and would make everyone dress in really wacky costumes.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.800
 Did everyone know that?

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.800
 And wherever they found the new species, he would like ring a bell or something like that,

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.800
 or play a two to horn or something.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.800
 See, I know you think the boring billion sounds fun, but I think that sounds like a more fun day out.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.800
 We're all working out wherein the history we're going to go with our type machine.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.800
 Andy's been gone a while.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:57.800
 I said, "How long have you been some slime?"

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.800
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.800
 My fact this week is that if you're bitten by the boom-slang snake,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800
 you bleed from every orifice.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.800
 Frightening. James finds it funny.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.800
 I find the word orifice funny.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800
 Yeah, that's pretty terrifying. Even your gums.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800
 Yeah, every part of your body you could bleed from.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.800
 Yeah, your gums, your eyes, your nose, your eight, you know, the bits down there.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.800
 You're Marianas Strange.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 You're Marianas Strange, exactly.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.800
 You're Marianas.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.800
 Well, okay, I'm never calling it anything else.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 Anyway, so this is really horrible.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800
 We shouldn't be laughing.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 No, but it's fine. The boom-slang snake, which is quite a cool name,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.800
 is not particularly dangerous because it very, very rarely attacks people.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.800
 I think it's only killed seven people on record.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.800
 But when it does kill you, it has a venom which is called a hemotoxin

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800
 which destroys your blood cells.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.800
 And the first recorded incident was an expert on snakes who got bitten by him when he was in his lab

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.800
 and he thought nothing of it because it's just a tiny little bruise.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.800
 And he actually, because he was a snake expert, he noted down the symptoms as they went along

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.800
 and spent the day going, "Oh, my bruise is looking a little bit purple.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.800
 I'll get a little tiny bit sore now."

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.800
 And then he was dead within 24 hours because suddenly about, you know, six to eight hours later,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.800
 he started bleeding everywhere.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.800
 He was cold, was he?

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800
 Yes, I think he was.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800
 Yeah.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 And I think was it thought to be harmless at the time, the boom-slang?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 Yeah.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.800
 So he said, "If he'd been bitten by a snake, then thought it would be dangerous."

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.800
 He obviously would have been really worried.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800
 But he just thought, "Oh, it's just a boom-slang."

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800
 I love so the boom-slang.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800
 So it's killed seven people with its bite.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.800
 I reckon it's only seven because it must be such an ordeal for it to actually bite someone properly

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.800
 because its fangs are located at the back of its mouth.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800
 Yeah.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.800
 It's a ridiculous reason that evolution put it back there.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.800
 So in order to bite, it has to open its mouth 170 degrees, like this huge.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800
 And then make the bite.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.800
 But that's just such an odd placement.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.800
 That's amazing.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.800
 And they're called backfanged snakes, aren't they?

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.800
 And they're loads of species of snake, which, yeah, I don't really understand it either.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.800
 Supposedly when they bite you, boom-slangs, they have to...

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 It looks as though they're chewing on their prey.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.800
 Supposedly when they bite they prey, it looks as though they're chewing on them.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.800
 But actually, all they're doing is working the venom into their prey.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 Because they have to open their mouth so wide to get their fangs actually in there,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800
 then they need to...it looks like they're chomping on you.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.800
 Have you guys heard of the Japanese tiger keelback?

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800
 No.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.800
 It is the most badass snake.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.800
 This snake is incredible.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.800
 And bite you and kill you with a poison, with a toxin.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.800
 However, it's a non-venomous snake.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.800
 And what it does is it bites poison frogs.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.800
 It takes from it the venom and the toxin from the toad.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.800
 And then it lets it drip back to its backfangs as well.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.800
 And it keeps it in these little, I think, pouches.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 And then it bites something and it uses the poison that it's carried over to kill its enemy.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800
 That's insane, right?

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.800
 That's amazing.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.800
 Yeah.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.800
 Because it takes a lot of energy to make your own venom, doesn't it?

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.800
 Yeah, it's actually really clever.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.800
 It's much less energy to just go and nick it off someone else and work out with your test tubes inside your body,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800
 how to actually concoct one.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800
 Do they tell each other, though?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.800
 Like, do the snakes go...it's cool.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.800
 There's no venom, but that toad will give you it.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.800
 You just have to put it to your back, too.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.800
 How do they pass that knowledge on?

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800
 Is it like with beavers?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800
 They just know how to build dams when they're born.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800
 Are they keelbacks, did you say?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 Yeah.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.800
 So female keelbacks, when they have babies and the babies don't have any venom yet,

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:24.800
 they'll find a toad and then collect the venom from the toad and then give it to the children

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.800
 so that they have some venom when they're first born.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.800
 So that might be observational.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 It could be, yeah.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.800
 Do you guys know how many people would you guess?

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.800
 I think I told Andy this the other day, so don't answer it.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.800
 How many people would you to guess per year are killed by snakes around the world?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800
 Around the world, yeah.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800
 I would say about 100.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800
 How many people do you reckon, Dan?

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800
 Oh God, I don't know.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.800
 Maybe something ridiculously low, like seven, because we have so much.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800
 It's 200,000.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800
 What?

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.800
 Really?

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800
 200,000 people a year.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.800
 They're the most dangerous animal aside from mosquitoes.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.800
 And there's a massive health emergency because it's a really unfashionable thing for pharmaceutical companies

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.800
 to be investing in because everywhere where snakes are dangerous is in rural developing the poorest areas.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.800
 And so lots of pharmaceutical companies are stopping producing certain antivenom,

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800
 which is killing a lot of people.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.800
 But 200,000 people a year.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.800
 That's more than you would have expected, right?

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800
 That's crazy.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800
 It's insane.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.800
 Yeah, there was a guy recently who survived a brown snake attack, which is, I think Australia is most dangerous snake.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.800
 He was doing a charity walk and he came across a snake that he thought was dead and it leapt up and it bit him.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.800
 But he survived the attack because this entire walk, which was right across a huge walk in Australia,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.800
 he was wearing a stormtrooper outfit from Star Wars.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.800
 And so it hit the plate on his, on his shin.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800
 And he made all the news at Australia.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800
 I'm not surprised.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800
 Yeah.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.800
 And every single news channel that interviewed him asked him if he was a massive Star Wars nerd.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800
 No.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 He doesn't even like Star Wars.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.800
 It's like, what is Star Wars?

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.800
 I was just wearing my anti-snake suit.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.800
 Wow, amazing.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.800
 I read a list yesterday of the 1,295 venomous snakes.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.800
 There's a list of them online.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.800
 I'm not sure it's all of them, but I think it might be pretty close.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800
 Do you want to hear some of the names?

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800
 Yeah, please.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800
 Okay, the Moorish snake.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.800
 Moorish with two eyes.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.800
 Or like, okay, not as in what you've had one, you just can't stop it.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.800
 The tiger cat snake, which I really like because it's like three animals in one.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800
 Yeah.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.800
 Yeah, that's a bit like, there's a hawk moth caterpillar, I think.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.800
 I think maybe it must get really upset because it's called the hawk moth caterpillar.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.800
 And then when it turns into a moth, I reckon it thinks, that must be the things I turn into as I keep going on.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.800
 It spends the rest of its life waiting to become a hawk.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800
 Anyway, it's incredible.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.800
 If you Google it because it can disguise itself as a snake in order to repel birds.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.800
 And so it's like, it's underside, has this pair of false eyes on it.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.800
 And it sort of causes itself to become a bit engorged where the snake's head would be.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800
 And if you look at pictures, it looks exactly like the head of a snake.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.800
 Except that it's obviously caterpillar-sized.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.800
 So I don't know what kind of a frightening snake is three inches long, but it works.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800
 That's great.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.800
 They've apparently found out that snakes are actually 70 million years older than we first thought they were.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.800
 These snakes sometimes were massive.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.800
 One of them, this is what they ate, dinosaurs.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800
 There's a dinosaur eating snake.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.800
 That's amazing. Although you did get small dinosaurs back in the day.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800
 I know, but just the word.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.800
 You just imagine it kind of locking its jaws around like a diplodocus.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.800
 Yeah, it says it ate small mammals, lizards, and even dinosaurs.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 I read quite a cool new story from 1996 about a snake.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.800
 And I'm going to say now I wouldn't recommend this because actually for snake bite,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.800
 you're not supposed to create a tourney K because that people often think that's the right thing to do.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.800
 But actually sometimes that can trap the venom in the wrong place

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.800
 and then make it more harmful than it otherwise would have been.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.800
 However, it does sometimes work in 1996 in Texas.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 A man was bitten by a poisonous coral snake.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:13.800
 He killed the reptile by biting off its head and then peeled off its skin and used it as a tourney K to wrap around the injury.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800
 That's amazing.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800
 That's pretty hardcore, isn't it?

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800
 Yeah, it is.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800
 You know, they can hear through it.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.800
 So I don't know if this is all species of snake, but they can hear through their jawbone.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.800
 So their jawbone is on the ground, but what's really interesting is that their jawbone is split into two.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:32.800
 So they can work out the direction because if the left jawbone is going bull or there's a little guy over there.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.800
 Yeah, they can suddenly be going, "Oh, okay, left jawbone. All right, let's make a move."

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800
 It also has two ways of smelling.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 And one is the classic way, you know, classic snake smell way.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.800
 The other is through its tongue tasting the air.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800
 That's how it smells.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.800
 So when you see a snake and it's kind of sticking out its tongue just like how it's doing now,

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.800
 it's trying to kind of see if it can taste any predators or prey.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.800
 Okay, speaking of being able to hear, do you know the death ade?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800
 No.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800
 Okay, the death ade.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.800
 It kills a lot of people, a lot of people are killed by it, but it's not called the death ade because of that.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.800
 It used to be called the death ade.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.800
 And then it just kind of got switched around.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.800
 And it's because when early people went to Australia, they saw it and it never ran away from humans.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.800
 And so they assumed that it just couldn't hear the humans.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.800
 And so that's they thought it was death.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.800
 I like the fact that the death ade became the death ade due to a mishearing.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.800
 Basically.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.800
 Have you seen footage of the flying snakes?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800
 Oh, yeah, they're amazing.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800
 They go a long way, don't they?

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800
 They go a long way.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800
 And their body.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.800
 Where are they going to flying to?

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.800
 So if they're off on a tree, and they want to get to the ground, but they kind of want to cover some distance while they're in the air.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.800
 They always fly from somewhere higher to somewhere lower.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800
 Yes.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.800
 And never, never the other way.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:55.800
 So it's not, I guess it's more a parachuting mechanism that they do because they flatten their body into a sort of spiral.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.800
 Almost like when you see the Olympics, the ribbons that they do when that ribbon display, it's like that.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.800
 I mean, birds are still laughing in their faces.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.800
 Yeah, but give it a few million years and you won't be laughing when they're flying snakes with wings.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.800
 You'll be harking back to that time with the boring billions.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800
 Longing was in slime.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.800
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.800
 And that is my fact.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.800
 My fact this week is that Albert Einstein has a social media team.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.800
 Yeah, so he has.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.800
 This is a genuinely devoted team who are paid specifically to keep up his Twitter presence.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.800
 His Facebook outputs, his Tumblr account.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.800
 I did hear his Twitter presence has fallen a bit by the wayside over the past 70 years.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800
 Yeah, so you died.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:47.800
 How does it feel to be less technologically a debt to somebody who's been dead for 50 years?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800
 Yeah, fair point.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.800
 So you will see on Twitter that people set up accounts for dead historical characters.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.800
 Someone even has done one for God and they run it as if they are God.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.800
 Yeah, but that's not a verified account.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800
 Exactly.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800
 So that's the difference.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.800
 Albert Einstein has a little blue tick next to his Twitter account because there's a verified account.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.800
 He on Facebook has a little tick as well.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.800
 He's got 17 million followers on Facebook.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800
 17 million.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:18.800
 So this is Corbis who looks after his output and they have the license to his image.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:26.800
 And as a result of the money that they get from it, he is the fifth most profitable dead person basically.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.800
 So I think only people like maybe Kirk Cobain and a few others.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800
 Elvis.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.800
 And maybe John Lennon.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.800
 Yes. And the fourth is Charles Schultz who drew peanuts.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800
 Really?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.800
 Because his books are still so popular and still so loved.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.800
 But I was very skeptical about this because I thought this sounds terrible using Einstein's image after his death for profit.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:55.800
 It turns out that actually on his death, he left the rights to his image to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which he co-founded.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.800
 So he said, you can have the rights to my image after I die and use it to make money for the university.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.800
 So they licensed out to Corbis the right to use this image and Corbis take a cut of the money basically.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.800
 But most of it goes back to the Hebrew University.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:15.800
 So it is actually an odd way of fulfilling your will or having a charitable legacy.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.800
 They actually really care about it.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:24.800
 The guy who runs the team at Corbis says that every day he thinks about what Einstein stands for and what he doesn't stand for.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:32.800
 And then he sends out a tweet or he sends out a Facebook message reflecting what he thinks Einstein might have said about a situation.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.800
 Also, he corrects people who misattribute quotes to Einstein.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.800
 So Einstein will write back to them.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.800
 In one case, he wrote to one of the Kardashians saying, Einstein never said that.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.800
 So he's also doing damage limitation on the spread of misinformation.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:40:00.800
 And I just love the quote. There was a guy at Corbis. Not the guy who actually runs Einstein's account, but one of the managers there, Kevin Connolly, who said, it's not rocket science running Einstein's social media presence.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.800
 Yeah, they also point out that no one on the Corbis team has any scientific expertise.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.800
 So that yeah, Einstein still gets five to ten requests for an autograph every day.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800
 What?

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800
 It's true.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800
 Like people ask on Twitter for his autograph.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 I'm afraid I don't have much more detail than that. But I suspect they go disappointed most of the time.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.800
 Yeah, Einstein. Those pictures of him from the 30s look old.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:29.800
 And they're in black and white. So you can tell they're a long time ago. How ancient do they think this guy is?

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.800
 Yeah.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.800
 So Einstein is a bit slightly disturbing person, right? Because he seems to have no flaws.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:46.800
 Well, he has one flaw. He has one flaw. But in every other way, he's so great. All these quotes that he said that are also wise and brilliant. He's a great pacifist. He's a genius.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:52.800
 If you read, you know, I think new scientist or scientific American a couple of months ago did the top 10 greatest scientists of all time.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.800
 And you can feel they all want to be a bit left field. But in the end, they all say Einstein's the one.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.800
 And yet he had this weird relationship with his wife.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.800
 So his list of ways that his wife had to behave around him if the marriage was to function is so weird.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.800
 So they yeah, they were on the brink of a divorce. And then they decided to hold the marriage together for the kids.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.800
 Yeah, and in part of the deal was Einstein wrote this letter to her.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.800
 Yeah, it's featured in the letters of notebook. If if anyone has that, you can see it.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.800
 So the conditions of him of them remaining together, it was a contract that he wrote up that she had to sign.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.800
 And she had to say that she would make sure that his clothes and laundry were kept in good order that he'd get his three meals regularly in his room.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.800
 Bedroom and study kept neat stuff like that. But then you were renounced all personal relations with me.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.800
 And so far as they are not completely necessary for social reasons, you will stop talking to me if I request it.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.800
 That's an insane one.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.800
 You will stop talking to me if I request it. I mean, this doesn't mean I can please.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:59.800
 I mean, this doesn't sound like a guy who'd be great on social media if he actually was loud.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.800
 He just blocked it basically.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:11.800
 This is what he promises her in return. In return, I assure you of proper comportment on my part, such as I would exercise to any woman as a stranger.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.800
 Oh, out. And she signed it.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.800
 What an ass.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800
 What an ass.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800
 And then they divorced a couple of years later, I think.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.800
 Oh, did they?

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.800
 All right, couldn't keep it up, kept on yabbering on, didn't she?

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800
 Yeah.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800
 Wow.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:31.800
 You know the weirdest thing about that list is it feels really awkward having to say bad stuff about Einstein, but it's true.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.800
 It's this is who he was, but you really kind of, I feel almost dirty saying this out loud, but it's kind of, it's just true.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800
 Yeah.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800
 It's odd.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.800
 Well, that's because of the expert work being done by the folks at Corbitt, who very rarely tweet.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.800
 You will not talk to me if I request it.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.800
 So Einstein was also an inventor because he worked in the patents office and he did a few inventions.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:03.800
 My favorite one is a blouse with two sets of buttons, some parallel to each other, so that it would fit both a slim person and a fat person.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800
 It's such a good idea.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.800
 It means that you can use the slim buttons, and if you put on a load of weight, then you can use a fat button.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.800
 Did he release it into the market or did he just invent it?

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.800
 He invented it and paid it to it, but no one ever made it.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.800
 Because I've got shirt cuffs where you can do the buster.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.800
 In case you put a lot of weight on your wrist.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.800
 No, like Kate goes straight to my wrist.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.800
 Anyway, yeah, he had some other, he painted it a hearing aid, I think, and a refrigerator.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.800
 Yes.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:37.800
 Which didn't take off at the time, literally or metaphorically, and wasn't really bought.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.800
 But now they're thinking about, we're introducing it because it's very environmentally friendly.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.800
 So it's actually was very ahead of his time.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.800
 It's not the reason he did it, though. He did it because fridges at the time were lethal.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:54.800
 So they all used gases like ammonia to actually do the cooling of the food or other gases like methyl chloride.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.800
 And several people died as a result of these gases leaking out into their homes, basically.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.800
 So Einstein was one of several scientists who worked on fixing that.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.800
 And in 1925, he co-developed with a former student of fringe, and he paid into it.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.800
 But then they invented a non-poisonous refrigerant, which just worked better.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.800
 Do you know Yoda was based on Einstein?

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.800
 No.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.800
 No.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.800
 No.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.800
 The guy who designed Yoda said he based it on a combination of himself and Einstein.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800
 It was Stuart Freeborn.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.800
 So hang on, if one element of Yoda is taken from...

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800
 Stuart?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.800
 Yeah.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.800
 From Einstein, it means that Stuart must be two-foot tall.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800
 And the reason.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.800
 When Einstein became really famous, and he had lectures, people really wanted to go to lectures,

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.800
 even though they didn't understand any of it.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.800
 And so he would start a lecture, and then stop after five minutes and say,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.800
 "I will now pause so that those with no further interest in the subject can leave."

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.800
 I pretty much everyone would go and just be like two or three people left.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.800
 Wow.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.800
 In Oxford, I visited it quite a few times.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.800
 I didn't understand what I was looking at.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.800
 But you can see the chalkboard that Einstein, when he came to England to explain,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800
 equals MC squared.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.800
 You can see the chalkboard where all the workings out are on there.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.800
 It's quite nice.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800
 It's a weird bit of history to look at.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.800
 Although weirdly, and nowhere on the chalkboard does it say E equals MC squared.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.800
 So I just have to assume that they're telling the truth.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.800
 You were definitely one of the people in the lectures weren't you,

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.800
 who as soon as you sat down, I was like, "God, five minutes, I've got to wait until he excuses me."

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.800
 Definitely not here for the science.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.800
 Just that thing, I was saying before, about taxonomy being everywhere in the world.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.800
 I guess mathematics as well is another one.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.800
 Yes.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.800
 So any mathematician can talk to each other about maths by just using the symbols.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800
 Yeah.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800
 Yeah.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.800
 You know how Einstein's brain was chopped up?

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800
 Yeah.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.800
 There's now an app that you can get.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.800
 And I think it's for doctors, where they've got high res images of the brain.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.800
 You can download it, and you can go close into it, and you can just...

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.800
 And I don't know what purpose it has, because they're not quite sure how it fully fits together.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.800
 I would say the main purpose is to get 2.49 of people.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.800
 Yeah.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.800
 Exactly.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.800
 But I mean, that's quite cool.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.800
 Just the idea that even his brain is now sort of an app.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800
 Yeah.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.800
 Also, interestingly, so just going back to the sort of nautilus side of Einstein.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:17.800
 There's an idea that his granddaughter, who was raised by Hans, which was his son,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.800
 was in fact an illegitimate love child of Einstein.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800
 His name was Evelyn.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.800
 And she was actually given a bit of Einstein's brain.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.800
 And the idea was that she was actually going to do a DNA checkup to see if she was related.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.800
 Because she got no money at all.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.800
 When it went to the Hebrew University, his likeness and all that stuff, they didn't give her a cut of anything.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.800
 And most exciting thing about her, though, is that for a period of about 13 years,

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:48.800
 she was married to Grover Krantz, who all the Bigfoot enthusiasts out there will know

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.800
 is the first scientist to believe in and try to prove the existence of Bigfoot.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.800
 Right.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.800
 Yeah, so she was associated with two great men.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.800
 The constant debate, who has given more to science, Einstein, Grover Krantz.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.800
 Can we do a quick thing on social media, on social media, particularly after death?

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.800
 Yeah.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:16.800
 Because there are companies now which offer to keep tweeting kind of things that you would have tweeted after you die.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800
 So they'll take a sample of all your previous tweets.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.800
 And their slogan is, "When your heart stops beating, you'll keep tweeting."

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:30.800
 I was reading a story about these firms. There was one businesswoman who had registered her interest in having that.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.800
 And she said, "It would be interesting to have a quote, kind of ironic legacy."

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.800
 But then she said, "But I'm not sure who'd be interested in reading a computer generated me."

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.800
 In the cold light of day, it is a very conceited thing to do.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.800
 Which is very, I think, self-aware.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:53.800
 And there's another one called, "Eternity Me," I think, which you sort of contain your avatar.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.800
 So it recommends that if you sign up to it, the best way to have as realistic tweeting as possible after you die

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.800
 is to properly train up your avatar and feed it with your whole personality.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.800
 So give it all your pictures or your tweets.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:09.800
 And then it creates this thing that looks like you and that can speak to people as you would have.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800
 Wow.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.800
 It's so mad.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.800
 Oh, Brave New World.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.800
 Yeah. There's a guy called Joe Vixel-Vikes.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.800
 And he is a writer for the Music and Pop Culture website, Death and Taxes.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.800
 Sorry, did he say Death and Taxes?

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800
 Sorry, go on.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:34.800
 And he's kind of gone on to Hoot Sweets, which is an app which will send tweets in the future.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.800
 So you can do it for a tweet next week.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800
 If you're not going to be in the country, it'll just send it.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:43.800
 But anyway, he has got some messages to be sent out in 2086.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.800
 And he wants to be the last person to ever tweet.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.800
 And he reckons that just Twitter with it being an internet company, whatever.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.800
 Or just any company really probably still won't be going in those times.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.800
 But he will still have one last tweet.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.800
 Oh, wow.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.800
 But if Twitter doesn't exist, how will it go out?

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.800
 Yeah.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.800
 You could still post on my space, even though no one's going on there before.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.800
 That's true.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.800
 What do you mean?

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.800
 #GetAndTheOffMySpace.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.800
 There are some things Twitter accounts that make me really happy.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800
 I'm not on Twitter.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.800
 So one of them is the...

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.800
 One of them is @Streiberland.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.800
 Yeah.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.800
 @Streiberland is right there on a par with the Big Ben Twitter feeds.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.800
 Which is fantastic.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800
 What are you talking about?

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.800
 Big Ben Clock is so good.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800
 It's great.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.800
 At 1 o'clock, it tweets BONG.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.800
 At 2 o'clock, it tweets BONG BONG.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.800
 And it's been doing that for years, every hour.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.800
 That's Andy's favourite Twitter feed.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800
 Yeah, he does do that.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.800
 And one that I do like, though, is...

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800
 Do you guys...

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800
 Have you guys seen Kim Kierke Kardashian?

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.800
 Kim what?

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.800
 Kim Kierke Kardashian.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.800
 No.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.800
 It's a combination of Kim Kardashian and Kierke God.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800
 Great.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.800
 And it says...

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.800
 It's the philosophy of Kierke God mashed with the tweets and observations of Kim Kardashian.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800
 And it includes things like...

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.800
 Filling in the eyebrows with a pencil or powder helps eliminate the imperfection

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.800
 that pertains to everything human.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.800
 It's really fun.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.800
 That's great.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800
 It's so clever.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.800
 That's all of our facts.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.800
