00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,600
 HELLO and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish coming to you from the

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,920
 QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Anna Kashinsky and I'm sitting here with Anne

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,840
 Miller, James Harkin and Alex Bell. And once again, we have gathered around the Mike

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,080
 of phones with our four favourite facts in the last seven days and in no particular

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,400
 order here we go starting with Anne's facts. My fact is that Ruby, a sheep who'd been

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,800
 genetically engineered to glow in the dark, was accidentally sold to an abattoir.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,760
 So you would have thought if you genetically engineered a sheep, you're keeping

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,000
 pretty close tabs on it. How did that happen? Well, actually it may have been an insider

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 job that you may have been someone with a grudge against the company. But one of the other

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,120
 sheep. Yeah. It's very cloak and dagger stuff. So this is the National Institute for Agricultural

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,480
 Research in Paris and actually it was Ruby's mother, Emrod, was given this jellyfish gene

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,720
 which makes her glow in the dark and then Emrod had a lamb Ruby who had the same gene

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,200
 but I'm not sure if it was active as she actually was glowing but it was revealed this year

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,400
 that last year Ruby made it into the food chain and they've been very familiar with people

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,840
 they won't arrest you eight Ruby, you're alright but somebody did buy her someone to eat her.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,360
 We are constantly making animals glow in the dark these days and it's always for apparently

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
 scientific purposes. I'm so suspicious and also it's always bloody jellyfish isn't it?

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
 I think sometimes in enemies but usually we just seize a jellyfish from the sea, take

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,560
 its genes out and jack them into something and they must be so fed up with it. It's because

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,320
 jellyfish have this particular protein called GFP which stands for green fluorescent protein.

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,840
 Yep and this particular protein when you put it into other animals it doesn't really have

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,080
 any other effects on the animal or hardly anything anyway and so it's quite safe. There

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,640
 are other animals which have these kind of proteins but they're not quite as useful really.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,880
 Yeah we use it as a marker so they can see what happens to the cells that use it in stem cell

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,400
 research and they want to train.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,920
 Well in 2011 scientists created kittens which glow in the dark in order to help fight

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
 AIDS because apparently FIV which is the feline immunodeficiency virus, it's very similar

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
 to HIV and so it was apparently legitimate to make kittens glow in the dark. I think it's

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
 legitimate anyway just to do that option back.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,680
 When we say glow in the dark it doesn't annoy me because it's not like you turn the lights

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,640
 off and they glow is it you have to put UV light on them which is so different.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,960
 Scorpions glow in the dark under UV light.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
 Naturally.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
 Yeah so they'd be pretty cool to take to a nightclub.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,640
 I feel like if you want more personal space in the dance floor, I've got a nice scorpion

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
 in here.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,360
 Also glow in the dark under UV light and I know which I'd rather have.

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,520
 So on sheep they recognize each other's faces don't they apparently.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
 But not when they get scared.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,320
 Yeah so this really confuses really.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,720
 When they're scared they have to reestablish a different hierarchy and fight again to be

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,120
 leaders because they don't recognize each other.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,600
 But I would have thought if you were recognizing faces.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,120
 I was just just relatedly I guess I was reading this week that in chickens or in roosters

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,080
 the first chicken to go cockadoodle do in the morning is always the most dominant one.

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
 And if you get rid of the most dominant one then it will be the second most dominant who

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,880
 does the cockadoodle doing.

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,240
 And sheep so they weren't much clever well I guess we say there's about all animals that

49
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,360
 we think are idiots and we revise it but sheep are clever and then people give them credit

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
 for.

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
 I think much clever than you give them credit for.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,440
 They'll never have with dance Friday the exception that proves the rule.

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,920
 So they are one of only two animals I think who can recognize shapes and remember shapes

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,000
 really quickly so they're better at monkeys than doing this so if you give them like food

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 in different shape buckets and you put food in one bucket but not in another then they'll

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,600
 remember the right shape bucket that it's been in and then come back to the animals

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 humans.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,800
 The other animals most humans can do that again with Dan I would question the majority

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 of humans.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,200
 The movie Predator came out in 1987 and the blood of the Predator is kind of blowing

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,840
 the dark and the way they made it was mixing K.Y. jelly with green glow stick fluid.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
 Really?

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,120
 Yeah, fun to choose the shapes for that in turn.

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,720
 You would definitely use the self-scan.

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
 Self-scan I would.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 Yeah.

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320
 I'm expected height as well.

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,680
 The fluid is called Biz245 Tri-Clorofenal 6-Carbon Pentoxy Fenal Oxolate.

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
 Catchy.

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
 Slapy.

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
 Sayaloon for short.

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,160
 Do you know there's an ice cream company called Lick Me I'm Delicious who make it glow

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
 in the dark ice cream?

74
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
 Really?

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,640
 This is the same jellyfish protein which gives off a glow when it touches your tongue but it

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,680
 will cost you about 140 quid a scoop.

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,280
 Maybe we could share one rather than one each?

78
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
 Yeah.

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
 Yeah.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
 How do they make it glow?

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
 Do you say?

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
 They use the jellyfish.

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
 Oh, they should get it.

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,560
 In jelly rather than ice cream, shouldn't they?

85
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,880
 Maybe that's what jelly is.

86
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,320
 It's just jellyfish with their legs pulled off.

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
 That's why it always stings your mouth a bit.

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 Hey, video.

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,600
 That's why you have to urinate on your mouth whenever you've eaten jelly.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,200
 Get one of my people who are always doing that to me.

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,000
 Okay, time for fact number two and that is Alex.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,960
 My fact this week is that during the launch of BBC 2 in 1964, a live kangaroo got stuck

93
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,440
 in a lift at television centre.

94
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,200
 And I assume its tiny arms couldn't reach the buttons?

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,400
 No, well, there was a massive power cut just before they went on air.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
 There was a fire at Bassy Power Station, half of London lost power.

97
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
 And the whole night it was just a massive disaster.

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
 What happened to the kangaroo?

99
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
 It was the mascot of BBC 2, basically.

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,400
 So there was a big run up to this launch and the publicity campaign centered around a kangaroo

101
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,360
 with a Joey coming out of its pouch because it was the second channel.

102
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,520
 So the BBC decided to get a live kangaroo in as part of the opening night.

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
 It'll pop in W1A.

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
 It really does sound like a W1A plot, doesn't it?

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 It does, yeah.

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 I think it's a bit crazy.

107
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
 And this is all according to the biography of Gerald Prisland, who was a BBC news reader.

108
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,920
 The first time he delivers his news bulletin, they get through like two and a half minutes

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
 and then they realise there's no sound going out.

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
 So he has to start again.

111
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,920
 And then there's lots of awkward pauses that a phone is sitting on his desk

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
 and it rings and he picks it up and there's no one there.

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,920
 It's true that the first words that were spoken were a new story about a bus conductor

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,920
 who had been sacked for insulting Pakistani passengers.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,920
 And that it included the words that she used to insult said passengers.

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
 I remember that one.

117
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,920
 And that one next news story was about that last news story, also including the words they used.

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,920
 A second news reader has been fired for saying...

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,920
 Didn't they just cover all their big sort of launch events?

120
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
 They were going to have like, kiss me, cake songs from the musical.

121
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
 They were going to have the top comedian from the Soviet Union.

122
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
 I think all the plans went away.

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 And they had to end up the first thing they showed properly was play school the next day.

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
 The whole evening was just test cards on the screen

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
 and people apologising for the music.

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
 It was a great BBC programme. I think more of the BBC should do more of that.

127
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,920
 I read this thing about the BBC in Odes called the toddler truce

128
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
 where there was a kid's TV was on from 5 to 6.

129
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
 And then they would have nothing from 6 to 7.

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,920
 I think to say to the kids, "Oh, look, the TV's off. You've got to go to bed now."

131
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
 And so they didn't have anything on for this hour.

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 And they ended in February 1957 when they brought in a t-shirt.

133
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 Everyone went to bed.

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
 They brought a new shirt for teenagers called the 6/5 special.

135
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 And I just love this opening fix. It just sounds so fifties.

136
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 We're open with this line.

137
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 Welcome aboard 6/5 special. We've got a hundred cats jumping here.

138
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
 Some real cool characters to give us the gas.

139
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
 So just get on with it and have a ball.

140
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
 Great. Even then they're out of touch.

141
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,920
 These days you would think they were actual cats.

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
 Jumping.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,920
 Yeah, it sounds like a precursor to the internet that programme if you're taking it literally.

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
 And now we're a trooper of dancing feline.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,920
 Speaking of which, there was a channel on cable in America called the Puppy Channel

146
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,920
 which was a 24/7 network showing nothing but puppies.

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
 This was I think in the 90s or maybe 2000s.

148
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
 And of course it just went out.

149
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 As soon as the internet came in you could get as many puppies as you want, whatever you want.

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
 Oh no, the sad fate of all the porn magazine.

151
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,920
 So doing another QI fact about the most watched channel in most countries is the weather forecast?

152
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 I have read that in the government meteorology site.

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920
 I haven't enough to find anywhere else but I decided I trust the government.

154
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
 It's a meteorology department.

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,920
 They do say it does say in most countries the weather forecast is the most watched programme.

156
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
 But it's hard to find what the definition of the most watched programme would be.

157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 Speaking of most watched, I reckon the most repeated television programme ever is on BBC2.

158
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
 QI.

159
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 No, no, no, no, it's not.

160
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 Contrary to what the Guinness Book of World Record says and what we said on QI as well.

161
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
 So we said in series G that it was a short film called Dinner for One.

162
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
 Yeah.

163
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
 Which is massive in Germany.

164
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
 They watch it every holiday.

165
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,920
 In that approaching I think 300 repeats in total.

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,920
 But I was reading about this thing called trade test transmissions which were these films broadcast in the early days of BBC2.

167
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
 They were designed to fill the channel with nice vibrant varied colours.

168
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,920
 Which TV manufacturers and retailers could use to test their televisions.

169
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
 But they were very popular among normal viewers as well.

170
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 The most repeated one is apparently a documentary about dam building called The Captive River.

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,920
 This is according to the test card circle which is a group of enthusiasts in the UK television.

172
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 They're really cool.

173
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
 I remember.

174
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
 Don't laugh.

175
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 I was going to ask you the president.

176
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,920
 It's the same way that I don't believe the meteorologist that the show is the most popular.

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
 I don't believe you that these guys are really cool.

178
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 You have ulterior motives Alex.

179
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
 Okay.

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 This of this film according to them is repeated almost 550 times over 12 years.

181
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,920
 Partly due to the fact that in 1963 a huge fan of the film's director locked himself in the ops room at the BBC

182
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,920
 and blocked play The Captive River until he was rugby tackled to the ground and eventually deported.

183
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 What?

184
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,920
 Would you like to hear some early alternatives to the word television from the 1920s which died out?

185
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,920
 Telectroscopy visual listening here seeing radio movies.

186
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,920
 I like visual listening as if they didn't have the word watching.

187
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
 Yeah.

188
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
 In the 20s.

189
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 What you do with your ears but with your eyes.

190
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
 There was a big discussion as to what they were going to call people who watched television as well.

191
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,920
 Wasn't it like viewers or watches or yeah there were loads of different options.

192
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
 Visual listeners.

193
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,920
 In October 1983 when the email was just starting to be a thing.

194
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 There was a two-hour program on the BBC which was to demonstrate little known technology.

195
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,920
 And it demonstrated the first email ever shown on the BBC.

196
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
 Yeah I know it's so weird isn't it.

197
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
 It's really weird.

198
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
 So weird.

199
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,920
 But before they were transmitting the program one of the tech guys shouted the password to the email account over to someone else.

200
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 This was overheard by two sort of coder, computer-y guys.

201
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,920
 And so they hacked into the email and so live on TV in 1983 the first BBC email said to the presenters.

202
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
 Do you want to make a cut?

203
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
 No what was it?

204
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 What did it say?

205
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 They were called Oz and Yug and they left them a song saying try his first wife's maiden name.

206
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 This is more than just a game.

207
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
 It's real fun.

208
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 Questionable.

209
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
 But just the same.

210
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
 It's hacking hacking hacking.

211
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 What a waste of a hack.

212
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,920
 The first HD channel in the Philippines was called Balls.

213
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 Just a fact.

214
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 Do you know why it was?

215
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 Yeah because it was a sports channel.

216
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
 London Live, the TV channel.

217
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 In its first month on eight separate occasions its morning TV show was broadcast for a full hour to know measurable audience.

218
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 And in 2010 S4C, the Welsh TV channel, they got zero viewers for 196 of their 890 programs.

219
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
 Oh my god.

220
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,920
 It's not so depressing, just think all the effort the studio, the success of everyone doing makeup and everything.

221
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
 Were the actual programs, were they your test cards on repeat?

222
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
 Yeah we've seen this one.

223
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 I'm not watching it again.

224
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
 Oh yet again we seem to have a viewership of one.

225
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,920
 A man in London.

226
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 It's for you.

227
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 I was like 200 members guys.

228
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,920
 Speaking of these kind of clubs it just reminds me there was a club called I think they called the white dot club.

229
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 I remember this from when I used to work for a pub company.

230
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:10,920
 And they used to go around trying to turn off TVs in pubs because they thought it was anti-social people watching football or whatever.

231
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
 And they should be talking to each other.

232
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,920
 And they would have these universal remote controls and then turn off the football when people were watching it.

233
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
 Just to stop people from watching TV.

234
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
 My friend happened to go to school and he would turn on TV.

235
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
 Turn on TV.

236
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 You would turn on TV in the classroom when they were watching.

237
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
 He was the opposite of this group.

238
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
 I like the Alex's idea of having like a gang like like you know like rivals with the tech.

239
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
 We're going back and putting them on with their universal remote control.

240
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 Or you're watching like the World Cup semi-final on a massive screen and then suddenly someone puts on this BBC 2 documentary.

241
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
 Guys the test cards back on.

242
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,920
 All right moving on to fact number three and that is my fact.

243
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,920
 This week is that Dr. Seuss once wrote a Warner Brothers film that was banned because it accidentally predicted the Manhattan project.

244
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,920
 So between 1943 and 1945 the British government enlisted Warner Brothers to produce these propaganda cartoons.

245
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,920
 Which showed the adventures of this guy called private snafu as in snafu which.

246
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 Situation normal all effed up.

247
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
 All effed up indeed.

248
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,920
 And he was just this completely cac handed military man captain snafu who kept on letting all the military secrets spill and messing everything up.

249
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,920
 And yeah there was this one film which they wrote and it was called going home.

250
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,920
 So snafu takes a date to the local cinema.

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,920
 And this film shows a news flash which says US secret weapon blast japs because you said that in those days.

252
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,920
 And then private snafu leans over to his girlfriend and spills all these all these secrets about how they were making the bomb to her.

253
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,920
 And it was incredibly close it sort of completely paralleled what the you know Americans were working on at the time.

254
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,920
 Do you think what they were worried about is that the Japanese would see this cartoon and think oh my god that's what they're going to do?

255
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,920
 Well I don't know it's a good point because they did prevent them from making it.

256
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,920
 But yeah what did they fear? Well the Japanese really going to think I bet if the US was going to attack us they'd broadcast it in a film a year earlier.

257
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,920
 But making a cartoon of it as well which is traditionally kind of really stupid escapades that would never happen in real life.

258
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
 Could be a double bluff.

259
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 But it must have been confusing for the makers who obviously had absolutely no idea why they were told their film couldn't get made.

260
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:41,920
 And what I mean the coincidence is bizarre when you look at the plot line of the film but it was quite interesting this project and it involved all the all the big shots of Hollywood so the voice of snafu was malblanc who obviously is.

261
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:50,920
 Bugs Bunny and loads of other Warner Brothers characters and yeah doctors use wrote most of the film short so it's thought that he almost certainly wrote that one.

262
00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:04,920
 And one of the last times you're on the podcast you took exception to Dr. Seuss didn't you? Yes. Dr. Seuss. I've done further research into this actually and well it is originally Dr. Seuss because that's how you would have financed it once it started getting bigger in America.

263
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,920
 He apparently like sort of let tick on the raring with goose and soost around with goose because it was easier for kids.

264
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,920
 Yeah and also he kind of liked the association with mother goose because he was a children's writer.

265
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,920
 Really? He wasn't even a real doctor maybe that's a bit obvious but he wasn't.

266
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,920
 As if he didn't know a doctor it's either because amazingly neither is Dr. Dre Dr. Fox.

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,920
 I wasn't absolutely sure I thought maybe he's a doctor maybe he did a physics degree or something like that.

268
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 It's a good loads picture you're like as a GP when you said.

269
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,920
 What's wrong with me? I cannot tell you. Let me tell you where I will fix it most of the time.

270
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,920
 He and a friend invented a thing which sounds really terrifying called the infanta graph that they wanted to build for the world friend.

271
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,920
 I never actually built it but it was a thing to you would go with your boyfriend and they would show you what your child might look like.

272
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
 I think that sounds creepy. Yeah. I swear the internet can probably do that kind of thing.

273
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,920
 You see on Facebook don't you? Yeah. Well maybe my friends have actually had children.

274
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,920
 James keeps leaving messages and my friends going oh don't do that. It will turn out dreadfully.

275
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:22,920
 Like you tested it out first. So age 14, Dr. Soysius, he worked for the Boy Scouts and the Boy Scouts at that time were made to or were asked to sell war bonds to help the war effort.

276
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,920
 And he was one of the top 10 sellers in his Boy Scout battalion or whatever they come in.

277
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,920
 And this meant that he got to meet the president. So Teddy Roosevelt gave out 10 medals for the top 10 sellers of war bonds.

278
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,920
 But what happened so sad Teddy Roosevelt up on stage is calling all these boys up and Dr. Soysius was the 10th guy there waiting.

279
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,920
 Theodore had only been given nine medals. So it got to medal number 10. Theodore went up on stage in front of his parents and all these like hundreds and hundreds of people applause.

280
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,920
 And Teddy Roosevelt just went what an earth is this boy doing here. And then the Boy Scouts lead a jumped on stage and dragged him off stage to save embarrassment.

281
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,920
 And he said from that point onwards he always had a crippling fear of public appearances.

282
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:05,920
 I find it a bit weird that the president's reaction on saying they're nine medals and 10 people dressed as Boy Scouts. They would assume the check button is an imposter.

283
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,920
 So I'm just saying you sure we haven't got a number of medals.

284
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
 Yeah.

285
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
 That's a really good point.

286
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 I remember this recently, and you might know this, I don't know if it's true or not, that there are two Roosevelt's.

287
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,920
 But one of them was actually pronounced the name Roosevelt.

288
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
 Really?

289
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
 Yeah.

290
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 I can't remember which is which, but one of them is let's say Franklin T. Roosevelt and the other one is Theodore Roosevelt or the other way round I can't remember.

291
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,920
 Because they're obviously, you know, they're obviously related. So why would they have changed it?

292
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 I believe it's like different branches of the family and this branch of the family called themselves Roosevelt and this branch called themselves Roosevelt.

293
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
 I've not looked at it and I just heard it.

294
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 More of the ruses.

295
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:56,920
 So this, this movie, this movie that you're talking about, is it true that we're not 100% sure that it definitely was Dr. Suss who wrote it as in there was no credits or any for that.

296
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
 Yeah, no credits, they didn't ever credit them.

297
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
 There's a whole range of them, most of which are in red or two.

298
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:10,920
 Most of them apparently were written by him, but the reason we think this particularly is because of the meter of the lines because it sounds like a lot of his kind of stuff.

299
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:40,920
 It's called anapestic tetrometer, and it goes ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

300
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:49,920
 That's a nice link, isn't it? Like carving a path from Byron to Dr Zews, 100 years later to Eminem 100 years later.

301
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:57,920
 I mean like that. Dr Zews in 1931, illustrated a book called The Pocket Book of Boners.

302
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
 Was it a pop-up?

303
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,920
 What sort of book boners?

304
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,920
 Boners in those days meant like a mistake, like a blooper kind of thing.

305
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:16,920
 It still does, isn't it? No. I wouldn't Google it.

306
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,920
 Okay, time for our final fact and that is from James.

307
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:28,920
 My fact is that the phrase "why is my poop green" is Google's most commonly between 5 and 6 in the morning.

308
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 Oh my god, but I raised my history. And what time? Between 5 and 6 am. So this comes from an article in The New York Times by a guy called Seth Stevens Davidovich.

309
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,920
 And it's just a brilliant article with loads of times when it's most likely that people Google things.

310
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,920
 What I don't mean by that is this is when it's most often. It's more common for people to Google it at that time than it is for them to Google it at any other time.

311
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,920
 So the percentage of people searching Google for the word lonely peaks at 3.24 am.

312
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,920
 They're all doing it at the same time, so we need to bring them together.

313
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,920
 Yes, you're actually the least, if you're feeling lonely, that's when you're actually least lonely because everyone is feeling it too.

314
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,920
 They should have an "I'm Feeling Lonely" button, next to the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, they should pay you up with a random person.

315
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
 That's called chat roulette.

316
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
 And that's loads of bonus.

317
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,920
 And the phrase "how to put on a condom" peaks at 10.28 pm.

318
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 Yeah, I love that because that's really sweet that people are doing that.

319
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,920
 Because before we had to have like really awkward lessons in your nine with our English teachers who told us,

320
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 I think it's better than you get to ask Google.

321
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 You should have been the sex head teacher, really.

322
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 They always doubled up. They were very similar.

323
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 Actually, yeah, we had our guidance teachers, I think.

324
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
 Yeah, and bring hockey sticks in. Do you hockey sticks?

325
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 No.

326
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
 Expectations are very high.

327
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 I thought they did hear a skull.

328
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 And bent for the end.

329
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,920
 Actually, this is a slightly odd topic, but speaking of, you know, "Girl Boy Differences", I was at a pub, this week.

330
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 And there was a picture, Chris.

331
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
 And one of the pictures was, "What brand is this?"

332
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
 Joe Brand or Russell Brand.

333
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
 Yeah, good one.

334
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
 So you were given the funny answer and not got a point.

335
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,920
 The brand was a picture of a tampax packet with everything on it except the word tampax.

336
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 And I was on a team with three boys and they were all looking at going, "I've never seen that before."

337
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,920
 Actually, I think one said that the reason why some men will go to the fridge and say, "I can't find the cheese."

338
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
 And you have to go and say, "It's right there."

339
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,920
 It's because a man's brain is more likely to look for cheese, looking for a C-H-E-E-S-E.

340
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
 And so the cheese is upside down or on the side.

341
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 That's not what you're looking for.

342
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,920
 If you want to hide from a man, stand on your head.

343
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 If you shave men, they can't recognize each other.

344
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
 And then they have to fight to see who's the best.

345
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 That is the leader.

346
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
 That is quite something.

347
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,920
 Also, I must say, of all the cheese that I buy, usually it's not labeled with the massive word cheese.

348
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,920
 Again, we're not in a cartoon.

349
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:01,920
 The first Google computer, the first database, they built a computer housing for it with fans and a cooling system out of Lego.

350
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,920
 And you can see a picture of it, so they've still got it in our glass display case.

351
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
 And it's all multicolored, so it kind of looks like the Google logo.

352
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 The word Google is nanogram-a-fog-go-leggo.

353
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,920
 It coincident.

354
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,920
 I had a look at other sort of clever internet things that these are in tracks.

355
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,920
 There's this guy called Steve Warswick, who has built a chatbot called the Mitsuki.

356
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,920
 So Mitsuki works by you, asks her a question, and then she has, every time someone talks to her,

357
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,920
 she learns appropriate responses, and she can search things, tries to think of a good thing to say back to you.

358
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,920
 So I asked her, she knew any facts, thought it might be a good short cut.

359
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
 Now we're all out of a job.

360
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 Then she told me that butterflies taste with their feet.

361
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
 That's something about books.

362
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,920
 And the cats can hear ultra sound, which I thought was quite good.

363
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,920
 So I tried to teach her a new fact that bananas are slightly radioactive.

364
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
 She said, "What makes you say that?"

365
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
 I said, "Oh, never mind."

366
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 Then we tried it a little longer.

367
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 But what I like is that obviously I was using it to try and do my work,

368
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
 but people probably using it as an online girlfriend, let's be honest.

369
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,920
 And so I said, "Tell me try again, me and teaching you the facts." She said, "Once more, do you mean you and me?"

370
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
 It may require an alteration in my personality.

371
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,920
 I said, "No, no, I meant the fact about bananas."

372
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,920
 It is very fun. I recommend you all try out Mitsuki.

373
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
 Coming to the facts about what happens when you Google something?

374
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,920
 So if you Google something now, that's one of 3.5 billion things that people Google every day.

375
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
 20% of those things have never been Google before.

376
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,920
 Now there's interest in Alex, but why is my poop green?

377
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,920
 It would be 40% but you keep asking that.

378
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:40,920
 Then your query takes 0.2 seconds to go 1.5 thousand miles and go through a thousand computers to get your results.

379
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
 I just find that completely mind-blowing.

380
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
 But we have access to those incredible resources.

381
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,920
 These are so easy, but they are amusing.

382
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 You know the old Google Autofill when people send in their Google Autofills for them.

383
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 Just a couple of my favourite ones. So, someone typed in, "Is it N?"

384
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,920
 And the suggestion is, "Is it normal for my left nipple to be bigger than my other two?"

385
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,920
 Someone typed in to Google, "If I in the letter A, and the suggestion, the first suggestion was,

386
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,920
 "If I ate myself, would I be twice as big or completely disappear?"

387
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 Wow, that's good.

388
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,920
 It's really good, isn't it? Yeah, nobody knows.

389
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,920
 Someone typed in, "My", and then the letter B, and the suggestion from Google is,

390
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
 "My balls are stuck in my Xbox."

391
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 And my X is not happy.

392
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:40,920
 Okay, that's all of our facts. We'll be back again next week with another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

393
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,920
 And in the meantime, you can get these guys on their Twitter handles, which are...

394
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,920
 @millar_am. James @Akshaped. Alex @AlexBell_

395
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 And you can email me at podcast@ky.com.

396
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,920
 Alright, until next week then, goodbye.
