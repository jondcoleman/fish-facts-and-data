 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anitz Zitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.320
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.440
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with you, James."

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.200
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a special language in Papu New Guinea that is only used

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:56.240
 when gathering nuts. It's very weird. So can you only use it when gathering nuts?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.600
 Actually picking the nut or when you're on your way to pick the nut or when you...

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.320
 In the general nut picking area. So if you try and use it outside the area where the trees are

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.480
 then there's a worry that mountain spirits might come down and investigate and then cause problems

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.280
 with the nuts. And basically this is a taboo language, this is relatively common around the world

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.960
 and you change your language whenever you're doing anything as a superstition and eventually it becomes

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.840
 an actual language or an actual vocabulary of more than a thousand words in this case.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.600
 And what's the idea that the spirits will steal the nuts from you? What's the fear here?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.840
 So some some normal words that you might use like say I don't know I'm making these up but like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.680
 wither or dry or dead or whatever they might be bad for the plants they might be unhealthy for the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.600
 plants and so you have to use alternative words that wouldn't be generally unhealthy to the plants.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 And is this if you were going to be part of the nut gathering unit would you have to study

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.160
 this language or does everyone know this language? That's a really good point I don't know but I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.480
 imagine they teach it to you is probably not the first thing you learn. It's probably more like a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.520
 second language. Yeah I think. So it's really weird there seem to be two different kinds of belief.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.400
 One is that there's a spirit called keto made who can rip people apart but that's only one

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.040
 group of people that's only one social group because there are loads of different groups all over

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.880
 New Guinea and lots of them gather the nuts and they travel in from the coast to the mountains to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.320
 get to the nut area and the other is that as you say that if you talk about wet things then all

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.200
 the nuts you find will be really wet and if you use words like empty or bitter same deal but it's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.480
 too complete separate beliefs about why you have to use this language it's wet. So then you have a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.440
 euphemism for empty or bitter or wet but then that starts to mean that so then surely that

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.680
 becomes bad luck and then you've got to make a new one right. So this is a thing called

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.760
 perjuration and it happens in English as well so for example the word for the toilet in the 15th

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.160
 century was privy and then that was replaced by a euphemism but then which was it was raised by bog house

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.200
 which I didn't know that was the polite way you'd say it instead of privy because privy was rude

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.480
 and then toilet but then toilet becomes rude so then lavatory and now in America it's restroom

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.000
 but as soon as people really associate restroom as soon as that becomes the rude word they'll have

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 to think of another even more remote. So what is it in Britain then? I think bathroom people say

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 bathroom to be polite don't they? Yeah but it will move on should we make a new one quickly now?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.920
 Can we not go back to bog house? Yeah the privy oh sorry the bog house

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:32.320
 Only when you're around the queen. In a similar vein our word for bear in the middle ages

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.200
 was taboo because so it probably came from ursus so you know obviously you have some

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.960
 ursumager and stuff and that's the Latin for bear but because bears were big scary things it was

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.280
 thought to bring bear rage upon you if you said their name so people would refer to them as

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.240
 the brown one or the shaggy one and so the word for bear comes from the word for brown it's like

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.960
 bro and in china you can't say the word tiger in some places so if you're speaking about a

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.720
 man-eating tiger you'll use a different word often referred to as big insect.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.560
 There's a massive insect down the road. I think you'd be more terrified if someone said there's

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.520
 a large insect behind you and you turned around and it was a tiger. I would say just give them

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.080
 the warning straight out so it's to prevent it from coming into the village so you don't if there's

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.520
 a tiger behind you you probably say tiger but it's if you say big insect then it won't hear

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.640
 its name and it won't come down oh yeah so it won't know it's been summoned so you'll get summoned

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.920
 instead loads of big insects yes at least there's no such insects yeah. In Papua New Guinea so this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.560
 language even though this is language purely for picking up nuts the diversity of language in Papua

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.840
 New Guinea is extraordinary I think it's the highest diversity in the world so they have over 800

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.840
 languages, 850 languages and they have so much this is what's crazy population versus the amount

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.400
 of languages that they have there's this thing called the greenberg greenberg's diversity index

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.440
 which charts how much diversity language is in per country it says Papua New Guinea holds the top

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.440
 spot it is so diverse there that the probability of two random people selected in the country any two

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.040
 random people if they were brought to each other to talk to each other there's a 98.8% chance that

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.840
 they won't speak the same language. Isn't that crazy? That's a bad speed dating day. Yeah so how do

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.400
 you have courts and things like that how do you have schools? They must have a national language of

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.120
 let's say English yeah yeah exactly they've got they've actually got four official languages in

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.480
 Papua New Guinea the fourth being sign language as the official language but that's exactly what it is

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.240
 everyone speaks a main language and then these are all other languages that are slowly going

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.880
 extinct and one or two speakers left. Yeah because they've got English that's very widely spoken

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.640
 there and then they've got Taco Pisin haven't they which is Pigeon talk so just Pigeon English which

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.200
 is great and I just love all kinds of Pigeon English or kind of Creole when you read them because

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.840
 it's such a funny warping of what we say so the word for broken in Taco Pisin is Bagarapim which

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.840
 is Bagarap from Bagarap that's what you know now say broken um MT tin is a person who talks nonsense

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.240
 you know like an empty person like an empty vessel an empty vessel exactly Sue Sock man is a

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.520
 sophisticated person why James might know this oh James you always wear Sock Socks is that it?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.440
 you always say there's a phrase that you used to say when you're growing up to say that someone's

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.880
 bit well to do oh look at you with your matching shoes same thing Sue Sock man means

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.720
 person with shoes and socks oh look at you look at you we have matching shoes here you go you fit

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.120
 right in I didn't know that Papi New Guinea is the second largest island in the world I didn't

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.560
 know that either it depends what you count as an island of course it's very true yeah if you count

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.840
 Eurasia as an island fuck down to three but sorry it doesn't include Australia it doesn't

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.440
 it looks great yeah after I think it's after Greenland yeah it's um the country is called Papi New Guinea

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.520
 the whole island is called New Guinea but the western half of it which is part of Indonesia

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.840
 is Papua and West Papua well yeah and then you also have Guinea and Guinea Bissell right and Guiana

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.880
 yeah absolutely Germany I have mixed up

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.840
 I looked up a couple more taboos oh yeah so this is an interesting one there's an Ethiopian language

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.960
 called Cambata and it's got marital linguistic taboos that's quite common isn't it yeah so a woman

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.440
 can't use some married women follow the system which is called Balecia and it means that they are not

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.480
 allowed to use words that begin with the same syllable as your father-in-law's name or your mother-in-law's

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.920
 name so so my mother-in-law is called Natalia so you wouldn't be able to talk about Natajek Toads

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.160
 you wouldn't be able to talk about Natajek Toads at all you'd have nothing to say yeah

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.720
 you'd have to coin a completely different word for them I just call them Toads Toads yeah yeah

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.440
 so it's not a problem for James which is great what what um what syllable would you not be allowed to

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.640
 use um liel liel so you wouldn't be able to talk about the northern french city right

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:27.520
 where is this yoro star going to oh you'll see when we got there

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:37.040
 yeah that's really cool well there's another kind of gender-based specific language I was looking at

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.360
 in Nigeria actually so I guess the thing you're talking about as a language specific to one thing

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.440
 yeah and this is a language in the uban community in Nigeria and they have different languages for men

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.480
 and women and they say they think they're the only tribe in the world who has this that would be

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.440
 even worse for speed dating wouldn't they I don't know how it works and it's also bizarre because

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.200
 when people are born then you get raised by your mother and your sisters and generally women

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.880
 so everyone speaks the women's language but then apparently there was an interview with one of

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.760
 the tribal leaders who said that as boys start reaching adolescence they just start speaking the

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.520
 male language and it's completely different I mean the words are utterly different and he's like

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.560
 if boys don't start speaking the male language then we consider them a bit abnormal so it was a

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.040
 kick what a rough adolescence is that you're like shit I've got to sort of memorize secretly this

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.760
 language I'm supposed to miraculously start speaking we talk about toxic masculinity in this country

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.440
 don't we but yeah that is pretty bad you know sometimes when you're at a restaurant and you see a

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.200
 couple who just don't speak to each other the whole meal yeah I presume every restaurant is like that

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:49.200
 relationships are constantly awkward so the so the meals can still speak the yeah they can understand

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.080
 each other they're just not allowed to speak each other's language anymore no I was reading about

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.080
 a secret language that was used in wartime in Canada and it was very cleverly done because it was

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.640
 it's a secret language in that not many people spoke it so they were in the Canadian army they enlisted

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.480
 these Native North Americans and they were they spoke Cree and Cree was a language that barely

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.680
 anyone speaks it's only these these people and so what they used to do is in between battalions they

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.400
 would have Cree speakers and any messages that they needed to send across it was those people who

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.720
 took it so if they were caught there was no way of getting the information out of them because

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:33.120
 the language barrier was so great so yeah but the problem was is that Cree didn't have words for the

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.320
 things that they needed to get across so things like they had you know tanks machine guns and bombers

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.440
 so a machine gun they had to translate into their language which is little gun that shoots fast

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.960
 or a fighter bomber would be the Cree word for mosquito because that was the that was the best way

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.160
 of explaining it so yeah they had to invent new words and new phrases in order to do this so cool

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.720
 that's interesting because there were planes called mosquitoes weren't there that's right yeah yeah

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.320
 yeah yeah one of those but they the ones that were slightly made of wood yes they were I'm pretty

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.080
 sure that was my thing I think yes or partly wouldn't frame that's very cool I have some stuff on

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.920
 gathering nuts oh right so don't go gathering hazel nuts on September the 21st in Birmingham why

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:28.400
 because that is devil's nutting day apparently according to an old folklore satan comes out at that

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.800
 time and he collects his nuts on September the 21st so you leave it for him to do and where's

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.080
 this Birmingham it's in the West Midlands basically and there's an old saying of something being dirty

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.160
 in Birmingham you would say it's the colour of the devil's nutting bag

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.840
 you're ever in Birmingham a bit of locals like for you to use yeah that's going to go down like an

00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:01.280
 absolute charm coolest kid of the party just on nut gathering it's quite dangerous sometimes

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:10.000
 isn't it so if you're gathering big nuts then they can fall on you and that is a genuine

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.040
 dang coconut I picture nuts on the ground as opposed to in the tree so no sorry yeah from

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.320
 the tree okay coconut obviously it's not like you're just crawling on the ground you keep bumping

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:28.640
 into nuts but I like the so gathering Brazil nuts then foragers wear hats and they don't collect

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.280
 the more windy days and stuff like that but I didn't realize that they when they fall out of trees

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.160
 they fall from so high that they'll bury themselves 30 centimetres into the ground so when you're not

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.880
 gathering for Brazil nuts then you're digging up the ground yeah the nut inside isn't that weird

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.640
 because they're quite spiky are they Brazil nuts they are on the outside yeah so trekking

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.440
 they're made like that so that they because it's quite clever if you're a nut isn't it to kind of

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.120
 go directly to the ground not have to get trampled in because that's what you want to be in the end

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.880
 yeah absolutely yeah if you're a verb that must be terrifying if you're one going through the soil

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.640
 and suddenly these like daggers are coming down I mean they're great lacing your friend in half

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:15.840
 and now you've got two friends that says quite nice the only species we're watching your

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.880
 friend be cut in half it's quite nice got the one French revolution would have been really weird

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.640
 we've doubled the aristocrats the word James Bond where the laser comes down it just cuts

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:43.440
 if it's a two James Bond snowmessers Bond okay there's time for fact number two and that is Anna

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.760
 my fact this week is that the man who worked out how to stop soft cheese going moldy came from a place

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:59.280
 called mold so I know just before this we started recording we asked it saying that it's pronounced

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:07.520
 mold yeah mold yeah I think I said mold so it's a phrase called mold it's in Norway and you

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.080
 you you sort of say it molder but it's still got the word molding it I mean it is still quite

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.360
 amazing this is a great fact written down yeah it looks pretty good if as long as you spell moldy

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:27.360
 American way so if you're reading this podcast then great so this was a Norwegian cheese make he

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.840
 was called Olaf Cavley and yeah he grew up in this municipality in Norway and he was actually

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.960
 really old when he invented Primula which is that do you laugh because I pronounce it old not

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:47.520
 older he ended up inventing Primula which is you know that cheese that you see that comes in a

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:54.560
 squeezy tube I think it probably is pronounced Primula and in fact it's named after Primrose's because

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.280
 he thought the beautiful yellow color was reminded him of the beautiful yellow of yellow Primrose

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:06.160
 so Primula makes a lot more sense anyway yeah he discovered this and then he got really rich and he

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.400
 I quite like this because it gives us all hope for our future later years of being finally successful

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.560
 rather hanging out with you dogs because he was in his 60s when he came up with this he just ran

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.640
 this delicatessen I mean it's not good for your next 30 years I'm out of his head 30 years of

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.520
 hanging around with those dogs it's so nice to invent some cheese yeah right I'm not going to

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.640
 last that long he actually lived to a hundred lived in 1958 and also a good thing to know about

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.200
 Primula and I'm actually going to start buying it is that all well know that you can pronounce it

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:49.600
 but all the profits go to charity go to causes because he was a massive philanthropist and then his

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.400
 son was and didn't have any offspring and so set up the company which is the I think it's called

00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.080
 the Cavalry Trust and it's legally required to donate all its profits to scientific humanitarian

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.440
 wow wow cool but yeah cheese and stopping cheese going moldy it's been a problem for centuries

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 that just on the place called molder mold it's name comes from the word mold without any on the end

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.160
 it's a plural form of that place and the word mold in Norwegian means either fertile soil

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:29.440
 skull or mold it might actually it might actually be mold so that I was looking up moldy

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.240
 cheeses or soft cheeses so there's a cheese called kuga gold which is made in Washington state

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:42.240
 university and this is really weird so it's canned soft cheese but it the it's canned when it's

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.920
 still in the curd form so it develops as it ages as in it's not once it's gone into the

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.880
 can it doesn't stay the same yeah wow so the lactic acid bacteria inside they don't need oxygen

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.920
 so the flavor keeps developing and there are fans who age their cans for years and years before

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:07.360
 opening them and it's just curts I think it goes in as curd no way nobody yeah no yes it was too good

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:16.320
 I just had to sit back in them and just stare in awe I can now looking back when you said 30 more

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:26.960
 years I said I'm done yeah that's that's really cool so there's no use by date on it presumably I

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.960
 maybe there is for safety is then maybe after a certain number of years it does go off but I'm not sure

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:37.600
 so when process cheese came about which this is an example of then it was very controversial

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:43.120
 because it threatened the normal cheese market and there were actually a lot of cheese makers in

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.360
 America who said it should be called embalmed cheese which it was almost named but I hadn't quite

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.840
 realized that it's just a blend of lots of other cheeses which I think most people will but like

00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.240
 off-cuts of the cheese-making process so for instance I think American cheese you know your classic

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:07.520
 American process cheese is a combination of bits of cheddar, colby, provolone, things like that

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.440
 and they're credible and then they add sodium phosphate which kind of makes it all go

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.560
 goopy yeah and that but quite easy to slice and that was invented American cheese by Canadian

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:25.920
 of course who is James Lewis Kraft of Kraft fame Kraft cheese yeah he was a Canadian and he kind of

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.680
 came up with this idea of kind of shredding it and then adding this stuff which makes it kind of

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:37.440
 cutable yeah so it's kind of a Franken cheese yeah and they pasteurise it so it doesn't ripen so

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.160
 it's not it's really not proper cheese as we the French might know it by the time it's been

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.160
 so for instance Belvita has to be called pasteurised prepared cheese product it does did you know

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.640
 that's only since the early 90s which is when they finally worked out a way to make the base not

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.160
 real cheese at Kraft so it was a really exciting moment because instead of like using just this

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.280
 mixture of cheese and then adding this sodium phosphate and stuff they worked out way of cracking milk

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.520
 which I didn't know was a thing but basically this is you add little bits of plastic membrane into

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.520
 milk and it causes all the milk particles to separate and it separates out into its milk protein lumps

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.320
 and the mix is kind of concentrated protein and that can be the base for their cheese and it was at

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.920
 that moment when some inspectors went around their factories and they weren't guys you're not using

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.400
 cheese anymore I'm afraid you have to call it cheese products how do they come up with this

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.640
 shit yeah so is I always think the other day I found out this is completely off topic but early

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.880
 cars had white tires right and the only reason that we have tires that are black is because you add

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.080
 something called I think it's called black carbon which is just this tiny bit of weird carbon that

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.320
 they manage to get from their industrial process and they just like let's just try it with rubber

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:57.680
 and it turned out to make rubber 10,000 times more solid than normal but even on that I was like how

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.400
 do you even think of that yeah and they just trying everything or what I can't believe early cars had

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.720
 white tires that's not so cool but an absolute nightmare to keep clean it's actually you would just

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.960
 naturally have a black tire after a week yeah it'd be as dirty as the devil's nuts at me

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.920
 sorry I just checked nutting bag

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:23.840
 don't embarrass yourself in Birmingham am I getting that wrong I'm just thinking the difference

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.800
 between your brain and mind jabs is that you're fascinated by the fact that all these processes go on

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:36.560
 and I'm still busy here going wow there was an actual guy called craft so I looked off a bit

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:42.000
 about food preservation have we I don't think we've spoken before about Nicholas Apert or Apert

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.200
 so he was the man who started preserving foods by heating it a lot and then putting in an airtight

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.760
 container so this was in the Napoleonic Wars and there was a massive price on offer from the French

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.120
 army to anyone who could work out how to safely preserve food and keep it for a long period of time

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.080
 because it couldn't be done and he invented it and it was called appetization he and he put all

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.760
 his food in glass jars in fact not in tins so he won the prize and it was decades before microbe

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.880
 theory so he had invented safe food storage but he didn't know how it worked so good on that happens

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:19.440
 yeah and then later on there was a British innovator called Peter Durend and he invented giant tins

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.400
 so you know how you have a normal tin of beans or something it's a normal size he was keen to

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.840
 scale up for the Royal Navy and he stored up to 30 and a half kilos of meat in a single can

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.120
 I'm already going to go on the limb and say that's not an invention

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:39.280
 making a much much bigger version of something is already I couldn't I couldn't invent the giant

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.080
 book yeah exactly well not with that attitude yeah no we're talking about a Guinness World Record

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.600
 attempt aren't we think of it it's a giant it's a it's a it's a quarter of a person's size oh my god

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.280
 and he's showing us how big it is with his hands he's right it's an invention

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:03.360
 okay innovator he innovated it's very impressive though wasn't he the same guy

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:10.080
 wasn't this the one where it was like 30 years until they invented something to a specific tin

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.400
 opener didn't they yeah so in the Napoleon it was they all used their what those instruments

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.400
 called bananas yeah another name thing I came across I was looking up some cheese studies

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.120
 and there was a cheese study in the encyclopedia of food sciences and nutrition that was published

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:33.360
 in 2003 it was called cheeses colon processed cheese and the author was called a gooder

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:42.560
 no no yeah yeah what an unusual surname if you're surprised that there was a person called

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:50.000
 craft I know but I think you'd be biased if you were called gooder a proper cheese I'm not sure

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.120
 I would trust you to write a balanced article about process oh yeah you're right you know it's

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.360
 like being called baby bell and writing about the cheddar industry that is named after a guy called

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:06.080
 bell isn't it isn't it so I think the laughing cow company was founded by the bell brothers or

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.720
 maybe it was a father and son the surname was BEL so I think baby bell is named after a guy as well

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.960
 that's awesome at one point would have been a baby yeah so would the father actually yeah

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.600
 and the thing about laughing cow by the way which I did see is I went on the website and they have one

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.640
 top secret technology there that they've never given away to anyone else okay do you know what that is

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:35.280
 oh how to uh no so it's a couple of triangles is it folding the foil kind of yes is it the red

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.040
 thing how you get the red thing to peel off so hopefully it's the easy open foil wrapping technology

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.720
 which according to the website remains top secret to this day wow uh yeah it's not a

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:55.440
 technology that we're crying out that would be so useful that would be so useful for so many years

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.840
 yeah imagine if you had it for your clothes and whenever you needed to get undressed at the night

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.640
 you start to pull one red string you start completely undressed you've got that it's easy

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.880
 strip strip shows would be a lot shorter wouldn't there if there was one baby bells i'll peel off thing

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.280
 i found a weird thing about cheese humans invented cheese before they could digest milk

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:27.120
 okay what yeah okay so so all mammals you know they're lactose tolerant when they're very young

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.200
 because they're they're drinking their mother's milk and then all mammals are lactose intolerant

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.400
 you're almost all though and then humans only got the genetic mutation to

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:45.120
 to allow them to drink milk as adults a few thousand years ago but so we we couldn't digest lactose

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:51.200
 but cheese has much lower lactose than milk so if you make cheese you can store all the calories

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.440
 of the animal's milk in cheese form and that means you can keep the calories for longer so you'll

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.600
 survive longer so that gives you a reason to keep animals for longer rather than immediately

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.320
 killing them or hunting them so that means that you domesticate cheap and cows and all of this and

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.000
 you make cheese but you don't drink the milk but the thing is like to make the cheese

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.040
 is this not right that what you do is you get the milk and then you get the stomach of a dead animal

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.040
 and you put the milk inside the stomach because it's got acid which you need and then you leave it

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.360
 for weeks and weeks and weeks and then you eat it yeah i mean Adam was talking about

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.800
 things not being invented that is an invention half isn't it it is one of those things that

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.480
 required them to be incredibly bored and wouldn't be able to be invented now because we've

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.320
 all got better things to do than experiment with these bizarre things and the ancient Greeks used

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.360
 a great goat's cheese into their beer and wine one of the earliest wines actually the kind of

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:50.080
 peasant wine mentioned by Homer is actually wine and goat cheese which we could try and bring back

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.360
 i mean what would it taste like in cheese yeah why the cheese together but not one inside the other

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.080
 out of pasta you know what out of pasta you've got it you've got to hold a plate and you've got to

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.520
 hold a glass and it's really difficult if you need to use it you have a gesture yeah if you just put

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:09.600
 the cheese in the wine yeah i'm going to try that this Christmas who these are the Greeks or the

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.640
 Romans. The ancient Greeks. Do you think as I came here they was think we were really pretentious

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.640
 because you know if you go to some really post restaurants and they have deconstructed ex why is

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.040
 that like you have a deconstructed crumble where the crumbles on one side and do you know what i mean

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:29.920
 yeah well that yeah they'd come and say fucking deconstructed wine cheese drink wine on one side and

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:41.600
 cheese on the other. Okay it's time for fact number three and that is Andy my

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.760
 fact is that when Charles Darwin submitted on the origin of species to his publisher the publisher

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:55.920
 suggested he should rewrite it exclusively about pigeons. So I know so there's there's this article

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.760
 in the London Review of Books which is reviewing a book all about the publisher John Murray and the

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:07.120
 correspondence between authors and the publishers over centuries so it's got all these famous authors

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.960
 like Jane Austen and Lord Byron and David Livingstone and all these people and the firm sent on the

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.320
 origin of species out to two readers when it came in but one of them was a lawyer called George Pollock

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.520
 who said that it was beyond the apprehension of any living scientist and the other was this guy

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.560
 he called Wittwell Elwin who was a clergyman and he wrote back saying look I like Darwin but

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.160
 it's a wild and foolish piece of imagination and that it would really be a good book if you just

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:42.080
 write it about pigeons because he said everybody is interested in pigeons. So did when Elwin then

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.680
 Elwin sorry spoke to Murray right did Murray then go back to Darwin and say write it about pigeons

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.440
 that's what I couldn't work out or was it just a internal email kind of thing I don't know I don't

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.280
 know whether it got passed on to Darwin yeah but that that wouldn't involve ripping the whole thing

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.640
 to pieces because there's quite a lot of pigeon in there it's just a shutter book yeah it's a very

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.400
 slight edit he was he was really into pigeons though I hadn't quite realised how much of a pigeon

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.840
 fancier he was so he might have been flattered that his pigeon work was so inspiring he was a member

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.120
 of two London pigeon clubs two one's not enough your wife would be a bit annoyed wouldn't she you're

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:28.400
 spending your time at one pigeon club yeah the thing is with the pigeons like he was it was a bit

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.000
 like breeding dogs wasn't it like the pigeons were really weird looking like they they bred them

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.240
 to look not like pigeons yeah so they didn't look like the pigeons you see yeah yeah so like breeds

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.840
 that he worked on included the pygmy powder pigeon the Polish helmet pigeon the English long faced

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.840
 muffin tumbler classic if you look at these pictures yeah if you google them they don't look like

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.240
 pigeons at all there's one the English carrier pigeon which you don't see anymore it looks almost

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.600
 identical to jacobry smog does it really really does like honestly if you google it it just looks

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.080
 like jacobry spot you should put a picture on Twitter yeah because they're extinct aren't they so

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.000
 maybe he's actually the one surviving member of the species we need to start breeding him he's breeding

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.800
 glasses because there were these ones called powders which are really weird because they

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.760
 bred them to grow this the bizarre birds because they it looks like it's fallen a bowling ball

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.120
 basically it's got this huge they've got this huge lump under their under their chins as it were

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.760
 in their neck it's really strange well I find it weird that we're so used to are just very

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.200
 standard pigeons when there aren't there is this huge variety so if you go to pigeon contest and

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.680
 pigeon beauty patterns which you can they're quite big to the middle east in fact then they look almost

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.040
 nothing like pigeons a lot of them have that kind of gross turkey like red bulbous stuff around

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.440
 their eyes but yeah it's a very popular thing I think they've been big in the middle east since 1150

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:04.080
 when the first pigeon post service was set up in Baghdad and it took messages from Baghdad to Syria

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.280
 and by the 1160s then it was you know it was constantly taking messages back and forth to the

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.040
 extent that in the crusades the Christians brought loads of falcons over with them to try and intercept

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.560
 the pigeon post in the middle east so they were the first hackers who would grab their messages

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.280
 they also used to do a lot of homing pigeon races which still go on to this day but that's been going

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:31.440
 since the 1800s and I was reading about one in China that happened very recently and it's a huge

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.320
 prize for this it's a big deal in China so 160,000 American dollars would be the prize for the

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.680
 winning homing pigeon so they get sent a hundred miles away and they have to fly back to this spot

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:48.000
 and the fastest speed that a homing pigeon has ever done is it go they go about a hundred miles

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.920
 an hour what yeah but no way this is the this is clock speeds faster than a hundred miles an hour

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:02.400
 but the ones that won would have had to have gone 200 miles an hour the first four places and they

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.600
 couldn't work out how that was possible and it turns out what it was is the owners of the pigeons

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.760
 had them fly off but immediately come back hopped on a bullet train which can go 200 miles an hour

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.640
 get to the other side and release them and and they won but they have been caught and sent to prison

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.720
 I think that's I think that's such a silly cheat because you will be caught because pigeons don't fly

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.480
 200 miles that's exactly did you say they got sent to prison not the pigeons the humans still

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.840
 well it's a huge prize isn't it it's a 160,000 dollars so that's yeah yeah they go for a lot I think

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:40.640
 Chinese guy recently bought one for half a million dollars American dollars yeah they go for a huge amount

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.120
 I should say they were sentenced to three years but it was a suspended sentence so if another crime

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.920
 occurs then they go to prison do it again have you guys heard of the Spanish sport which is called

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:58.000
 it's thieving it's a pigeon thieving competition no no this is amazing so it's basically pigeon love

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.360
 island you get you you're a pigeon fancier and you have a male so half a dozen men each bring

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.400
 a male pigeon and they paint them in bright colors to mark which one is theirs and then

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.400
 there's a marked female and the male pigeons all compete to seduce the female and the aim is

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.920
 to get them to come home with them because this is a very unusual pigeon it's called the horseman

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:31.360
 thief powder and it unusually it makes by bringing it's made back to its place for sex and so

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:37.360
 how do you know that they're all fancy her though um I think cold pigeons just all fancy all other

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.440
 pigeons they are actually quite roundly aren't they're not these ones are not choosy yeah and so

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.680
 the owner wins if um his male is the one who wins the seduction competition with the female yeah

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.160
 that's amazing a little strut around and they you know they dance and they do little that's some

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:59.360
 that was some excellent pigeon strutting that and this happens in Scotland too it's called um do

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.360
 basically the pigeons are called doos d double o and if you if you see a pigeon flying up and you

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.080
 know that one of your rival doom and has released their pigeon you release your pigeon of the opposite

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.720
 sex and then there's this battle in the skies over who goes back to whose place and if you and if

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.200
 the pigeon comes back to your place you get to keep both pigeons it must be confusing because they're

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.800
 completely painted right so that's almost the equivalent human wise of going to a Halloween party

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.360
 and fancying someone who's just come as a skeleton but but you get on well and then the next morning

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:40.880
 and you're like oh you put them away pigeons were the first drones in a way weren't they or some of

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:49.200
 the first drones in that there was in 1907 this guy called dr. Julius Nurbronner uh which I will

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.960
 have pronounced incorrectly sorry but he was a German apothecary and he invented the pigeon camera

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.840
 and this was a very exciting adventure at the time it was thought to be quite revolutionary because

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.240
 a couple of cameras have been sent up on balloons and stuff but this was really acting like a proper

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.400
 drone so he'd strap it like a backpack onto the pigeon's chest like a chest pack and send them off

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.680
 to fly fly through the air and they took amazing aerial photographs it's so worth looking at them they

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:21.360
 are like beautiful pictures and I hadn't really considered that for most people seeing those was

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.840
 bizarre because they've never seen pictures taken from above oh yeah there's a whole school of

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:33.520
 first world war artists which or post first world war art which is derived from aerial photography

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.120
 and aerial landscapes because it just wasn't a I guess you saw maps but you could see it from the

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.960
 top of the hill or something but in fact from that you'd never you'd never be able to see a city

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:51.840
 from a bunch of you yeah yeah exactly he also actually invented a horse drawn dove cut you know a

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.280
 home for the pigeons and doves that he was trapping the cameras to and dark room which is quite

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.080
 cool to go with the pigeon cameras so that when you thought I suddenly want to photograph this city

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.800
 you'd take your whole horse drawn dove cut and dark room inside to where it was and then you could

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:13.520
 send them off just one last quick thing on Darwin maybe you guys all knew this but I didn't realize

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:20.000
 that in the origin of the species in the sick edition he added a new chapter which was responding

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.840
 to all the criticisms from previous editions of his book oh really I think that's such a good idea

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.400
 that's a great idea nice great we should do that with the book of the year yeah I think you'll find

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:37.440
 the wasp article is funny how many people wrote in saying not enough pigeons did you have

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:44.960
 I just have one last thing it's not great but I'll mention it anyway oh yeah

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:53.440
 buckle up this is just a fact on publishers getting it wrong so in this fact it's the pigeon suggestion

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:59.120
 this has just happened in Australia there's a business woman and socialite called Roxy Jacenco

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.800
 and she's just released a book now she's a she's very famous as a PR specialist and she was on

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.680
 celebrity apprentice in Australia so she's a she's a big name there and so the book is described

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:15.200
 as a no bullshit guide to PR social media and building your brand and it had all these glowing

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.760
 reviews on it being street smart and hard-headed totally tenacious PR expert but they've had to

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.080
 pulp every single one of the copies of the book because it also included as a result of the publisher's

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.600
 mistake a quote that was a misquote that said on the front that the book never fails to disappoint

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.600
 so medsay never fails to deliver but yeah total PR disaster

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.080
 time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact my fact this week is that King Louis the 13th

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:54.880
 of France had a royal anagramist wow yeah this was like you know you'd have a court jester

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.760
 and then you would also have your royal anagramist who would just be there ready to make anagrams

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.960
 for the amusement of the king that that really was the role um he uh he did a number of things with

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:14.880
 anagrams it wasn't just a musing name uh remixes it was uh he used to do prophecies as well using anagrams

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.760
 and yeah so it had a lot of had a lot of mystical purposes as well as I wonder if he could make an

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.760
 anagram of Louis the 13 because there's an X and three eyes in there yeah it's pretty so fun if

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.600
 you can do that he deserves a gel you get six I've got the word six there from Louis and then the X

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:39.520
 and then you've got L.O.U and there's three eyes you've got we in French yeah six L.I.I

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:45.600
 I always I'm really bad at doing anagrams because I always end up with spare elites means uh or

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.920
 in Russian the Romans supposedly there's a there's a thing called ars magna the great art and supposedly

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.200
 the Romans called anagraming ars magna which is an anagram of the word anagrams but I don't

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.800
 think they used I don't think they knew the word anagrams because they didn't have a plural form

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.840
 like which just adds an S to the main noun normally there are a few weird ones where it does but

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.840
 anyway I don't think that is true but it does come from the Greek anagrama design from anna which

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.480
 means backwards a grammar which means letter so it's putting the letters backwards anna with one end

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:25.760
 though guys not the two ends which is which means excellent anna meaning backwards considering

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:34.880
 that anna is a palindrome it's quite weird isn't it yeah that is weird anyway so what about this guy

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:40.480
 who was he oh so yeah so we're talking the 1600s here this is one King Louis the 13th reigned um

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.160
 and this person um I don't actually know if he had a number of them uh but the one person you

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:52.560
 can find who definitely was one of his royal anagrams was Thomas Billon so he lived from 1617 to

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.320
 1647 and he served as the royal anagramist twice so there's a suggestion that there might have been

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.120
 another person fulfilling the role in between actually there was a royal sudoku guy in between

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:13.200
 so he did it from 1624 to 1631 and then from 1640 till his death I guess in 1647 maybe he was

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:19.120
 fired in 31 because he had a leftover letter or something but he also he predicted people's characters

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:25.680
 so he would rearrange the letters of your name and if it came out as being you know an evil phrase

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.120
 then people would think badly of you do you think as a parent if you were having a new child

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.080
 you would deliberately come up with a good word like an anagram of you call your child like an

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:43.040
 anagram of awesome yes yeah you were trying trick it I'm a soury no we're soury yes this is something

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.600
 that I think we might have mentioned on qi and one of our researchers found the other day again

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.600
 but that during the whole enlightenment anagrams was something that fascinated people they were

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.840
 thought to pull ten certain things like you say if your name could spell something bad but also

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:01.280
 they were used by lots of scientists as a way of concealing their discoveries whilst also kind of

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:07.280
 stamping them as their own so people like Galileo and a robot hook would record their initial results

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.320
 as an anagram and send it off when they hadn't actually confirmed their results yet because that

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.600
 meant once they confirmed the results they could say look I did it first look here's the anagram

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.480
 proof it's like blockchain I imagine even though I don't really know what blockchain is

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:26.160
 many of them I imagine it is too but the the anagrams were exceptionally poor weren't they

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:34.400
 were they yeah so christian hygans he discovered the rings around Saturn and he wanted an anagram

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:42.320
 um so he wanted to anagram anuto singitor tenuay pleno nusquam coherente ad ecliptam

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:47.120
 inclinato which means it is surrounded by a thin flat ring nowhere touching inclined to the

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:57.280
 elliptic so he wanted to make that okay his anagram was a a a a a a a a c c c c c c d e e e e e e g h

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.840
 he basically put all the letters in help yeah that's a good even trying it's not even trying that's

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:08.160
 ready that's right yeah that's not an anagram is it that's like the well we said a few weeks ago the

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:13.280
 crosswords answers in that to be actual words yeah the anagram has to be an actual word christian

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.480
 god that was an easy job then if that's all you had to do random things well there are kind of

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.880
 different types of anagram this is according to a book was reading for about a hundred years ago

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.920
 I think which is saying you get a synagram which is kind of like that but a synagram is an anagram

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.920
 where the anagram means the same sort of thing so vial is a synagram of evil or anger'd have

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.080
 been raged eleven plus two and twelve plus one is that one blows my yeah so yeah every time it's

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.560
 always yeah always a winner but imagine if you thought that there were hidden things in anagrams

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.480
 you would use those as examples of like yeah look at look how connected the universe is when we

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.680
 reshuffle this stuff I would have bought into that immediately great there's a website called

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:59.920
 anagrammy dot com which has a monthly award so the archbishop of canterbury is another church

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:07.440
 it's type of rabbi mmm nice um the amateur thespians is an anagram of in apt hams use theater

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:13.280
 really like and do they do they release of a something they want an anagram made of or you

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.520
 just submitting I think you submit your own right okay and they pick a really good one each month

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:22.320
 so they're synagrams they're synagrams and then you get anti-grams which are the ones that

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:29.680
 mean the opposite uh so like diplomacy is mad policy there's a Guinness World record for the

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:36.240
 longest anagram that you can get in the English language and this this is for a non-scientific

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:43.520
 English word because in the scientific ones they they're pretty bizarre so in a non-scientific word

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.240
 I have known that in the past but I can't remember it now okay so I'll give you I'll give you

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.920
 the the original word and see if you can make the anagram so conversationalists oh yeah

00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:00.400
 what is the anagram a conservationist yeah oh that's a cheat I think you should have to rearrange

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:07.520
 at least four letters yeah it's making up rules on the fly yeah I'm allowed yeah it is a bit

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.400
 bit measly isn't it what about scone and cones yeah so that's currently the record no

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.120
 what is why is that not good enough I think they should have to begin with a different letter

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.360
 scone and cones yeah yeah okay I'll accept scone and cones but I'm not with that right off the

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:28.000
 bat like just did you yeah I didn't even have to think about have you heard of Corey Kell Hoon

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.640
 nope he's an anagrammer I don't think he's a pro but he's bad as close as the modern age gets to

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.240
 a pro anagrammer so he rearranged the first line of hamlets soliloquy to come up with a summary

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:47.280
 of hamlet so as in just to be or not to be no let's see if it passes the anotest for crazy

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.040
 anagram so to be or not to be that is the question whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.640
 slings and arrows of outrageous fortune okay that he rearranged to make in one of the bar's best

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:01.920
 thought of tragedies our insistent hero hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:09.520
 that's very good that's really nice so good there's another thing that gets done where these

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.360
 kind of big challenges where people try to take complete texts and create an anagram that works

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.800
 so that it just works as a whole separate work if that makes sense so the biggest one that's ever

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:26.160
 been completed is a guy called Mike Keith has anagrammed the complete text of Moby Dick so that's

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.680
 yeah nine hundred thirty five thousand seven hundred and sixty three letters and he used a computer

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.960
 to do this so that's seen as a cheat yeah but there was a person who did do it all by himself which

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.160
 was Richard Brody and he made an anagram of battle of the books by Jonathan Swift and that's 42,000

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:48.640
 letters 142,177 letters but how much of a different anagram does it be could you have the exact

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:58.720
 same book but it just call me maleish so the the ancient Greeks had this is kind of related so it's

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:06.560
 about palindromes not anagrams but Greek fountains had a big palindrome written on them which said

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:13.920
 nispon anominata mi mon an obsin so that's exactly the same backwards as it is forwards and it means

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.160
 wash the sin as well as the face that's a good one that's cool for a fountain yeah very good I do

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.160
 know what the lung is palindrome in the English language it's gone it's redevider

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:31.360
 redevider oh cool just a fact that's good fact did you guys know the Dutch national anthem

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.840
 is an acrostic as in the first letter of each word spell something out the first letter of each line

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.440
 spell something out so the first letter of sorry the first letter of each of the 15 verses

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:49.040
 spells out William Van Nassau as in William of Orange's name because and it's sung from his

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.480
 perspective so it's all in the first person bizarrely when you're Dutch you all sing as if

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:57.200
 you're William of Orange when you sing the anthem isn't there a line where he kind of says and I

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:04.880
 give everything to the king of Spain in that I think there is yeah so good yeah how weird and they

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.360
 were trying to change it I think but now you can't really otherwise the acrostic won't work doesn't work

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:16.640
 yeah it's covered there was a guy called Andre Pujon and this was back in the day when everyone

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.560
 thought that anagrams were really important and they had some kind of spiritual thing behind them

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:31.200
 he worked out that his name was an anagram of Pondu de Réon which means hanged in Réon and so

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:38.400
 he decided to fulfill his destiny by traveling to the town of Réon and committing criminal offence

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.640
 which meant that he was hanged wow um so he actually you know made sure that the omen happened

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.960
 right oh poor guy oh no silly silly man there could have been there could have been another

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:58.000
 ionagram he might have found where it said had a relaxing holiday somewhere else yeah yeah I mean

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.800
 it probably is just a story isn't it but it is a story that exists and that's the bar we've decided

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:11.200
 um so there's an anagram thinking our book as well in the book of the year there's a there's

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.320
 a thing about Banksy because he submitted an artwork to the Royal Academy under the name Brian

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:22.080
 S. Garkman which is an anagram of the words Banksy Anagram and they did not spot it they rejected it

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.480
 and then they asked him can he submit a work they just got in touch with the banks he said

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.640
 can you submit a work of art and he sent them the thing that they had already rejected and they

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:37.040
 accepted it would they have been expected to spot an anagram do people actually have an anagram

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:48.080
 pass over everything that's submitted this is an anagram of mobility nice try buddy supposedly if you

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.240
 are asked to solve anagrams against a green background and then against a red background you'll

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:59.280
 do worse on the red background really this has been tried and um the people who were exposed

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.400
 to the red background anagrams did substantially worse is that because the text was in red on both

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:12.560
 times black text um sorry so is that sorry i misunderstood so it's um there's a piece of paper

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:18.000
 that is red yes right and it's got anagram it's got anagrams in black that need to be solved

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:27.120
 as black as the devil's nut sack it's not it's it's the devil's nutting bag no the language is

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:34.080
 evolved at this point it's a nut sack there was another paper that suggests that it's easier to

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:41.200
 solve anagrams while you're laying down rather than standing up right no yeah i think that's true

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.720
 because there's more blood flow in your head because this the red green thing is crazy it suggests

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:52.560
 that if you do worse on the red that you're sensitive to the queue of danger you think the

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.640
 sound of grams are dangerous you know it must be just that you can't see black on red as well as

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.840
 you can see no it's not i tried it and actually i did better on the ones with the red background

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.240
 that the green ones so i would have been an anomaly you're so brave does that mean you should

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:18.960
