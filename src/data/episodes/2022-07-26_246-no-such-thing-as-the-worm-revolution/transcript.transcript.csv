00:00:00,00:00:20,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anitz Zitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:29,00:00:34,James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:34,00:00:41,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with you, James."""
00:00:41,00:00:47,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is a special language in Papu New Guinea that is only used"
00:00:47,00:00:56,when gathering nuts. It's very weird. So can you only use it when gathering nuts?
00:00:56,00:00:59,Actually picking the nut or when you're on your way to pick the nut or when you...
00:00:59,00:01:06,In the general nut picking area. So if you try and use it outside the area where the trees are
00:01:06,00:01:10,then there's a worry that mountain spirits might come down and investigate and then cause problems
00:01:10,00:01:15,"with the nuts. And basically this is a taboo language, this is relatively common around the world"
00:01:15,00:01:20,and you change your language whenever you're doing anything as a superstition and eventually it becomes
00:01:20,00:01:25,an actual language or an actual vocabulary of more than a thousand words in this case.
00:01:25,00:01:29,And what's the idea that the spirits will steal the nuts from you? What's the fear here?
00:01:29,00:01:35,So some some normal words that you might use like say I don't know I'm making these up but like
00:01:35,00:01:41,wither or dry or dead or whatever they might be bad for the plants they might be unhealthy for the
00:01:41,00:01:47,plants and so you have to use alternative words that wouldn't be generally unhealthy to the plants.
00:01:47,00:01:53,And is this if you were going to be part of the nut gathering unit would you have to study
00:01:53,00:01:58,this language or does everyone know this language? That's a really good point I don't know but I
00:01:58,00:02:02,imagine they teach it to you is probably not the first thing you learn. It's probably more like a
00:02:02,00:02:07,second language. Yeah I think. So it's really weird there seem to be two different kinds of belief.
00:02:07,00:02:12,One is that there's a spirit called keto made who can rip people apart but that's only one
00:02:12,00:02:17,group of people that's only one social group because there are loads of different groups all over
00:02:17,00:02:20,New Guinea and lots of them gather the nuts and they travel in from the coast to the mountains to
00:02:20,00:02:26,get to the nut area and the other is that as you say that if you talk about wet things then all
00:02:26,00:02:31,the nuts you find will be really wet and if you use words like empty or bitter same deal but it's
00:02:31,00:02:34,too complete separate beliefs about why you have to use this language it's wet. So then you have a
00:02:34,00:02:39,euphemism for empty or bitter or wet but then that starts to mean that so then surely that
00:02:39,00:02:43,becomes bad luck and then you've got to make a new one right. So this is a thing called
00:02:43,00:02:49,perjuration and it happens in English as well so for example the word for the toilet in the 15th
00:02:49,00:02:56,century was privy and then that was replaced by a euphemism but then which was it was raised by bog house
00:02:56,00:03:01,which I didn't know that was the polite way you'd say it instead of privy because privy was rude
00:03:01,00:03:06,and then toilet but then toilet becomes rude so then lavatory and now in America it's restroom
00:03:06,00:03:10,but as soon as people really associate restroom as soon as that becomes the rude word they'll have
00:03:10,00:03:14,to think of another even more remote. So what is it in Britain then? I think bathroom people say
00:03:14,00:03:18,bathroom to be polite don't they? Yeah but it will move on should we make a new one quickly now?
00:03:18,00:03:23,Can we not go back to bog house? Yeah the privy oh sorry the bog house
00:03:23,00:03:32,Only when you're around the queen. In a similar vein our word for bear in the middle ages
00:03:32,00:03:37,was taboo because so it probably came from ursus so you know obviously you have some
00:03:37,00:03:40,ursumager and stuff and that's the Latin for bear but because bears were big scary things it was
00:03:40,00:03:45,thought to bring bear rage upon you if you said their name so people would refer to them as
00:03:45,00:03:50,the brown one or the shaggy one and so the word for bear comes from the word for brown it's like
00:03:50,00:03:56,bro and in china you can't say the word tiger in some places so if you're speaking about a
00:03:56,00:04:00,man-eating tiger you'll use a different word often referred to as big insect.
00:04:00,00:04:08,There's a massive insect down the road. I think you'd be more terrified if someone said there's
00:04:08,00:04:13,a large insect behind you and you turned around and it was a tiger. I would say just give them
00:04:13,00:04:18,the warning straight out so it's to prevent it from coming into the village so you don't if there's
00:04:18,00:04:23,a tiger behind you you probably say tiger but it's if you say big insect then it won't hear
00:04:23,00:04:28,its name and it won't come down oh yeah so it won't know it's been summoned so you'll get summoned
00:04:28,00:04:35,instead loads of big insects yes at least there's no such insects yeah. In Papua New Guinea so this
00:04:35,00:04:40,language even though this is language purely for picking up nuts the diversity of language in Papua
00:04:40,00:04:45,New Guinea is extraordinary I think it's the highest diversity in the world so they have over 800
00:04:45,00:04:53,"languages, 850 languages and they have so much this is what's crazy population versus the amount"
00:04:53,00:04:58,of languages that they have there's this thing called the greenberg greenberg's diversity index
00:04:58,00:05:03,which charts how much diversity language is in per country it says Papua New Guinea holds the top
00:05:03,00:05:09,spot it is so diverse there that the probability of two random people selected in the country any two
00:05:09,00:05:15,random people if they were brought to each other to talk to each other there's a 98.8% chance that
00:05:15,00:05:23,they won't speak the same language. Isn't that crazy? That's a bad speed dating day. Yeah so how do
00:05:23,00:05:28,you have courts and things like that how do you have schools? They must have a national language of
00:05:28,00:05:33,let's say English yeah yeah exactly they've got they've actually got four official languages in
00:05:33,00:05:38,Papua New Guinea the fourth being sign language as the official language but that's exactly what it is
00:05:38,00:05:42,everyone speaks a main language and then these are all other languages that are slowly going
00:05:42,00:05:46,extinct and one or two speakers left. Yeah because they've got English that's very widely spoken
00:05:46,00:05:52,there and then they've got Taco Pisin haven't they which is Pigeon talk so just Pigeon English which
00:05:52,00:05:57,is great and I just love all kinds of Pigeon English or kind of Creole when you read them because
00:05:57,00:06:03,it's such a funny warping of what we say so the word for broken in Taco Pisin is Bagarapim which
00:06:03,00:06:11,is Bagarap from Bagarap that's what you know now say broken um MT tin is a person who talks nonsense
00:06:11,00:06:18,you know like an empty person like an empty vessel an empty vessel exactly Sue Sock man is a
00:06:18,00:06:25,sophisticated person why James might know this oh James you always wear Sock Socks is that it?
00:06:25,00:06:31,you always say there's a phrase that you used to say when you're growing up to say that someone's
00:06:31,00:06:38,bit well to do oh look at you with your matching shoes same thing Sue Sock man means
00:06:38,00:06:44,person with shoes and socks oh look at you look at you we have matching shoes here you go you fit
00:06:44,00:06:49,right in I didn't know that Papi New Guinea is the second largest island in the world I didn't
00:06:49,00:06:54,know that either it depends what you count as an island of course it's very true yeah if you count
00:06:54,00:06:59,Eurasia as an island fuck down to three but sorry it doesn't include Australia it doesn't
00:06:59,00:07:05,it looks great yeah after I think it's after Greenland yeah it's um the country is called Papi New Guinea
00:07:05,00:07:09,the whole island is called New Guinea but the western half of it which is part of Indonesia
00:07:09,00:07:15,is Papua and West Papua well yeah and then you also have Guinea and Guinea Bissell right and Guiana
00:07:15,00:07:20,yeah absolutely Germany I have mixed up
00:07:22,00:07:27,I looked up a couple more taboos oh yeah so this is an interesting one there's an Ethiopian language
00:07:27,00:07:34,called Cambata and it's got marital linguistic taboos that's quite common isn't it yeah so a woman
00:07:34,00:07:41,can't use some married women follow the system which is called Balecia and it means that they are not
00:07:41,00:07:46,allowed to use words that begin with the same syllable as your father-in-law's name or your mother-in-law's
00:07:46,00:07:53,name so so my mother-in-law is called Natalia so you wouldn't be able to talk about Natajek Toads
00:07:53,00:07:58,you wouldn't be able to talk about Natajek Toads at all you'd have nothing to say yeah
00:07:58,00:08:04,you'd have to coin a completely different word for them I just call them Toads Toads yeah yeah
00:08:04,00:08:11,so it's not a problem for James which is great what what um what syllable would you not be allowed to
00:08:11,00:08:16,use um liel liel so you wouldn't be able to talk about the northern french city right
00:08:16,00:08:27,where is this yoro star going to oh you'll see when we got there
00:08:27,00:08:37,yeah that's really cool well there's another kind of gender-based specific language I was looking at
00:08:37,00:08:41,in Nigeria actually so I guess the thing you're talking about as a language specific to one thing
00:08:41,00:08:47,yeah and this is a language in the uban community in Nigeria and they have different languages for men
00:08:47,00:08:52,and women and they say they think they're the only tribe in the world who has this that would be
00:08:52,00:08:59,even worse for speed dating wouldn't they I don't know how it works and it's also bizarre because
00:08:59,00:09:03,when people are born then you get raised by your mother and your sisters and generally women
00:09:03,00:09:06,so everyone speaks the women's language but then apparently there was an interview with one of
00:09:06,00:09:11,the tribal leaders who said that as boys start reaching adolescence they just start speaking the
00:09:11,00:09:17,male language and it's completely different I mean the words are utterly different and he's like
00:09:17,00:09:22,if boys don't start speaking the male language then we consider them a bit abnormal so it was a
00:09:22,00:09:27,kick what a rough adolescence is that you're like shit I've got to sort of memorize secretly this
00:09:27,00:09:31,language I'm supposed to miraculously start speaking we talk about toxic masculinity in this country
00:09:31,00:09:35,don't we but yeah that is pretty bad you know sometimes when you're at a restaurant and you see a
00:09:35,00:09:41,couple who just don't speak to each other the whole meal yeah I presume every restaurant is like that
00:09:41,00:09:49,relationships are constantly awkward so the so the meals can still speak the yeah they can understand
00:09:49,00:09:54,each other they're just not allowed to speak each other's language anymore no I was reading about
00:09:54,00:10:00,a secret language that was used in wartime in Canada and it was very cleverly done because it was
00:10:00,00:10:06,it's a secret language in that not many people spoke it so they were in the Canadian army they enlisted
00:10:06,00:10:12,these Native North Americans and they were they spoke Cree and Cree was a language that barely
00:10:12,00:10:17,anyone speaks it's only these these people and so what they used to do is in between battalions they
00:10:17,00:10:22,would have Cree speakers and any messages that they needed to send across it was those people who
00:10:22,00:10:26,took it so if they were caught there was no way of getting the information out of them because
00:10:26,00:10:33,the language barrier was so great so yeah but the problem was is that Cree didn't have words for the
00:10:33,00:10:40,things that they needed to get across so things like they had you know tanks machine guns and bombers
00:10:40,00:10:45,so a machine gun they had to translate into their language which is little gun that shoots fast
00:10:45,00:10:50,or a fighter bomber would be the Cree word for mosquito because that was the that was the best way
00:10:50,00:10:56,of explaining it so yeah they had to invent new words and new phrases in order to do this so cool
00:10:56,00:11:00,that's interesting because there were planes called mosquitoes weren't there that's right yeah yeah
00:11:00,00:11:06,yeah yeah one of those but they the ones that were slightly made of wood yes they were I'm pretty
00:11:06,00:11:12,sure that was my thing I think yes or partly wouldn't frame that's very cool I have some stuff on
00:11:12,00:11:19,gathering nuts oh right so don't go gathering hazel nuts on September the 21st in Birmingham why
00:11:19,00:11:28,because that is devil's nutting day apparently according to an old folklore satan comes out at that
00:11:28,00:11:34,time and he collects his nuts on September the 21st so you leave it for him to do and where's
00:11:34,00:11:40,this Birmingham it's in the West Midlands basically and there's an old saying of something being dirty
00:11:40,00:11:44,in Birmingham you would say it's the colour of the devil's nutting bag
00:11:46,00:11:51,you're ever in Birmingham a bit of locals like for you to use yeah that's going to go down like an
00:11:51,00:12:01,absolute charm coolest kid of the party just on nut gathering it's quite dangerous sometimes
00:12:01,00:12:10,isn't it so if you're gathering big nuts then they can fall on you and that is a genuine
00:12:10,00:12:17,dang coconut I picture nuts on the ground as opposed to in the tree so no sorry yeah from
00:12:17,00:12:20,the tree okay coconut obviously it's not like you're just crawling on the ground you keep bumping
00:12:20,00:12:28,into nuts but I like the so gathering Brazil nuts then foragers wear hats and they don't collect
00:12:28,00:12:33,the more windy days and stuff like that but I didn't realize that they when they fall out of trees
00:12:33,00:12:38,they fall from so high that they'll bury themselves 30 centimetres into the ground so when you're not
00:12:38,00:12:42,gathering for Brazil nuts then you're digging up the ground yeah the nut inside isn't that weird
00:12:42,00:12:48,because they're quite spiky are they Brazil nuts they are on the outside yeah so trekking
00:12:48,00:12:53,they're made like that so that they because it's quite clever if you're a nut isn't it to kind of
00:12:53,00:12:57,go directly to the ground not have to get trampled in because that's what you want to be in the end
00:12:57,00:13:02,yeah absolutely yeah if you're a verb that must be terrifying if you're one going through the soil
00:13:02,00:13:08,and suddenly these like daggers are coming down I mean they're great lacing your friend in half
00:13:08,00:13:15,and now you've got two friends that says quite nice the only species we're watching your
00:13:15,00:13:20,friend be cut in half it's quite nice got the one French revolution would have been really weird
00:13:20,00:13:28,we've doubled the aristocrats the word James Bond where the laser comes down it just cuts
00:13:28,00:13:43,if it's a two James Bond snowmessers Bond okay there's time for fact number two and that is Anna
00:13:43,00:13:49,my fact this week is that the man who worked out how to stop soft cheese going moldy came from a place
00:13:49,00:13:59,called mold so I know just before this we started recording we asked it saying that it's pronounced
00:13:59,00:14:07,mold yeah mold yeah I think I said mold so it's a phrase called mold it's in Norway and you
00:14:07,00:14:12,you you sort of say it molder but it's still got the word molding it I mean it is still quite
00:14:12,00:14:19,amazing this is a great fact written down yeah it looks pretty good if as long as you spell moldy
00:14:19,00:14:27,American way so if you're reading this podcast then great so this was a Norwegian cheese make he
00:14:27,00:14:33,was called Olaf Cavley and yeah he grew up in this municipality in Norway and he was actually
00:14:33,00:14:38,really old when he invented Primula which is that do you laugh because I pronounce it old not
00:14:38,00:14:47,older he ended up inventing Primula which is you know that cheese that you see that comes in a
00:14:47,00:14:54,squeezy tube I think it probably is pronounced Primula and in fact it's named after Primrose's because
00:14:54,00:14:59,he thought the beautiful yellow color was reminded him of the beautiful yellow of yellow Primrose
00:14:59,00:15:06,so Primula makes a lot more sense anyway yeah he discovered this and then he got really rich and he
00:15:06,00:15:12,I quite like this because it gives us all hope for our future later years of being finally successful
00:15:12,00:15:18,rather hanging out with you dogs because he was in his 60s when he came up with this he just ran
00:15:18,00:15:24,this delicatessen I mean it's not good for your next 30 years I'm out of his head 30 years of
00:15:24,00:15:29,hanging around with those dogs it's so nice to invent some cheese yeah right I'm not going to
00:15:29,00:15:36,last that long he actually lived to a hundred lived in 1958 and also a good thing to know about
00:15:36,00:15:41,Primula and I'm actually going to start buying it is that all well know that you can pronounce it
00:15:41,00:15:49,but all the profits go to charity go to causes because he was a massive philanthropist and then his
00:15:49,00:15:54,son was and didn't have any offspring and so set up the company which is the I think it's called
00:15:54,00:16:00,the Cavalry Trust and it's legally required to donate all its profits to scientific humanitarian
00:16:00,00:16:05,wow wow cool but yeah cheese and stopping cheese going moldy it's been a problem for centuries
00:16:06,00:16:14,that just on the place called molder mold it's name comes from the word mold without any on the end
00:16:14,00:16:20,it's a plural form of that place and the word mold in Norwegian means either fertile soil
00:16:20,00:16:29,skull or mold it might actually it might actually be mold so that I was looking up moldy
00:16:29,00:16:34,cheeses or soft cheeses so there's a cheese called kuga gold which is made in Washington state
00:16:34,00:16:42,university and this is really weird so it's canned soft cheese but it the it's canned when it's
00:16:42,00:16:47,still in the curd form so it develops as it ages as in it's not once it's gone into the
00:16:47,00:16:52,can it doesn't stay the same yeah wow so the lactic acid bacteria inside they don't need oxygen
00:16:52,00:16:57,so the flavor keeps developing and there are fans who age their cans for years and years before
00:16:57,00:17:07,opening them and it's just curts I think it goes in as curd no way nobody yeah no yes it was too good
00:17:07,00:17:16,I just had to sit back in them and just stare in awe I can now looking back when you said 30 more
00:17:16,00:17:26,years I said I'm done yeah that's that's really cool so there's no use by date on it presumably I
00:17:26,00:17:30,maybe there is for safety is then maybe after a certain number of years it does go off but I'm not sure
00:17:30,00:17:37,so when process cheese came about which this is an example of then it was very controversial
00:17:37,00:17:43,because it threatened the normal cheese market and there were actually a lot of cheese makers in
00:17:43,00:17:49,America who said it should be called embalmed cheese which it was almost named but I hadn't quite
00:17:49,00:17:53,realized that it's just a blend of lots of other cheeses which I think most people will but like
00:17:53,00:18:00,off-cuts of the cheese-making process so for instance I think American cheese you know your classic
00:18:00,00:18:07,"American process cheese is a combination of bits of cheddar, colby, provolone, things like that"
00:18:07,00:18:11,and they're credible and then they add sodium phosphate which kind of makes it all go
00:18:11,00:18:18,goopy yeah and that but quite easy to slice and that was invented American cheese by Canadian
00:18:18,00:18:25,of course who is James Lewis Kraft of Kraft fame Kraft cheese yeah he was a Canadian and he kind of
00:18:25,00:18:31,came up with this idea of kind of shredding it and then adding this stuff which makes it kind of
00:18:31,00:18:37,cutable yeah so it's kind of a Franken cheese yeah and they pasteurise it so it doesn't ripen so
00:18:37,00:18:42,it's not it's really not proper cheese as we the French might know it by the time it's been
00:18:42,00:18:48,so for instance Belvita has to be called pasteurised prepared cheese product it does did you know
00:18:48,00:18:54,that's only since the early 90s which is when they finally worked out a way to make the base not
00:18:54,00:19:00,real cheese at Kraft so it was a really exciting moment because instead of like using just this
00:19:00,00:19:05,mixture of cheese and then adding this sodium phosphate and stuff they worked out way of cracking milk
00:19:05,00:19:09,which I didn't know was a thing but basically this is you add little bits of plastic membrane into
00:19:09,00:19:15,milk and it causes all the milk particles to separate and it separates out into its milk protein lumps
00:19:15,00:19:20,and the mix is kind of concentrated protein and that can be the base for their cheese and it was at
00:19:20,00:19:23,that moment when some inspectors went around their factories and they weren't guys you're not using
00:19:23,00:19:28,cheese anymore I'm afraid you have to call it cheese products how do they come up with this
00:19:28,00:19:34,shit yeah so is I always think the other day I found out this is completely off topic but early
00:19:34,00:19:40,cars had white tires right and the only reason that we have tires that are black is because you add
00:19:40,00:19:46,something called I think it's called black carbon which is just this tiny bit of weird carbon that
00:19:46,00:19:50,they manage to get from their industrial process and they just like let's just try it with rubber
00:19:50,00:19:57,"and it turned out to make rubber 10,000 times more solid than normal but even on that I was like how"
00:19:57,00:20:02,do you even think of that yeah and they just trying everything or what I can't believe early cars had
00:20:02,00:20:08,white tires that's not so cool but an absolute nightmare to keep clean it's actually you would just
00:20:08,00:20:12,naturally have a black tire after a week yeah it'd be as dirty as the devil's nuts at me
00:20:12,00:20:17,sorry I just checked nutting bag
00:20:17,00:20:23,don't embarrass yourself in Birmingham am I getting that wrong I'm just thinking the difference
00:20:23,00:20:28,between your brain and mind jabs is that you're fascinated by the fact that all these processes go on
00:20:28,00:20:36,and I'm still busy here going wow there was an actual guy called craft so I looked off a bit
00:20:36,00:20:42,about food preservation have we I don't think we've spoken before about Nicholas Apert or Apert
00:20:42,00:20:47,so he was the man who started preserving foods by heating it a lot and then putting in an airtight
00:20:47,00:20:51,container so this was in the Napoleonic Wars and there was a massive price on offer from the French
00:20:51,00:20:57,army to anyone who could work out how to safely preserve food and keep it for a long period of time
00:20:57,00:21:02,because it couldn't be done and he invented it and it was called appetization he and he put all
00:21:02,00:21:07,his food in glass jars in fact not in tins so he won the prize and it was decades before microbe
00:21:07,00:21:12,theory so he had invented safe food storage but he didn't know how it worked so good on that happens
00:21:12,00:21:19,yeah and then later on there was a British innovator called Peter Durend and he invented giant tins
00:21:19,00:21:24,so you know how you have a normal tin of beans or something it's a normal size he was keen to
00:21:24,00:21:29,scale up for the Royal Navy and he stored up to 30 and a half kilos of meat in a single can
00:21:29,00:21:33,I'm already going to go on the limb and say that's not an invention
00:21:33,00:21:39,making a much much bigger version of something is already I couldn't I couldn't invent the giant
00:21:39,00:21:46,book yeah exactly well not with that attitude yeah no we're talking about a Guinness World Record
00:21:46,00:21:51,attempt aren't we think of it it's a giant it's a it's a it's a quarter of a person's size oh my god
00:21:51,00:21:55,and he's showing us how big it is with his hands he's right it's an invention
00:21:55,00:22:03,okay innovator he innovated it's very impressive though wasn't he the same guy
00:22:03,00:22:10,wasn't this the one where it was like 30 years until they invented something to a specific tin
00:22:10,00:22:14,opener didn't they yeah so in the Napoleon it was they all used their what those instruments
00:22:14,00:22:20,called bananas yeah another name thing I came across I was looking up some cheese studies
00:22:21,00:22:27,and there was a cheese study in the encyclopedia of food sciences and nutrition that was published
00:22:27,00:22:33,in 2003 it was called cheeses colon processed cheese and the author was called a gooder
00:22:33,00:22:42,no no yeah yeah what an unusual surname if you're surprised that there was a person called
00:22:42,00:22:50,craft I know but I think you'd be biased if you were called gooder a proper cheese I'm not sure
00:22:50,00:22:55,I would trust you to write a balanced article about process oh yeah you're right you know it's
00:22:55,00:22:59,like being called baby bell and writing about the cheddar industry that is named after a guy called
00:22:59,00:23:06,bell isn't it isn't it so I think the laughing cow company was founded by the bell brothers or
00:23:06,00:23:10,maybe it was a father and son the surname was BEL so I think baby bell is named after a guy as well
00:23:10,00:23:14,that's awesome at one point would have been a baby yeah so would the father actually yeah
00:23:17,00:23:21,and the thing about laughing cow by the way which I did see is I went on the website and they have one
00:23:21,00:23:26,top secret technology there that they've never given away to anyone else okay do you know what that is
00:23:26,00:23:35,oh how to uh no so it's a couple of triangles is it folding the foil kind of yes is it the red
00:23:35,00:23:41,thing how you get the red thing to peel off so hopefully it's the easy open foil wrapping technology
00:23:41,00:23:46,which according to the website remains top secret to this day wow uh yeah it's not a
00:23:46,00:23:55,technology that we're crying out that would be so useful that would be so useful for so many years
00:23:55,00:23:59,yeah imagine if you had it for your clothes and whenever you needed to get undressed at the night
00:23:59,00:24:04,you start to pull one red string you start completely undressed you've got that it's easy
00:24:04,00:24:10,strip strip shows would be a lot shorter wouldn't there if there was one baby bells i'll peel off thing
00:24:13,00:24:19,i found a weird thing about cheese humans invented cheese before they could digest milk
00:24:19,00:24:27,okay what yeah okay so so all mammals you know they're lactose tolerant when they're very young
00:24:27,00:24:31,because they're they're drinking their mother's milk and then all mammals are lactose intolerant
00:24:31,00:24:36,you're almost all though and then humans only got the genetic mutation to
00:24:37,00:24:45,to allow them to drink milk as adults a few thousand years ago but so we we couldn't digest lactose
00:24:45,00:24:51,but cheese has much lower lactose than milk so if you make cheese you can store all the calories
00:24:51,00:24:55,of the animal's milk in cheese form and that means you can keep the calories for longer so you'll
00:24:55,00:25:01,survive longer so that gives you a reason to keep animals for longer rather than immediately
00:25:01,00:25:06,killing them or hunting them so that means that you domesticate cheap and cows and all of this and
00:25:06,00:25:10,you make cheese but you don't drink the milk but the thing is like to make the cheese
00:25:10,00:25:15,is this not right that what you do is you get the milk and then you get the stomach of a dead animal
00:25:15,00:25:19,and you put the milk inside the stomach because it's got acid which you need and then you leave it
00:25:19,00:25:23,for weeks and weeks and weeks and then you eat it yeah i mean Adam was talking about
00:25:23,00:25:28,things not being invented that is an invention half isn't it it is one of those things that
00:25:28,00:25:32,required them to be incredibly bored and wouldn't be able to be invented now because we've
00:25:32,00:25:38,all got better things to do than experiment with these bizarre things and the ancient Greeks used
00:25:38,00:25:43,a great goat's cheese into their beer and wine one of the earliest wines actually the kind of
00:25:43,00:25:50,peasant wine mentioned by Homer is actually wine and goat cheese which we could try and bring back
00:25:50,00:25:55,i mean what would it taste like in cheese yeah why the cheese together but not one inside the other
00:25:55,00:25:58,out of pasta you know what out of pasta you've got it you've got to hold a plate and you've got to
00:25:58,00:26:03,hold a glass and it's really difficult if you need to use it you have a gesture yeah if you just put
00:26:03,00:26:09,the cheese in the wine yeah i'm going to try that this Christmas who these are the Greeks or the
00:26:09,00:26:14,Romans. The ancient Greeks. Do you think as I came here they was think we were really pretentious
00:26:14,00:26:18,because you know if you go to some really post restaurants and they have deconstructed ex why is
00:26:18,00:26:23,that like you have a deconstructed crumble where the crumbles on one side and do you know what i mean
00:26:23,00:26:29,yeah well that yeah they'd come and say fucking deconstructed wine cheese drink wine on one side and
00:26:29,00:26:41,cheese on the other. Okay it's time for fact number three and that is Andy my
00:26:41,00:26:45,fact is that when Charles Darwin submitted on the origin of species to his publisher the publisher
00:26:45,00:26:55,suggested he should rewrite it exclusively about pigeons. So I know so there's there's this article
00:26:55,00:27:01,in the London Review of Books which is reviewing a book all about the publisher John Murray and the
00:27:01,00:27:07,correspondence between authors and the publishers over centuries so it's got all these famous authors
00:27:07,00:27:12,like Jane Austen and Lord Byron and David Livingstone and all these people and the firm sent on the
00:27:12,00:27:18,origin of species out to two readers when it came in but one of them was a lawyer called George Pollock
00:27:18,00:27:23,who said that it was beyond the apprehension of any living scientist and the other was this guy
00:27:23,00:27:28,he called Wittwell Elwin who was a clergyman and he wrote back saying look I like Darwin but
00:27:28,00:27:34,it's a wild and foolish piece of imagination and that it would really be a good book if you just
00:27:34,00:27:42,write it about pigeons because he said everybody is interested in pigeons. So did when Elwin then
00:27:42,00:27:47,Elwin sorry spoke to Murray right did Murray then go back to Darwin and say write it about pigeons
00:27:47,00:27:53,that's what I couldn't work out or was it just a internal email kind of thing I don't know I don't
00:27:53,00:27:57,know whether it got passed on to Darwin yeah but that that wouldn't involve ripping the whole thing
00:27:57,00:28:02,to pieces because there's quite a lot of pigeon in there it's just a shutter book yeah it's a very
00:28:02,00:28:08,slight edit he was he was really into pigeons though I hadn't quite realised how much of a pigeon
00:28:08,00:28:13,fancier he was so he might have been flattered that his pigeon work was so inspiring he was a member
00:28:13,00:28:21,of two London pigeon clubs two one's not enough your wife would be a bit annoyed wouldn't she you're
00:28:21,00:28:28,spending your time at one pigeon club yeah the thing is with the pigeons like he was it was a bit
00:28:28,00:28:34,like breeding dogs wasn't it like the pigeons were really weird looking like they they bred them
00:28:34,00:28:40,to look not like pigeons yeah so they didn't look like the pigeons you see yeah yeah so like breeds
00:28:40,00:28:47,that he worked on included the pygmy powder pigeon the Polish helmet pigeon the English long faced
00:28:47,00:28:53,muffin tumbler classic if you look at these pictures yeah if you google them they don't look like
00:28:53,00:28:58,pigeons at all there's one the English carrier pigeon which you don't see anymore it looks almost
00:28:58,00:29:03,identical to jacobry smog does it really really does like honestly if you google it it just looks
00:29:03,00:29:08,like jacobry spot you should put a picture on Twitter yeah because they're extinct aren't they so
00:29:08,00:29:14,maybe he's actually the one surviving member of the species we need to start breeding him he's breeding
00:29:14,00:29:20,glasses because there were these ones called powders which are really weird because they
00:29:20,00:29:25,bred them to grow this the bizarre birds because they it looks like it's fallen a bowling ball
00:29:25,00:29:31,basically it's got this huge they've got this huge lump under their under their chins as it were
00:29:31,00:29:35,in their neck it's really strange well I find it weird that we're so used to are just very
00:29:35,00:29:41,standard pigeons when there aren't there is this huge variety so if you go to pigeon contest and
00:29:41,00:29:45,pigeon beauty patterns which you can they're quite big to the middle east in fact then they look almost
00:29:45,00:29:51,nothing like pigeons a lot of them have that kind of gross turkey like red bulbous stuff around
00:29:51,00:29:57,their eyes but yeah it's a very popular thing I think they've been big in the middle east since 1150
00:29:57,00:30:04,when the first pigeon post service was set up in Baghdad and it took messages from Baghdad to Syria
00:30:04,00:30:09,and by the 1160s then it was you know it was constantly taking messages back and forth to the
00:30:09,00:30:15,extent that in the crusades the Christians brought loads of falcons over with them to try and intercept
00:30:15,00:30:20,the pigeon post in the middle east so they were the first hackers who would grab their messages
00:30:20,00:30:25,they also used to do a lot of homing pigeon races which still go on to this day but that's been going
00:30:25,00:30:31,since the 1800s and I was reading about one in China that happened very recently and it's a huge
00:30:31,00:30:36,"prize for this it's a big deal in China so 160,000 American dollars would be the prize for the"
00:30:36,00:30:41,winning homing pigeon so they get sent a hundred miles away and they have to fly back to this spot
00:30:41,00:30:48,and the fastest speed that a homing pigeon has ever done is it go they go about a hundred miles
00:30:48,00:30:55,an hour what yeah but no way this is the this is clock speeds faster than a hundred miles an hour
00:30:55,00:31:02,but the ones that won would have had to have gone 200 miles an hour the first four places and they
00:31:02,00:31:07,couldn't work out how that was possible and it turns out what it was is the owners of the pigeons
00:31:07,00:31:13,had them fly off but immediately come back hopped on a bullet train which can go 200 miles an hour
00:31:13,00:31:18,get to the other side and release them and and they won but they have been caught and sent to prison
00:31:18,00:31:22,I think that's I think that's such a silly cheat because you will be caught because pigeons don't fly
00:31:22,00:31:28,200 miles that's exactly did you say they got sent to prison not the pigeons the humans still
00:31:28,00:31:33,"well it's a huge prize isn't it it's a 160,000 dollars so that's yeah yeah they go for a lot I think"
00:31:33,00:31:40,Chinese guy recently bought one for half a million dollars American dollars yeah they go for a huge amount
00:31:40,00:31:45,I should say they were sentenced to three years but it was a suspended sentence so if another crime
00:31:45,00:31:51,occurs then they go to prison do it again have you guys heard of the Spanish sport which is called
00:31:51,00:31:58,it's thieving it's a pigeon thieving competition no no this is amazing so it's basically pigeon love
00:31:58,00:32:05,island you get you you're a pigeon fancier and you have a male so half a dozen men each bring
00:32:05,00:32:10,a male pigeon and they paint them in bright colors to mark which one is theirs and then
00:32:10,00:32:16,there's a marked female and the male pigeons all compete to seduce the female and the aim is
00:32:16,00:32:21,to get them to come home with them because this is a very unusual pigeon it's called the horseman
00:32:21,00:32:31,thief powder and it unusually it makes by bringing it's made back to its place for sex and so
00:32:31,00:32:37,how do you know that they're all fancy her though um I think cold pigeons just all fancy all other
00:32:37,00:32:41,pigeons they are actually quite roundly aren't they're not these ones are not choosy yeah and so
00:32:41,00:32:47,the owner wins if um his male is the one who wins the seduction competition with the female yeah
00:32:47,00:32:52,that's amazing a little strut around and they you know they dance and they do little that's some
00:32:52,00:32:59,that was some excellent pigeon strutting that and this happens in Scotland too it's called um do
00:32:59,00:33:05,basically the pigeons are called doos d double o and if you if you see a pigeon flying up and you
00:33:05,00:33:10,know that one of your rival doom and has released their pigeon you release your pigeon of the opposite
00:33:10,00:33:14,sex and then there's this battle in the skies over who goes back to whose place and if you and if
00:33:14,00:33:19,the pigeon comes back to your place you get to keep both pigeons it must be confusing because they're
00:33:19,00:33:24,completely painted right so that's almost the equivalent human wise of going to a Halloween party
00:33:24,00:33:31,and fancying someone who's just come as a skeleton but but you get on well and then the next morning
00:33:31,00:33:40,and you're like oh you put them away pigeons were the first drones in a way weren't they or some of
00:33:40,00:33:49,the first drones in that there was in 1907 this guy called dr. Julius Nurbronner uh which I will
00:33:49,00:33:54,have pronounced incorrectly sorry but he was a German apothecary and he invented the pigeon camera
00:33:54,00:33:59,and this was a very exciting adventure at the time it was thought to be quite revolutionary because
00:33:59,00:34:04,a couple of cameras have been sent up on balloons and stuff but this was really acting like a proper
00:34:04,00:34:10,drone so he'd strap it like a backpack onto the pigeon's chest like a chest pack and send them off
00:34:10,00:34:15,to fly fly through the air and they took amazing aerial photographs it's so worth looking at them they
00:34:15,00:34:21,are like beautiful pictures and I hadn't really considered that for most people seeing those was
00:34:21,00:34:25,bizarre because they've never seen pictures taken from above oh yeah there's a whole school of
00:34:25,00:34:33,first world war artists which or post first world war art which is derived from aerial photography
00:34:33,00:34:39,and aerial landscapes because it just wasn't a I guess you saw maps but you could see it from the
00:34:39,00:34:44,top of the hill or something but in fact from that you'd never you'd never be able to see a city
00:34:44,00:34:51,from a bunch of you yeah yeah exactly he also actually invented a horse drawn dove cut you know a
00:34:51,00:34:57,home for the pigeons and doves that he was trapping the cameras to and dark room which is quite
00:34:57,00:35:02,cool to go with the pigeon cameras so that when you thought I suddenly want to photograph this city
00:35:02,00:35:06,you'd take your whole horse drawn dove cut and dark room inside to where it was and then you could
00:35:06,00:35:13,send them off just one last quick thing on Darwin maybe you guys all knew this but I didn't realize
00:35:13,00:35:20,that in the origin of the species in the sick edition he added a new chapter which was responding
00:35:20,00:35:25,to all the criticisms from previous editions of his book oh really I think that's such a good idea
00:35:25,00:35:30,that's a great idea nice great we should do that with the book of the year yeah I think you'll find
00:35:30,00:35:37,the wasp article is funny how many people wrote in saying not enough pigeons did you have
00:35:37,00:35:44,I just have one last thing it's not great but I'll mention it anyway oh yeah
00:35:45,00:35:53,buckle up this is just a fact on publishers getting it wrong so in this fact it's the pigeon suggestion
00:35:53,00:35:59,this has just happened in Australia there's a business woman and socialite called Roxy Jacenco
00:35:59,00:36:04,and she's just released a book now she's a she's very famous as a PR specialist and she was on
00:36:04,00:36:09,celebrity apprentice in Australia so she's a she's a big name there and so the book is described
00:36:09,00:36:15,as a no bullshit guide to PR social media and building your brand and it had all these glowing
00:36:15,00:36:19,reviews on it being street smart and hard-headed totally tenacious PR expert but they've had to
00:36:19,00:36:24,pulp every single one of the copies of the book because it also included as a result of the publisher's
00:36:24,00:36:29,mistake a quote that was a misquote that said on the front that the book never fails to disappoint
00:36:29,00:36:35,so medsay never fails to deliver but yeah total PR disaster
00:36:43,00:36:48,time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact my fact this week is that King Louis the 13th
00:36:48,00:36:54,of France had a royal anagramist wow yeah this was like you know you'd have a court jester
00:36:54,00:36:59,and then you would also have your royal anagramist who would just be there ready to make anagrams
00:36:59,00:37:06,for the amusement of the king that that really was the role um he uh he did a number of things with
00:37:06,00:37:14,anagrams it wasn't just a musing name uh remixes it was uh he used to do prophecies as well using anagrams
00:37:14,00:37:19,and yeah so it had a lot of had a lot of mystical purposes as well as I wonder if he could make an
00:37:19,00:37:25,anagram of Louis the 13 because there's an X and three eyes in there yeah it's pretty so fun if
00:37:25,00:37:31,you can do that he deserves a gel you get six I've got the word six there from Louis and then the X
00:37:31,00:37:39,and then you've got L.O.U and there's three eyes you've got we in French yeah six L.I.I
00:37:39,00:37:45,I always I'm really bad at doing anagrams because I always end up with spare elites means uh or
00:37:45,00:37:51,in Russian the Romans supposedly there's a there's a thing called ars magna the great art and supposedly
00:37:51,00:37:57,the Romans called anagraming ars magna which is an anagram of the word anagrams but I don't
00:37:57,00:38:02,think they used I don't think they knew the word anagrams because they didn't have a plural form
00:38:02,00:38:07,like which just adds an S to the main noun normally there are a few weird ones where it does but
00:38:07,00:38:13,anyway I don't think that is true but it does come from the Greek anagrama design from anna which
00:38:13,00:38:18,means backwards a grammar which means letter so it's putting the letters backwards anna with one end
00:38:18,00:38:25,though guys not the two ends which is which means excellent anna meaning backwards considering
00:38:25,00:38:34,that anna is a palindrome it's quite weird isn't it yeah that is weird anyway so what about this guy
00:38:34,00:38:40,who was he oh so yeah so we're talking the 1600s here this is one King Louis the 13th reigned um
00:38:40,00:38:46,and this person um I don't actually know if he had a number of them uh but the one person you
00:38:46,00:38:52,can find who definitely was one of his royal anagrams was Thomas Billon so he lived from 1617 to
00:38:52,00:38:58,1647 and he served as the royal anagramist twice so there's a suggestion that there might have been
00:38:58,00:39:03,another person fulfilling the role in between actually there was a royal sudoku guy in between
00:39:03,00:39:13,so he did it from 1624 to 1631 and then from 1640 till his death I guess in 1647 maybe he was
00:39:13,00:39:19,fired in 31 because he had a leftover letter or something but he also he predicted people's characters
00:39:19,00:39:25,so he would rearrange the letters of your name and if it came out as being you know an evil phrase
00:39:25,00:39:31,then people would think badly of you do you think as a parent if you were having a new child
00:39:31,00:39:36,you would deliberately come up with a good word like an anagram of you call your child like an
00:39:36,00:39:43,anagram of awesome yes yeah you were trying trick it I'm a soury no we're soury yes this is something
00:39:43,00:39:47,that I think we might have mentioned on qi and one of our researchers found the other day again
00:39:47,00:39:51,but that during the whole enlightenment anagrams was something that fascinated people they were
00:39:51,00:39:55,thought to pull ten certain things like you say if your name could spell something bad but also
00:39:55,00:40:01,they were used by lots of scientists as a way of concealing their discoveries whilst also kind of
00:40:01,00:40:07,stamping them as their own so people like Galileo and a robot hook would record their initial results
00:40:07,00:40:12,as an anagram and send it off when they hadn't actually confirmed their results yet because that
00:40:12,00:40:15,meant once they confirmed the results they could say look I did it first look here's the anagram
00:40:15,00:40:20,proof it's like blockchain I imagine even though I don't really know what blockchain is
00:40:20,00:40:26,many of them I imagine it is too but the the anagrams were exceptionally poor weren't they
00:40:26,00:40:34,were they yeah so christian hygans he discovered the rings around Saturn and he wanted an anagram
00:40:34,00:40:42,um so he wanted to anagram anuto singitor tenuay pleno nusquam coherente ad ecliptam
00:40:42,00:40:47,inclinato which means it is surrounded by a thin flat ring nowhere touching inclined to the
00:40:47,00:40:57,elliptic so he wanted to make that okay his anagram was a a a a a a a a c c c c c c d e e e e e e g h
00:40:57,00:41:01,he basically put all the letters in help yeah that's a good even trying it's not even trying that's
00:41:01,00:41:08,ready that's right yeah that's not an anagram is it that's like the well we said a few weeks ago the
00:41:08,00:41:13,crosswords answers in that to be actual words yeah the anagram has to be an actual word christian
00:41:13,00:41:18,god that was an easy job then if that's all you had to do random things well there are kind of
00:41:18,00:41:22,different types of anagram this is according to a book was reading for about a hundred years ago
00:41:22,00:41:27,I think which is saying you get a synagram which is kind of like that but a synagram is an anagram
00:41:27,00:41:33,where the anagram means the same sort of thing so vial is a synagram of evil or anger'd have
00:41:33,00:41:40,been raged eleven plus two and twelve plus one is that one blows my yeah so yeah every time it's
00:41:40,00:41:44,always yeah always a winner but imagine if you thought that there were hidden things in anagrams
00:41:44,00:41:48,you would use those as examples of like yeah look at look how connected the universe is when we
00:41:48,00:41:53,reshuffle this stuff I would have bought into that immediately great there's a website called
00:41:53,00:41:59,anagrammy dot com which has a monthly award so the archbishop of canterbury is another church
00:41:59,00:42:07,it's type of rabbi mmm nice um the amateur thespians is an anagram of in apt hams use theater
00:42:07,00:42:13,really like and do they do they release of a something they want an anagram made of or you
00:42:13,00:42:17,just submitting I think you submit your own right okay and they pick a really good one each month
00:42:17,00:42:22,so they're synagrams they're synagrams and then you get anti-grams which are the ones that
00:42:22,00:42:29,mean the opposite uh so like diplomacy is mad policy there's a Guinness World record for the
00:42:29,00:42:36,longest anagram that you can get in the English language and this this is for a non-scientific
00:42:36,00:42:43,English word because in the scientific ones they they're pretty bizarre so in a non-scientific word
00:42:43,00:42:48,I have known that in the past but I can't remember it now okay so I'll give you I'll give you
00:42:48,00:42:53,the the original word and see if you can make the anagram so conversationalists oh yeah
00:42:54,00:43:00,what is the anagram a conservationist yeah oh that's a cheat I think you should have to rearrange
00:43:00,00:43:07,at least four letters yeah it's making up rules on the fly yeah I'm allowed yeah it is a bit
00:43:07,00:43:12,bit measly isn't it what about scone and cones yeah so that's currently the record no
00:43:12,00:43:17,what is why is that not good enough I think they should have to begin with a different letter
00:43:17,00:43:21,scone and cones yeah yeah okay I'll accept scone and cones but I'm not with that right off the
00:43:21,00:43:28,bat like just did you yeah I didn't even have to think about have you heard of Corey Kell Hoon
00:43:28,00:43:32,nope he's an anagrammer I don't think he's a pro but he's bad as close as the modern age gets to
00:43:32,00:43:38,a pro anagrammer so he rearranged the first line of hamlets soliloquy to come up with a summary
00:43:38,00:43:47,of hamlet so as in just to be or not to be no let's see if it passes the anotest for crazy
00:43:47,00:43:51,anagram so to be or not to be that is the question whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the
00:43:51,00:43:56,slings and arrows of outrageous fortune okay that he rearranged to make in one of the bar's best
00:43:56,00:44:01,thought of tragedies our insistent hero hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten
00:44:01,00:44:09,that's very good that's really nice so good there's another thing that gets done where these
00:44:09,00:44:15,kind of big challenges where people try to take complete texts and create an anagram that works
00:44:15,00:44:20,so that it just works as a whole separate work if that makes sense so the biggest one that's ever
00:44:20,00:44:26,been completed is a guy called Mike Keith has anagrammed the complete text of Moby Dick so that's
00:44:26,00:44:31,yeah nine hundred thirty five thousand seven hundred and sixty three letters and he used a computer
00:44:31,00:44:36,to do this so that's seen as a cheat yeah but there was a person who did do it all by himself which
00:44:36,00:44:42,"was Richard Brody and he made an anagram of battle of the books by Jonathan Swift and that's 42,000"
00:44:42,00:44:48,"letters 142,177 letters but how much of a different anagram does it be could you have the exact"
00:44:48,00:44:58,same book but it just call me maleish so the the ancient Greeks had this is kind of related so it's
00:44:58,00:45:06,about palindromes not anagrams but Greek fountains had a big palindrome written on them which said
00:45:06,00:45:13,nispon anominata mi mon an obsin so that's exactly the same backwards as it is forwards and it means
00:45:13,00:45:20,wash the sin as well as the face that's a good one that's cool for a fountain yeah very good I do
00:45:20,00:45:24,know what the lung is palindrome in the English language it's gone it's redevider
00:45:24,00:45:31,redevider oh cool just a fact that's good fact did you guys know the Dutch national anthem
00:45:31,00:45:37,is an acrostic as in the first letter of each word spell something out the first letter of each line
00:45:37,00:45:43,spell something out so the first letter of sorry the first letter of each of the 15 verses
00:45:43,00:45:49,spells out William Van Nassau as in William of Orange's name because and it's sung from his
00:45:49,00:45:52,perspective so it's all in the first person bizarrely when you're Dutch you all sing as if
00:45:52,00:45:57,you're William of Orange when you sing the anthem isn't there a line where he kind of says and I
00:45:58,00:46:04,give everything to the king of Spain in that I think there is yeah so good yeah how weird and they
00:46:04,00:46:09,were trying to change it I think but now you can't really otherwise the acrostic won't work doesn't work
00:46:09,00:46:16,yeah it's covered there was a guy called Andre Pujon and this was back in the day when everyone
00:46:16,00:46:22,thought that anagrams were really important and they had some kind of spiritual thing behind them
00:46:23,00:46:31,he worked out that his name was an anagram of Pondu de Réon which means hanged in Réon and so
00:46:31,00:46:38,he decided to fulfill his destiny by traveling to the town of Réon and committing criminal offence
00:46:38,00:46:44,which meant that he was hanged wow um so he actually you know made sure that the omen happened
00:46:44,00:46:50,right oh poor guy oh no silly silly man there could have been there could have been another
00:46:50,00:46:58,ionagram he might have found where it said had a relaxing holiday somewhere else yeah yeah I mean
00:46:58,00:47:04,it probably is just a story isn't it but it is a story that exists and that's the bar we've decided
00:47:04,00:47:11,um so there's an anagram thinking our book as well in the book of the year there's a there's
00:47:11,00:47:16,a thing about Banksy because he submitted an artwork to the Royal Academy under the name Brian
00:47:16,00:47:22,S. Garkman which is an anagram of the words Banksy Anagram and they did not spot it they rejected it
00:47:22,00:47:26,and then they asked him can he submit a work they just got in touch with the banks he said
00:47:26,00:47:30,can you submit a work of art and he sent them the thing that they had already rejected and they
00:47:30,00:47:37,accepted it would they have been expected to spot an anagram do people actually have an anagram
00:47:37,00:47:48,pass over everything that's submitted this is an anagram of mobility nice try buddy supposedly if you
00:47:48,00:47:52,are asked to solve anagrams against a green background and then against a red background you'll
00:47:52,00:47:59,do worse on the red background really this has been tried and um the people who were exposed
00:47:59,00:48:04,to the red background anagrams did substantially worse is that because the text was in red on both
00:48:04,00:48:12,times black text um sorry so is that sorry i misunderstood so it's um there's a piece of paper
00:48:12,00:48:18,that is red yes right and it's got anagram it's got anagrams in black that need to be solved
00:48:18,00:48:27,as black as the devil's nut sack it's not it's it's the devil's nutting bag no the language is
00:48:27,00:48:34,evolved at this point it's a nut sack there was another paper that suggests that it's easier to
00:48:34,00:48:41,solve anagrams while you're laying down rather than standing up right no yeah i think that's true
00:48:41,00:48:46,because there's more blood flow in your head because this the red green thing is crazy it suggests
00:48:46,00:48:52,that if you do worse on the red that you're sensitive to the queue of danger you think the
00:48:52,00:48:56,sound of grams are dangerous you know it must be just that you can't see black on red as well as
00:48:56,00:49:01,you can see no it's not i tried it and actually i did better on the ones with the red background
00:49:01,00:49:06,that the green ones so i would have been an anomaly you're so brave does that mean you should
00:49:06,00:49:18,need us all into war i'm now a general idiot okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so
00:49:18,00:49:22,much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we
