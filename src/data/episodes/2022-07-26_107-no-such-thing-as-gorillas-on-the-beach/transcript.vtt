00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.400
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.160
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.920
 this week coming to you from Orrenmore in Glasgow.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 My name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to stage

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.520
 its Anitazinski James Harkin and Andy Murray.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 (cheering and applause)

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:47.960
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.080
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.360
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that in Utah,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.920
 it is illegal to wear a hat in your driving license photo

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.760
 but you can wear a colander.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.920
 (cheering and applause)

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.080
 Yeah, one of those pasta strainers, you can wear them.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.160
 (laughing)

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 Who's genuinely true and it obviously pisses off

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.600
 the authorities whenever someone says it's my right to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 and the reason they say it's their right to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 is they say they can do it on religious grounds.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.960
 - Yeah, is it pasta fairy anism?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.200
 - Pasta fairy anism.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.640
 - Such strong name.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 - How many people know about pasta fairy anism?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.400
 - How many people are pasta fairings?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.640
 - I'm a minister.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.920
 - Whoa, did someone just say you're a minister?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.640
 - Oh no.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480
 - What?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.600
 - If anyone would like to get married tonight.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.360
 (laughing)

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.240
 Which you can do, can you do it here in Glasgow?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640
 Can you get married?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.040
 - The legislation that brought in same sex marriages

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 last year, part of that was to allow non-traditional

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.640
 religious groups to perform weddings well.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.480
 I'm not quite sure.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.720
 (laughing)

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 - Wait, you're a minister mate.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.040
 You should have that covered.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.600
 - Dan, do you know, I'm a minister

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.440
 of the priest of the church of the latter day dude.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.280
 - What?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.120
 - What?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.360
 - Yeah, I signed up online.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.000
 (laughing)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.440
 It's a very, very stringent thing you have to go through.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.400
 You go onto their website, you put your email,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.960
 it's basically signing up to a mailing list,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.840
 but they say that then you're a minister in their church.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.240
 - What do you get to do?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.080
 Apparently it's something.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 - You get to dude.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.920
 (laughing)

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.800
 Dude, dude, dude, you take this woman.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.280
 (laughing)

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.120
 I dude.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.040
 (laughing)

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.560
 - I don't think you're taking my religion.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.920
 - Very serious, sorry.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 - Sorry.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.280
 - So it's from a movie with the dude.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.960
 I don't know what, I've never seen it in my bioski.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.800
 - Oh my god.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640
 - Think of the bioski.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.000
 - You never see, it's like, it's like a Jew

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 hasn't read the Ten Commandments.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.000
 (laughing)

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.360
 And when I signed up, I vowed to uphold the principles of dudeism

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.600
 to take it easy, to be easy going to everyone I meet

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.880
 and to keep my mind limber.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.560
 And I had to promise that the ordination was for me

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.280
 and not for someone else or my dog or whatever.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.280
 (laughing)

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.080
 - That's very cool, that's amazing.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.920
 - Wow.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.160
 - So what about paciferianism?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 What's that all about?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.600
 - Well, it was started in 2005, wasn't it?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.440
 - Yeah.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.160
 - And it's people who are protesting against teaching,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.040
 intelligent design in schools in America

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.760
 as an alternative to evolution.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.120
 - And so they created their own kind of god,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.720
 which was the spaghetti monster.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720
 (laughing)

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.520
 Yeah, and it's becoming, this is the thing,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.080
 it's becoming quite a large religion

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.000
 to the point where people are ministers

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.120
 and are wearing calendars on their head

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.480
 because that's the religious headgear

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.200
 that they wear in the photos.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.320
 And they even have now, it's gone so far

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.640
 that there are some people who aren't quite sure

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.000
 whether or not they believe in the flying spaghetti.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.840
 (laughing)

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.640
 - Yeah, there's spaghetti monster.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.560
 - So, most paciferians believe that he's tomato based

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.640
 whereas others believe.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.280
 (laughing)

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.960
 Whereas others believe that it is pesto or cream.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.040
 (laughing)

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.720
 And they're called spagnostics.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.720
 (laughing)

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.680
 - So I have a fact about things that are not hats.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680
 (laughing)

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.520
 I wanted to find out things that are not hats

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.600
 that have been used as hats.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.520
 So I googled the phrase worn as a hat, specifically that.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.320
 And it turned out that in 2002, a 17-year-old girl

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.160
 wore a chameleon as a hat through Manchester Airport

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.040
 and was stopped by the customs guys.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.880
 (laughing)

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.960
 The telegraph said, "Despite its abilities,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.960
 a camouflage itself by changing color."

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800
 (laughing)

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.560
 But the chameleon attracted the attention

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.480
 of people with a luggage carousel.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.000
 And she'd flown all the way from Dubai

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.560
 with this thing on her head.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.400
 (laughing)

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.600
 And it was a very endangered species.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.120
 So they took it off her and sent it to a safe house

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.520
 and eventually sent it back this way.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.680
 - There's an Australian guy who once muggled a snake

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.280
 in his underpants to Bali.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.120
 - Yeah.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.280
 - On a plane, that's an early day.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.120
 - Is that how you used to do this?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.440
 (laughing)

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.120
 - Oh yeah, I might have misheard that story.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.960
 - Yeah.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.080
 (laughing)

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.400
 - Yeah, no, okay, back to you.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.240
 - Yeah.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.120
 (laughing)

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.200
 - On wearing odd things on your head.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.680
 - I wouldn't put a snake in my pants.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.520
 - Sorry, sorry.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.880
 - No, please, I think this is a fruitful thing to pursue.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880
 - I would probably put it in, you know,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.880
 there's ice cream lolly containers.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.320
 I'd put it in the ice cream lolly container

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.040
 and then I'd put the handle on, you know, the lid on.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.880
 - Right.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.920
 - I don't think anyone knows what you're talking about.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.760
 - Guys.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.560
 (laughing)

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.520
 You know when you're making a lolly

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.160
 and you pour the lolly stuff into the mold

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.240
 and then you put the mold in the freezer,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.080
 I put it in one of those.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.480
 - But that'd be quite a small snake.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.320
 - Yeah.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320
 - You see my lolly mold.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.160
 (laughing)

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.560
 - And that is not the first time I've heard you use

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560
 that shelter one.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.800
 (laughing)

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.160
 - And it won't be the last.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.720
 (laughing)

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.320
 - So there's a guy in America

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.160
 - Yeah.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.520
 - Who decided to wear a colander on his head

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.760
 for his gun license and the police took his guns away.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.400
 (laughing)

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.640
 - That's what you have to do to get your guns taken away.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.640
 (laughing)

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.800
 - He said I was told I was mentally competent

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.400
 and I've never misused my guns or intend to do so.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.520
 So it's a real kick in the guts

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.960
 that if I was told that I was to go for another photo

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.240
 with a colander on my head,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.520
 my guns will be taken away again.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.840
 So apparently, if you wear a colander on your head

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.240
 for your gun license, they're gonna take it off you.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.800
 And he said he's gonna wear his colander on his head

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.200
 for his driving license

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200
 and he said what they're gonna do?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.360
 Take my car away.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.840
 (laughing)

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840
 I think probably they will.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.360
 (laughing)

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.880
 - I've read an account that it's someone in Russia

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.040
 got the first ever license.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.360
 I think they were the fifth person worldwide

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.240
 to be officially allowed to wear a colander on their head

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.640
 because of this planx spaghetti monster.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.480
 - Yeah.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.840
 - But it said that this person, if he was driving,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.600
 he had to be wearing the colander at all times.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
 (laughing)

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.200
 Because you have to look like you do in your license.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.640
 - I think he wore a knitted colander as well.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.400
 - It hates it. - It's not an actual colander.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.640
 It's just a knitted one.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.000
 - On driving licenses,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.240
 there's a guy called Jared Haiams

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.000
 who lives in Victorian Australia

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.840
 who's been fighting with authorities for five years now

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.840
 for the right to have a penis drawing as his signature.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.680
 (laughing)

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.160
 - On his driving license.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.960
 (laughing)

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.760
 - And he said this all started.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.000
 He was registering for a change of electoral address

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.240
 and he thought this would be funny

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.960
 rather than sign it, I'm gonna draw a cartoon penis.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.440
 Which is quite a good drawing of the cartoon penis actually.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.840
 And he said, I was receiving letters and phone calls,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.760
 telling me I couldn't have that as my signature.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.320
 And I thought, that's interesting, why not?

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.880
 (laughing)

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.680
 - You don't have to, a signature doesn't have to be you

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.400
 writing your name, it just has to be a mark

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.280
 that you produce that can look the same every time.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.520
 So if you can draw a consistent penis picture,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.640
 that's your signature, I'm with him on this.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.920
 - Well, I think he's getting away with it.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.440
 I think it might be on his driving license thing now.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.400
 - And I think he's been signing my front door.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.960
 (laughing)

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.800
 - Yeah.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.440
 - We need to move on fairly soon to the next fact.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.560
 Anything else before we do?

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.080
 - There is a guy, there's a Swedish artist.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.920
 I just love this guy, he's called Frederick Sacker

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.320
 and he painted the picture for his driving license, right?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.600
 So he did a self-portrait because you have

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.640
 to submit a likeness and a photo,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.000
 but it doesn't have to be a photo of you.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.240
 It just has to be a photo that looks enough like you

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.360
 that if someone looked at it, they thought, oh, that's him.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.760
 So he did a self-portrait, he took a photo of the self-portrait

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.560
 and he submitted it and the authorities said, fine.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.360
 But they were very cool about it.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.840
 They just said the picture we have received

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.080
 looks like any other photo,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.320
 so we have had no reason to question it,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.480
 and they'd let him do it.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.840
 - I mean, they're accepting collenders and penises now,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.520
 so I find that unsurprising.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.880
 Can I just, there's a problem

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.360
 with driving license applications in the US.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.920
 And this was raised by a woman in Florida last year,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.440
 I think, when she'd had, she got her driving license renewed

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.000
 and she'd had it for a few months

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.200
 and she started noticing people were treating her a bit weirdly,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.800
 so she tried to stay in a hotel

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.240
 and she couldn't stay there, they wouldn't let her stay.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.080
 She went to Disney World and they said,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.440
 I'm sorry, we can't let you park here,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.920
 we can't let you come in.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.240
 And eventually, someone checked her driving license

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.760
 and pointed out that they'd accidentally labeled her

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.600
 as a sexual predator rather than an organ donor.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 (audience laughing)

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.440
 - Whoa.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.880
 - That's a different kind of organ, I think.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.880
 (audience laughing)

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.920
 - But only those two boxes are just right next to each other.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.680
 (audience laughing)

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.800
 - What box is that though?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.600
 'Cause it's not like there's another interesting fact section

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.080
 on my driving license, there's no trivia bit on your passport,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.920
 you know?

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.880
 - It's not like, as he says, lolly-mold-infusey act.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.880
 (audience laughing)

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.760
 - Should we move on to our next fact?

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.600
 - Sure.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.480
 - My fact is, there was a Victorian job

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.880
 that consisted solely of pushing people into the sea.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.640
 (audience laughing)

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.920
 This was a real thing, these people were called dippers.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.320
 (audience laughing)

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.320
 And so it's all to do with Victorian swimming etiquette,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.160
 basically, so they were quite strict

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.400
 about segregating sexes for reasons of modesty and decency.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.960
 You would have these people whose job it was

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.440
 to push you quickly into the water

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.440
 so that your modesty was preserved as a woman.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.000
 I think it was mostly for female swimmers.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.760
 - So these bathing houses that they used to go into,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.040
 that's the thing that got taken into the...

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.840
 - Yeah, so to go swimming,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.640
 you had to go into a special cart on wheels,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.200
 then they would take horses, attach them to the cart,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.640
 the horses would drag the machine into the sea,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.160
 you would change and then you would dive in off the end.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.000
 - Yeah.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.680
 - You would mostly go nude because,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.000
 and I'm hoping that you guys can confirm this,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.720
 swimming at the beach,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.880
 and these big, laborious things with horses

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.840
 bringing you down there were invented

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.440
 before the swimming suit.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.520
 So everyone went naked and they're like,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.080
 how do we get around this naked thing?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.840
 Let's build a massive house and then we'll get a horse

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.880
 and we'll bring it in, but it just didn't have swimming clothes.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.440
 - I think they did have like woolen swimming suits,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.680
 but they got quite heavy.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.920
 - But everyone was drowning.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.760
 - People did swim naked at the start of the Victorian period,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.360
 but then about halfway through everyone,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.920
 got a little bit prudish as we all know,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.120
 and that's when they had these kind of houses and things,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.960
 I think.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.800
 - Yeah.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.200
 - Because swimming in the Victorian era at first

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.880
 was really more for medical purposes

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.360
 than holidaying purposes, wasn't it?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.120
 And so I think sometimes some people thought

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.120
 you had to be dipped in three times in and out,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.480
 and it was quite important how quickly you got dipped in,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.960
 how many times, and that could cure you

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.080
 of TB or flu or whatever you had.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.920
 - Oh wow.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.760
 - So yeah.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.240
 - And they were really unpopular as well.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.200
 People hated the differs.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.320
 So somebody said they were the most horrid looking creatures

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.440
 I ever beheld.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.800
 Good heavens to be dipped by one of them and sourced

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.040
 like a condemned puppy or kitten.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.360
 (audience laughing)

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.280
 - I was looking into swimming around the world now,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.960
 'cause I thought, oh, I wonder if different cultures

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.600
 have different ways of going to the beach,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.600
 and if you're living China and you go to the beach,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.880
 how would that be?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.000
 In China, there's a big new fashion with swimming costumes,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.640
 and I'd not heard of this, and maybe you all have,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.400
 but called the face keeny.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.400
 So it's basically, they wear what effectively

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.720
 is a nutcher Libre mask over their heads,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.240
 because they don't want sun tans, it's a big kind of no-no

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.800
 though to have a sun tan.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.120
 So they wear these, yeah, these Mexican wrestling masks,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.160
 and they go to the beach.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.400
 So if you go to the beach in China,

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.000
 it's just packed with wrestlers.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 (audience laughing)

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.720
 - If you wear one of those, can you go naked

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.280
 on the rest of your body?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.200
 - 'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause no one knows who you are.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.440
 - So this is the thing, a lot of people do it now,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.560
 it's not about the tan anymore.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.560
 It's about an anonymous state at the beach.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.080
 You can do whatever you want to hang out,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.000
 and just go and do whatever you want,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.160
 and no one will know who you are.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.720
 - That's, they actually did that.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.040
 Women used to wear masks in the 16th and 17th centuries,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.280
 for exactly that reason.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.600
 It was a fashion thing, so women of high society

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.360
 would go around in masks, and they'd often wear them in bed,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.600
 and that was to stop your skin being exposed too much

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.440
 to sunlight and to stop yourself getting a tan,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.280
 'cause it was unfashionable.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.440
 - Wow.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.840
 - Do you know, it was illegal to be topulous in America

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.800
 in the early 20th century, and people were arrested for it?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.640
 - It was a man or woman.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.440
 - It was a man, sorry.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.920
 I didn't, how sexist am I?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.240
 I just assumed by Tobias, I meant all men.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.680
 Yeah, in 1935, 42 men were arrested for being topulous

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.480
 in Atlantic City, and people who were arresting them said,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.960
 "We will have no gorillas on our beaches."

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.960
 And yeah, it was a thing, it was so very improper.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.440
 - The man who invented the lava lamp was a nudist, wasn't he?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.280
 - Yes.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.360
 - Yeah, he used to make videos

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.080
 of women swimming underwater naked,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.080
 and then presumably went from there to lava lamp.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.120
 (audience laughing)

00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.960
 - Obviously.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.320
 - The logical joke, yeah.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.440
 (laughing)

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.840
 - Do you know what's happened to bathing machines today?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.280
 Do you know what happened to them?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.240
 - No.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.240
 - They are now, they were repurposed into those bathing hubs

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.680
 that you get at the back of beaches,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.760
 so they just took the, they wheeled them back off the beach

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.960
 as it came as people thought actually it's more sensible

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.080
 for us to wear us something costume.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.680
 They wheeled them back to the back of the beach,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.560
 they took the wheels off, and now that's why they're fashionable

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.400
 because bathing machines were transformed into that.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.840
 - Oh, someone last year built a new bathing machine,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.760
 incredibly exciting.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.600
 This is the first one built for 100 years,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.320
 is on the coast, somewhere, obviously.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.320
 (audience laughing)

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.320
 I think it was in Margate, and he raised about 30,000 pounds

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.520
 on Kickstarter, and it's really cool.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.120
 It features one of the little special features

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.320
 that you used to get on bathing machines,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.280
 but it was a modesty hood,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.880
 which is this little canvas tent,

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.920
 and basically the end that's facing the sea,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.160
 you kind of lower this canvas hood,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.440
 almost all the way to the water,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.680
 so that you can have even more privacy to get in.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.440
 - That specific awning was invented by a guy called Benjamin Beale,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.040
 and he's often given credit for inventing the entire concept

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.280
 of the beach house, the bathing house,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.560
 but all he did was the awning,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.920
 and he just got all the credit.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.760
 - That is outrageous.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.040
 I'm so glad that you are rewriting everyone's assumptions

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.440
 about this guy.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.280
 (audience laughing)

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.960
 I'm glad we've rited that wrong.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.160
 (audience laughing)

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.480
 - I know you're an asshole.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.520
 (audience laughing)

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520
 - Come on, Benjamin Beale.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.680
 (audience laughing)

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.680
 - I was reading about, there's a,

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.560
 'cause obviously people love swimming,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.160
 and there's a lot of beautiful places in the UK to go swimming.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160
 There's one absolute,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.360
 if you look at photos of this place,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.080
 absolutely beautiful, and it's called The Lagoon of Bucsden.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.640
 Absolutely stunning, but it's really toxic.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.200
 It's really dangerous, and so they're doing everything they can

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.720
 to stop people from swimming in it,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.400
 but because it looks so beautiful,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.680
 people just ignore the signs and keep going in.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.680
 So one sign that's up there, it says warning,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.080
 do not enter water, due to high pH levels.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.720
 This can cause skin and eye rotation, stomach problems,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.760
 fungal infections, such as thrush.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.640
 It says that inside there are car wrecks,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.960
 dead animals, excrement, rubbed,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.080
 and still people keep going in.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.400
 They keep going into a swim, and they're getting quite ill.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.000
 So what they've had to do in the end,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.760
 they've had to die the lagoon black,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.160
 so that people now go, oh, that looks disgusting.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.960
 So they've altered a beautiful place or a beautiful place.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.640
 I wonder why, how beautiful it can be.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.720
 Well, it's full of car wrecks and car experiments.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.040
 Oh, look at that.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.720
 Beautiful, turd floating by.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.680
 Ah, the serenity.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.080
 There are swimming pools in New Zealand,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.000
 which are being terrorised by mystery poors.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.200
 And this is in it.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.240
 Terror, right.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.880
 This is terrorism in New Zealand.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.920
 Yeah, there's a swimming pool.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.720
 One is in a place called Middle March,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.720
 but there are a couple who've experienced it,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.920
 and there were three feces incidents in a week,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.360
 so they think it was deliberate.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.280
 There was one incident where this was in a invacargue

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.120
 splash palace pool, so avoid that.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.680
 Where there was a view.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.840
 No, it sounds beautiful.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.320
 No, James, I went and I got thrushed.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.440
 Yeah, so this place is full of shit

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.800
 and Andy's vaginal infections.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:26.360
 Well, it said there was a large amount of human waste

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.640
 deposited into the deep end, so everyone was evacuated

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.120
 and moved to the learner's pool,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.920
 and then they were evacuated from that

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.040
 when it was discovered that the learner's pool was also full of feces.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.720
 All right, let's move on to our next fact.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.280
 OK, it's time for fact number.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.800
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.920
 Yes, my fact is that desperate Dan stopped eating cow pie

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.400
 because of mad cow disease.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.840
 He gave up cow pie, which is his favorite food.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.320
 So that was really sad.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.440
 Yeah, I think it was in 1996, and source is very,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.320
 and I can't find the original comic strips,

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.400
 but I think he started eating aunt Aggie's vegetable

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.720
 and fish options as a replacement.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.680
 The cow pie's E.A., so the thing with mad cow disease or C.J.D.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.720
 is that the danger was eating strange bits of a cow, wasn't it?

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.720
 And desperate Dan did used to eat the whole cow,

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.160
 because they had the horn sticking out and the tail sticking out.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.200
 So I would say if anyone was in danger of contracting it,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.800
 it was probably him.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.040
 We should say, for listeners overseas and things like that,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.240
 who desperate Dan is, just in case people get noticed.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.680
 So Britain's two biggest comics, ever,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.120
 called the Bino and the Dandy, and the Dandy star,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.960
 the cover star, desperate Dan, who was a cowboy,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.560
 and he was this huge guy, and it did amazing things.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.440
 He had to shave with a blowtorch, because he was so tough.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.800
 And he parted his hair by firing a pistol through it.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.400
 And it's just one of this amazing tradition

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.320
 of really, really great comics and really imaginative things.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.800
 I read these when I was a boy, and that's very good.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.160
 He used to smoke through a drain pipe.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.560
 He used to use a drain pipe as a cigarette or a pipe, I think, didn't he?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.600
 And it was a dustbin full of rubbish at the end of it,

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.560
 which I think he lit and smokes.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.720
 He was pretty hardcore.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.320
 He was.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.000
 He had a gun.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.280
 He had to give that up as well in the '90s or the '80s

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.600
 for political correctness.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.720
 Gone mad.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.320
 So I don't know how he parted his hair after that.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.120
 Maybe he went for--

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.120
 I think he had a water pistol after that.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.840
 OK, yeah, that's intense.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.480
 He sounds a lot better than the guy who

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.000
 was in the first episode of the Bino called Hairy Dan.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.600
 And Hairy Dan was an old man whose long white beard usually

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.560
 saved the day.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.120
 And in the first episode, he used his beard as a sail to win a boat race.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.280
 And you could rescue children from down wells?

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.400
 I'm sure he did.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.280
 I think I can see why Dennis the Menace took his top spot after a short while.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.440
 Those are amazing factors, and they're about Dennis the Menace,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.240
 which is that they-- so there were two Dennis the Menace's.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.040
 One is an American version, and then one is the British version.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.560
 And they were both created in the same year,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.680
 independent of each other.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.600
 They had no idea that they were being published.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.560
 They both had the red and black costume.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.880
 They both were called Dennis the Menace.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.560
 I think it might have even been in the same week.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.280
 I think it was the same week, really, really.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.040
 And it's often used by people trying

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.560
 to explain coincidences and why they're not surprising

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.880
 that you, in a world where infinite things can happen,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.240
 you expect the old coincidences.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.120
 So actually, when we discovered that, we should have gone,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.520
 well, yeah, obviously, mad things will happen.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.040
 Yes.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.760
 And just move on.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.760
 It's not amazing at all, in fact.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.160
 The other argument about that is that ideas have a time.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.360
 So maybe there was some other children with spike hair

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.920
 in some other cartoon, and other people with red and black,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.040
 and other people called Dennis.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.680
 And the same thing came with calculus, when Liebnitz,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.440
 and Newton all came up with it at the same time.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.920
 It almost did exactly the same time.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.040
 And it's like, well, was it a weird coincidence?

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.480
 Or was it just the time for that areas to come up?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.200
 Yeah.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.600
 Dennis the Menace's dad now has spike hair.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.120
 In fact, the Bino did an extremely exciting reveal

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.840
 a few years ago, which was that they showed

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.040
 on one of the bits of comic strip, a photograph

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.680
 of Dennis the Menace from the '80s.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.760
 And they had Dennis' dad saying, look, that's a picture of me.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.320
 So it transpires that Dennis the Menace is actually now.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.400
 Dennis is dad.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.360
 Oh, I don't know when the switch happens.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.320
 Wait, they used a photo of Dennis the Menace from the '80s.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.520
 Dennis's dad said that used to be me.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.760
 Yeah, there's no plotline where Dennis grows up in the '90s,

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.880
 and that's just father's son.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.640
 That's like, that is stupid.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.040
 I'm so angry here.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:43.040
 Anyway, he's changed his hairstyle, Dennis the Menace's dad,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.240
 so they've tried to upgrade the Bino to make it more realistic.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.080
 And the case is now that we live in a happier time

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.880
 where parents don't all abuse their children

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.560
 and kids don't all hate their parents.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.320
 And so Dennis's dad is now, yeah, spiky hair,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.960
 and he's a bit cool and groovy.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.440
 He's a little bit like, I used to be a rebel too.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.240
 Yeah.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.360
 Is there an authority figure who's still the enemy, though?

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.160
 Because that was always the thing.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.240
 It was always Anarchy, you know, the Batch Street kids,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.240
 or the like, "Teach was the enemy."

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.840
 I think the teachers are still quite bad, but...

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.840
 This is called the guy who draws the Batch Street kids.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.800
 This is a niche fact now for people who are at the beach.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.600
 He's called David Sutherland.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.680
 And here's drawn that comic strip since 1962.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680
 Wow.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.520
 53 years.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.520
 He's drawn over 2,000 of them.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.080
 Well, here's a weird one as well.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.000
 Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.240
 So the lead singer of the Pet Shop Boys

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.960
 between 1975 and 1977, he worked as an editor for Marvel UK.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.000
 So his job was to anglicise all the things

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.960
 that were Americanized in the original comic.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.600
 And his main job was to look at all the points of, say,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.560
 like, cleavage or two short skirts, pointed out,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.800
 and then they had to draw over the cleavage and readdress it,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.080
 because we had different indecency laws over here.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.080
 Really?

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.960
 So the poor Pet Shop Boys, he was stopping cleavage

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.160
 from getting into the comic books of...

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.040
 There was a big thing in America in the...

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040
 Where was it?

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.080
 It was in the '50s, '50s and '60s, where they had a censorship of comics.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080
 They might have even banned it, banned them for a while,

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.720
 but they definitely censored them.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.040
 And there was a guy called Frederick Wurton,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.880
 who wrote a pamphlet called "Ceduction of the Innocents"

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.640
 where he complained about all these comics

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.280
 and what they were doing to children.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.920
 And he said that Batman and Robin were obviously homosexual.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.160
 And Porkey Pig was an open invitation to Buggery.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.880
 LAUGHTER

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.520
 Now, I have never got that from the cartoons.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.920
 What was this man's name?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.440
 He was called Frederick Wurton.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.640
 And he was as my contestant, so he should know, actually.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.880
 OK, well, I think there might have been a little bit more going on in the Wurton brain.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.840
 Just on that subject, though, with Porkey Pig,

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.880
 there's a very big porn website in America called "PornHub"

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.200
 and they recently looked into the analytics of the most search for words.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.960
 Within people go on, they put in a word like "Milf"

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.760
 was a massive one in a lot of American states, stuff like that.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.800
 They found that in Nebraska, Arkansas, and Tennessee,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.000
 the number one search term was "Cartoon".

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.040
 Another fact, in South London, it was lollimold.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:22.760
 LAUGHTER

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.320
 What were on this?

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.480
 LAUGHTER

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.440
 I read a list of characters in the Bino.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.640
 OK.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:42.000
 And they included "Little Dead Eye Dick", "Deep Down Daddy Neptune",

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.720
 "Cocky Dick", "Wondering Willie", "Sticky Willie",

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.160
 and "Polly Wodley Doodle" and "Her Great Big Poodle".

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.800
 So every single one of those is an invitation to Bugery.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.000
 If Frederick had been around.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.040
 Open. Not a private invitation to Bugery.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.960
 It's on the billboard, it's at your turn.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.280
 On Facebook, it is, this is an open event.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.840
 Do you guys know what the world's first comic strip is?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.400
 Bio-tapestry.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.360
 That's very funny.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.520
 A lot of good comedy in there, if you want to see it.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.560
 No, I think so.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.480
 I think Rusty and me, a comic strip is a series of cartoons

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.200
 that are sent out to people's homes.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.920
 So the beer tapestry was just in one place.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.720
 You didn't receive it through the letterbox.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.640
 So, which have speech bubbles and people talking.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.560
 And the first one was made in Glasgow.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.040
 And it was the Glasgow-- well done.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.520
 It was the Glasgow-looking glass.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.280
 And it was in the-- in 1825, it had its first issue.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.840
 And the first comic strip in it was called "The History of the Coat."

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.800
 And it was--

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.320
 It was the adventures of a coat going from one owner to the next.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320
 That's a pretty good one.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.040
 That's really cool.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.720
 Kind of cool, yeah.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.840
 And also, it had a lot of heart-hitting sati.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.400
 It had a lot of bitching about the English in it.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.120
 Even though it was set up by a English guy who'd had to flee London

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.600
 because he was in so much debt.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.800
 So he went to Scotland and was obviously like, OK, cool.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.280
 I like these guys.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.600
 He made a comic strip, which partly bitched about the English.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.400
 And then he racked up so much gambling and drinking debts in Scotland

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.600
 that he had to flee again back to England.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.440
 And so it stopped.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.840
 Do you know who invented the speech bubble?

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.240
 Oh, controversial.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.160
 I've got a theory.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 What's yours?

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.680
 My theory is that it's 650 BC.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.360
 And it was the Meso-Americans, early central American people.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.120
 Are they of super fame?

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.800
 Or is that--

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.920
 Have I pronounced that right just in case we get letters?

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.000
 It doesn't mess up.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.520
 All right.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.960
 I don't think any of them are going to write to you now, Andy.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.200
 But they have little speech bubble.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.240
 They have drawings of people.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.560
 And they have these tiny little sort of arrows

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.440
 showing that, like, to a dagger drawing.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.080
 And it shows that people are slacking each other off in the drawings.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.880
 Yeah.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.560
 And that is a speech bubble that's sort of signifying abuse.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.000
 And do you agree with that, Anna?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.240
 I do agree with that, probably, yes.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.400
 You know, super-ted.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.240
 You know that his first language is not, in fact, English.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.400
 It's Welsh.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.400
 Yeah, really.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.640
 Super-ted's first language as well.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.720
 So it's a Welsh cartoon.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.360
 And when it first went out, it was in Welsh.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.680
 And they just dubbed it into English.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.080
 We should move on soon.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.360
 Have you guys got anything else before we do?

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.160
 I quite liked the quote from you and Kerr,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.040
 who was a--

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040
 I can't talk about it.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.480
 You won Kerr.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.120
 Poor you, Anna.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.280
 [APPLAUSE]

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.640
 How did I not see that?

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.400
 I'm not really doing my job properly.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.520
 I wrote down the name You and Kerr.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.160
 I did the notice.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.320
 I'm so embarrassed.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.200
 Yeah, so Youwanker is a top guy at DC.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.880
 Thompson, which makes the vino and the dandy.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.040
 And he was-- there's an interview with him

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.440
 semi-bemoning how they've had to go a bit politically correct.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.280
 So corporal punishment, smoking, and racial stereotypes

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.320
 are now taboo.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.800
 It does limit us in a way.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.080
 But we get to be slightly ruder than in the old days.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.040
 A bit more bodily functions instead.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.040
 We know that's what the kids laugh at now.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.120
 Those stupid kids, not laughing at the racial stereotypes anymore.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.360
 Let's move on to our final fact of the night.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.120
 And that is James Harkin.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.240
 OK, my fact this week is that the oldest sperm is worm sperm.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.640
 Mostly because I just like the cadence of it.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.440
 But we found some 50 million-year-old sperm cells.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.880
 No, ask them what we ask.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.400
 You leave us out of it.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.520
 I was swimming in bookstore.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.600
 We have 50 million-year-old sperm cells.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.400
 And they have been found in an Antarctic worm.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.920
 And they were in a fossilized cocoon.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.000
 Because normally sperm cells are so small and delicate,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.200
 they normally die, and they don't get fossilized.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.440
 But these ones did get fossilized.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.840
 And they're the oldest ones that we have.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.040
 And they're from worms.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.000
 50 million years.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.680
 Did you know that sperm had evolved at that point?

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.680
 Or is this the first proof we've had that it did evolve there?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.320
 I don't know about that, actually.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.360
 But yeah, I suppose there was no evidence

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.480
 that they'd evolved at that stage.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480
 It kind of been.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.680
 Does it still function?

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.520
 There is a sperm that's worked after 23 years, I think.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.520
 So the world's oldest baby is 23 years old.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.960
 This is an Australian guy who got quite ill.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.880
 And he was, I think, 15 years old at the time.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.520
 And he decided to save his sperm before he was going

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.160
 to have some kind of operation.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.880
 He survived his problem.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.040
 He grew old.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.800
 He got married.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.240
 And then I think the operation that he needed at the point

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.320
 meant that he could no longer produce sperm.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.880
 So he had this sitting there from all those years ago.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.120
 And they used that, and it worked.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.120
 And so he has a kid from his sperm from when he was 15.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.560
 It was like frozen in a lab.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.120
 It wasn't just sitting there.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.960
 Because you have to freeze it properly, don't you?

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.920
 You have to freeze it at a really low temperature.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.480
 Freeze the temperature will not do.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.000
 Yes.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 That's a man who spends a lot of his time, apparently.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.240
 They're refrigerated, yeah.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.040
 Thinking-- I'm now thinking that lollimold sounds

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.800
 like a disease.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.320
 It's the touch of lollimold, anyway.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.920
 And there are sperm smugglers as well who are freezing sperm.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.160
 Smuggling-- smuggling is happening in--

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.320
 not spuggling.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.480
 That's what they should call it.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.400
 Is they should call it spuggling or something, yeah?

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.360
 So what's with people smuggling sperm?

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.200
 Yeah.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.040
 Boltzperman.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040
 Boltzperman.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.160
 No, this is in prisons.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.320
 So people who are in prison who aren't allowed

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.800
 to have contact with their wives are smuggling sperm.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:13.880
 So there's a baby who was born to Regina Granato in America

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.080
 in 1999, even though her husband had been in prison since 1987.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.240
 He was a gang leader gangster.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.040
 And yeah, this baby was born because she'd

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.720
 smuggled in a cryogenic sperm freezing kit and given it to him

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.160
 and then he'd spermed into it.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.280
 And then she'd give it up.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.800
 She'd spermed into it.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.160
 Yeah, that's the verb, that's the verb.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.200
 That's what you do.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.680
 But she smuggled it in because they're not allowed

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.720
 to touch each other.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.440
 So she smuggled in the kit.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.120
 The only people who the prisoners are allowed to touch in--

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.080
 I think it's in Pennsylvania--

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.720
 people under the age of eight who are allowed

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.080
 to give their parents a hug.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.520
 So she brought her husband's nephew in

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.400
 and gave him the cryogenic sperm freezing kit

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.040
 so that he could hug his uncle and his uncle could slip the kit

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.840
 out from his coat pocket.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.840
 I was Googling worm and sperm.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.520
 There's a lot of amazing things, but they're so disgusting.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.160
 This is a really hard topic to talk about because--

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.760
 OK, so for example, there's a type of worm, a female worm,

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.200
 that when after she's been spermed into--

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.920
 --she can then decide that she doesn't like the sperm.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.280
 So then she puts her face into it and sucks out the sperm

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.720
 and just spits it away.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720
 So--

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.240
 Wow.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:37.720
 Yeah.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.480
 Is there a kind of worm?

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.320
 This is a kind of worm.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:39.800
 Yeah.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.600
 So this worm does it.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.680
 It just goes, no, I'm not having that.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.880
 And goes in, takes, sucks it out.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.360
 And so it's got to the point where the sperm--

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.360
 I think has evolved now to be a bit savvy to it.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.040
 So it has this little clinging stuff inside.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.120
 So actually, it's like you need to properly suck.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600
 Because it's hanging on.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.040
 Because that's amazing.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:32:59.560
 Yeah.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.480
 It's like an arms race between the two sexes in the species.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.000
 Yeah.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.440
 Yeah, because the scaly cricket--

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.360
 I think the male scaly cricket has to copulate constantly.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.080
 It can copulate more than 50 times in three hours or something.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.120
 Because the female scaly cricket, for some evolutionary reason,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.280
 that's beyond us, her response when he does copulate into her

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.480
 is to take it out immediate and eat the sperm.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.320
 So it's very rare he's slipped on through.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.880
 She thinks he'll be feeding her.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.880
 Wow.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.880
 Yeah.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.840
 I found a flatworm and buckle up, guys.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.040
 It's called macrostomum hysterics, right?

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.320
 And if it is lonely, and if it can't find a mate,

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.680
 they're all hemaphrodites.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.120
 So they have both kinds of genitalia.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.960
 If it's lonely, it can stab itself

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.520
 in the head with the sperm-filled hypodermic needle

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.680
 to inseminate itself.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.480
 We've never seen it doing it.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.520
 But scientists left certain worms on their own,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.880
 and they then came back later and they found,

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.800
 oh, they've got a lot of sperm in their head.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.400
 But how did it get there?

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.560
 And these worms had injected themselves

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.160
 because they can fertilize themselves

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.320
 using both bits of genitalia.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.200
 And yeah, and they hatched, and they had hatchlings.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.360
 They call that "selfing."

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.160
 Do they?

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160
 Yeah.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.680
 Do they have selfing sticks?

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:32.520
 There is a ground louse that reproduces

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.160
 by slapping one giant sperm onto a female's back.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:50.200
 And its Latin name is "Zorotipus impoliteus."

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.080
 You know, larger animals tend to have smaller sperm.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.280
 That's the way I think the study was done

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.240
 on this really recently to try and work out why.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:57.920
 And it's quite interesting.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.840
 So fruit fly sperm is the largest sperm in nature,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.360
 I think.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.800
 Elephant sperm are very small.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.080
 So I think a fruit fly sperm is about 1,000 times bigger

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.920
 than an elephant sperm off the top of my head.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.840
 Something like that.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.120
 And it's because, if you're a big animal,

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.040
 then the sperm have further to swim.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.720
 And so in order for them to have a chance to succeed,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.240
 you've got to produce more of them

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.480
 to make it more likely that one of them

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.760
 is going to finally get to the egg.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.920
 And if you produce more of them,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.280
 it takes up more energy so you can't make them as big.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.520
 Whereas if you're a little fruit fly,

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.760
 it's like the sperm, it's easy.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.720
 It's about about a centimeter to go.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.280
 And so you can produce a few giant sperm.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:39.920
 No one, people who are more attractive men wise, have worse sperm.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.640
 So men who are attractive to women

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.480
 tend to be men with deeper voices

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.600
 who are a bit more manly, who evolution has told us

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.040
 we should be attracted to because they've got more testosterone.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.640
 But actually, it's a trade-off.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.160
 So if you fed all your testosterone

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.200
 to building yourself ridiculously large biceps

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.480
 or penis or whatever, then you have less wealthy sperm.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.800
 Have you seen that room in the gym?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.800
 LAUGHTER

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.960
 I assume that's what they were doing.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.800
 LAUGHTER

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.360
 So yeah, keep going.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.360
 That's it, so there's too much testosterone going

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.320
 to making lifting weights with your penis or whatever.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.320
 So it's...

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.600
 You don't have enough leftos to make healthier sperm.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.800
 I find that really surprising.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.880
 I can't believe that testosterone is spent on attractiveness,

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.280
 in that sense.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.920
 Well, I suppose if you're spending on attractiveness,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.440
 then you're going to attract more mates.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.120
 And so there's a higher likelihood

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.680
 that you'll be able to fertilise one of them.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.360
 So it's almost like, "Okay, well, never mind

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.920
 "the less attractive people will give you some better sperm instead,

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.120
 "so that the one mate you finally do manage just as you use.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.360
 "You've got a higher chance."

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.120
 You leave my wife out of this.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.640
 LAUGHTER

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.880

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.480
 LAUGHTER

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.240
