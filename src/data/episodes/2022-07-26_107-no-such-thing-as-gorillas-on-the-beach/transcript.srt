1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,400
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,160
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,920
 this week coming to you from Orrenmore in Glasgow.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
 My name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to stage

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,520
 its Anitazinski James Harkin and Andy Murray.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,520
 (cheering and applause)

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:47,960
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,080
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,360
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that in Utah,

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,920
 it is illegal to wear a hat in your driving license photo

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,760
 but you can wear a colander.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,920
 (cheering and applause)

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,080
 Yeah, one of those pasta strainers, you can wear them.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,160
 (laughing)

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
 Who's genuinely true and it obviously pisses off

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,600
 the authorities whenever someone says it's my right to

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,040
 and the reason they say it's their right to

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,520
 is they say they can do it on religious grounds.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,960
 - Yeah, is it pasta fairy anism?

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,200
 - Pasta fairy anism.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,640
 - Such strong name.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,640
 - How many people know about pasta fairy anism?

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,400
 - How many people are pasta fairings?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
 - I'm a minister.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,920
 - Whoa, did someone just say you're a minister?

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,640
 - Oh no.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
 - What?

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,600
 - If anyone would like to get married tonight.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
 (laughing)

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,240
 Which you can do, can you do it here in Glasgow?

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
 Can you get married?

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,040
 - The legislation that brought in same sex marriages

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,200
 last year, part of that was to allow non-traditional

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,640
 religious groups to perform weddings well.

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
 I'm not quite sure.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,720
 (laughing)

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,520
 - Wait, you're a minister mate.

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,040
 You should have that covered.

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,600
 - Dan, do you know, I'm a minister

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,440
 of the priest of the church of the latter day dude.

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
 - What?

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
 - What?

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
 - Yeah, I signed up online.

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
 (laughing)

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,440
 It's a very, very stringent thing you have to go through.

48
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,400
 You go onto their website, you put your email,

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,960
 it's basically signing up to a mailing list,

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,840
 but they say that then you're a minister in their church.

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
 - What do you get to do?

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
 Apparently it's something.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
 - You get to dude.

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,920
 (laughing)

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
 Dude, dude, dude, you take this woman.

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,280
 (laughing)

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
 I dude.

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,040
 (laughing)

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,560
 - I don't think you're taking my religion.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,920
 - Very serious, sorry.

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
 - Sorry.

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,280
 - So it's from a movie with the dude.

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,960
 I don't know what, I've never seen it in my bioski.

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
 - Oh my god.

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
 - Think of the bioski.

66
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,000
 - You never see, it's like, it's like a Jew

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
 hasn't read the Ten Commandments.

68
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
 (laughing)

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,360
 And when I signed up, I vowed to uphold the principles of dudeism

70
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,600
 to take it easy, to be easy going to everyone I meet

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,880
 and to keep my mind limber.

72
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,560
 And I had to promise that the ordination was for me

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
 and not for someone else or my dog or whatever.

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
 (laughing)

75
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,080
 - That's very cool, that's amazing.

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
 - Wow.

77
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,160
 - So what about paciferianism?

78
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
 What's that all about?

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
 - Well, it was started in 2005, wasn't it?

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,440
 - Yeah.

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
 - And it's people who are protesting against teaching,

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,040
 intelligent design in schools in America

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,760
 as an alternative to evolution.

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,120
 - And so they created their own kind of god,

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
 which was the spaghetti monster.

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 (laughing)

87
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,520
 Yeah, and it's becoming, this is the thing,

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
 it's becoming quite a large religion

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,000
 to the point where people are ministers

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
 and are wearing calendars on their head

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
 because that's the religious headgear

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,200
 that they wear in the photos.

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,320
 And they even have now, it's gone so far

94
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
 that there are some people who aren't quite sure

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,000
 whether or not they believe in the flying spaghetti.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
 (laughing)

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,640
 - Yeah, there's spaghetti monster.

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,560
 - So, most paciferians believe that he's tomato based

99
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
 whereas others believe.

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,280
 (laughing)

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,960
 Whereas others believe that it is pesto or cream.

102
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,040
 (laughing)

103
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,720
 And they're called spagnostics.

104
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
 (laughing)

105
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,680
 - So I have a fact about things that are not hats.

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
 (laughing)

107
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,520
 I wanted to find out things that are not hats

108
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,600
 that have been used as hats.

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,520
 So I googled the phrase worn as a hat, specifically that.

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
 And it turned out that in 2002, a 17-year-old girl

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,160
 wore a chameleon as a hat through Manchester Airport

112
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,040
 and was stopped by the customs guys.

113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,880
 (laughing)

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
 The telegraph said, "Despite its abilities,

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
 a camouflage itself by changing color."

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
 (laughing)

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
 But the chameleon attracted the attention

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
 of people with a luggage carousel.

119
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
 And she'd flown all the way from Dubai

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
 with this thing on her head.

121
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
 (laughing)

122
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
 And it was a very endangered species.

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,120
 So they took it off her and sent it to a safe house

124
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,520
 and eventually sent it back this way.

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
 - There's an Australian guy who once muggled a snake

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,280
 in his underpants to Bali.

127
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,120
 - Yeah.

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,280
 - On a plane, that's an early day.

129
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
 - Is that how you used to do this?

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,440
 (laughing)

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,120
 - Oh yeah, I might have misheard that story.

132
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
 - Yeah.

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,080
 (laughing)

134
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,400
 - Yeah, no, okay, back to you.

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
 - Yeah.

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
 (laughing)

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,200
 - On wearing odd things on your head.

138
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,680
 - I wouldn't put a snake in my pants.

139
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
 - Sorry, sorry.

140
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,880
 - No, please, I think this is a fruitful thing to pursue.

141
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,880
 - I would probably put it in, you know,

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,880
 there's ice cream lolly containers.

143
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,320
 I'd put it in the ice cream lolly container

144
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,040
 and then I'd put the handle on, you know, the lid on.

145
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
 - Right.

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,920
 - I don't think anyone knows what you're talking about.

147
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
 - Guys.

148
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,560
 (laughing)

149
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,520
 You know when you're making a lolly

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,160
 and you pour the lolly stuff into the mold

151
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,240
 and then you put the mold in the freezer,

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
 I put it in one of those.

153
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
 - But that'd be quite a small snake.

154
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
 - Yeah.

155
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
 - You see my lolly mold.

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
 (laughing)

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
 - And that is not the first time I've heard you use

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
 that shelter one.

159
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,800
 (laughing)

160
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,160
 - And it won't be the last.

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,720
 (laughing)

162
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
 - So there's a guy in America

163
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,160
 - Yeah.

164
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,520
 - Who decided to wear a colander on his head

165
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,760
 for his gun license and the police took his guns away.

166
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,400
 (laughing)

167
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,640
 - That's what you have to do to get your guns taken away.

168
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
 (laughing)

169
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,800
 - He said I was told I was mentally competent

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,400
 and I've never misused my guns or intend to do so.

171
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,520
 So it's a real kick in the guts

172
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,960
 that if I was told that I was to go for another photo

173
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,240
 with a colander on my head,

174
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,520
 my guns will be taken away again.

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
 So apparently, if you wear a colander on your head

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
 for your gun license, they're gonna take it off you.

177
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
 And he said he's gonna wear his colander on his head

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
 for his driving license

179
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 and he said what they're gonna do?

180
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,360
 Take my car away.

181
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,840
 (laughing)

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
 I think probably they will.

183
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,360
 (laughing)

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
 - I've read an account that it's someone in Russia

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
 got the first ever license.

186
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
 I think they were the fifth person worldwide

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,240
 to be officially allowed to wear a colander on their head

188
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,640
 because of this planx spaghetti monster.

189
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
 - Yeah.

190
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,840
 - But it said that this person, if he was driving,

191
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,600
 he had to be wearing the colander at all times.

192
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
 (laughing)

193
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,200
 Because you have to look like you do in your license.

194
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,640
 - I think he wore a knitted colander as well.

195
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,400
 - It hates it. - It's not an actual colander.

196
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,640
 It's just a knitted one.

197
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,000
 - On driving licenses,

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,240
 there's a guy called Jared Haiams

199
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,000
 who lives in Victorian Australia

200
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,840
 who's been fighting with authorities for five years now

201
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,840
 for the right to have a penis drawing as his signature.

202
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,680
 (laughing)

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
 - On his driving license.

204
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,960
 (laughing)

205
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
 - And he said this all started.

206
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,000
 He was registering for a change of electoral address

207
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
 and he thought this would be funny

208
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
 rather than sign it, I'm gonna draw a cartoon penis.

209
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
 Which is quite a good drawing of the cartoon penis actually.

210
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,840
 And he said, I was receiving letters and phone calls,

211
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,760
 telling me I couldn't have that as my signature.

212
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,320
 And I thought, that's interesting, why not?

213
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,880
 (laughing)

214
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
 - You don't have to, a signature doesn't have to be you

215
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,400
 writing your name, it just has to be a mark

216
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,280
 that you produce that can look the same every time.

217
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,520
 So if you can draw a consistent penis picture,

218
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,640
 that's your signature, I'm with him on this.

219
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
 - Well, I think he's getting away with it.

220
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,440
 I think it might be on his driving license thing now.

221
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,400
 - And I think he's been signing my front door.

222
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,960
 (laughing)

223
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
 - Yeah.

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,440
 - We need to move on fairly soon to the next fact.

225
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,560
 Anything else before we do?

226
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,080
 - There is a guy, there's a Swedish artist.

227
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,920
 I just love this guy, he's called Frederick Sacker

228
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,320
 and he painted the picture for his driving license, right?

229
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,600
 So he did a self-portrait because you have

230
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,640
 to submit a likeness and a photo,

231
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,000
 but it doesn't have to be a photo of you.

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,240
 It just has to be a photo that looks enough like you

233
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,360
 that if someone looked at it, they thought, oh, that's him.

234
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,760
 So he did a self-portrait, he took a photo of the self-portrait

235
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
 and he submitted it and the authorities said, fine.

236
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,360
 But they were very cool about it.

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
 They just said the picture we have received

238
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
 looks like any other photo,

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
 so we have had no reason to question it,

240
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
 and they'd let him do it.

241
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,840
 - I mean, they're accepting collenders and penises now,

242
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,520
 so I find that unsurprising.

243
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,880
 Can I just, there's a problem

244
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,360
 with driving license applications in the US.

245
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,920
 And this was raised by a woman in Florida last year,

246
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,440
 I think, when she'd had, she got her driving license renewed

247
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
 and she'd had it for a few months

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
 and she started noticing people were treating her a bit weirdly,

249
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
 so she tried to stay in a hotel

250
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
 and she couldn't stay there, they wouldn't let her stay.

251
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,080
 She went to Disney World and they said,

252
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
 I'm sorry, we can't let you park here,

253
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,920
 we can't let you come in.

254
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
 And eventually, someone checked her driving license

255
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,760
 and pointed out that they'd accidentally labeled her

256
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,600
 as a sexual predator rather than an organ donor.

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 (audience laughing)

258
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
 - Whoa.

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
 - That's a different kind of organ, I think.

260
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 (audience laughing)

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,920
 - But only those two boxes are just right next to each other.

262
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,680
 (audience laughing)

263
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,800
 - What box is that though?

264
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
 'Cause it's not like there's another interesting fact section

265
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,080
 on my driving license, there's no trivia bit on your passport,

266
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
 you know?

267
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
 - It's not like, as he says, lolly-mold-infusey act.

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,880
 (audience laughing)

269
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
 - Should we move on to our next fact?

270
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,600
 - Sure.

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

272
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,480
 - My fact is, there was a Victorian job

273
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,880
 that consisted solely of pushing people into the sea.

274
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,640
 (audience laughing)

275
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,920
 This was a real thing, these people were called dippers.

276
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,320
 (audience laughing)

277
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
 And so it's all to do with Victorian swimming etiquette,

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,160
 basically, so they were quite strict

279
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,400
 about segregating sexes for reasons of modesty and decency.

280
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,960
 You would have these people whose job it was

281
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,440
 to push you quickly into the water

282
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
 so that your modesty was preserved as a woman.

283
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,000
 I think it was mostly for female swimmers.

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

285
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,760
 - So these bathing houses that they used to go into,

286
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,040
 that's the thing that got taken into the...

287
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
 - Yeah, so to go swimming,

288
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,640
 you had to go into a special cart on wheels,

289
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,200
 then they would take horses, attach them to the cart,

290
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,640
 the horses would drag the machine into the sea,

291
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
 you would change and then you would dive in off the end.

292
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
 - Yeah.

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,680
 - You would mostly go nude because,

294
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,000
 and I'm hoping that you guys can confirm this,

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
 swimming at the beach,

296
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,880
 and these big, laborious things with horses

297
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,840
 bringing you down there were invented

298
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
 before the swimming suit.

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,520
 So everyone went naked and they're like,

300
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,080
 how do we get around this naked thing?

301
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,840
 Let's build a massive house and then we'll get a horse

302
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,880
 and we'll bring it in, but it just didn't have swimming clothes.

303
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,440
 - I think they did have like woolen swimming suits,

304
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,680
 but they got quite heavy.

305
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
 - But everyone was drowning.

306
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,760
 - People did swim naked at the start of the Victorian period,

307
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
 but then about halfway through everyone,

308
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
 got a little bit prudish as we all know,

309
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,120
 and that's when they had these kind of houses and things,

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
 I think.

311
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,800
 - Yeah.

312
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
 - Because swimming in the Victorian era at first

313
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
 was really more for medical purposes

314
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,360
 than holidaying purposes, wasn't it?

315
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
 And so I think sometimes some people thought

316
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
 you had to be dipped in three times in and out,

317
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,480
 and it was quite important how quickly you got dipped in,

318
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,960
 how many times, and that could cure you

319
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,080
 of TB or flu or whatever you had.

320
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,920
 - Oh wow.

321
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,760
 - So yeah.

322
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,240
 - And they were really unpopular as well.

323
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,200
 People hated the differs.

324
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,320
 So somebody said they were the most horrid looking creatures

325
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
 I ever beheld.

326
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,800
 Good heavens to be dipped by one of them and sourced

327
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
 like a condemned puppy or kitten.

328
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,360
 (audience laughing)

329
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,280
 - I was looking into swimming around the world now,

330
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
 'cause I thought, oh, I wonder if different cultures

331
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,600
 have different ways of going to the beach,

332
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
 and if you're living China and you go to the beach,

333
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,880
 how would that be?

334
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,000
 In China, there's a big new fashion with swimming costumes,

335
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
 and I'd not heard of this, and maybe you all have,

336
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,400
 but called the face keeny.

337
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
 So it's basically, they wear what effectively

338
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,720
 is a nutcher Libre mask over their heads,

339
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240
 because they don't want sun tans, it's a big kind of no-no

340
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,800
 though to have a sun tan.

341
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,120
 So they wear these, yeah, these Mexican wrestling masks,

342
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,160
 and they go to the beach.

343
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,400
 So if you go to the beach in China,

344
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
 it's just packed with wrestlers.

345
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 (audience laughing)

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
 - If you wear one of those, can you go naked

347
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,280
 on the rest of your body?

348
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,200
 - 'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause no one knows who you are.

349
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,440
 - So this is the thing, a lot of people do it now,

350
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
 it's not about the tan anymore.

351
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
 It's about an anonymous state at the beach.

352
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,080
 You can do whatever you want to hang out,

353
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,000
 and just go and do whatever you want,

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,160
 and no one will know who you are.

355
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,720
 - That's, they actually did that.

356
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,040
 Women used to wear masks in the 16th and 17th centuries,

357
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,280
 for exactly that reason.

358
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,600
 It was a fashion thing, so women of high society

359
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,360
 would go around in masks, and they'd often wear them in bed,

360
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,600
 and that was to stop your skin being exposed too much

361
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
 to sunlight and to stop yourself getting a tan,

362
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,280
 'cause it was unfashionable.

363
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,440
 - Wow.

364
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
 - Do you know, it was illegal to be topulous in America

365
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,800
 in the early 20th century, and people were arrested for it?

366
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,640
 - It was a man or woman.

367
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
 - It was a man, sorry.

368
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,920
 I didn't, how sexist am I?

369
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,240
 I just assumed by Tobias, I meant all men.

370
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,680
 Yeah, in 1935, 42 men were arrested for being topulous

371
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,480
 in Atlantic City, and people who were arresting them said,

372
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,960
 "We will have no gorillas on our beaches."

373
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,960
 And yeah, it was a thing, it was so very improper.

374
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,440
 - The man who invented the lava lamp was a nudist, wasn't he?

375
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
 - Yes.

376
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,360
 - Yeah, he used to make videos

377
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,080
 of women swimming underwater naked,

378
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 and then presumably went from there to lava lamp.

379
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
 (audience laughing)

380
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,960
 - Obviously.

381
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,320
 - The logical joke, yeah.

382
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,440
 (laughing)

383
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,840
 - Do you know what's happened to bathing machines today?

384
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
 Do you know what happened to them?

385
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,240
 - No.

386
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
 - They are now, they were repurposed into those bathing hubs

387
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
 that you get at the back of beaches,

388
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
 so they just took the, they wheeled them back off the beach

389
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,960
 as it came as people thought actually it's more sensible

390
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,080
 for us to wear us something costume.

391
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,680
 They wheeled them back to the back of the beach,

392
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,560
 they took the wheels off, and now that's why they're fashionable

393
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,400
 because bathing machines were transformed into that.

394
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,840
 - Oh, someone last year built a new bathing machine,

395
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,760
 incredibly exciting.

396
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
 This is the first one built for 100 years,

397
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,320
 is on the coast, somewhere, obviously.

398
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 (audience laughing)

399
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,320
 I think it was in Margate, and he raised about 30,000 pounds

400
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,520
 on Kickstarter, and it's really cool.

401
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,120
 It features one of the little special features

402
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
 that you used to get on bathing machines,

403
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,280
 but it was a modesty hood,

404
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
 which is this little canvas tent,

405
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,920
 and basically the end that's facing the sea,

406
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,160
 you kind of lower this canvas hood,

407
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
 almost all the way to the water,

408
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,680
 so that you can have even more privacy to get in.

409
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,440
 - That specific awning was invented by a guy called Benjamin Beale,

410
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,040
 and he's often given credit for inventing the entire concept

411
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,280
 of the beach house, the bathing house,

412
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,560
 but all he did was the awning,

413
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
 and he just got all the credit.

414
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,760
 - That is outrageous.

415
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,040
 I'm so glad that you are rewriting everyone's assumptions

416
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,440
 about this guy.

417
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
 (audience laughing)

418
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,960
 I'm glad we've rited that wrong.

419
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,160
 (audience laughing)

420
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,480
 - I know you're an asshole.

421
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
 (audience laughing)

422
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 - Come on, Benjamin Beale.

423
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,680
 (audience laughing)

424
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
 - I was reading about, there's a,

425
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,560
 'cause obviously people love swimming,

426
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,160
 and there's a lot of beautiful places in the UK to go swimming.

427
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
 There's one absolute,

428
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,360
 if you look at photos of this place,

429
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,080
 absolutely beautiful, and it's called The Lagoon of Bucsden.

430
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,640
 Absolutely stunning, but it's really toxic.

431
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,200
 It's really dangerous, and so they're doing everything they can

432
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,720
 to stop people from swimming in it,

433
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,400
 but because it looks so beautiful,

434
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,680
 people just ignore the signs and keep going in.

435
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,680
 So one sign that's up there, it says warning,

436
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,080
 do not enter water, due to high pH levels.

437
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,720
 This can cause skin and eye rotation, stomach problems,

438
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,760
 fungal infections, such as thrush.

439
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,640
 It says that inside there are car wrecks,

440
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,960
 dead animals, excrement, rubbed,

441
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,080
 and still people keep going in.

442
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,400
 They keep going into a swim, and they're getting quite ill.

443
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
 So what they've had to do in the end,

444
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,760
 they've had to die the lagoon black,

445
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,160
 so that people now go, oh, that looks disgusting.

446
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,960
 So they've altered a beautiful place or a beautiful place.

447
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,640
 I wonder why, how beautiful it can be.

448
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,720
 Well, it's full of car wrecks and car experiments.

449
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,040
 Oh, look at that.

450
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,720
 Beautiful, turd floating by.

451
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,680
 Ah, the serenity.

452
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,080
 There are swimming pools in New Zealand,

453
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,000
 which are being terrorised by mystery poors.

454
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,200
 And this is in it.

455
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,240
 Terror, right.

456
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,880
 This is terrorism in New Zealand.

457
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,920
 Yeah, there's a swimming pool.

458
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,720
 One is in a place called Middle March,

459
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
 but there are a couple who've experienced it,

460
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,920
 and there were three feces incidents in a week,

461
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,360
 so they think it was deliberate.

462
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,280
 There was one incident where this was in a invacargue

463
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,120
 splash palace pool, so avoid that.

464
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,680
 Where there was a view.

465
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,840
 No, it sounds beautiful.

466
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,320
 No, James, I went and I got thrushed.

467
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,440
 Yeah, so this place is full of shit

468
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,800
 and Andy's vaginal infections.

469
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,360
 Well, it said there was a large amount of human waste

470
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,640
 deposited into the deep end, so everyone was evacuated

471
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,120
 and moved to the learner's pool,

472
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,920
 and then they were evacuated from that

473
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,040
 when it was discovered that the learner's pool was also full of feces.

474
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,720
 All right, let's move on to our next fact.

475
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,280
 OK, it's time for fact number.

476
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,800
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

477
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,920
 Yes, my fact is that desperate Dan stopped eating cow pie

478
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,400
 because of mad cow disease.

479
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,840
 He gave up cow pie, which is his favorite food.

480
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
 So that was really sad.

481
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
 Yeah, I think it was in 1996, and source is very,

482
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,320
 and I can't find the original comic strips,

483
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,400
 but I think he started eating aunt Aggie's vegetable

484
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,720
 and fish options as a replacement.

485
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,680
 The cow pie's E.A., so the thing with mad cow disease or C.J.D.

486
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,720
 is that the danger was eating strange bits of a cow, wasn't it?

487
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 And desperate Dan did used to eat the whole cow,

488
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,160
 because they had the horn sticking out and the tail sticking out.

489
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,200
 So I would say if anyone was in danger of contracting it,

490
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
 it was probably him.

491
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,040
 We should say, for listeners overseas and things like that,

492
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,240
 who desperate Dan is, just in case people get noticed.

493
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,680
 So Britain's two biggest comics, ever,

494
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,120
 called the Bino and the Dandy, and the Dandy star,

495
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,960
 the cover star, desperate Dan, who was a cowboy,

496
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,560
 and he was this huge guy, and it did amazing things.

497
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,440
 He had to shave with a blowtorch, because he was so tough.

498
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,800
 And he parted his hair by firing a pistol through it.

499
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
 And it's just one of this amazing tradition

500
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,320
 of really, really great comics and really imaginative things.

501
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,800
 I read these when I was a boy, and that's very good.

502
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,160
 He used to smoke through a drain pipe.

503
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,560
 He used to use a drain pipe as a cigarette or a pipe, I think, didn't he?

504
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,600
 And it was a dustbin full of rubbish at the end of it,

505
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,560
 which I think he lit and smokes.

506
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,720
 He was pretty hardcore.

507
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,320
 He was.

508
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,000
 He had a gun.

509
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,280
 He had to give that up as well in the '90s or the '80s

510
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,600
 for political correctness.

511
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,720
 Gone mad.

512
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,320
 So I don't know how he parted his hair after that.

513
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,120
 Maybe he went for--

514
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
 I think he had a water pistol after that.

515
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
 OK, yeah, that's intense.

516
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,480
 He sounds a lot better than the guy who

517
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,000
 was in the first episode of the Bino called Hairy Dan.

518
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,600
 And Hairy Dan was an old man whose long white beard usually

519
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,560
 saved the day.

520
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,120
 And in the first episode, he used his beard as a sail to win a boat race.

521
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,280
 And you could rescue children from down wells?

522
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
 I'm sure he did.

523
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,280
 I think I can see why Dennis the Menace took his top spot after a short while.

524
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
 Those are amazing factors, and they're about Dennis the Menace,

525
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
 which is that they-- so there were two Dennis the Menace's.

526
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,040
 One is an American version, and then one is the British version.

527
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,560
 And they were both created in the same year,

528
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
 independent of each other.

529
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,600
 They had no idea that they were being published.

530
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,560
 They both had the red and black costume.

531
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,880
 They both were called Dennis the Menace.

532
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,560
 I think it might have even been in the same week.

533
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,280
 I think it was the same week, really, really.

534
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,040
 And it's often used by people trying

535
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,560
 to explain coincidences and why they're not surprising

536
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,880
 that you, in a world where infinite things can happen,

537
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,240
 you expect the old coincidences.

538
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,120
 So actually, when we discovered that, we should have gone,

539
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
 well, yeah, obviously, mad things will happen.

540
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,040
 Yes.

541
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,760
 And just move on.

542
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
 It's not amazing at all, in fact.

543
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,160
 The other argument about that is that ideas have a time.

544
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,360
 So maybe there was some other children with spike hair

545
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,920
 in some other cartoon, and other people with red and black,

546
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,040
 and other people called Dennis.

547
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,680
 And the same thing came with calculus, when Liebnitz,

548
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,440
 and Newton all came up with it at the same time.

549
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,920
 It almost did exactly the same time.

550
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,040
 And it's like, well, was it a weird coincidence?

551
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,480
 Or was it just the time for that areas to come up?

552
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,200
 Yeah.

553
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
 Dennis the Menace's dad now has spike hair.

554
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,120
 In fact, the Bino did an extremely exciting reveal

555
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,840
 a few years ago, which was that they showed

556
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,040
 on one of the bits of comic strip, a photograph

557
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,680
 of Dennis the Menace from the '80s.

558
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,760
 And they had Dennis' dad saying, look, that's a picture of me.

559
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,320
 So it transpires that Dennis the Menace is actually now.

560
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,400
 Dennis is dad.

561
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,360
 Oh, I don't know when the switch happens.

562
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,320
 Wait, they used a photo of Dennis the Menace from the '80s.

563
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,520
 Dennis's dad said that used to be me.

564
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,760
 Yeah, there's no plotline where Dennis grows up in the '90s,

565
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,880
 and that's just father's son.

566
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,640
 That's like, that is stupid.

567
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
 I'm so angry here.

568
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:43,040
 Anyway, he's changed his hairstyle, Dennis the Menace's dad,

569
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,240
 so they've tried to upgrade the Bino to make it more realistic.

570
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,080
 And the case is now that we live in a happier time

571
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,880
 where parents don't all abuse their children

572
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,560
 and kids don't all hate their parents.

573
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,320
 And so Dennis's dad is now, yeah, spiky hair,

574
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,960
 and he's a bit cool and groovy.

575
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
 He's a little bit like, I used to be a rebel too.

576
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,240
 Yeah.

577
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
 Is there an authority figure who's still the enemy, though?

578
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,160
 Because that was always the thing.

579
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
 It was always Anarchy, you know, the Batch Street kids,

580
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
 or the like, "Teach was the enemy."

581
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,840
 I think the teachers are still quite bad, but...

582
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,840
 This is called the guy who draws the Batch Street kids.

583
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,800
 This is a niche fact now for people who are at the beach.

584
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,600
 He's called David Sutherland.

585
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,680
 And here's drawn that comic strip since 1962.

586
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
 Wow.

587
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,520
 53 years.

588
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
 He's drawn over 2,000 of them.

589
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,080
 Well, here's a weird one as well.

590
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,000
 Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.

591
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,240
 So the lead singer of the Pet Shop Boys

592
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,960
 between 1975 and 1977, he worked as an editor for Marvel UK.

593
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
 So his job was to anglicise all the things

594
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,960
 that were Americanized in the original comic.

595
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,600
 And his main job was to look at all the points of, say,

596
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,560
 like, cleavage or two short skirts, pointed out,

597
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,800
 and then they had to draw over the cleavage and readdress it,

598
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,080
 because we had different indecency laws over here.

599
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
 Really?

600
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,960
 So the poor Pet Shop Boys, he was stopping cleavage

601
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,160
 from getting into the comic books of...

602
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,040
 There was a big thing in America in the...

603
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 Where was it?

604
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,080
 It was in the '50s, '50s and '60s, where they had a censorship of comics.

605
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 They might have even banned it, banned them for a while,

606
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,720
 but they definitely censored them.

607
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,040
 And there was a guy called Frederick Wurton,

608
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,880
 who wrote a pamphlet called "Ceduction of the Innocents"

609
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,640
 where he complained about all these comics

610
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,280
 and what they were doing to children.

611
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,920
 And he said that Batman and Robin were obviously homosexual.

612
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,160
 And Porkey Pig was an open invitation to Buggery.

613
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,880
 LAUGHTER

614
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,520
 Now, I have never got that from the cartoons.

615
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
 What was this man's name?

616
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
 He was called Frederick Wurton.

617
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,640
 And he was as my contestant, so he should know, actually.

618
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,880
 OK, well, I think there might have been a little bit more going on in the Wurton brain.

619
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,840
 Just on that subject, though, with Porkey Pig,

620
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,880
 there's a very big porn website in America called "PornHub"

621
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,200
 and they recently looked into the analytics of the most search for words.

622
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
 Within people go on, they put in a word like "Milf"

623
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,760
 was a massive one in a lot of American states, stuff like that.

624
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,800
 They found that in Nebraska, Arkansas, and Tennessee,

625
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,000
 the number one search term was "Cartoon".

626
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,040
 Another fact, in South London, it was lollimold.

627
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:22,760
 LAUGHTER

628
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,320
 What were on this?

629
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,480
 LAUGHTER

630
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,440
 I read a list of characters in the Bino.

631
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,640
 OK.

632
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:42,000
 And they included "Little Dead Eye Dick", "Deep Down Daddy Neptune",

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,720
 "Cocky Dick", "Wondering Willie", "Sticky Willie",

634
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,160
 and "Polly Wodley Doodle" and "Her Great Big Poodle".

635
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,800
 So every single one of those is an invitation to Bugery.

636
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
 If Frederick had been around.

637
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,040
 Open. Not a private invitation to Bugery.

638
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,960
 It's on the billboard, it's at your turn.

639
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,280
 On Facebook, it is, this is an open event.

640
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,840
 Do you guys know what the world's first comic strip is?

641
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,400
 Bio-tapestry.

642
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
 That's very funny.

643
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,520
 A lot of good comedy in there, if you want to see it.

644
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
 No, I think so.

645
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,480
 I think Rusty and me, a comic strip is a series of cartoons

646
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,200
 that are sent out to people's homes.

647
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,920
 So the beer tapestry was just in one place.

648
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,720
 You didn't receive it through the letterbox.

649
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,640
 So, which have speech bubbles and people talking.

650
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,560
 And the first one was made in Glasgow.

651
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,040
 And it was the Glasgow-- well done.

652
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,520
 It was the Glasgow-looking glass.

653
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,280
 And it was in the-- in 1825, it had its first issue.

654
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,840
 And the first comic strip in it was called "The History of the Coat."

655
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,800
 And it was--

656
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,840
 [LAUGHTER]

657
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,320
 It was the adventures of a coat going from one owner to the next.

658
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
 That's a pretty good one.

659
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,040
 That's really cool.

660
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,720
 Kind of cool, yeah.

661
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,840
 And also, it had a lot of heart-hitting sati.

662
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,400
 It had a lot of bitching about the English in it.

663
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,120
 Even though it was set up by a English guy who'd had to flee London

664
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,600
 because he was in so much debt.

665
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
 So he went to Scotland and was obviously like, OK, cool.

666
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,280
 I like these guys.

667
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,600
 He made a comic strip, which partly bitched about the English.

668
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,400
 And then he racked up so much gambling and drinking debts in Scotland

669
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,600
 that he had to flee again back to England.

670
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,120
 [LAUGHTER]

671
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,440
 And so it stopped.

672
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,840
 Do you know who invented the speech bubble?

673
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,240
 Oh, controversial.

674
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
 I've got a theory.

675
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 What's yours?

676
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,680
 My theory is that it's 650 BC.

677
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,360
 And it was the Meso-Americans, early central American people.

678
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
 Are they of super fame?

679
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,800
 Or is that--

680
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,760
 [LAUGHTER]

681
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,920
 Have I pronounced that right just in case we get letters?

682
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,000
 It doesn't mess up.

683
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,520
 All right.

684
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,960
 I don't think any of them are going to write to you now, Andy.

685
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,200
 But they have little speech bubble.

686
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,240
 They have drawings of people.

687
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,560
 And they have these tiny little sort of arrows

688
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,440
 showing that, like, to a dagger drawing.

689
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,080
 And it shows that people are slacking each other off in the drawings.

690
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
 Yeah.

691
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,560
 And that is a speech bubble that's sort of signifying abuse.

692
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,000
 And do you agree with that, Anna?

693
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,240
 I do agree with that, probably, yes.

694
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,400
 You know, super-ted.

695
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,240
 You know that his first language is not, in fact, English.

696
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,400
 It's Welsh.

697
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 Yeah, really.

698
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,640
 Super-ted's first language as well.

699
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,720
 So it's a Welsh cartoon.

700
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,360
 And when it first went out, it was in Welsh.

701
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,680
 And they just dubbed it into English.

702
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
 We should move on soon.

703
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,360
 Have you guys got anything else before we do?

704
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,160
 I quite liked the quote from you and Kerr,

705
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,040
 who was a--

706
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
 I can't talk about it.

707
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,480
 You won Kerr.

708
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,120
 Poor you, Anna.

709
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,280
 [APPLAUSE]

710
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,640
 How did I not see that?

711
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,400
 I'm not really doing my job properly.

712
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,520
 I wrote down the name You and Kerr.

713
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
 I did the notice.

714
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,320
 I'm so embarrassed.

715
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,200
 Yeah, so Youwanker is a top guy at DC.

716
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
 Thompson, which makes the vino and the dandy.

717
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,040
 And he was-- there's an interview with him

718
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,440
 semi-bemoning how they've had to go a bit politically correct.

719
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,280
 So corporal punishment, smoking, and racial stereotypes

720
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,320
 are now taboo.

721
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,800
 It does limit us in a way.

722
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,880
 [LAUGHTER]

723
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,080
 But we get to be slightly ruder than in the old days.

724
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,040
 A bit more bodily functions instead.

725
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 We know that's what the kids laugh at now.

726
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,120
 Those stupid kids, not laughing at the racial stereotypes anymore.

727
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,400
 [LAUGHTER]

728
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,360
 Let's move on to our final fact of the night.

729
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
 And that is James Harkin.

730
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,240
 OK, my fact this week is that the oldest sperm is worm sperm.

731
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,040
 [LAUGHTER]

732
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,640
 Mostly because I just like the cadence of it.

733
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,440
 But we found some 50 million-year-old sperm cells.

734
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,880
 No, ask them what we ask.

735
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,400
 You leave us out of it.

736
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,080
 [LAUGHTER]

737
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,520
 I was swimming in bookstore.

738
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,760
 [LAUGHTER]

739
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,600
 We have 50 million-year-old sperm cells.

740
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,400
 And they have been found in an Antarctic worm.

741
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,920
 And they were in a fossilized cocoon.

742
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,000
 Because normally sperm cells are so small and delicate,

743
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,200
 they normally die, and they don't get fossilized.

744
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,440
 But these ones did get fossilized.

745
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,840
 And they're the oldest ones that we have.

746
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,040
 And they're from worms.

747
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,000
 50 million years.

748
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,680
 Did you know that sperm had evolved at that point?

749
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,680
 Or is this the first proof we've had that it did evolve there?

750
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,320
 I don't know about that, actually.

751
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,360
 But yeah, I suppose there was no evidence

752
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,480
 that they'd evolved at that stage.

753
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
 It kind of been.

754
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,680
 Does it still function?

755
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,280
 [LAUGHTER]

756
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,520
 There is a sperm that's worked after 23 years, I think.

757
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
 So the world's oldest baby is 23 years old.

758
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,960
 This is an Australian guy who got quite ill.

759
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,880
 And he was, I think, 15 years old at the time.

760
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,520
 And he decided to save his sperm before he was going

761
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,160
 to have some kind of operation.

762
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,880
 He survived his problem.

763
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,040
 He grew old.

764
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,800
 He got married.

765
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,240
 And then I think the operation that he needed at the point

766
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
 meant that he could no longer produce sperm.

767
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,880
 So he had this sitting there from all those years ago.

768
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,120
 And they used that, and it worked.

769
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,120
 And so he has a kid from his sperm from when he was 15.

770
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,560
 It was like frozen in a lab.

771
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,120
 It wasn't just sitting there.

772
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,240
 [LAUGHTER]

773
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,960
 Because you have to freeze it properly, don't you?

774
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,920
 You have to freeze it at a really low temperature.

775
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,480
 Freeze the temperature will not do.

776
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,000
 Yes.

777
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

778
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 That's a man who spends a lot of his time, apparently.

779
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,240
 They're refrigerated, yeah.

780
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,040
 Thinking-- I'm now thinking that lollimold sounds

781
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,800
 like a disease.

782
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,320
 It's the touch of lollimold, anyway.

783
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,920
 And there are sperm smugglers as well who are freezing sperm.

784
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,160
 Smuggling-- smuggling is happening in--

785
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,320
 not spuggling.

786
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,480
 That's what they should call it.

787
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,400
 Is they should call it spuggling or something, yeah?

788
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,360
 So what's with people smuggling sperm?

789
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,200
 Yeah.

790
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,040
 Boltzperman.

791
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
 Boltzperman.

792
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,160
 No, this is in prisons.

793
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,320
 So people who are in prison who aren't allowed

794
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,800
 to have contact with their wives are smuggling sperm.

795
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,880
 So there's a baby who was born to Regina Granato in America

796
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,080
 in 1999, even though her husband had been in prison since 1987.

797
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,240
 He was a gang leader gangster.

798
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,040
 And yeah, this baby was born because she'd

799
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,720
 smuggled in a cryogenic sperm freezing kit and given it to him

800
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
 and then he'd spermed into it.

801
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,280
 And then she'd give it up.

802
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,800
 She'd spermed into it.

803
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,760
 [LAUGHTER]

804
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,160
 Yeah, that's the verb, that's the verb.

805
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,200
 That's what you do.

806
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,680
 But she smuggled it in because they're not allowed

807
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,720
 to touch each other.

808
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,440
 So she smuggled in the kit.

809
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,120
 The only people who the prisoners are allowed to touch in--

810
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,080
 I think it's in Pennsylvania--

811
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,720
 people under the age of eight who are allowed

812
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,080
 to give their parents a hug.

813
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,520
 So she brought her husband's nephew in

814
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,400
 and gave him the cryogenic sperm freezing kit

815
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,040
 so that he could hug his uncle and his uncle could slip the kit

816
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,840
 out from his coat pocket.

817
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
 I was Googling worm and sperm.

818
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,520
 There's a lot of amazing things, but they're so disgusting.

819
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,160
 This is a really hard topic to talk about because--

820
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,760
 OK, so for example, there's a type of worm, a female worm,

821
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,200
 that when after she's been spermed into--

822
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,720
 [LAUGHTER]

823
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,920
 --she can then decide that she doesn't like the sperm.

824
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,280
 So then she puts her face into it and sucks out the sperm

825
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,720
 and just spits it away.

826
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
 So--

827
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,240
 Wow.

828
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,720
 Yeah.

829
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,480
 Is there a kind of worm?

830
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,320
 This is a kind of worm.

831
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,800
 Yeah.

832
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,600
 So this worm does it.

833
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,680
 It just goes, no, I'm not having that.

834
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,880
 And goes in, takes, sucks it out.

835
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,360
 And so it's got to the point where the sperm--

836
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
 I think has evolved now to be a bit savvy to it.

837
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,040
 So it has this little clinging stuff inside.

838
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,120
 So actually, it's like you need to properly suck.

839
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,600
 [LAUGHTER]

840
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
 Because it's hanging on.

841
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,040
 Because that's amazing.

842
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,560
 Yeah.

843
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,480
 It's like an arms race between the two sexes in the species.

844
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,000
 Yeah.

845
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
 Yeah, because the scaly cricket--

846
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
 I think the male scaly cricket has to copulate constantly.

847
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,080
 It can copulate more than 50 times in three hours or something.

848
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,120
 Because the female scaly cricket, for some evolutionary reason,

849
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,280
 that's beyond us, her response when he does copulate into her

850
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,480
 is to take it out immediate and eat the sperm.

851
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,320
 So it's very rare he's slipped on through.

852
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,880
 She thinks he'll be feeding her.

853
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
 Wow.

854
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 Yeah.

855
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,840
 I found a flatworm and buckle up, guys.

856
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,360
 [LAUGHTER]

857
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,040
 It's called macrostomum hysterics, right?

858
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,320
 And if it is lonely, and if it can't find a mate,

859
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,680
 they're all hemaphrodites.

860
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,120
 So they have both kinds of genitalia.

861
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,960
 If it's lonely, it can stab itself

862
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,520
 in the head with the sperm-filled hypodermic needle

863
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,680
 to inseminate itself.

864
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,480
 We've never seen it doing it.

865
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,520
 But scientists left certain worms on their own,

866
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,880
 and they then came back later and they found,

867
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,800
 oh, they've got a lot of sperm in their head.

868
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,400
 But how did it get there?

869
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,560
 And these worms had injected themselves

870
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,160
 because they can fertilize themselves

871
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,320
 using both bits of genitalia.

872
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,200
 And yeah, and they hatched, and they had hatchlings.

873
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,360
 They call that "selfing."

874
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,160
 Do they?

875
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
 Yeah.

876
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,680
 Do they have selfing sticks?

877
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,160
 [LAUGHTER]

878
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:32,520
 There is a ground louse that reproduces

879
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,160
 by slapping one giant sperm onto a female's back.

880
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:50,200
 And its Latin name is "Zorotipus impoliteus."

881
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,080
 You know, larger animals tend to have smaller sperm.

882
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,280
 That's the way I think the study was done

883
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,240
 on this really recently to try and work out why.

884
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,920
 And it's quite interesting.

885
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,840
 So fruit fly sperm is the largest sperm in nature,

886
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,360
 I think.

887
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
 Elephant sperm are very small.

888
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,080
 So I think a fruit fly sperm is about 1,000 times bigger

889
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,920
 than an elephant sperm off the top of my head.

890
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,840
 Something like that.

891
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,120
 And it's because, if you're a big animal,

892
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,040
 then the sperm have further to swim.

893
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,720
 And so in order for them to have a chance to succeed,

894
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,240
 you've got to produce more of them

895
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,480
 to make it more likely that one of them

896
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,760
 is going to finally get to the egg.

897
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,920
 And if you produce more of them,

898
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,280
 it takes up more energy so you can't make them as big.

899
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,520
 Whereas if you're a little fruit fly,

900
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
 it's like the sperm, it's easy.

901
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,720
 It's about about a centimeter to go.

902
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,280
 And so you can produce a few giant sperm.

903
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:39,920
 No one, people who are more attractive men wise, have worse sperm.

904
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,640
 So men who are attractive to women

905
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,480
 tend to be men with deeper voices

906
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,600
 who are a bit more manly, who evolution has told us

907
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,040
 we should be attracted to because they've got more testosterone.

908
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,640
 But actually, it's a trade-off.

909
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,160
 So if you fed all your testosterone

910
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,200
 to building yourself ridiculously large biceps

911
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,480
 or penis or whatever, then you have less wealthy sperm.

912
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,800
 Have you seen that room in the gym?

913
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,800
 LAUGHTER

914
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,960
 I assume that's what they were doing.

915
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,800
 LAUGHTER

916
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,360
 So yeah, keep going.

917
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 That's it, so there's too much testosterone going

918
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,320
 to making lifting weights with your penis or whatever.

919
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
 So it's...

920
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,600
 You don't have enough leftos to make healthier sperm.

921
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,800
 I find that really surprising.

922
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,880
 I can't believe that testosterone is spent on attractiveness,

923
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,280
 in that sense.

924
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,920
 Well, I suppose if you're spending on attractiveness,

925
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,440
 then you're going to attract more mates.

926
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,120
 And so there's a higher likelihood

927
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,680
 that you'll be able to fertilise one of them.

928
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,360
 So it's almost like, "Okay, well, never mind

929
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,920
 "the less attractive people will give you some better sperm instead,

930
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,120
 "so that the one mate you finally do manage just as you use.

931
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,360
 "You've got a higher chance."

932
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,120
 You leave my wife out of this.

933
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,640
 LAUGHTER

934
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,880
 Well, goodness, why haven't we learnt to lie to you?

935
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,480
 LAUGHTER

936
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,240
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.
