00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:21,this week coming to you from Orrenmore in Glasgow.
00:00:21,00:00:24,My name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to stage
00:00:24,00:00:27,its Anitazinski James Harkin and Andy Murray.
00:00:27,00:00:30,(cheering and applause)
00:00:30,00:00:47,And once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:47,00:00:50,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:50,00:00:53,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:53,00:00:57,"Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that in Utah,"
00:00:57,00:01:00,it is illegal to wear a hat in your driving license photo
00:01:00,00:01:02,but you can wear a colander.
00:01:02,00:01:03,(cheering and applause)
00:01:03,00:01:08,"Yeah, one of those pasta strainers, you can wear them."
00:01:08,00:01:10,(laughing)
00:01:10,00:01:12,Who's genuinely true and it obviously pisses off
00:01:12,00:01:14,the authorities whenever someone says it's my right to
00:01:14,00:01:16,and the reason they say it's their right to
00:01:16,00:01:18,is they say they can do it on religious grounds.
00:01:18,00:01:19,"- Yeah, is it pasta fairy anism?"
00:01:19,00:01:21,- Pasta fairy anism.
00:01:21,00:01:23,- Such strong name.
00:01:23,00:01:26,- How many people know about pasta fairy anism?
00:01:26,00:01:29,- How many people are pasta fairings?
00:01:29,00:01:30,- I'm a minister.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"- Whoa, did someone just say you're a minister?"
00:01:32,00:01:34,- Oh no.
00:01:34,00:01:35,- What?
00:01:35,00:01:37,- If anyone would like to get married tonight.
00:01:37,00:01:39,(laughing)
00:01:39,00:01:42,"Which you can do, can you do it here in Glasgow?"
00:01:42,00:01:43,Can you get married?
00:01:43,00:01:46,- The legislation that brought in same sex marriages
00:01:46,00:01:50,"last year, part of that was to allow non-traditional"
00:01:50,00:01:52,religious groups to perform weddings well.
00:01:52,00:01:54,I'm not quite sure.
00:01:54,00:01:55,(laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:57,"- Wait, you're a minister mate."
00:01:57,00:02:00,You should have that covered.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- Dan, do you know, I'm a minister"
00:02:02,00:02:06,of the priest of the church of the latter day dude.
00:02:06,00:02:07,- What?
00:02:07,00:02:08,- What?
00:02:08,00:02:09,"- Yeah, I signed up online."
00:02:09,00:02:12,(laughing)
00:02:12,00:02:14,"It's a very, very stringent thing you have to go through."
00:02:14,00:02:16,"You go onto their website, you put your email,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"it's basically signing up to a mailing list,"
00:02:18,00:02:21,but they say that then you're a minister in their church.
00:02:21,00:02:23,- What do you get to do?
00:02:23,00:02:24,Apparently it's something.
00:02:24,00:02:25,- You get to dude.
00:02:25,00:02:27,(laughing)
00:02:27,00:02:30,"Dude, dude, dude, you take this woman."
00:02:30,00:02:32,(laughing)
00:02:32,00:02:33,I dude.
00:02:33,00:02:36,(laughing)
00:02:36,00:02:37,- I don't think you're taking my religion.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"- Very serious, sorry."
00:02:38,00:02:39,- Sorry.
00:02:39,00:02:42,- So it's from a movie with the dude.
00:02:42,00:02:43,"I don't know what, I've never seen it in my bioski."
00:02:43,00:02:44,- Oh my god.
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Think of the bioski.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"- You never see, it's like, it's like a Jew"
00:02:48,00:02:49,hasn't read the Ten Commandments.
00:02:49,00:02:52,(laughing)
00:02:52,00:02:56,"And when I signed up, I vowed to uphold the principles of dudeism"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"to take it easy, to be easy going to everyone I meet"
00:02:59,00:03:01,and to keep my mind limber.
00:03:01,00:03:04,And I had to promise that the ordination was for me
00:03:04,00:03:07,and not for someone else or my dog or whatever.
00:03:07,00:03:10,(laughing)
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- That's very cool, that's amazing."
00:03:12,00:03:12,- Wow.
00:03:12,00:03:14,- So what about paciferianism?
00:03:14,00:03:15,What's that all about?
00:03:15,00:03:16,"- Well, it was started in 2005, wasn't it?"
00:03:16,00:03:17,- Yeah.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"- And it's people who are protesting against teaching,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,intelligent design in schools in America
00:03:21,00:03:22,as an alternative to evolution.
00:03:22,00:03:25,"- And so they created their own kind of god,"
00:03:25,00:03:26,which was the spaghetti monster.
00:03:26,00:03:27,(laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:29,"Yeah, and it's becoming, this is the thing,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,it's becoming quite a large religion
00:03:31,00:03:34,to the point where people are ministers
00:03:34,00:03:37,and are wearing calendars on their head
00:03:37,00:03:38,because that's the religious headgear
00:03:38,00:03:40,that they wear in the photos.
00:03:40,00:03:42,"And they even have now, it's gone so far"
00:03:42,00:03:44,that there are some people who aren't quite sure
00:03:44,00:03:47,whether or not they believe in the flying spaghetti.
00:03:47,00:03:47,(laughing)
00:03:47,00:03:49,"- Yeah, there's spaghetti monster."
00:03:49,00:03:53,"- So, most paciferians believe that he's tomato based"
00:03:53,00:03:54,whereas others believe.
00:03:54,00:03:57,(laughing)
00:03:57,00:03:59,Whereas others believe that it is pesto or cream.
00:03:59,00:04:02,(laughing)
00:04:02,00:04:03,And they're called spagnostics.
00:04:03,00:04:05,(laughing)
00:04:05,00:04:12,- So I have a fact about things that are not hats.
00:04:12,00:04:14,(laughing)
00:04:14,00:04:17,I wanted to find out things that are not hats
00:04:17,00:04:18,that have been used as hats.
00:04:18,00:04:23,"So I googled the phrase worn as a hat, specifically that."
00:04:23,00:04:28,"And it turned out that in 2002, a 17-year-old girl"
00:04:28,00:04:31,wore a chameleon as a hat through Manchester Airport
00:04:31,00:04:34,and was stopped by the customs guys.
00:04:34,00:04:34,(laughing)
00:04:34,00:04:36,"The telegraph said, ""Despite its abilities,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,"a camouflage itself by changing color."""
00:04:38,00:04:40,(laughing)
00:04:40,00:04:42,But the chameleon attracted the attention
00:04:42,00:04:44,of people with a luggage carousel.
00:04:44,00:04:46,And she'd flown all the way from Dubai
00:04:46,00:04:47,with this thing on her head.
00:04:47,00:04:48,(laughing)
00:04:48,00:04:49,And it was a very endangered species.
00:04:49,00:04:52,So they took it off her and sent it to a safe house
00:04:52,00:04:53,and eventually sent it back this way.
00:04:53,00:04:57,- There's an Australian guy who once muggled a snake
00:04:57,00:05:00,in his underpants to Bali.
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"- On a plane, that's an early day."
00:05:02,00:05:03,- Is that how you used to do this?
00:05:03,00:05:04,(laughing)
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Oh yeah, I might have misheard that story."
00:05:06,00:05:06,- Yeah.
00:05:06,00:05:09,(laughing)
00:05:09,00:05:10,"- Yeah, no, okay, back to you."
00:05:10,00:05:11,- Yeah.
00:05:11,00:05:13,(laughing)
00:05:13,00:05:15,- On wearing odd things on your head.
00:05:15,00:05:16,- I wouldn't put a snake in my pants.
00:05:16,00:05:17,"- Sorry, sorry."
00:05:17,00:05:19,"- No, please, I think this is a fruitful thing to pursue."
00:05:19,00:05:22,"- I would probably put it in, you know,"
00:05:22,00:05:25,there's ice cream lolly containers.
00:05:25,00:05:27,I'd put it in the ice cream lolly container
00:05:27,00:05:30,"and then I'd put the handle on, you know, the lid on."
00:05:30,00:05:30,- Right.
00:05:30,00:05:32,- I don't think anyone knows what you're talking about.
00:05:32,00:05:33,- Guys.
00:05:33,00:05:35,(laughing)
00:05:35,00:05:37,You know when you're making a lolly
00:05:37,00:05:39,and you pour the lolly stuff into the mold
00:05:39,00:05:40,"and then you put the mold in the freezer,"
00:05:40,00:05:41,I put it in one of those.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- But that'd be quite a small snake.
00:05:42,00:05:43,- Yeah.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- You see my lolly mold.
00:05:44,00:05:46,(laughing)
00:05:46,00:05:48,- And that is not the first time I've heard you use
00:05:48,00:05:49,that shelter one.
00:05:49,00:05:51,(laughing)
00:05:51,00:05:54,- And it won't be the last.
00:05:54,00:05:56,(laughing)
00:05:56,00:05:58,- So there's a guy in America
00:05:58,00:05:59,- Yeah.
00:05:59,00:06:01,- Who decided to wear a colander on his head
00:06:01,00:06:05,for his gun license and the police took his guns away.
00:06:05,00:06:07,(laughing)
00:06:07,00:06:09,- That's what you have to do to get your guns taken away.
00:06:09,00:06:11,(laughing)
00:06:11,00:06:14,- He said I was told I was mentally competent
00:06:14,00:06:17,and I've never misused my guns or intend to do so.
00:06:17,00:06:19,So it's a real kick in the guts
00:06:19,00:06:21,that if I was told that I was to go for another photo
00:06:21,00:06:23,"with a colander on my head,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,my guns will be taken away again.
00:06:25,00:06:27,"So apparently, if you wear a colander on your head"
00:06:27,00:06:30,"for your gun license, they're gonna take it off you."
00:06:30,00:06:32,And he said he's gonna wear his colander on his head
00:06:32,00:06:34,for his driving license
00:06:34,00:06:35,and he said what they're gonna do?
00:06:35,00:06:36,Take my car away.
00:06:36,00:06:37,(laughing)
00:06:37,00:06:38,I think probably they will.
00:06:38,00:06:41,(laughing)
00:06:42,00:06:44,- I've read an account that it's someone in Russia
00:06:44,00:06:46,got the first ever license.
00:06:46,00:06:47,I think they were the fifth person worldwide
00:06:47,00:06:49,to be officially allowed to wear a colander on their head
00:06:49,00:06:51,because of this planx spaghetti monster.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- Yeah.
00:06:52,00:06:54,"- But it said that this person, if he was driving,"
00:06:54,00:06:57,he had to be wearing the colander at all times.
00:06:57,00:06:58,(laughing)
00:06:58,00:07:02,Because you have to look like you do in your license.
00:07:02,00:07:04,- I think he wore a knitted colander as well.
00:07:04,00:07:06,- It hates it. - It's not an actual colander.
00:07:06,00:07:08,It's just a knitted one.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"- On driving licenses,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,there's a guy called Jared Haiams
00:07:13,00:07:15,who lives in Victorian Australia
00:07:15,00:07:17,who's been fighting with authorities for five years now
00:07:17,00:07:20,for the right to have a penis drawing as his signature.
00:07:20,00:07:21,(laughing)
00:07:21,00:07:23,- On his driving license.
00:07:23,00:07:24,(laughing)
00:07:24,00:07:26,- And he said this all started.
00:07:26,00:07:29,He was registering for a change of electoral address
00:07:29,00:07:30,and he thought this would be funny
00:07:30,00:07:32,"rather than sign it, I'm gonna draw a cartoon penis."
00:07:32,00:07:35,Which is quite a good drawing of the cartoon penis actually.
00:07:35,00:07:38,"And he said, I was receiving letters and phone calls,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,telling me I couldn't have that as my signature.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"And I thought, that's interesting, why not?"
00:07:43,00:07:44,(laughing)
00:07:44,00:07:46,"- You don't have to, a signature doesn't have to be you"
00:07:46,00:07:48,"writing your name, it just has to be a mark"
00:07:48,00:07:50,that you produce that can look the same every time.
00:07:50,00:07:54,"So if you can draw a consistent penis picture,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"that's your signature, I'm with him on this."
00:07:56,00:07:57,"- Well, I think he's getting away with it."
00:07:57,00:08:00,I think it might be on his driving license thing now.
00:08:00,00:08:02,- And I think he's been signing my front door.
00:08:02,00:08:03,(laughing)
00:08:03,00:08:04,- Yeah.
00:08:04,00:08:10,- We need to move on fairly soon to the next fact.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Anything else before we do?
00:08:11,00:08:13,"- There is a guy, there's a Swedish artist."
00:08:13,00:08:14,"I just love this guy, he's called Frederick Sacker"
00:08:14,00:08:18,"and he painted the picture for his driving license, right?"
00:08:18,00:08:21,So he did a self-portrait because you have
00:08:21,00:08:24,"to submit a likeness and a photo,"
00:08:24,00:08:27,but it doesn't have to be a photo of you.
00:08:27,00:08:29,It just has to be a photo that looks enough like you
00:08:29,00:08:32,"that if someone looked at it, they thought, oh, that's him."
00:08:32,00:08:35,"So he did a self-portrait, he took a photo of the self-portrait"
00:08:35,00:08:38,"and he submitted it and the authorities said, fine."
00:08:38,00:08:41,But they were very cool about it.
00:08:41,00:08:42,They just said the picture we have received
00:08:42,00:08:44,"looks like any other photo,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"so we have had no reason to question it,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,and they'd let him do it.
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- I mean, they're accepting collenders and penises now,"
00:08:49,00:08:53,so I find that unsurprising.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"Can I just, there's a problem"
00:08:55,00:08:58,with driving license applications in the US.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"And this was raised by a woman in Florida last year,"
00:09:00,00:09:04,"I think, when she'd had, she got her driving license renewed"
00:09:04,00:09:06,and she'd had it for a few months
00:09:06,00:09:08,"and she started noticing people were treating her a bit weirdly,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,so she tried to stay in a hotel
00:09:09,00:09:11,"and she couldn't stay there, they wouldn't let her stay."
00:09:11,00:09:13,"She went to Disney World and they said,"
00:09:13,00:09:14,"I'm sorry, we can't let you park here,"
00:09:14,00:09:15,we can't let you come in.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"And eventually, someone checked her driving license"
00:09:18,00:09:20,and pointed out that they'd accidentally labeled her
00:09:20,00:09:23,as a sexual predator rather than an organ donor.
00:09:23,00:09:26,(audience laughing)
00:09:26,00:09:27,- Whoa.
00:09:27,00:09:29,"- That's a different kind of organ, I think."
00:09:29,00:09:32,(audience laughing)
00:09:32,00:09:34,- But only those two boxes are just right next to each other.
00:09:34,00:09:37,(audience laughing)
00:09:37,00:09:39,- What box is that though?
00:09:39,00:09:42,'Cause it's not like there's another interesting fact section
00:09:42,00:09:47,"on my driving license, there's no trivia bit on your passport,"
00:09:47,00:09:47,you know?
00:09:47,00:09:50,"- It's not like, as he says, lolly-mold-infusey act."
00:09:50,00:09:53,(audience laughing)
00:09:53,00:09:56,- Should we move on to our next fact?
00:09:56,00:09:57,- Sure.
00:09:57,00:10:00,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:10:00,00:10:03,"- My fact is, there was a Victorian job"
00:10:03,00:10:06,that consisted solely of pushing people into the sea.
00:10:06,00:10:09,(audience laughing)
00:10:09,00:10:12,"This was a real thing, these people were called dippers."
00:10:12,00:10:14,(audience laughing)
00:10:14,00:10:18,"And so it's all to do with Victorian swimming etiquette,"
00:10:18,00:10:21,"basically, so they were quite strict"
00:10:21,00:10:25,about segregating sexes for reasons of modesty and decency.
00:10:25,00:10:27,You would have these people whose job it was
00:10:27,00:10:30,to push you quickly into the water
00:10:30,00:10:32,so that your modesty was preserved as a woman.
00:10:32,00:10:34,I think it was mostly for female swimmers.
00:10:34,00:10:34,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:34,00:10:37,"- So these bathing houses that they used to go into,"
00:10:37,00:10:40,that's the thing that got taken into the...
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- Yeah, so to go swimming,"
00:10:41,00:10:45,"you had to go into a special cart on wheels,"
00:10:45,00:10:48,"then they would take horses, attach them to the cart,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"the horses would drag the machine into the sea,"
00:10:50,00:10:54,you would change and then you would dive in off the end.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Yeah.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"- You would mostly go nude because,"
00:10:56,00:11:00,"and I'm hoping that you guys can confirm this,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,"swimming at the beach,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"and these big, laborious things with horses"
00:11:03,00:11:05,bringing you down there were invented
00:11:05,00:11:07,before the swimming suit.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"So everyone went naked and they're like,"
00:11:09,00:11:11,how do we get around this naked thing?
00:11:11,00:11:14,Let's build a massive house and then we'll get a horse
00:11:14,00:11:17,"and we'll bring it in, but it just didn't have swimming clothes."
00:11:17,00:11:20,"- I think they did have like woolen swimming suits,"
00:11:20,00:11:21,but they got quite heavy.
00:11:21,00:11:22,- But everyone was drowning.
00:11:22,00:11:27,"- People did swim naked at the start of the Victorian period,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,"but then about halfway through everyone,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,"got a little bit prudish as we all know,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"and that's when they had these kind of houses and things,"
00:11:33,00:11:33,I think.
00:11:33,00:11:34,- Yeah.
00:11:34,00:11:36,- Because swimming in the Victorian era at first
00:11:36,00:11:37,was really more for medical purposes
00:11:37,00:11:39,"than holidaying purposes, wasn't it?"
00:11:39,00:11:41,And so I think sometimes some people thought
00:11:41,00:11:43,"you had to be dipped in three times in and out,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,"and it was quite important how quickly you got dipped in,"
00:11:45,00:11:46,"how many times, and that could cure you"
00:11:46,00:11:49,of TB or flu or whatever you had.
00:11:49,00:11:49,- Oh wow.
00:11:49,00:11:50,- So yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:52,- And they were really unpopular as well.
00:11:52,00:11:54,People hated the differs.
00:11:54,00:11:57,So somebody said they were the most horrid looking creatures
00:11:57,00:11:58,I ever beheld.
00:11:58,00:12:00,Good heavens to be dipped by one of them and sourced
00:12:00,00:12:03,like a condemned puppy or kitten.
00:12:03,00:12:06,(audience laughing)
00:12:06,00:12:09,"- I was looking into swimming around the world now,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,"'cause I thought, oh, I wonder if different cultures"
00:12:10,00:12:12,"have different ways of going to the beach,"
00:12:12,00:12:14,"and if you're living China and you go to the beach,"
00:12:14,00:12:15,how would that be?
00:12:15,00:12:19,"In China, there's a big new fashion with swimming costumes,"
00:12:19,00:12:20,"and I'd not heard of this, and maybe you all have,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,but called the face keeny.
00:12:22,00:12:25,"So it's basically, they wear what effectively"
00:12:25,00:12:28,"is a nutcher Libre mask over their heads,"
00:12:28,00:12:32,"because they don't want sun tans, it's a big kind of no-no"
00:12:32,00:12:33,though to have a sun tan.
00:12:33,00:12:37,"So they wear these, yeah, these Mexican wrestling masks,"
00:12:37,00:12:38,and they go to the beach.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"So if you go to the beach in China,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,it's just packed with wrestlers.
00:12:41,00:12:44,(audience laughing)
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- If you wear one of those, can you go naked"
00:12:46,00:12:48,on the rest of your body?
00:12:48,00:12:50,"- 'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause no one knows who you are."
00:12:50,00:12:52,"- So this is the thing, a lot of people do it now,"
00:12:52,00:12:53,it's not about the tan anymore.
00:12:53,00:12:55,It's about an anonymous state at the beach.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"You can do whatever you want to hang out,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"and just go and do whatever you want,"
00:13:00,00:13:01,and no one will know who you are.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"- That's, they actually did that."
00:13:02,00:13:06,"Women used to wear masks in the 16th and 17th centuries,"
00:13:06,00:13:07,for exactly that reason.
00:13:07,00:13:09,"It was a fashion thing, so women of high society"
00:13:09,00:13:12,"would go around in masks, and they'd often wear them in bed,"
00:13:12,00:13:15,and that was to stop your skin being exposed too much
00:13:15,00:13:17,"to sunlight and to stop yourself getting a tan,"
00:13:17,00:13:18,'cause it was unfashionable.
00:13:18,00:13:19,- Wow.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"- Do you know, it was illegal to be topulous in America"
00:13:21,00:13:25,"in the early 20th century, and people were arrested for it?"
00:13:25,00:13:26,- It was a man or woman.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"- It was a man, sorry."
00:13:28,00:13:29,"I didn't, how sexist am I?"
00:13:29,00:13:33,"I just assumed by Tobias, I meant all men."
00:13:33,00:13:36,"Yeah, in 1935, 42 men were arrested for being topulous"
00:13:36,00:13:40,"in Atlantic City, and people who were arresting them said,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"""We will have no gorillas on our beaches."""
00:13:42,00:13:46,"And yeah, it was a thing, it was so very improper."
00:13:46,00:13:49,"- The man who invented the lava lamp was a nudist, wasn't he?"
00:13:49,00:13:50,- Yes.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"- Yeah, he used to make videos"
00:13:52,00:13:55,"of women swimming underwater naked,"
00:13:55,00:13:58,and then presumably went from there to lava lamp.
00:13:58,00:13:59,(audience laughing)
00:13:59,00:13:59,- Obviously.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- The logical joke, yeah."
00:14:01,00:14:03,(laughing)
00:14:03,00:14:05,- Do you know what's happened to bathing machines today?
00:14:05,00:14:07,Do you know what happened to them?
00:14:07,00:14:08,- No.
00:14:08,00:14:12,"- They are now, they were repurposed into those bathing hubs"
00:14:12,00:14:13,"that you get at the back of beaches,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,"so they just took the, they wheeled them back off the beach"
00:14:15,00:14:17,as it came as people thought actually it's more sensible
00:14:17,00:14:20,for us to wear us something costume.
00:14:20,00:14:21,"They wheeled them back to the back of the beach,"
00:14:21,00:14:24,"they took the wheels off, and now that's why they're fashionable"
00:14:24,00:14:26,because bathing machines were transformed into that.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- Oh, someone last year built a new bathing machine,"
00:14:28,00:14:29,incredibly exciting.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"This is the first one built for 100 years,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"is on the coast, somewhere, obviously."
00:14:33,00:14:36,(audience laughing)
00:14:36,00:14:42,"I think it was in Margate, and he raised about 30,000 pounds"
00:14:42,00:14:44,"on Kickstarter, and it's really cool."
00:14:44,00:14:47,It features one of the little special features
00:14:47,00:14:48,"that you used to get on bathing machines,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,"but it was a modesty hood,"
00:14:50,00:14:51,"which is this little canvas tent,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"and basically the end that's facing the sea,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,"you kind of lower this canvas hood,"
00:14:56,00:14:57,"almost all the way to the water,"
00:14:57,00:15:00,so that you can have even more privacy to get in.
00:15:00,00:15:04,"- That specific awning was invented by a guy called Benjamin Beale,"
00:15:04,00:15:08,and he's often given credit for inventing the entire concept
00:15:08,00:15:11,"of the beach house, the bathing house,"
00:15:11,00:15:12,"but all he did was the awning,"
00:15:12,00:15:13,and he just got all the credit.
00:15:13,00:15:14,- That is outrageous.
00:15:14,00:15:18,I'm so glad that you are rewriting everyone's assumptions
00:15:18,00:15:19,about this guy.
00:15:19,00:15:20,(audience laughing)
00:15:20,00:15:21,I'm glad we've rited that wrong.
00:15:21,00:15:24,(audience laughing)
00:15:24,00:15:25,- I know you're an asshole.
00:15:25,00:15:27,(audience laughing)
00:15:27,00:15:28,"- Come on, Benjamin Beale."
00:15:28,00:15:30,(audience laughing)
00:15:30,00:15:32,"- I was reading about, there's a,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"'cause obviously people love swimming,"
00:15:34,00:15:37,and there's a lot of beautiful places in the UK to go swimming.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"There's one absolute,"
00:15:38,00:15:39,"if you look at photos of this place,"
00:15:39,00:15:43,"absolutely beautiful, and it's called The Lagoon of Bucsden."
00:15:43,00:15:45,"Absolutely stunning, but it's really toxic."
00:15:45,00:15:49,"It's really dangerous, and so they're doing everything they can"
00:15:49,00:15:50,"to stop people from swimming in it,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"but because it looks so beautiful,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,people just ignore the signs and keep going in.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"So one sign that's up there, it says warning,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,"do not enter water, due to high pH levels."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"This can cause skin and eye rotation, stomach problems,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"fungal infections, such as thrush."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"It says that inside there are car wrecks,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,"dead animals, excrement, rubbed,"
00:16:08,00:16:11,and still people keep going in.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"They keep going into a swim, and they're getting quite ill."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"So what they've had to do in the end,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,"they've had to die the lagoon black,"
00:16:17,00:16:20,"so that people now go, oh, that looks disgusting."
00:16:20,00:16:22,So they've altered a beautiful place or a beautiful place.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"I wonder why, how beautiful it can be."
00:16:24,00:16:28,"Well, it's full of car wrecks and car experiments."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"Oh, look at that."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Beautiful, turd floating by."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"Ah, the serenity."
00:16:36,00:16:39,"There are swimming pools in New Zealand,"
00:16:39,00:16:43,which are being terrorised by mystery poors.
00:16:43,00:16:45,And this is in it.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"Terror, right."
00:16:47,00:16:48,This is terrorism in New Zealand.
00:16:48,00:16:50,"Yeah, there's a swimming pool."
00:16:50,00:16:52,"One is in a place called Middle March,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"but there are a couple who've experienced it,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,"and there were three feces incidents in a week,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,so they think it was deliberate.
00:16:58,00:17:01,There was one incident where this was in a invacargue
00:17:01,00:17:04,"splash palace pool, so avoid that."
00:17:04,00:17:05,Where there was a view.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"No, it sounds beautiful."
00:17:08,00:17:13,"No, James, I went and I got thrushed."
00:17:13,00:17:15,"Yeah, so this place is full of shit"
00:17:15,00:17:19,and Andy's vaginal infections.
00:17:19,00:17:26,"Well, it said there was a large amount of human waste"
00:17:26,00:17:28,"deposited into the deep end, so everyone was evacuated"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"and moved to the learner's pool,"
00:17:30,00:17:31,and then they were evacuated from that
00:17:31,00:17:37,when it was discovered that the learner's pool was also full of feces.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"All right, let's move on to our next fact."
00:17:39,00:17:44,"OK, it's time for fact number."
00:17:44,00:17:48,"It's time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski."
00:17:48,00:17:52,"Yes, my fact is that desperate Dan stopped eating cow pie"
00:17:52,00:17:55,because of mad cow disease.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"He gave up cow pie, which is his favorite food."
00:17:58,00:18:00,So that was really sad.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"Yeah, I think it was in 1996, and source is very,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"and I can't find the original comic strips,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,but I think he started eating aunt Aggie's vegetable
00:18:08,00:18:11,and fish options as a replacement.
00:18:11,00:18:15,"The cow pie's E.A., so the thing with mad cow disease or C.J.D."
00:18:15,00:18:19,"is that the danger was eating strange bits of a cow, wasn't it?"
00:18:19,00:18:22,"And desperate Dan did used to eat the whole cow,"
00:18:22,00:18:25,because they had the horn sticking out and the tail sticking out.
00:18:25,00:18:28,"So I would say if anyone was in danger of contracting it,"
00:18:28,00:18:29,it was probably him.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"We should say, for listeners overseas and things like that,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,"who desperate Dan is, just in case people get noticed."
00:18:34,00:18:37,"So Britain's two biggest comics, ever,"
00:18:37,00:18:41,"called the Bino and the Dandy, and the Dandy star,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"the cover star, desperate Dan, who was a cowboy,"
00:18:43,00:18:47,"and he was this huge guy, and it did amazing things."
00:18:47,00:18:50,"He had to shave with a blowtorch, because he was so tough."
00:18:50,00:18:54,And he parted his hair by firing a pistol through it.
00:18:54,00:18:57,And it's just one of this amazing tradition
00:18:57,00:19:00,"of really, really great comics and really imaginative things."
00:19:00,00:19:03,"I read these when I was a boy, and that's very good."
00:19:03,00:19:06,He used to smoke through a drain pipe.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"He used to use a drain pipe as a cigarette or a pipe, I think, didn't he?"
00:19:08,00:19:10,"And it was a dustbin full of rubbish at the end of it,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,which I think he lit and smokes.
00:19:12,00:19:13,He was pretty hardcore.
00:19:13,00:19:14,He was.
00:19:14,00:19:17,He had a gun.
00:19:17,00:19:19,He had to give that up as well in the '90s or the '80s
00:19:19,00:19:20,for political correctness.
00:19:20,00:19:21,Gone mad.
00:19:21,00:19:23,So I don't know how he parted his hair after that.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Maybe he went for--
00:19:24,00:19:26,I think he had a water pistol after that.
00:19:26,00:19:27,"OK, yeah, that's intense."
00:19:27,00:19:29,He sounds a lot better than the guy who
00:19:29,00:19:33,was in the first episode of the Bino called Hairy Dan.
00:19:33,00:19:36,And Hairy Dan was an old man whose long white beard usually
00:19:36,00:19:40,saved the day.
00:19:40,00:19:45,"And in the first episode, he used his beard as a sail to win a boat race."
00:19:45,00:19:47,And you could rescue children from down wells?
00:19:47,00:19:48,I'm sure he did.
00:19:48,00:19:53,I think I can see why Dennis the Menace took his top spot after a short while.
00:19:53,00:19:55,"Those are amazing factors, and they're about Dennis the Menace,"
00:19:55,00:19:58,which is that they-- so there were two Dennis the Menace's.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"One is an American version, and then one is the British version."
00:20:01,00:20:03,"And they were both created in the same year,"
00:20:03,00:20:04,independent of each other.
00:20:04,00:20:06,They had no idea that they were being published.
00:20:06,00:20:08,They both had the red and black costume.
00:20:08,00:20:09,They both were called Dennis the Menace.
00:20:09,00:20:11,I think it might have even been in the same week.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"I think it was the same week, really, really."
00:20:14,00:20:16,And it's often used by people trying
00:20:16,00:20:18,to explain coincidences and why they're not surprising
00:20:18,00:20:21,"that you, in a world where infinite things can happen,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,you expect the old coincidences.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"So actually, when we discovered that, we should have gone,"
00:20:25,00:20:27,"well, yeah, obviously, mad things will happen."
00:20:27,00:20:28,Yes.
00:20:28,00:20:28,And just move on.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"It's not amazing at all, in fact."
00:20:30,00:20:34,The other argument about that is that ideas have a time.
00:20:34,00:20:37,So maybe there was some other children with spike hair
00:20:37,00:20:39,"in some other cartoon, and other people with red and black,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,and other people called Dennis.
00:20:41,00:20:44,"And the same thing came with calculus, when Liebnitz,"
00:20:44,00:20:48,and Newton all came up with it at the same time.
00:20:48,00:20:49,It almost did exactly the same time.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"And it's like, well, was it a weird coincidence?"
00:20:52,00:20:54,Or was it just the time for that areas to come up?
00:20:54,00:20:55,Yeah.
00:20:55,00:20:57,Dennis the Menace's dad now has spike hair.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"In fact, the Bino did an extremely exciting reveal"
00:21:00,00:21:03,"a few years ago, which was that they showed"
00:21:03,00:21:06,"on one of the bits of comic strip, a photograph"
00:21:06,00:21:07,of Dennis the Menace from the '80s.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"And they had Dennis' dad saying, look, that's a picture of me."
00:21:10,00:21:13,So it transpires that Dennis the Menace is actually now.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Dennis is dad.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"Oh, I don't know when the switch happens."
00:21:16,00:21:19,"Wait, they used a photo of Dennis the Menace from the '80s."
00:21:19,00:21:21,Dennis's dad said that used to be me.
00:21:21,00:21:26,"Yeah, there's no plotline where Dennis grows up in the '90s,"
00:21:26,00:21:29,and that's just father's son.
00:21:29,00:21:33,"That's like, that is stupid."
00:21:33,00:21:35,I'm so angry here.
00:21:35,00:21:43,"Anyway, he's changed his hairstyle, Dennis the Menace's dad,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,so they've tried to upgrade the Bino to make it more realistic.
00:21:45,00:21:47,And the case is now that we live in a happier time
00:21:47,00:21:48,where parents don't all abuse their children
00:21:48,00:21:50,and kids don't all hate their parents.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"And so Dennis's dad is now, yeah, spiky hair,"
00:21:53,00:21:54,and he's a bit cool and groovy.
00:21:54,00:21:57,"He's a little bit like, I used to be a rebel too."
00:21:57,00:21:58,Yeah.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Is there an authority figure who's still the enemy, though?"
00:22:01,00:22:02,Because that was always the thing.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"It was always Anarchy, you know, the Batch Street kids,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"or the like, ""Teach was the enemy."""
00:22:06,00:22:08,"I think the teachers are still quite bad, but..."
00:22:08,00:22:11,This is called the guy who draws the Batch Street kids.
00:22:11,00:22:13,This is a niche fact now for people who are at the beach.
00:22:13,00:22:15,He's called David Sutherland.
00:22:15,00:22:20,And here's drawn that comic strip since 1962.
00:22:20,00:22:21,Wow.
00:22:21,00:22:22,53 years.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"He's drawn over 2,000 of them."
00:22:24,00:22:26,"Well, here's a weird one as well."
00:22:26,00:22:29,Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.
00:22:29,00:22:31,So the lead singer of the Pet Shop Boys
00:22:31,00:22:36,"between 1975 and 1977, he worked as an editor for Marvel UK."
00:22:36,00:22:40,So his job was to anglicise all the things
00:22:40,00:22:42,that were Americanized in the original comic.
00:22:42,00:22:46,"And his main job was to look at all the points of, say,"
00:22:46,00:22:49,"like, cleavage or two short skirts, pointed out,"
00:22:49,00:22:51,"and then they had to draw over the cleavage and readdress it,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,because we had different indecency laws over here.
00:22:54,00:22:55,Really?
00:22:55,00:22:56,"So the poor Pet Shop Boys, he was stopping cleavage"
00:22:56,00:23:00,from getting into the comic books of...
00:23:00,00:23:02,There was a big thing in America in the...
00:23:02,00:23:03,Where was it?
00:23:03,00:23:07,"It was in the '50s, '50s and '60s, where they had a censorship of comics."
00:23:07,00:23:09,"They might have even banned it, banned them for a while,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,but they definitely censored them.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"And there was a guy called Frederick Wurton,"
00:23:13,00:23:15,"who wrote a pamphlet called ""Ceduction of the Innocents"""
00:23:15,00:23:17,where he complained about all these comics
00:23:17,00:23:19,and what they were doing to children.
00:23:19,00:23:22,And he said that Batman and Robin were obviously homosexual.
00:23:22,00:23:26,And Porkey Pig was an open invitation to Buggery.
00:23:26,00:23:31,LAUGHTER
00:23:31,00:23:37,"Now, I have never got that from the cartoons."
00:23:37,00:23:38,What was this man's name?
00:23:38,00:23:40,He was called Frederick Wurton.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"And he was as my contestant, so he should know, actually."
00:23:43,00:23:47,"OK, well, I think there might have been a little bit more going on in the Wurton brain."
00:23:47,00:23:50,"Just on that subject, though, with Porkey Pig,"
00:23:50,00:23:54,"there's a very big porn website in America called ""PornHub"""
00:23:54,00:23:59,and they recently looked into the analytics of the most search for words.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"Within people go on, they put in a word like ""Milf"""
00:24:02,00:24:05,"was a massive one in a lot of American states, stuff like that."
00:24:05,00:24:08,"They found that in Nebraska, Arkansas, and Tennessee,"
00:24:08,00:24:12,"the number one search term was ""Cartoon""."
00:24:12,00:24:15,"Another fact, in South London, it was lollimold."
00:24:15,00:24:22,LAUGHTER
00:24:22,00:24:25,What were on this?
00:24:25,00:24:28,LAUGHTER
00:24:28,00:24:32,I read a list of characters in the Bino.
00:24:32,00:24:33,OK.
00:24:33,00:24:42,"And they included ""Little Dead Eye Dick"", ""Deep Down Daddy Neptune"","
00:24:42,00:24:48,"""Cocky Dick"", ""Wondering Willie"", ""Sticky Willie"","
00:24:48,00:24:54,"and ""Polly Wodley Doodle"" and ""Her Great Big Poodle""."
00:24:54,00:24:59,So every single one of those is an invitation to Bugery.
00:24:59,00:25:01,If Frederick had been around.
00:25:01,00:25:04,Open. Not a private invitation to Bugery.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"It's on the billboard, it's at your turn."
00:25:05,00:25:09,"On Facebook, it is, this is an open event."
00:25:09,00:25:12,Do you guys know what the world's first comic strip is?
00:25:12,00:25:16,Bio-tapestry.
00:25:16,00:25:19,That's very funny.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"A lot of good comedy in there, if you want to see it."
00:25:21,00:25:22,"No, I think so."
00:25:22,00:25:26,"I think Rusty and me, a comic strip is a series of cartoons"
00:25:26,00:25:28,that are sent out to people's homes.
00:25:28,00:25:29,So the beer tapestry was just in one place.
00:25:29,00:25:31,You didn't receive it through the letterbox.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"So, which have speech bubbles and people talking."
00:25:34,00:25:37,And the first one was made in Glasgow.
00:25:37,00:25:41,And it was the Glasgow-- well done.
00:25:41,00:25:42,It was the Glasgow-looking glass.
00:25:42,00:25:46,"And it was in the-- in 1825, it had its first issue."
00:25:46,00:25:49,"And the first comic strip in it was called ""The History of the Coat."""
00:25:49,00:25:50,And it was--
00:25:50,00:25:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:52,00:25:56,It was the adventures of a coat going from one owner to the next.
00:25:56,00:25:57,That's a pretty good one.
00:25:57,00:25:58,That's really cool.
00:25:58,00:25:59,"Kind of cool, yeah."
00:25:59,00:26:01,"And also, it had a lot of heart-hitting sati."
00:26:01,00:26:04,It had a lot of bitching about the English in it.
00:26:04,00:26:08,Even though it was set up by a English guy who'd had to flee London
00:26:08,00:26:09,because he was in so much debt.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"So he went to Scotland and was obviously like, OK, cool."
00:26:11,00:26:13,I like these guys.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"He made a comic strip, which partly bitched about the English."
00:26:16,00:26:19,And then he racked up so much gambling and drinking debts in Scotland
00:26:19,00:26:21,that he had to flee again back to England.
00:26:21,00:26:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:22,00:26:24,And so it stopped.
00:26:24,00:26:26,Do you know who invented the speech bubble?
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Oh, controversial."
00:26:28,00:26:29,I've got a theory.
00:26:29,00:26:30,What's yours?
00:26:30,00:26:33,My theory is that it's 650 BC.
00:26:33,00:26:37,"And it was the Meso-Americans, early central American people."
00:26:37,00:26:39,Are they of super fame?
00:26:39,00:26:39,Or is that--
00:26:39,00:26:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:44,00:26:48,Have I pronounced that right just in case we get letters?
00:26:48,00:26:50,It doesn't mess up.
00:26:50,00:26:50,All right.
00:26:50,00:26:53,"I don't think any of them are going to write to you now, Andy."
00:26:53,00:26:55,But they have little speech bubble.
00:26:55,00:26:56,They have drawings of people.
00:26:56,00:26:58,And they have these tiny little sort of arrows
00:26:58,00:27:00,"showing that, like, to a dagger drawing."
00:27:00,00:27:04,And it shows that people are slacking each other off in the drawings.
00:27:04,00:27:04,Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:07,And that is a speech bubble that's sort of signifying abuse.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"And do you agree with that, Anna?"
00:27:09,00:27:11,"I do agree with that, probably, yes."
00:27:11,00:27:12,"You know, super-ted."
00:27:12,00:27:17,"You know that his first language is not, in fact, English."
00:27:17,00:27:19,It's Welsh.
00:27:19,00:27:20,"Yeah, really."
00:27:20,00:27:21,Super-ted's first language as well.
00:27:21,00:27:22,So it's a Welsh cartoon.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"And when it first went out, it was in Welsh."
00:27:24,00:27:27,And they just dubbed it into English.
00:27:27,00:27:30,We should move on soon.
00:27:30,00:27:32,Have you guys got anything else before we do?
00:27:32,00:27:35,"I quite liked the quote from you and Kerr,"
00:27:35,00:27:36,who was a--
00:27:36,00:27:37,I can't talk about it.
00:27:37,00:27:40,You won Kerr.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"Poor you, Anna."
00:27:42,00:27:45,[APPLAUSE]
00:27:45,00:27:47,How did I not see that?
00:27:47,00:27:49,I'm not really doing my job properly.
00:27:49,00:27:51,I wrote down the name You and Kerr.
00:27:51,00:27:53,I did the notice.
00:27:53,00:27:54,I'm so embarrassed.
00:27:54,00:27:59,"Yeah, so Youwanker is a top guy at DC."
00:27:59,00:28:00,"Thompson, which makes the vino and the dandy."
00:28:00,00:28:03,And he was-- there's an interview with him
00:28:03,00:28:06,semi-bemoning how they've had to go a bit politically correct.
00:28:06,00:28:10,"So corporal punishment, smoking, and racial stereotypes"
00:28:10,00:28:12,are now taboo.
00:28:12,00:28:13,It does limit us in a way.
00:28:13,00:28:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:16,00:28:19,But we get to be slightly ruder than in the old days.
00:28:19,00:28:21,A bit more bodily functions instead.
00:28:21,00:28:24,We know that's what the kids laugh at now.
00:28:24,00:28:27,"Those stupid kids, not laughing at the racial stereotypes anymore."
00:28:27,00:28:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:30,00:28:33,Let's move on to our final fact of the night.
00:28:33,00:28:35,And that is James Harkin.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"OK, my fact this week is that the oldest sperm is worm sperm."
00:28:39,00:28:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:42,00:28:46,Mostly because I just like the cadence of it.
00:28:46,00:28:49,But we found some 50 million-year-old sperm cells.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"No, ask them what we ask."
00:28:51,00:28:53,You leave us out of it.
00:28:53,00:28:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:57,00:28:58,I was swimming in bookstore.
00:28:58,00:29:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:04,00:29:06,We have 50 million-year-old sperm cells.
00:29:06,00:29:10,And they have been found in an Antarctic worm.
00:29:10,00:29:12,And they were in a fossilized cocoon.
00:29:12,00:29:16,"Because normally sperm cells are so small and delicate,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,"they normally die, and they don't get fossilized."
00:29:18,00:29:19,But these ones did get fossilized.
00:29:19,00:29:20,And they're the oldest ones that we have.
00:29:20,00:29:22,And they're from worms.
00:29:22,00:29:23,50 million years.
00:29:23,00:29:25,Did you know that sperm had evolved at that point?
00:29:25,00:29:28,Or is this the first proof we've had that it did evolve there?
00:29:28,00:29:30,"I don't know about that, actually."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"But yeah, I suppose there was no evidence"
00:29:32,00:29:34,that they'd evolved at that stage.
00:29:34,00:29:35,It kind of been.
00:29:35,00:29:36,Does it still function?
00:29:36,00:29:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:39,00:29:44,"There is a sperm that's worked after 23 years, I think."
00:29:44,00:29:46,So the world's oldest baby is 23 years old.
00:29:46,00:29:49,This is an Australian guy who got quite ill.
00:29:49,00:29:52,"And he was, I think, 15 years old at the time."
00:29:52,00:29:55,And he decided to save his sperm before he was going
00:29:55,00:29:57,to have some kind of operation.
00:29:57,00:29:58,He survived his problem.
00:29:58,00:30:00,He grew old.
00:30:00,00:30:00,He got married.
00:30:00,00:30:04,And then I think the operation that he needed at the point
00:30:04,00:30:06,meant that he could no longer produce sperm.
00:30:06,00:30:09,So he had this sitting there from all those years ago.
00:30:09,00:30:11,"And they used that, and it worked."
00:30:11,00:30:14,And so he has a kid from his sperm from when he was 15.
00:30:14,00:30:15,It was like frozen in a lab.
00:30:15,00:30:17,It wasn't just sitting there.
00:30:17,00:30:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Because you have to freeze it properly, don't you?"
00:30:20,00:30:22,You have to freeze it at a really low temperature.
00:30:22,00:30:24,Freeze the temperature will not do.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Yes.
00:30:25,00:30:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:26,00:30:28,"That's a man who spends a lot of his time, apparently."
00:30:28,00:30:31,"They're refrigerated, yeah."
00:30:31,00:30:33,Thinking-- I'm now thinking that lollimold sounds
00:30:33,00:30:35,like a disease.
00:30:35,00:30:39,"It's the touch of lollimold, anyway."
00:30:39,00:30:42,And there are sperm smugglers as well who are freezing sperm.
00:30:42,00:30:46,Smuggling-- smuggling is happening in--
00:30:46,00:30:48,not spuggling.
00:30:48,00:30:49,That's what they should call it.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"Is they should call it spuggling or something, yeah?"
00:30:53,00:30:55,So what's with people smuggling sperm?
00:30:55,00:30:56,Yeah.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Boltzperman.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Boltzperman.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"No, this is in prisons."
00:31:00,00:31:03,So people who are in prison who aren't allowed
00:31:03,00:31:07,to have contact with their wives are smuggling sperm.
00:31:07,00:31:13,So there's a baby who was born to Regina Granato in America
00:31:13,00:31:18,"in 1999, even though her husband had been in prison since 1987."
00:31:18,00:31:21,He was a gang leader gangster.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"And yeah, this baby was born because she'd"
00:31:23,00:31:26,smuggled in a cryogenic sperm freezing kit and given it to him
00:31:26,00:31:28,and then he'd spermed into it.
00:31:28,00:31:29,And then she'd give it up.
00:31:29,00:31:30,She'd spermed into it.
00:31:30,00:31:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:34,00:31:37,"Yeah, that's the verb, that's the verb."
00:31:37,00:31:40,That's what you do.
00:31:40,00:31:41,But she smuggled it in because they're not allowed
00:31:41,00:31:42,to touch each other.
00:31:42,00:31:44,So she smuggled in the kit.
00:31:44,00:31:48,The only people who the prisoners are allowed to touch in--
00:31:48,00:31:50,I think it's in Pennsylvania--
00:31:50,00:31:51,people under the age of eight who are allowed
00:31:51,00:31:53,to give their parents a hug.
00:31:53,00:31:55,So she brought her husband's nephew in
00:31:55,00:31:58,and gave him the cryogenic sperm freezing kit
00:31:58,00:32:02,so that he could hug his uncle and his uncle could slip the kit
00:32:02,00:32:03,out from his coat pocket.
00:32:03,00:32:07,I was Googling worm and sperm.
00:32:07,00:32:11,"There's a lot of amazing things, but they're so disgusting."
00:32:11,00:32:14,This is a really hard topic to talk about because--
00:32:14,00:32:17,"OK, so for example, there's a type of worm, a female worm,"
00:32:17,00:32:21,that when after she's been spermed into--
00:32:21,00:32:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:25,00:32:29,--she can then decide that she doesn't like the sperm.
00:32:29,00:32:34,So then she puts her face into it and sucks out the sperm
00:32:34,00:32:35,and just spits it away.
00:32:35,00:32:36,So--
00:32:36,00:32:37,Wow.
00:32:37,00:32:37,Yeah.
00:32:37,00:32:38,Is there a kind of worm?
00:32:38,00:32:39,This is a kind of worm.
00:32:39,00:32:39,Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:40,So this worm does it.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"It just goes, no, I'm not having that."
00:32:42,00:32:44,"And goes in, takes, sucks it out."
00:32:44,00:32:47,And so it's got to the point where the sperm--
00:32:47,00:32:50,I think has evolved now to be a bit savvy to it.
00:32:50,00:32:53,So it has this little clinging stuff inside.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"So actually, it's like you need to properly suck."
00:32:55,00:32:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:56,00:32:57,Because it's hanging on.
00:32:57,00:32:59,Because that's amazing.
00:32:59,00:32:59,Yeah.
00:32:59,00:33:03,It's like an arms race between the two sexes in the species.
00:33:03,00:33:04,Yeah.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"Yeah, because the scaly cricket--"
00:33:05,00:33:09,I think the male scaly cricket has to copulate constantly.
00:33:09,00:33:12,It can copulate more than 50 times in three hours or something.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"Because the female scaly cricket, for some evolutionary reason,"
00:33:15,00:33:18,"that's beyond us, her response when he does copulate into her"
00:33:18,00:33:20,is to take it out immediate and eat the sperm.
00:33:20,00:33:23,So it's very rare he's slipped on through.
00:33:23,00:33:25,She thinks he'll be feeding her.
00:33:25,00:33:26,Wow.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Yeah.
00:33:27,00:33:30,"I found a flatworm and buckle up, guys."
00:33:30,00:33:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:33,00:33:36,"It's called macrostomum hysterics, right?"
00:33:36,00:33:40,"And if it is lonely, and if it can't find a mate,"
00:33:40,00:33:41,they're all hemaphrodites.
00:33:41,00:33:44,So they have both kinds of genitalia.
00:33:44,00:33:45,"If it's lonely, it can stab itself"
00:33:45,00:33:48,in the head with the sperm-filled hypodermic needle
00:33:48,00:33:50,to inseminate itself.
00:33:50,00:33:53,We've never seen it doing it.
00:33:53,00:33:56,"But scientists left certain worms on their own,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,"and they then came back later and they found,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"oh, they've got a lot of sperm in their head."
00:34:01,00:34:03,But how did it get there?
00:34:03,00:34:06,And these worms had injected themselves
00:34:06,00:34:09,because they can fertilize themselves
00:34:09,00:34:13,using both bits of genitalia.
00:34:13,00:34:16,"And yeah, and they hatched, and they had hatchlings."
00:34:16,00:34:17,"They call that ""selfing."""
00:34:17,00:34:18,Do they?
00:34:18,00:34:19,Yeah.
00:34:19,00:34:20,Do they have selfing sticks?
00:34:20,00:34:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:23,00:34:32,There is a ground louse that reproduces
00:34:32,00:34:38,by slapping one giant sperm onto a female's back.
00:34:38,00:34:50,"And its Latin name is ""Zorotipus impoliteus."""
00:34:50,00:34:53,"You know, larger animals tend to have smaller sperm."
00:34:53,00:34:55,That's the way I think the study was done
00:34:55,00:34:57,on this really recently to try and work out why.
00:34:57,00:34:57,And it's quite interesting.
00:34:57,00:35:00,"So fruit fly sperm is the largest sperm in nature,"
00:35:00,00:35:01,I think.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Elephant sperm are very small.
00:35:02,00:35:06,"So I think a fruit fly sperm is about 1,000 times bigger"
00:35:06,00:35:07,than an elephant sperm off the top of my head.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Something like that.
00:35:08,00:35:12,"And it's because, if you're a big animal,"
00:35:12,00:35:15,then the sperm have further to swim.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"And so in order for them to have a chance to succeed,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,you've got to produce more of them
00:35:19,00:35:20,to make it more likely that one of them
00:35:20,00:35:21,is going to finally get to the egg.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"And if you produce more of them,"
00:35:22,00:35:25,it takes up more energy so you can't make them as big.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Whereas if you're a little fruit fly,"
00:35:26,00:35:27,"it's like the sperm, it's easy."
00:35:27,00:35:29,It's about about a centimeter to go.
00:35:29,00:35:32,And so you can produce a few giant sperm.
00:35:32,00:35:39,"No one, people who are more attractive men wise, have worse sperm."
00:35:39,00:35:41,So men who are attractive to women
00:35:41,00:35:43,tend to be men with deeper voices
00:35:43,00:35:45,"who are a bit more manly, who evolution has told us"
00:35:45,00:35:48,we should be attracted to because they've got more testosterone.
00:35:48,00:35:49,"But actually, it's a trade-off."
00:35:49,00:35:51,So if you fed all your testosterone
00:35:51,00:35:53,to building yourself ridiculously large biceps
00:35:53,00:35:58,"or penis or whatever, then you have less wealthy sperm."
00:35:58,00:35:59,Have you seen that room in the gym?
00:35:59,00:36:03,LAUGHTER
00:36:03,00:36:05,I assume that's what they were doing.
00:36:05,00:36:08,LAUGHTER
00:36:08,00:36:10,"So yeah, keep going."
00:36:10,00:36:13,"That's it, so there's too much testosterone going"
00:36:13,00:36:15,to making lifting weights with your penis or whatever.
00:36:15,00:36:16,So it's...
00:36:16,00:36:18,You don't have enough leftos to make healthier sperm.
00:36:18,00:36:19,I find that really surprising.
00:36:19,00:36:23,"I can't believe that testosterone is spent on attractiveness,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,in that sense.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"Well, I suppose if you're spending on attractiveness,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,then you're going to attract more mates.
00:36:28,00:36:30,And so there's a higher likelihood
00:36:30,00:36:31,that you'll be able to fertilise one of them.
00:36:31,00:36:34,"So it's almost like, ""Okay, well, never mind"
00:36:34,00:36:36,"""the less attractive people will give you some better sperm instead,"
00:36:36,00:36:40,"""so that the one mate you finally do manage just as you use."
00:36:40,00:36:42,"""You've got a higher chance."""
00:36:42,00:36:44,You leave my wife out of this.
00:36:44,00:36:47,LAUGHTER
00:36:47,00:36:52,"Well, goodness, why haven't we learnt to lie to you?"
00:36:52,00:36:56,LAUGHTER
