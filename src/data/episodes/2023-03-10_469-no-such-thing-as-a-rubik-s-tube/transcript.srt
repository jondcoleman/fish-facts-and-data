00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,040
 Hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish we have another very special guest for you today and

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,760
 That guest is our very good friend Lucy Porter. You will remember Lucy from previous episodes on fish

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,760
 I know you'll love her. She's so smart. She's so funny

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,200
 In fact, she's got a stand-up show that is touring at this very moment

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,920
 Which is called wake up call and really I'll be honest the best way to find out about that is to Google

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,500
 Lucy Porter wake up call and you'll find all the dates, but she's doing the whole of the UK

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,300
 It's definitely a show that's worth going to see. She also has a podcast called fingers on buzzers

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,280
 It's all about quizzing and she does that with my very good old friend Jenny Ryan

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,440
 It's a brilliant podcast so listen to that and she has a radio for stand-up special called Lucy Porter's lucky dip

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,720
 Which is going out at 11 30 on March the 15th

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,980
 It'll probably be on the BBC sounds app after that so again Google Lucy Potter's lucky dip and you'll find that and apart from that

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,880
 Just enjoy the show so nothing more to say apart from on with the podcast on with the show. Oh hi Andy. I've been here the whole time

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:29,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin and Lucy Porter

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,940
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here

16
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,920
 We go starting with fact number one and that is my fact

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,720
 My fact this week is that it took the creator of the Rubik's Cube a month to solve it the first time he tried

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:02,120
 It's so crazy you I would have thought after about 20 or 30 days you would just make a new one

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:10,480
 So yeah invented 1974 he was a professor and he just had this idea

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,640
 What if I could make something that was static on the inside but fluid on the outside and that's what gave him the idea and

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,220
 He had a bash it it's later been worked out quite a famous number if you know Rubik's cubes that 43

22
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,080
 Quintillion is the number of permutations that you can make on the Rubik's Cube

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,760
 And so luckily he got there within a month. Yeah, it's pretty good. Well, I'll tell you what's weird. His prototype

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,960
 Wasn't three by three. His prototype was two by two. So I've got that took him a month

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,040
 That's the thing. Well, I'm curious to know if this is the one that took him a month because this is okay

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,600
 So Dan's showing us an image and it's like four wooden blocks

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,720
 That I've got various colors and numbers on it and they're held together almost by bits of wire

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,320
 Yeah, there's a wire meshing inside and he took a month to do a Rubik's Cube

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,120
 Yeah, that one's piss easy. Yeah, it's clever enough to make that you're clever enough to solve it. Yes

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440
 You can do a Rubik's Cube, James. I can I think you can Lucy

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
 Well, I am yeah, my children obsessed with them

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,240
 We've got hundreds in the house and all those weird one, you know

33
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,360
 There's like weird different shaped ones and mirror ones where there's absolutely, you know

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,800
 Colors on it and stuff. So this is a long way of me saying I should be

35
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 And I have at one point

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 That one's tough because it's got like Dan's mixing up one from the Transport Museum

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
 I'd rather do the one with the colors

38
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,520
 But the other thing is about the Rubik's Cube is that I find that when you're under pressure

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,600
 It's almost impossible. Yes, because you do it kind of with muscle memory

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,400
 Yes, and then as soon as you start thinking about it, you can't really do it at all

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,960
 Yeah

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,040
 I made a terrible decision when because I did learn to do it when my kids got into it and then I

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,560
 Decided we were doing a live podcast recording of fingers on buzzers and I said, oh, I tell you what'll be fun

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,320
 I'll solve a Rubik's Cube while we do this round, and it took about 15 minutes

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 Is there an algorithm basically? It's like a set pattern of moves that will help you work on the side you're working on

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
 So layers, that's the key

47
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
 Yeah, exactly so

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
 It's layers not sides, so you can see at the moment that I've done the bottom layer

49
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
 Right

50
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
 Or the top layer

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
 And then you do the middle one, then you do the top one

52
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 Remember when we went on only connect and they asked you for facts about yourself

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,320
 And my fact was that I could do a Rubik's Cube in less than a minute

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 And the team that we were playing with apparently one of them said that he could do three Rubik's Cubes in 30 seconds

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
 They decided they weren't going to use that fact

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 Made you look pretty foolish

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 But it's huge, the speed cubing because we had to get a timer so that we could record my kids' times

58
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,320
 And also my kids said "Oh, can we have some Cubelube?"

59
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,320
 And that's the moment that I was like "I'm sorry"

60
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
 As a mother you've got to worry

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 Couldn't we have some Cubelube?

62
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,320
 Is there a brand? Is it a specifically sold lube?

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,320
 There is one of the best Cubelube, we didn't get good Cubelube

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
 It's called Cubelube

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
 Yeah, we got dodgy Cubelube

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
 And it's allowed as well, it's allowed in competition

67
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,320
 It's legit, it's like chalk on your hands if you're an athlete

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
 Yes

69
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,320
 Well there's just a piece about the, you know, there are so many cubes, the world, there we go

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 But listen, the change has just completed the rubies

71
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
 That's why I've been silent for the last three minutes

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
 But by the time I've edited this it'll be about twenty seconds

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:34,320
 And it just listed the GAN 356 iCarry, the MoU RS3M Maglev, the GAN 11M Pro

74
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,320
 And it's all, there's kind of FIFA of cubing

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 The World Cube Association

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
 Are they corrupt?

77
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,320
 They're hugely corrupt, millions and millions of dollars change hands

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 So 1981, the top selling book in America was a book that was called The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube

79
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,320
 It sold six million copies and it was the number one book of the year

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 It was massive, a guy called James G. Norris, he was a professor

81
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
 He did it as a pamphlet for his university and then someone saw it

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
 Said can you expand that into a like sixty four page book

83
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,320
 So it wasn't that big, it was double the expansion of the pamphlet

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 And so he published it and in it he gives categories of what you're labeled as as a cuber if you manage to do it in certain times

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 So this is 1981, twenty minutes, if you did it in that time you were a whiz

86
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
 Ten minutes, you were a speed demon

87
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 Five minutes, you were an expert

88
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
 And three minutes, you were an emcee, the master of the cube

89
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
 Oh that's what I am then, I can tell you

90
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
 Yeah, you're a master of the cube

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
 Well in the 80s you were a famous person

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 It's actually been updated since 2013

93
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 You're now adult

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 Yeah, unfortunately

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
 Well you James, if you take longer than sixty seconds

96
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
 I do, I take probably about a minute and a half first

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,320
 Okay, I'm afraid you don't even qualify as a whiz at this point

98
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 Whereas a whiz was twenty minutes it's now sixty seconds

99
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 Speed demon has gone from ten minutes to forty seconds

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
 Oh my god

101
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 An expert has gone from five minutes to fifteen to twenty five seconds

102
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 And the master of the cube which is now called world champion

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
 From three minutes to three to five seconds

104
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
 That's amazing the difference isn't it

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 I can't even pick it up within three seconds

106
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
 My old arthritic fingers

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
 Because I remember the original crates in the 80s

108
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
 I'm old enough for that

109
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 But it was one of those things that boys would learn to do

110
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
 And this is a terrible sexist generalisation

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,320
 But it did tend to be boys would learn to do it thinking it would really impress the girls

112
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,320
 And all girls just went meh

113
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
 I found that I've never ever pressed a girl with a Rubik's cube

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
 I impressed the QI's accountant once

115
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
 With a few Rubik's cube tricks

116
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
 But he wasn't my type

117
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
 I did because I brought mine in today

118
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 So I did sit on the tube doing it

119
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,320
 And people don't look at you with admiration

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 I'll be honest

121
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
 Really?

122
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
 It's pity

123
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
 No honey, honey, we'll just have to get up at the next stop

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,320
 Is she gonna do it?

125
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
 The craze just is unbelievable

126
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 The 80s craze

127
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 So it was the UK toy of the year in 1980

128
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
 And then again in 1981

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
 As if they just thought

130
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
 We're gonna give it to the cube again

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
 So Dan, you were mentioning the books that sold out very well

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 So at one point in 1982

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
 I think it was four or five different books on the New York Times bestsellers list

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
 For Rubik's cube books

135
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,320
 There was a boy called Patrick Bossert

136
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
 Who was 13 years old

137
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 And wrote a book called You Can Do the Cube

138
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
 And sold nearly a million copies of it

139
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,320
 He was the youngest ever author on the New York Times bestseller list

140
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 It kind of came from nowhere, right?

141
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
 Like Dan says, it was invented in 1974

142
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
 And this was 1980

143
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
 In 1981 it was absolutely huge

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 I looked on the newspaper archives

145
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
 And the first mention of it

146
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 It doesn't even call it the Rubik's cube

147
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
 It calls it the Hungarian magic cube

148
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 This was in 1979

149
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
 This was in The Observer

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,320
 And they said that at first most people tried to take the cube apart

151
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 But that is not the object

152
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 And it said if you even get one face done

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 Of the cube in 20 minutes

154
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
 Then you've done well

155
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
 And it says, but there are several people

156
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 Brackets, well at least three

157
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 That are able to solve the cube in less than five minutes

158
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 Dan, you mentioned that there are 43 quintillion different states

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
 That you can have

160
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,320
 The newspaper said, and this was in 1979

161
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 At one per microsecond

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
 A computer would take around 3,000 million years

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
 Just to count up the number of states

164
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
 And in 2022

165
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,320
 We got the first ever quintillion per second computer

166
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 So today a computer could reach it in just under a minute

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 I think what's extraordinary

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
 The numbers are so bamboozlingly big

169
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,320
 I remember reading an interview with Erno Rubik

170
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,320
 Where he was talking about the fact that he'd invented

171
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 More kinds of Rubik's cubes now

172
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
 There was a Snake Rubik's cube that he'd invented

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
 Did you buy that Lucy?

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
 I did have it

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 Rubik's snake, which sounds a bit dodgy now

176
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
 Why did they call it the Snake and not the Rubik's tube?

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
 Sorry, very nice

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 But he said that and this one has potentially even more permutations

179
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
 And the guy writing the article just went

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
 "Yeah, once you've hit 43 quintillion, I'm not impressed anymore"

181
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
 But what's interesting, so very randomly

182
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 Day before yesterday I bumped into

183
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
 A Rubik's cube Guinness world record holder

184
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
 He's a guy called George

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
 He holds two records, one which he's just done

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
 Which I'm not allowed to reveal

187
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 I know, of course that

188
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,320
 Rubik's cube Goss, I'll tell you guys after the show

189
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
 The other one is that he has the most Rubik's cubes

190
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 Solved while riding on a skateboard

191
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 For, I think, like an hour or something

192
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
 He did like 500 of them just going around a skate park

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 Quick question, Dan

194
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 Did he have on him a bag of 500 Rubik's cubes

195
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 Which he then had to get out of the skateboard?

196
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

197
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
 It wasn't like Santa, yeah

198
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 What he was was he had people stationed around the skate park

199
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 So he'd hand the solved one to the person

200
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 They would mix it back up and he'd grab a new one

201
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
 As he was travelling around

202
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
 So they mixed them back up again and so he used the same one

203
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 It feels kind of pointless

204
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
 It's like a punishment for the gods, actually

205
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
 It is, it is, it is

206
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
 So he demonstrated one thing I found amazing

207
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 Which is to do with the bamboozling numbers

208
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 If I took this right now and I mixed this up

209
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
 To give to him to solve

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
 Whatever I've just done here

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
 Is a combination that he will have never seen

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
 In his life

213
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 The combination is unique because of the 43 quintillion

214
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
 I just spent 2 and a half minutes in

215
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 I think what's extraordinary

216
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 Like when it started getting big

217
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
 There was a big concern that is this thing solvable

218
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
 So there was a world fair that he was taken to

219
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
 And he's not a particular

220
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
 He's quite a philosophical guy

221
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
 He's quite sort of very serious

222
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 And he wasn't the best ambassador of what this item was

223
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
 But they needed him there

224
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 To prove it could be solved

225
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 Otherwise it was the Americans, wasn't it?

226
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
 Yeah, they got sent to an American toy company

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 And they thought this is a good toy

228
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
 But it probably can't actually be done

229
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
 And I think they sent an executive to Budapest

230
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
 To meet Rubik

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
 If you can solve this, we'll make it

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 We'll manufacture it and we'll distribute it

233
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
 And then they sold 150 million in those 3 years

234
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
 But they sold it thanks to the most famous

235
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
 Hungarian at the time

236
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
 So Rubik obviously couldn't really do all the press and stuff

237
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
 Such a great question

238
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
 I'm going chajagaboor

239
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
 Was it?

240
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
 Absolutely, chajagaboor

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
 Rubik's Cube? That is not a Venn diagram

242
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
 Amazing, right?

243
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
 So this is the earliest mention of the actual phrase

244
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 Rubik's Cube I could find

245
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
 This was from 1980

246
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
 And chajagaboor had put on a party for the Rubik's Cube

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
 Where she invited all of her Hollywood friends

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
 Wow

249
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
 With a buffet of Hungarian delicacies

250
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
 That said, but he didn't say what I supposed

251
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
 Goulash, but I'm not sure what else was there

252
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Wow

253
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
 Rubik's Cube was hired by the ideal toy

254
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
 Corporation to promote

255
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
 The Rubik's Cube

256
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 As she said, even if you can't solve it

257
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
 The Cube feels so good in your hands

258
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
 It may replace worry beads

259
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 Oh, nice

260
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
 Like the original fidget spinner

261
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
 Or like those new poppers

262
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
 That is true, if you do just play with the Rubik's Cube

263
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 Even if you don't solve it

264
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
 It is fun to play with, isn't it?

265
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 Especially if you've got Cube Lube

266
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 Oh, it flies through your hand

267
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 You know, I told him from quite early

268
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 And he said that children are better than adults

269
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
 Solving it, which would you agree with that, Lucy?

270
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 Yeah, my own anecdotal experience

271
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 Who was saying all this? Was it Rubik?

272
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 That was Rubik saying that

273
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
 He had a couple of reasons why he thought

274
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 That kids would be better

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
 More nimble, wrists

276
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
 I think purely physical terms

277
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
 Smaller hands

278
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
 I always think with technology

279
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
 My kids will just pick up anything

280
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 And go "blah, blah, blah, blah"

281
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
 Whereas I am hovering

282
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
 I am tempted to think

283
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
 And I overthink it

284
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
 Maybe there's an impulsiveness

285
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
 Yeah, I think overthinking

286
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
 Is kind of one thing he said

287
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
 He said it requires a certain innocence

288
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 That children had

289
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
 Because adults will try out a pattern

290
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
 And it doesn't quite work out

291
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
 And they'll just never do that again

292
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
 Whereas kids will keep trying things

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
 The thing is with the Rubik's Cube

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
 It is all algorithms and it's just repeating things

295
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
 And so kids are good at that

296
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
 He also said that kids

297
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
 And I think this is probably quite true

298
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
 Is at certain kids anyway

299
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 Will get very absorbed with one thing

300
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 And won't let anything else distract them

301
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
 Just kind of concentrate on it and do it

302
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 And the other thing he said

303
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Is that kids have good visual memory

304
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 And that is true

305
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
 Children can have much better visual

306
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
 Until around 10 or 11 or 12

307
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 They have almost idetic memories

308
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 That they can just remember things really well

309
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
 He didn't mention nimble fingers

310
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 It's weird

311
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
 Cos I know Rubik was Hungarian

312
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 In 1981

313
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
 The spokesman at the Hungarian Embassy in London

314
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 Said the cube is our secret weapon

315
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 To pacify the West

316
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 Wow

317
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 There was even a cartoon

318
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
 Did you guys see the cartoon?

319
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 Rubik's Cube, it's a sentient Rubik's Cube

320
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 That is an alien

321
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
 So great and it was a Rubik's Cube

322
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 That was completely useless if it was out of position

323
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 And that could happen quite easily

324
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
 If a passing pigeon knocked it

325
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 And it would become useless

326
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
 But if it was in its right sold state

327
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
 It was this powerful sentient thing

328
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
 Could he change?

329
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
 Could he solve himself or did he require?

330
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 He required

331
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
 So it's called Rubik the Amazing Cube

332
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
 And it has

333
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 I love it, his IMDB page has goofs

334
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 One of the goofs is

335
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
 Even in its sold state

336
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
 The colours of Rubik are often in the wrong position

337
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
 The light is always across from yellow

338
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
 Correct?

339
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
 So it says in many of its sold states

340
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 The colours are sitting next to each other

341
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 That shouldn't be

342
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
 What a blue colour

343
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
 But it was actually

344
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 It was not a long lasting series

345
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
 But it was very much praised

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
 It sounds like such a long lasting form though

347
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
 The family that

348
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 When trusted with the sentient cube

349
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 Was a Latino family

350
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
 That was shown on TV really back then

351
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
 So it was a very progressive show

352
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 It was seen as a

353
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 It's nice to see a family who aren't white

354
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 It's the leads in a cartoon

355
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
 Bring it back it's what I'm saying

356
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
 They didn't announce a film in 2010

357
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 Which I'm not sure

358
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
 They did that with loads of them didn't they?

359
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
 Like loads of toys

360
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 And they made one or two battleships they made

361
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
 Battleships got made

362
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
 But they also announced Ridley Scott's Monopoly

363
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 Which I don't think

364
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 Happened unless I really missed it

365
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 But they're about to do Tetris as a big series

366
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 They're about to do a big Netflix series about Tetris

367
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
 I think Guess Who

368
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
 Would be a very good one

369
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 Very instantly recognisable characters

370
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 A mystery, do you think like a mystery thing?

371
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
 Yeah

372
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Did the suspect

373
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
 Wear a hat

374
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
 Weirdest follow up to Knives Out

375
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,320
 Operation that would be another good one

376
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
 Operation, yeah

377
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 Gruelling harrowing medical job

378
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,320
 It's his funny bone

379
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
 Let's get the tweezers

380
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 Okay, it is time for fact number two

381
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
 And that is Lucy

382
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
 It is this fact

383
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 On at least three occasions in the last 16 years

384
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
 The government of Shanghai has tried and failed

385
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
 To stop people wearing pyjamas

386
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
 Outdoors

387
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
 Which seems

388
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
 Famously Chinese authorities

389
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
 Are so laissez-faire

390
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,320
 The fact they've tried and failed is quite interesting

391
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
 It doesn't say much for the all powerful machinery

392
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 Of the state

393
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 You can't even stop people wearing pyjamas out

394
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
 I don't think they've sent the army in

395
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
 They've just disapprovingly said

396
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
 You shouldn't do this

397
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
 They haven't really tried then

398
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
 There's been several attempts

399
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
 It's quite a big thing, particularly in Shanghai

400
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
 For people to wear pyjamas

401
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
 Out and about

402
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 They think it's partly because

403
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
 In the early 20th century

404
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 It was a real status symbol to be able to

405
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 Afford imported pyjamas

406
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 So people would take to the streets

407
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 In their firing and are going look I can afford these

408
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
 And slippers

409
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
 They've got little teddy bears on them or whatever

410
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
 And so it was sort of

411
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 A status symbol and then it's just become a thing

412
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 I mean I'm all into it

413
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
 Because I wear pyjamas at all times

414
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
 I'm doing a tour at the moment

415
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
 In which I wear pyjamas so I'm very much on the side

416
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
 On stage you're a pyjama

417
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
 Because I decided during lockdown

418
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
 There's nothing you can't

419
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
 If I do a zoom and the other person is wearing something smart

420
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
 I think you absolutely lose her

421
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
 Why would you dress up

422
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
 To have a meeting in your own home

423
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
 Especially now you think if they're not wearing

424
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
 Three layers and a blankie you think

425
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
 Oh showing off you can afford heating

426
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
 So what you're doing then is possibly

427
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
 Doing in China as well

428
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
 Which is you've got daytime pyjamas

429
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
 And then you'll go home and you probably

430
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
 Have nighttime pyjamas that you wear right

431
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
 This is what they do in China so

432
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
 These aren't the pyjamas they're waking up in

433
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
 And just going out onto the street

434
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
 They'll get out of their pyjamas to put on some pyjamas

435
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 To then go out into the street

436
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 Yeah they are the day wearer pyjamas

437
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
 I can't say that for everyone but that's

438
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 For a lot of people

439
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
 To be honest I would try and get away with

440
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
 Going oh no these are my fancy pyjamas

441
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 No no I definitely didn't sleep in these

442
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 Definitely didn't

443
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 Have you ever done a school run or anything in your pyjamas Lucy

444
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 Well do you know I was on Five Live the other day

445
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
 Because the Prime Minister's wife

446
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 Had gone and done the school run in her slippers

447
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 Except they were like five hundred

448
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
 Pounds slippers

449
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
 And Five Live phoned me up and said oh for our

450
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
 Breakfast show tomorrow do you want to do a

451
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
 Phoning about should you be allowed to wear

452
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 Slippers on the school run and of course

453
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 I'm desperate to promote my tours so I said yes

454
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
 But the great thing was nobody cared

455
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
 And it was one of those

456
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 It was lovely when you're part of a sort of

457
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 Supposedly controversial phoning that is not at all

458
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 Controversial

459
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 Did people just phone in and say I don't care

460
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 Yeah they just said well you can wear what you want

461
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
 This is a tantrum do you know the most amazing radio phoning

462
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
 I've ever heard

463
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
 I was in a cab on the way somewhere or something

464
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
 It was quite a long journey this was 2020

465
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
 And it was if we get

466
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
 A new royal yacht right

467
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
 Should Prince Andrew be allowed

468
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 To go on it

469
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
 There's not going to be a new royal yacht

470
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
 Just not

471
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 And people had such strong opinions

472
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
 This must have been in the first two months

473
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
 Of 2020 I assume

474
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
 It was yeah yeah

475
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 Events overtook

476
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
 That one

477
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
 Where do you stand on

478
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 Should Prince Andrew be allowed on the royal yacht

479
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
 Oh god he's actually thinking about it

480
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
 It's a tricky one isn't it

481
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
 It's a taxpayer funded yacht

482
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
 If they're buying their own yacht

483
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
 I guess

484
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 But if I'm paying for this yacht

485
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 Yeah I think I am actually angry about it

486
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
 I think I shouldn't be allowed to go on it

487
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
 What if he's not allowed to come above decks

488
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
 What if he's only allowed in the

489
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
 I think he should be allowed to be in steerage

490
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 That's fine

491
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
 You can't keep him hidden in a basement

492
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 You don't want to get on that yacht and discover Andrew

493
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
 That's it

494
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 Oh god no

495
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 They used to use sign language on the old royal yacht

496
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 Yeah because they wanted to keep it quiet for the royals

497
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 And they had this complicated system of

498
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 Waving at each other

499
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 That's not typical BSL sign language

500
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 No sorry they had a royal yacht

501
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 Based hand language

502
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 Like the people on Ryanair

503
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 When they need a new tin of Pringles

504
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 They have a special sign that they make

505
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 The attendance

506
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
 They have a secret sign language code

507
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 For whatever they've run out of

508
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 You'll notice it now next time you've got a flight

509
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
 You can't wait

510
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 Paraboloid for a Pringle

511
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
 I'm not party to the code

512
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
 But I know that it exists

513
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 Like bookmakers

514
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 Bookmakers and the aircrew

515
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 Nice

516
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
 I can get us back to pyjamas

517
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
 The other thing they did on the royal yacht was

518
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 I think they wore soft sole shoes

519
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 The crew so they weren't stamping around the decks

520
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
 And presumably infuriating Princess Margaret or something

521
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
 So they had a specific

522
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 Well speaking of pyjamas

523
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 They did used to be

524
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
 Outdoor things didn't they

525
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 Well they originated in

526
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
 Like Persia

527
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 Ottoman Empire

528
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
 And they were just basically

529
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
 Loose fit trousers which you would tie around the waist

530
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 They were taken by the

531
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
 Colonial British

532
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
 And they realised that they were quite nice to sleep in

533
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 So that's how they became pyjamas

534
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
 But Coco Chanel thought that we should wear them down the beach

535
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 And they became really fashionable

536
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
 People wearing pyjamas down the beach

537
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 In the 1920s and 30s

538
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
 Really? Yeah

539
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
 There was a place called

540
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 I don't know how to pronounce it, it's in France

541
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
 So it's J-U-A-N

542
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
 I think it is

543
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 I think it's Huan Le Pan

544
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 I've seen it and not been able to pronounce it

545
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 It feels like Huan Le Pan

546
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 Feels like the nice way to say it

547
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
 But it was called 'Pajamaland'

548
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
 In English and 'Pajamapolis'

549
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
 In French because there were so many people in pyjamas

550
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 On the beach in that town

551
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
 I think it does come and go as a fashion

552
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
 And there's pockets of it

553
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 I remember being in Cardiff for quite a long time

554
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 And there was one area of Cardiff

555
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 Where everybody went out in their pyjamas all the time

556
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 Is that right? Do they wear pyjamas

557
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
 Or the ones they slept in?

558
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 I think sort of the ones they slept in

559
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
 But it's a fine line between leisure wear

560
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
 Shall I tell you about the various attempts

561
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
 To shut down a pyjama wearing in China?

562
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
 Oh yes, yeah

563
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 So in the 1990s

564
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 There was an education campaign

565
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 And they put signs up in Shanghai

566
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
 Saying 'Please don't wear your pyjamas'

567
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 2008, the Rixin neighbourhood

568
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 In northeast Shanghai had a public campaign

569
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 Saying 'Don't wear your pyjamas'

570
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
 But then, 2020

571
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 In Xuzhan city

572
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 Which is near to Shanghai

573
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
 There was a social media post

574
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
 Exposing uncivilised behaviour

575
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 Increasing the quality of residents

576
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
 And the local government

577
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 Put out various pictures of people

578
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
 Who were engaged in antisocial behaviour

579
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 Including seven people in pyjamas

580
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 And they used facial recognition technology

581
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 To find out who they were

582
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
 And put their names up

583
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 Which, what you need there

584
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 Is you need pyjamas that have got some sort of balaclava

585
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 A sleep mask

586
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 A sleep mask exactly

587
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
 But yeah, it does seem extraordinary

588
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
 I think around the Shanghai World Expo

589
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
 In 2010 as well, there was quite a campaign

590
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 To stop people wearing their pyjamas

591
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 Yeah, that was a big one, wasn't it?

592
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 The government at that one hired

593
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
 500 members of the public

594
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
 To volunteer to sort of stand at bus stops

595
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
 And just, just if someone in pyjamas came along

596
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 Go 'Hey, that looks daggy

597
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 You need a change out of that, mate?'

598
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
 Yeah, 500 alties

599
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
 Do you know what kind of pyjamas

600
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
 James Bond wears?

601
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
 Or what he wears to bed?

602
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
 Surely he doesn't wear anything

603
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
 I mean, because I don't think pyjamas are sexy

604
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
 Can they be sexy?

605
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
 Well, great point

606
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
 Because there are obviously fancy silk pyjamas

607
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
 Which might be sexy

608
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
 And the switch might not be

609
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
 The pyjamas aren't sexy because they cling

610
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
 Unless it's proper silk

611
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 Yeah, silk

612
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
 That's a problem

613
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
 All the balloons in the house

614
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 So Anthony Horowitz

615
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
 Is a thriller writer

616
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
 He writes lots and lots and lots of books

617
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
 And he, for a while, was the

618
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
 James Bond sequels

619
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
 He was the official state's choice

620
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 And he wrote a couple of Bond books

621
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 And one of them was called Trigger Mortis

622
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
 Great name

623
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 And in the start of the book, in the opening chapter

624
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
 Anthony Horowitz wrote a description of Bond

625
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 Jumping out of bed, naked

626
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 And he sent this off to the flaming estate

627
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
 And they got back it up and they said, 'You can't have that'

628
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 Because it's official Bond canon

629
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
 In one of the books, I can't remember which one it is

630
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
 I think it's 'You Only Live Twice' or something

631
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
 Bond wears a bed jacket

632
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
 Which is maybe the least sexy item

633
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 Of clothing you could possibly imagine

634
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
 It kind of buttons up to the neck

635
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
 And it goes down to the knees

636
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
 The winky night shirt style

637
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
 So he just rewrote it not saying that Bond was naked

638
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
 He didn't describe the bed jacket

639
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 Because he thought that would be a way of destroying the character

640
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
 Bond undid the top button of his night jacket

641
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
 Bond hung up his night cap

642
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
 On the side

643
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
 He just imagine a little packet of Renny's in the pocket

644
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
 Oh, there's a hand key in there

645
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 How long has that been in there for?

646
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
 Interestingly, for a very long time

647
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
 The classic trouser pajama

648
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 With the jacket button up kind of thing

649
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 For a long time, worn by men

650
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 And that changed during World War I

651
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
 This is where women started wearing it

652
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
 This is according to a professor

653
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 At the University of Glasgow called Lucy Whitmore

654
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
 Who talked about the fact that zeppelin raids

655
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
 Meant that whenever you heard the alarm

656
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
 And you needed to run out of your house

657
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
 It got to a point where

658
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
 You became quite conscious of what you were wearing

659
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
 You would come out in your nightie

660
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
 You might look a bit dishevelled

661
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 And also it's not the most practical thing

662
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 To be running around in a nightie

663
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 So to begin with, at the start of it

664
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
 It would be people would leave

665
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 Very nice looking jackets in a very good spot

666
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
 So that as the raid was happening

667
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 And they would grab it and go out

668
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 And look fashionable

669
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 There was an old lady who suggested leaving

670
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
 An emergency toupee by the door as well

671
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
 So you could grab that on the way out

672
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 And then eventually people started wearing

673
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
 Women rather started wearing pajamas

674
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
 And the popular colour was dark blue

675
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
 Because if you're outside

676
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 You obviously don't want any extras

677
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 Come on

678
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
 You don't want to give away

679
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 I guess if you're being bombed

680
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 You want to do everything to stop yourself from being seen

681
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 Is that also why you need the toupee

682
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 To stop the bald head

683
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 And light reflecting back up

684
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 Dan Widley, I found the same zeppelin based

685
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
 First World War fact in it

686
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 I went to the library and did a bit of research

687
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
 There are a couple of books about the history of underclothes

688
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
 And I sat there looking like a dirty old man

689
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
 Sitting in the library

690
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 Or you did have your penis out

691
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
 You should never

692
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
 Believe me

693
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
 But almost

694
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
 Every page of the book had a

695
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
 Line drawing of some corset

696
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
 Or some girdle

697
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
 Or something and I just started quickly flipping

698
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
 Through the line, I'm just here for the pyjamas

699
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 Actually, I want the least sexy stuff

700
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 Do you know what though, anyone looking at that would go

701
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
 That is the most adorable thing

702
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
 If that's how you're getting your kicks

703
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 I'm looking at line drawings of ladies petticoats

704
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
 It's not Andrew Tate

705
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
 Let's be honest

706
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,320
 And what did you find anything extra

707
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 On the underclothes

708
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
 The onesie was sort of invented in that period

709
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
 Wasn't it? We know Winston Churchill

710
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 He's still not wearing a onesie and that was

711
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 A World War one

712
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
 He called his like a bilus

713
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
 Siren suit

714
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
 I think that was later

715
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
 He meant siren suit because of the air raid sirens

716
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
 I was thinking that he would sit on a rock and sing

717
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 Imagine if he had a lovely singing voice

718
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
 We never really heard him sing

719
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
 So I wanted to meet them on the beaches

720
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,320
 We will seduce them on the beaches

721
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
 Most men

722
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
 Claim not to wear anything to bed

723
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,320
 But you're doubting them

724
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
 Okay, interesting

725
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
 I am doubting them, I think

726
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
 I think the dramas have a reputation of being a bit cosy

727
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
 I think there is a sense

728
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 That men want to be thought of as being tough

729
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 And rugged and like I don't wear anything to bed

730
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
 Even if it's minus four in the house or whatever

731
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 Is there not and now listen

732
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
 I know nothing of the male anatomy

733
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
 I'll put that right out there but is there not

734
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
 Do things not get a bit twisted and I would

735
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 Imagine discomfort if you slept completely

736
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
 Naked as a man, do things not

737
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
 Is it not nice at all? Is it alright?

738
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 Is it alright? Good to know

739
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
 Good to know, thanks for that

740
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
 I've never been woken up by that

741
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
 I've never twisted anything

742
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
 It's got a trap under the bed again

743
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,320
 Finally you're going to have to fold in the fibre game again

744
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,320
 If you tried to leap out for an air raid

745
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 I feel like that was one of the weirdest moments

746
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
 Ever on our podcast where you had

747
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
 Three guys sitting here picturing ourselves

748
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
 Naked in bed

749
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
 There are four listeners now

750
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 The mental images

751
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
 Please send in your fan art

752
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:12,320
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

753
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
 And that is Andy

754
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
 My fact is the flow of the Amazon

755
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
 Is so big that even a hundred miles

756
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
 Into the Atlantic you could

757
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
 Drink over the side of your ship

758
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
 And the water would still be fresh

759
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
 That's incredible, I love it

760
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
 I should tell where I got this fact first

761
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
 It's called Thomas Pueyo on Twitter

762
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,320
 I couldn't believe it when I first read it

763
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
 So I did a bit more looking

764
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
 Some sources say the water is going to be a bit brackish

765
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
 It might not be totally

766
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
 Sparkling, Evian style fresh

767
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 But it would definitely be noticeably less salty

768
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
 So you would not be able to see South America

769
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
 If you were a hundred miles out

770
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 And you would still get water that was much less salty

771
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
 If you were, let's say

772
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 You were sailing across the ocean

773
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
 Before you knew where you were

774
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
 You could keep tasting the water

775
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
 And as it got less and less salty

776
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
 You could almost find your way to the shore

777
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 What an incredible idea, yeah

778
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
 To navigate your way there

779
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 Sailors must have worked that out though

780
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
 Because they're very wise

781
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
 There will be some sort of sailor rhyme

782
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
 Like if the water tastes nice

783
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
 If the water tastes nice

784
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
 Brazil will be in a trice

785
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 If the water tastes salty

786
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
 Then your

787
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
 Compass is faulty

788
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
 There you go

789
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
 So every single day

790
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
 The water that we're talking about

791
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
 That sort of pushes out

792
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
 Into the Atlantic

793
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 It's 17 billion metric tonnes

794
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
 Of water that flows out

795
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
 It's hard to work out what that is

796
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
 What that equates to, if you were getting fresh water

797
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
 In New York City

798
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
 That's the daily amount for nine years

799
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
 That would be used

800
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
 Nine years worth of fresh water in New York City

801
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
 Is what goes out daily

802
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
 In the Atlantic

803
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
 They should move New York

804
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
 I don't know if that's practical

805
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
 But it's weird that we can't somehow

806
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
 Harvest it, it's just going

807
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
 It's just disappearing

808
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
 Becoming salty

809
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
 It goes into the water cycle

810
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
 And eventually rains down on us

811
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
 Yeah, but we could use the planet alive

812
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
 I think we've done enough mucking around

813
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
 Actually, maybe we should just meet the Amazon

814
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
 I actually disagree, I think a huge pike

815
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
 At the mouth of the Amazon

816
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
 That just takes it all the way to New York

817
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
 Brilliant, not New York, but somewhere that needs fresh water

818
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
 There's lots of places where they don't have water

819
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
 Somewhere closer

820
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 Yeah, exactly

821
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
 New Orleans

822
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
 I can't see it not working

823
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
 I'm just saying, it's a bit of a waste

824
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
 That's 17 billion metric tonnes

825
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
 It's a waste, I really don't think it's a waste

826
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
 Donald Trump listening to this

827
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
 Is going to be diverted to his golf courses

828
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
 Anyway, the Amazon, it's big

829
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
 It's big, it blows my mind

830
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
 My mate's got a new Brazilian girlfriend

831
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
 And he was saying, you know, you go to Brazil

832
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
 It's just massive, mate

833
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
 It's just massive

834
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
 The thing I always find interesting

835
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
 About the Amazon is that you can't build bridges

836
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
 Yeah

837
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
 Because it's too

838
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
 Because the width of it

839
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
 Varies so much

840
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
 And it's so soft, crumbly at the edges

841
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
 So it would have to be such a massive bridge

842
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
 Because it would have to start

843
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
 And so what, they just go across on boats and stuff

844
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

845
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
 I think they've built one now

846
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
 There is one, but it's right up at the north

847
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
 It's over a tributary

848
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
 It's the Rio Negro

849
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
 Which is a tributary of the Amazon

850
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
 But it's before it joins the river proper

851
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
 Basically, so there are no bridges across the Amazon-Amazon

852
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
 Like you say, Lucy

853
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
 During the wet season, the Amazon

854
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
 Is 190 kilometres wide

855
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
 But it's widest

856
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
 That's why this is really wide

857
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
 Imagine from here to Stoke

858
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
 Maybe Stafford

859
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
 That's further, in fact

860
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
 My electric car wouldn't be able to drive

861
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
 If there was a bridge that went over that net

862
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
 They would have to be a charging point

863
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
 On that bridge

864
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
 Otherwise they wouldn't be able to get across

865
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
 God, it's that wide, that is insane

866
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
 I like that the Amazon River is part of

867
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
 Effectively an Amazon River sandwich

868
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
 It's the meat

869
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
 Of a sandwich

870
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
 In that

871
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
 This is a tortured metaphor

872
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
 I know what you're talking about and even I'm struggling

873
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
 To come up with this

874
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
 There's a river below it

875
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
 And there's a river above it

876
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
 There's more water above the Amazon River

877
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
 In the clouds

878
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
 Above the actual Amazon itself

879
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
 The clouds follow the shape of the river

880
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
 I believe so

881
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
 It's water vapor stream, isn't it?

882
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
 It's amazing

883
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
 I think it's 20 billion tonnes of water

884
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
 Yeah, and that's more water

885
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
 Than it's actually in the river itself

886
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
 They say

887
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
 Isn't it something like a big tree

888
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
 In the Amazon, perspires

889
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
 Or transpires or whatever it is

890
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
 A thousand litres of water in a day

891
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
 One tree

892
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
 And then underneath

893
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
 You've got the Hamza

894
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
 So secret underground river

895
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
 You can only get to it

896
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
 If you defeat an Aztec boss

897
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
 On the final level

898
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
 On the final level

899
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
 So

900
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
 Under the Amazon there is a sort of aquifer

901
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
 That is even wider

902
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
 Even bigger

903
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
 Even bolder, even fresher

904
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
 It's Amazon 2, the revenge

905
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
 The River Hamza named after the

906
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
 Strictly winner this year obviously

907
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
 Oh, not Abu Hamza

908
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
 It's got a big hook in it

909
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
 Ranger Hamza

910
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
 It's quite recently discovered, isn't it?

911
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
 So Hamza was the name of the head of the team

912
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
 That discovered it, and it's

913
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
 Very low down

914
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
 4,000 metres below the river itself

915
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
 Super slow moving

916
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
 To the point where you can't really call it a river

917
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
 Like, it's not flowing

918
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
 It moves at one millimetre an hour

919
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
 I relate to this river very hard

920
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
 It's very slow, low down

921
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
 If you drop something in it

922
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
 You'll be reunited with it quite quickly

923
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
 It won't be swept away

924
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
 Suddenly

925
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
 You game of poostics would be quite low stakes, wouldn't it?

926
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
 Exactly

927
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
 The Giant Amazon Leech

928
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
 Which you find in the Amazon River

929
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
 Do you think it's longer or shorter

930
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
 Than the world's longest

931
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
 Cattail?

932
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
 No, I actually

933
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
 Know the length of the leech

934
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
 But I have no idea about the world's longest cattail

935
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
 That's the difficulty of this quiz question

936
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
 You actually need two quite arcade bits of knowledge

937
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
 To even make a guess

938
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
 I think the longest cattail is not that long

939
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
 Really?

940
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
 It's a domestic cat

941
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
 Here we go

942
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
 I think the leech is about a forearm

943
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
 I think it's about 18 inches

944
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
 The biggest giant leech

945
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
 The longest ever cattail is longer or shorter than 18 inches

946
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
 This gives it away a bit

947
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
 It's a Ferndale cat

948
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
 Well no, you've made it too easy

949
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 I don't want to submit an answer anymore

950
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
 Is it exactly the same length?

951
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
 Andy is spot on with the 18 inches

952
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
 For the Amazon Leech

953
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
 And the longest cattail

954
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
 According to Guinness

955
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
 Is 17 inches

956
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
 Do you think

957
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
 That the giant Amazon Leech

958
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
 Is longer or shorter

959
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
 Than the height

960
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
 Of the world's tallest donut

961
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
 Right, so

962
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
 It's good now we know we've got 18 inches

963
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
 Put the donut down flat

964
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
 So not the diameter

965
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
 Not the roundness, it's how tall it goes

966
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
 I think the donut's taller

967
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
 No, I think it's still the leech

968
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
 Yeah, Andy knows his stuff

969
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
 Tallest donut, 16 inches tall

970
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
 It was quite wide and fairness

971
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
 Yeah, but actually what's that foot and heart

972
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
 I mean that's a tall donut

973
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
 I could eat that then

974
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
 I want the world's biggest donut

975
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
 To be a donut that I was like

976
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
 I couldn't eat that

977
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
 You could make lovely donuts that big

978
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
 Or like the ring road of a small town

979
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
 Exactly

980
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
 Oh this is a great quiz

981
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
 Well I loved it, I had a great time

982
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
 So this is the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory

983
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
 This is a cool thing

984
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
 And it's a really new thing as well actually

985
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
 So it's an observatory

986
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
 But not a space observatory

987
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
 It's to look down at the Amazon

988
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
 And so it's in the middle of the rainforest

989
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
 And the trees are

990
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
 What are tall trees, they're about 80 to 100 meters aren't they

991
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
 A good tall tree is up to

992
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
 You know it's a really tall tree 100 meters

993
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
 And the tower, I think the tallest ever tree

994
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
 Is about 120 meters, like the tallest ever measured

995
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
 But this tower is 325 meters

996
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
 Okay, it's about as tall as the Eiffel Tower

997
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
 Which actually is really tall when you look at it

998
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
 The Eiffel Tower

999
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
 Wow busting some myths today out me

1000
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
 I never think of it as tall

1001
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
 But actually I went there

1002
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
 It's big, the Eiffel Tower

1003
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
 You can see it from a long way away

1004
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
 Exactly, and this is much thinner than the Eiffel Tower

1005
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
 It's just one needle going up

1006
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
 It looks mad this thing

1007
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
 I was up the Eiffel Tower once

1008
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
 In a restaurant

1009
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
 And we had a table next to the window

1010
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
 It was really nice, it was overlooking the bridge

1011
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
 And what you would see is

1012
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
 They had these guys playing

1013
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
 You know we have three cups and you have to hide the ball

1014
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
 And just taking loads of money

1015
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
 And then about every 20 minutes the police would turn up

1016
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
 And they would leg it

1017
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
 And then you could watch them go all the way down the river

1018
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
 Over the next bridge, back over again

1019
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
 And then back on the bridge and then start playing again

1020
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
 And then the police would turn up

1021
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
 It was like a cat and mouse

1022
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
 I really thought you were going to say that from your perspective

1023
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
 You could see which carpet was under

1024
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
 I just yelled

1025
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
 "Bettle on"

1026
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
 Your wife's down there looking up

1027
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
 You've got special cup ball sign language

1028
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
 You've developed

1029
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
 How's they doing it?

1030
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
 We have never been fucked before

1031
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,320
 What's done in that restaurant too? We didn't get a window seat

1032
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
 No, well you need to

1033
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,320
 Are there tables where you don't have window seats?

1034
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
 You're just looking at a big piece of iron

1035
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
 [Laughter]

1036
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
 They really saw you coming

1037
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
 Was it on the ground floor?

1038
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
 Did you get the basement table?

1039
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
 [Laughter]

1040
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,320
 Didn't know Peter Express was it

1041
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
 France?

1042
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
 Wow, oh that's funny

1043
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
 Is the restaurant still going?

1044
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,320
 I didn't even get into the restaurant

1045
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
 We need it, we'll go together

1046
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
 I'd love that

1047
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
 Oh yeah, this observatory is

1048
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
 325 metres

1049
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
 It's one metre taller than the Eiffel Tower

1050
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
 And it's got 1500 steps up

1051
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
 And it takes about an hour

1052
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
 to walk up to the top

1053
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
 I don't know if there's a lift actually

1054
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
 And basically it's just to sniff

1055
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
 the breath of the forest

1056
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
 They're measuring all the chemicals in the air

1057
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
 Where there are forest fires

1058
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
 They measure the concentrations and how dangerous that is

1059
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
 Deforestation

1060
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
 They can tell things about that

1061
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
 I think it's amazing

1062
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
 Imagine you go up and you've forgotten your glasses

1063
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
 [Laughter]

1064
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
 I can't even see the guy with the cup and the ball

1065
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
 [Laughter]

1066
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,320
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show

1067
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
 And that is James

1068
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
 OK, my fact this week

1069
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
 is that while playing a psychiatric patient

1070
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
 in one flew over the cuckoo's nest

1071
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
 Danny DeVito ended up becoming

1072
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
 a psychiatric patient himself

1073
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
 [Groans]

1074
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
 Was he going method?

1075
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
 Some people did go method

1076
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
 We might get to that

1077
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
 But DeVito's problem

1078
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
 really is quite sweet actually

1079
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
 He had recently

1080
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
 gotten together with Rhea Perlman

1081
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
 The amazing Rhea Perlman

1082
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
 And cheers right? Just to put

1083
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
 her head in your

1084
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
 Carla can cheers

1085
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
 And obviously they were filming

1086
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
 or not obviously but they were filming a long way away

1087
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
 from where she was

1088
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
 3000 miles in fact

1089
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
 and so he was really missed her

1090
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
 and in order to deal with that separation

1091
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
 he invented an imaginary friend to talk to at night

1092
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
 and he became a little bit

1093
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
 concerned about his mental health

1094
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
 perhaps because they were making this film

1095
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
 and there was a lot of it in the air

1096
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
 and so he decided to see the doctor

1097
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,320
 on set who was called Dr. Brooks

1098
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
 and asked for his advice and Dr. Brooks said

1099
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
 yeah don't worry about it as long as you're aware that it's an imaginary friend

1100
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
 imaginary friend is a perfectly normal

1101
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
 thing to have it's no problem at all

1102
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
 But also that doctor

1103
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
 the on set doctor was actually

1104
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
 in the movie of course

1105
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
 Was he? It was the weirdest thing was there

1106
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
 But an amazing man because he owned

1107
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
 the clinic in which they filmed it

1108
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
 so it's no wonder they were all a little bit

1109
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
 stir crazy because they were in an actual mental institution

1110
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
 filming this very intense

1111
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
 movie

1112
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
 He's the one who sort of checks in

1113
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
 Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy at the start of the film

1114
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
 and interviews him and I think

1115
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
 I don't know if he was going to be in it

1116
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
 but he was really insistent that everyone in the institution

1117
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
 or the patients got involved with the film

1118
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
 he was quite forward thinking, you know

1119
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
 he took lots of the patients on expeditions

1120
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
 he took them white water rafting

1121
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
 and he taught them kind of to rappel down cliffs

1122
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
 and things like, I mean really

1123
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
 because this was in the 70s they were filming it

1124
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
 it was pretty progressive at the time

1125
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
 and I think about 90 inmates ended up involved in the film

1126
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
 in some capacity or another

1127
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
 I must say I haven't seen the film

1128
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
 It's pretty amazing

1129
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
 and I started reading the book this week

1130
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
 and got about a third of the way through

1131
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
 but I think the book's amazing

1132
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
 and apparently the film's even better

1133
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
 Tell you what was even better

1134
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
 it was a stage production

1135
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
 that was put on about 20 years ago

1136
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
 2004

1137
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
 I was in a stage production

1138
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
 Who were you?

1139
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
 Were you the giant

1140
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
 Yes that's me, Chief Brompton

1141
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
 that was me

1142
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
 You know what though, so we did this basically

1143
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
 it was Christian Slater

1144
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
 from Heather's etc

1145
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
 came over and was Mc Murphy

1146
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
 and it was amazing

1147
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
 because at that time there weren't that many

1148
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
 Western shows with big Hollywood stars

1149
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
 Mc Murphy being Jack Dawkins' role in the movie

1150
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
 Exactly yes, the main guy

1151
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
 and I played

1152
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
 I played a nurse who had about two lines

1153
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
 and some of my friends came to see it

1154
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
 and they said, we just thought you were being modest

1155
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
 because I said I'm playing a nurse

1156
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
 he mumbled over the cookie's nest

1157
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
 you were just being modest and you were playing nurse ratchet

1158
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
 but you really were just

1159
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
 a nurse who has two lines

1160
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
 because Francis Barber was nurse ratchet

1161
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
 and Mackenzie Crook was in it

1162
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
 Mackenzie Crook?

1163
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
 He played Billy, the little shine

1164
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
 That's a good role for him

1165
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
 Shall we super quickly just say what the basic premise is?

1166
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
 Just for anyone who hasn't seen it

1167
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
 it's a bit confused

1168
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
 Jack Nicholson

1169
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
 it's been so long

1170
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
 Jack Nicholson plays Mc Murphy

1171
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
 who is this sort of tear away

1172
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
 who is sent to this

1173
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
 secure psychiatric facility

1174
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
 which nurse ratchet is this

1175
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 horrible nurse who

1176
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
 rules with the reign of terror over everybody

1177
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
 There is one nice nurse though

1178
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
 who just has a couple of lines

1179
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
 To star of

1180
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
 the entire production

1181
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
 is that nice nurse

1182
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
 and then the Indian chief

1183
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
 spoilers are we worried about that

1184
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
 I think it came out quite a long time ago

1185
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
 So anyway

1186
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
 Jack Nicholson creates this air of chaos

1187
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
 and rebellion in the place and rebels against

1188
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
 nurse ratchet and then the chief

1189
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
 Brompton, the Native American chief

1190
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
 smothers him with a pillow

1191
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
 We should maybe say that Jack Nicholson's character

1192
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
 suffers a lobotomy

1193
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
 not just the chief Brompton wants to restore

1194
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
 order in the hospital

1195
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
 It's a mercy killing

1196
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
 and the whole sort of thing is

1197
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
 hey we're not mad, society's

1198
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
 mad and

1199
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
 there's a bit of a book where

1200
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
 Murphy finds out that all the patients

1201
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
 are allowed to leave if they want to, they just don't

1202
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
 He's incredibly freaked out by, he says

1203
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
 why don't you just go home, you're allowed

1204
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
 and he says I'm not ready to

1205
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
 It's amazing anyway

1206
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
 It was a very tense filming experience

1207
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
 in lots of ways as well because you had a lot of big personalities

1208
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
 You had Ken Casey

1209
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
 who wrote the book and then ended up hating the film

1210
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
 never watched it

1211
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
 He once started watching it when it was just on TV

1212
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
 and then he realised what filming he was watching and changed channel

1213
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
 I love that

1214
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
 He was channel flipping

1215
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
 and he was like oh what's this

1216
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
 This looks great, oh no

1217
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
 And then so the director was

1218
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
 Milos Forman and Jack Nicholson

1219
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
 and Milos Forman had a big disagreement

1220
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
 about Murphy's character

1221
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
 and basically it's very ordered

1222
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
 and then Jack Nicholson arrives

1223
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
 and he turns the place upside down and

1224
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
 Milos Forman wanted it to be more like it was already chaotic

1225
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
 and then he arrives and he sort of draws

1226
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
 the patients together and they become a team

1227
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
 and there was a big falling out over there

1228
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
 and they ended up talking to each other through the cinematographer

1229
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
 so it would have to be kind of

1230
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
 Can you tell

1231
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
 Jack Nicholson to act this way

1232
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
 I mean it just sounds so tense

1233
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
 Danny DeVito as well

1234
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
 I'm a huge fan of Danny DeVito

1235
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
 and I remembered him as Lou

1236
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
 in Taxi

1237
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
 the sort of doer dispatcher

1238
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
 but when he was in Matilda

1239
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
 he actually played Matilda

1240
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
 although he was playing a horrible dad

1241
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
 but he actually became like a really lovely

1242
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
 father figure to her

1243
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
 and then you know in Mum Play with the Cuckoo's Nest

1244
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
 you could argue that he actually

1245
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
 was playing a sort of psychiatric patient

1246
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
 but he was taking care of his mental health

1247
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
 what I'm saying is he's always the opposite

1248
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
 of how he appears and actually

1249
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
 in Twins

1250
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
 if you put him and Arnold Schwarzenegger together he's taller

1251
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,320
 What a film

1252
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
 he was inducted

1253
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
 into the New Jersey Hall of Fame

1254
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
 in 2010

1255
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
 so I thought I'd look at some other people who are in

1256
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
 New Jersey Hall of Fame

1257
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
 so you've got Buzz Aldrin

1258
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
 Frank Sinatra

1259
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
 Do you have to be from New Jersey can I just ask

1260
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
 Well Thomas Edison is there born in Ohio

1261
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
 Yogi Berra born in Missouri

1262
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
 Harriet Tubman born in Maryland

1263
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
 and Albert Einstein

1264
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
 not even born in America

1265
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
 so we've all got a shot at the New Jersey Hall of Fame

1266
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
 proud son of New Jersey

1267
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
 I think you have to have lived there for a while

1268
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
 because Einstein worked in Princeton of course

1269
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,320
 that's great

1270
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
 on one from over

1271
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
 it was nearly defeated by the Cold War

1272
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
 it didn't get turned into a film because of the Iron Curtain

1273
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
 you know this

1274
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
 this is cool

1275
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
 so the book came out in the early 60s

1276
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
 and Michael Douglas

1277
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
 no sorry

1278
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
 Kirk Douglas bought the rights

1279
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
 he was in the play

1280
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
 he was in the first play version

1281
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
 based on the play not on the book

1282
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
 which is maybe why Ken Casey hated the film

1283
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
 so Kirk Douglas was the initial Mc Murphy

1284
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
 which is mad it's so strange for him to imagine now

1285
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
 because it's so Jack Nicholson's role

1286
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
 and then he bought the rights

1287
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
 and he wrote to Milos Forman in Czechoslovakia

1288
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
 and said got this great play

1289
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,320
 got the rights to where I think it should be a film

1290
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
 I'll send you a copy of the book

1291
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
 Milos Forman said great

1292
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
 the book was then seized by Czech Customs

1293
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
 in 1963

1294
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
 and Forman was really annoyed

1295
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
 because Milos Forman never said thank you for the book

1296
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
 rude

1297
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
 it took a decade to sort out

1298
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
 this misunderstanding between them

1299
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
 the film was made in something like 1975

1300
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
 I think

1301
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
 it took a long time

1302
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
 and eventually Kirk Douglas gave the rights to his son Michael

1303
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
 who then said

1304
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
 shall we just try again with this book thing

1305
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
 do we think that the Czech Customs

1306
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
 didn't let the book go initially

1307
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
 because they were worried

1308
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
 that it was seditious

1309
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
 maybe it's not clear

1310
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
 maybe they just wanted to read it

1311
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
 I was wondering if it was like the Rubik's Cube

1312
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
 going in the opposite direction

1313
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
 I have no idea

1314
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
 I don't know what their reasoning was

1315
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
 Kessie was quite notorious

1316
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
 as a LSD proponent

1317
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
 he was quite famous with the counterculture of America

1318
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
 at that point

1319
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
 he had a bus that he used to take everyone on

1320
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
 what a radical free thinker

1321
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
 it was a psychedelic bus

1322
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
 oh my god a multicoloured bus

1323
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
 we have those all the time

1324
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
 London buses are bright red

1325
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
 that's what it represented

1326
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
 they were called the Merry Pranksters

1327
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
 and Tom Warf wrote a whole book about this

1328
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
 it was a non-fiction book about these guys

1329
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
 who just would go around

1330
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
 they used to do things like

1331
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
 they would have people playing flutes on the top of the bus

1332
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
 who would feel buses where people have been playing the flute

1333
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
 were they on LSD?

1334
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
 just a public safety warning

1335
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
 do not take acid on a London bus

1336
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
 it's not a friendly environment to do that

1337
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
 but it is possible it was the counterculture thing

1338
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
 and his name was very much associated with that

1339
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
 it has a good point

1340
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
 it's interesting because he was an author

1341
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
 already at this point Kessie

1342
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
 before he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

1343
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
 and he was working on a book called Zoo

1344
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
 and in order to fund it he needed a job

1345
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
 so he worked at a psychiatric ward

1346
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
 in order to fund it

1347
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
 and the book idea came to him when one night he was in there

1348
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,320
 I think he was cleaning

1349
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
 and he was on peyote

1350
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
 and he was tripping and he saw a full-blown

1351
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
 Chief Broomden there

1352
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,320
 as a sort of vision

1353
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
 and a psychedelic part of his peyote

1354
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
 is it like a cactus or something?

1355
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,320
 yeah it's like a cactus which you

1356
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
 it's a drug

1357
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,320
 I know it is a word and I know it is a drug but I can't tell you the specifics

1358
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,320
 come on and do the big ol' squass

1359
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
 sorry not to hurt

1360
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
 but he said he saw a full-blown

1361
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
 Native American, he said Indian

1362
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
 Chief Broom, the solution, the whole mothering key to the novel

1363
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
 and that's how he wrote

1364
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
 the novel in the novel

1365
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
 and he's the main like the narrator

1366
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
 sorry and in the movie not

1367
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,320
 he's not and that's why Kessie

1368
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
 immediately hated it, it wasn't told from the perspective of him

1369
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
 he's a big character in it

1370
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
 but he's not

1371
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
 interestingly the guy who got the role of

1372
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
 Chief Broomden got it because

1373
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
 Michael Douglas was sitting next to a used car dealer

1374
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
 on a plane

1375
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
 and the used car dealer's dad was an acting agent

1376
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
 who had a load of Native American actors on his books

1377
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
 and the thing about Chief

1378
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
 Broomden is he's about eight feet tall

1379
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
 and Michael Douglas got a phone call saying

1380
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
 I just met the tallest Native American guy

1381
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,320
 you've ever seen

1382
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
 and it was Will, something I can't remember his name

1383
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
 anyway he got the role as Chief

1384
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
 Will Sampson

1385
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
 nice name for someone incredibly tall

1386
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
 and he's got long hair

1387
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
 so this movie was made

1388
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
 in an actual as we've said

1389
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
 hospital

1390
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
 that was originally it was called

1391
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
 the Oregon State Mental Hospital

1392
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
 it's since been renamed as now

1393
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
 Oregon State Hospital

1394
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
 and it's an interesting place

1395
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
 in its own right, it had

1396
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
 a really controversial bit

1397
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
 which was they found 5,000 canisters

1398
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
 of unclaimed human remains in there

1399
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
 and this was a lot of the patients

1400
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
 who had been cremated but no one

1401
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
 had come to collect them

1402
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
 and they put out the list, they found all the names of the people

1403
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
 and a lot of relatives, distant relatives

1404
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
 came and reclaimed them

1405
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
 and there was a documentary called

1406
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
 "Lust" that was made about it

1407
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
 it was pretty mad

1408
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
 but also they had a railroad

1409
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
 underneath the hospital

1410
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
 specifically built one so that they could deliver

1411
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
 items to different bits of the hospital

1412
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
 but also to transport patients

1413
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,320
 that they didn't want the members of the public

1414
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
 to have to come across if they were visiting the hospital

1415
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
 because they were worried something might go wrong

1416
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
 dangerous, you know, all that sort of stuff

1417
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,320
 and some of the tunnels possibly are still there

1418
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
 but you just walk them now or use bicycles

1419
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
 it's just Prince Andrew

1420
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
 in there now

1421
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,320
 and then they had a horrible thing

1422
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
 I found just horrible things about it

1423
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
 unfortunately, 1942

1424
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
 there was a mass poisoning by accident

1425
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
 they were serving scrambled eggs

1426
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
 and 47 people died from this

1427
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
 they used

1428
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
 instead of powdered milk

1429
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
 they used sodium fluoride

1430
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
 which is a poison you would use to kill cockroaches

1431
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
 and that was accidentally added to the scrambled eggs

1432
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
 and 47 died from that

1433
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
 in a kitchen

1434
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
 we had a Christmas party

1435
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
 and instead of putting white sauce

1436
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
 on the Christmas pudding, they put garlic sauce on

1437
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
 which is a very

1438
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
 less problematic version

1439
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
 of what you just said

1440
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
 it's good to know you can relate

1441
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,320
 I mean, just saying it's easily done

1442
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
 yeah, it's easily done

1443
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
 I want to use cube lube

1444
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
 instead of

1445
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
 instead of what?

1446
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
 it twisted sideways, didn't it?

1447
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:56,320
 should we just quickly mention Louise Fletcher

1448
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
 she played Nurse Fletcher

1449
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
 in the film and died last year sadly

1450
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
 but she was

1451
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
 amazing and she

1452
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
 I think she kept herself separate from the rest of the cast

1453
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
 didn't she, for a lot of the filming

1454
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
 so that she could be an icy

1455
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
 authority figure

1456
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
 and did you do that when you were in the play of Lucy?

1457
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
 she was an icy authority figure

1458
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
 in every situation

1459
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
 didn't she also take all the clothes off though

1460
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
 at one point

1461
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
 at the end of filming, wasn't it?

1462
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,320
 yeah, she'd go hey guys

1463
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
 look at this, all along I was fun

1464
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
 it was her saying

1465
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
 I'm fun, that's right

1466
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
 I think she had her underwear on

1467
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
 I don't think she was fully naked

1468
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
 she wasn't that much fun

1469
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
 I'm fun, but I'm not like fun

1470
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
 there must be a better way

1471
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
 to have cupcakes

1472
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
 to ingratiate yourself with their colleagues

1473
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
 just wait till the end of this podcast

1474
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,320
 there were two others

1475
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
 Anne Bancroft and Angela Lansbury

1476
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
 were both offered the role but turned it down

1477
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
 because they didn't want to appear so evil on screen

1478
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
 wow

1479
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
 this was in a no-bituary of Louise Fletcher that I read

1480
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
 and also

1481
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
 she was repeatedly turned down from roles

1482
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
 because she was 5 foot 10

1483
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
 and in those days a lot of the leading men

1484
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
 were much shorter than that

1485
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
 and she couldn't play roles opposite people

1486
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
 who were shorter or about the same height

1487
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
 and actually in the nurses' cap

1488
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
 she'll be more than 6 foot

1489
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
 and Jack Nilsson is quite a short guy

1490
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
 but it really works for the authority

1491
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
 for the sort of power struggle happening between them

1492
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
 she's brilliant

1493
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
 on Star Trek

1494
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
 yeah, that's right

1495
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
 she said that she found

1496
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
 her role so disturbing

1497
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
 that she also couldn't watch the film

1498
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
 on Star Trek

1499
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
 yeah

1500
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
 aliens are scary

1501
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
 did she, as Nurse Ratchet

1502
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
 she found it really hard

1503
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
 and she just found it too disturbing

1504
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
 to watch as a role

1505
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
 actually the last time I watched it

1506
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
 which was a couple of years ago, the person I was watching it with

1507
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
 sided with Nurse Ratchet

1508
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
 which didn't make me think, no, hang on

1509
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
 you've taken the wrong message there

1510
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
 and she said, no, no, no, look, the point is

1511
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
 someone's got to keep order

1512
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
 just take a job from where he was running the place

1513
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
 it would be an absolute mayhem

1514
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
 one last thing just about Ken Cassie

1515
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
 the author, because he was a pretty amazing author

1516
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
 his method for a certain period when he was writing

1517
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
 was to be completely

1518
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
 off his head on drugs

1519
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
 and he would write a crazy amount

1520
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
 then in the morning, he'd sober up and become his own editor

1521
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
 so he'd sort of say, okay

1522
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,320
 let's see what the author's written

1523
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
 and chop out all the junk

1524
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
 and get down to the good meat of it

1525
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
 wow, that's clever

1526
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
 apart from presumably the first draft was absolute junk

1527
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
 shit

1528
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,320
 just didn't make any sense at all

1529
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
 and then you'd think, hang on

1530
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,320
 what if the editor was drunk as well

1531
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,320
 but I'll do different drugs

1532
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
 then I'll make the copy editor will be sober

1533
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
 so that'll be fine

1534
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
 okay, as long as the printer is sober

1535
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
 it'll be fine

1536
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,320
 okay, that's it

1537
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
 that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening

1538
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320

 no such thing as a fish.com

1549
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
 all of our previous episodes are up there

1550
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
 so you can listen to those

1551
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
 but most importantly of all, if you'd like to see Lucy in her pyjamas

1552
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
 make sure to get out

1553
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
 of your house and into

1554
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,320
 a comedy club to see "Wake Up Call"

1555
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
 it's the show that she's touring

1556
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
 and she's going to be going around the UK doing that

1557
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
 so go google it, see where she's going

1558
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
 and try and see it

1559
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,320
 okay, that's it, we're going to be back again next week with another episode

1560
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,320
 we'll see you then, goodbye
