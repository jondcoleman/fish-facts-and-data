00:00:00,00:00:07,Hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish we have another very special guest for you today and
00:00:07,00:00:13,That guest is our very good friend Lucy Porter. You will remember Lucy from previous episodes on fish
00:00:13,00:00:16,I know you'll love her. She's so smart. She's so funny
00:00:16,00:00:20,"In fact, she's got a stand-up show that is touring at this very moment"
00:00:20,00:00:25,Which is called wake up call and really I'll be honest the best way to find out about that is to Google
00:00:26,00:00:30,"Lucy Porter wake up call and you'll find all the dates, but she's doing the whole of the UK"
00:00:30,00:00:36,It's definitely a show that's worth going to see. She also has a podcast called fingers on buzzers
00:00:36,00:00:41,It's all about quizzing and she does that with my very good old friend Jenny Ryan
00:00:41,00:00:49,It's a brilliant podcast so listen to that and she has a radio for stand-up special called Lucy Porter's lucky dip
00:00:49,00:00:52,Which is going out at 11 30 on March the 15th
00:00:52,00:00:59,It'll probably be on the BBC sounds app after that so again Google Lucy Potter's lucky dip and you'll find that and apart from that
00:00:59,00:01:06,Just enjoy the show so nothing more to say apart from on with the podcast on with the show. Oh hi Andy. I've been here the whole time
00:01:21,00:01:29,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden
00:01:29,00:01:34,My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin and Lucy Porter
00:01:34,00:01:41,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here"
00:01:41,00:01:45,We go starting with fact number one and that is my fact
00:01:46,00:01:52,My fact this week is that it took the creator of the Rubik's Cube a month to solve it the first time he tried
00:01:52,00:02:02,It's so crazy you I would have thought after about 20 or 30 days you would just make a new one
00:02:02,00:02:10,So yeah invented 1974 he was a professor and he just had this idea
00:02:10,00:02:16,What if I could make something that was static on the inside but fluid on the outside and that's what gave him the idea and
00:02:16,00:02:22,He had a bash it it's later been worked out quite a famous number if you know Rubik's cubes that 43
00:02:22,00:02:28,Quintillion is the number of permutations that you can make on the Rubik's Cube
00:02:28,00:02:33,"And so luckily he got there within a month. Yeah, it's pretty good. Well, I'll tell you what's weird. His prototype"
00:02:34,00:02:39,Wasn't three by three. His prototype was two by two. So I've got that took him a month
00:02:39,00:02:45,"That's the thing. Well, I'm curious to know if this is the one that took him a month because this is okay"
00:02:45,00:02:48,So Dan's showing us an image and it's like four wooden blocks
00:02:48,00:02:53,That I've got various colors and numbers on it and they're held together almost by bits of wire
00:02:53,00:03:00,"Yeah, there's a wire meshing inside and he took a month to do a Rubik's Cube"
00:03:00,00:03:07,"Yeah, that one's piss easy. Yeah, it's clever enough to make that you're clever enough to solve it. Yes"
00:03:07,00:03:11,"You can do a Rubik's Cube, James. I can I think you can Lucy"
00:03:11,00:03:14,"Well, I am yeah, my children obsessed with them"
00:03:14,00:03:17,"We've got hundreds in the house and all those weird one, you know"
00:03:17,00:03:22,"There's like weird different shaped ones and mirror ones where there's absolutely, you know"
00:03:22,00:03:27,Colors on it and stuff. So this is a long way of me saying I should be
00:03:28,00:03:30,And I have at one point
00:03:30,00:03:37,That one's tough because it's got like Dan's mixing up one from the Transport Museum
00:03:37,00:03:39,I'd rather do the one with the colors
00:03:39,00:03:44,But the other thing is about the Rubik's Cube is that I find that when you're under pressure
00:03:44,00:03:48,"It's almost impossible. Yes, because you do it kind of with muscle memory"
00:03:48,00:03:52,"Yes, and then as soon as you start thinking about it, you can't really do it at all"
00:03:52,00:03:52,Yeah
00:03:52,00:03:57,I made a terrible decision when because I did learn to do it when my kids got into it and then I
00:03:57,00:04:02,"Decided we were doing a live podcast recording of fingers on buzzers and I said, oh, I tell you what'll be fun"
00:04:02,00:04:07,"I'll solve a Rubik's Cube while we do this round, and it took about 15 minutes"
00:04:07,00:04:13,Is there an algorithm basically? It's like a set pattern of moves that will help you work on the side you're working on
00:04:13,00:04:15,"So layers, that's the key"
00:04:15,00:04:16,"Yeah, exactly so"
00:04:16,00:04:19,"It's layers not sides, so you can see at the moment that I've done the bottom layer"
00:04:19,00:04:20,Right
00:04:20,00:04:21,Or the top layer
00:04:21,00:04:23,"And then you do the middle one, then you do the top one"
00:04:23,00:04:27,Remember when we went on only connect and they asked you for facts about yourself
00:04:27,00:04:30,And my fact was that I could do a Rubik's Cube in less than a minute
00:04:30,00:04:36,And the team that we were playing with apparently one of them said that he could do three Rubik's Cubes in 30 seconds
00:04:36,00:04:39,They decided they weren't going to use that fact
00:04:39,00:04:42,Made you look pretty foolish
00:04:42,00:04:49,"But it's huge, the speed cubing because we had to get a timer so that we could record my kids' times"
00:04:49,00:04:53,"And also my kids said ""Oh, can we have some Cubelube?"""
00:04:53,00:04:56,"And that's the moment that I was like ""I'm sorry"""
00:04:56,00:04:58,As a mother you've got to worry
00:04:58,00:04:59,Couldn't we have some Cubelube?
00:04:59,00:05:02,Is there a brand? Is it a specifically sold lube?
00:05:02,00:05:05,"There is one of the best Cubelube, we didn't get good Cubelube"
00:05:05,00:05:06,It's called Cubelube
00:05:06,00:05:08,"Yeah, we got dodgy Cubelube"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"And it's allowed as well, it's allowed in competition"
00:05:10,00:05:13,"It's legit, it's like chalk on your hands if you're an athlete"
00:05:13,00:05:14,Yes
00:05:14,00:05:18,"Well there's just a piece about the, you know, there are so many cubes, the world, there we go"
00:05:18,00:05:21,"But listen, the change has just completed the rubies"
00:05:21,00:05:23,That's why I've been silent for the last three minutes
00:05:23,00:05:26,But by the time I've edited this it'll be about twenty seconds
00:05:26,00:05:34,"And it just listed the GAN 356 iCarry, the MoU RS3M Maglev, the GAN 11M Pro"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"And it's all, there's kind of FIFA of cubing"
00:05:37,00:05:39,The World Cube Association
00:05:39,00:05:41,Are they corrupt?
00:05:41,00:05:44,"They're hugely corrupt, millions and millions of dollars change hands"
00:05:45,00:05:51,"So 1981, the top selling book in America was a book that was called The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube"
00:05:51,00:05:55,It sold six million copies and it was the number one book of the year
00:05:55,00:05:58,"It was massive, a guy called James G. Norris, he was a professor"
00:05:58,00:06:01,He did it as a pamphlet for his university and then someone saw it
00:06:01,00:06:04,Said can you expand that into a like sixty four page book
00:06:04,00:06:08,"So it wasn't that big, it was double the expansion of the pamphlet"
00:06:08,00:06:17,And so he published it and in it he gives categories of what you're labeled as as a cuber if you manage to do it in certain times
00:06:17,00:06:21,"So this is 1981, twenty minutes, if you did it in that time you were a whiz"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"Ten minutes, you were a speed demon"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"Five minutes, you were an expert"
00:06:25,00:06:28,"And three minutes, you were an emcee, the master of the cube"
00:06:28,00:06:29,"Oh that's what I am then, I can tell you"
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Yeah, you're a master of the cube"
00:06:30,00:06:33,Well in the 80s you were a famous person
00:06:33,00:06:36,It's actually been updated since 2013
00:06:36,00:06:37,You're now adult
00:06:37,00:06:39,"Yeah, unfortunately"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"Well you James, if you take longer than sixty seconds"
00:06:42,00:06:45,"I do, I take probably about a minute and a half first"
00:06:45,00:06:48,"Okay, I'm afraid you don't even qualify as a whiz at this point"
00:06:48,00:06:51,Whereas a whiz was twenty minutes it's now sixty seconds
00:06:51,00:06:54,Speed demon has gone from ten minutes to forty seconds
00:06:54,00:06:55,Oh my god
00:06:55,00:06:58,An expert has gone from five minutes to fifteen to twenty five seconds
00:06:58,00:07:01,And the master of the cube which is now called world champion
00:07:01,00:07:03,From three minutes to three to five seconds
00:07:03,00:07:05,That's amazing the difference isn't it
00:07:05,00:07:08,I can't even pick it up within three seconds
00:07:08,00:07:10,My old arthritic fingers
00:07:10,00:07:13,Because I remember the original crates in the 80s
00:07:13,00:07:15,I'm old enough for that
00:07:15,00:07:19,But it was one of those things that boys would learn to do
00:07:19,00:07:21,And this is a terrible sexist generalisation
00:07:21,00:07:24,But it did tend to be boys would learn to do it thinking it would really impress the girls
00:07:24,00:07:27,And all girls just went meh
00:07:27,00:07:30,I found that I've never ever pressed a girl with a Rubik's cube
00:07:30,00:07:34,I impressed the QI's accountant once
00:07:34,00:07:36,With a few Rubik's cube tricks
00:07:36,00:07:38,But he wasn't my type
00:07:38,00:07:40,I did because I brought mine in today
00:07:40,00:07:42,So I did sit on the tube doing it
00:07:42,00:07:45,And people don't look at you with admiration
00:07:45,00:07:46,I'll be honest
00:07:46,00:07:47,Really?
00:07:47,00:07:49,It's pity
00:07:49,00:07:52,"No honey, honey, we'll just have to get up at the next stop"
00:07:52,00:07:55,Is she gonna do it?
00:07:55,00:07:58,The craze just is unbelievable
00:07:58,00:07:59,The 80s craze
00:07:59,00:08:01,So it was the UK toy of the year in 1980
00:08:01,00:08:03,And then again in 1981
00:08:03,00:08:05,As if they just thought
00:08:05,00:08:07,We're gonna give it to the cube again
00:08:07,00:08:10,"So Dan, you were mentioning the books that sold out very well"
00:08:10,00:08:12,So at one point in 1982
00:08:12,00:08:15,I think it was four or five different books on the New York Times bestsellers list
00:08:15,00:08:17,For Rubik's cube books
00:08:17,00:08:20,There was a boy called Patrick Bossert
00:08:20,00:08:22,Who was 13 years old
00:08:22,00:08:24,And wrote a book called You Can Do the Cube
00:08:24,00:08:26,And sold nearly a million copies of it
00:08:26,00:08:29,He was the youngest ever author on the New York Times bestseller list
00:08:29,00:08:31,"It kind of came from nowhere, right?"
00:08:31,00:08:33,"Like Dan says, it was invented in 1974"
00:08:33,00:08:35,And this was 1980
00:08:35,00:08:37,In 1981 it was absolutely huge
00:08:37,00:08:39,I looked on the newspaper archives
00:08:39,00:08:40,And the first mention of it
00:08:40,00:08:42,It doesn't even call it the Rubik's cube
00:08:42,00:08:44,It calls it the Hungarian magic cube
00:08:44,00:08:46,This was in 1979
00:08:46,00:08:48,This was in The Observer
00:08:48,00:08:51,And they said that at first most people tried to take the cube apart
00:08:51,00:08:53,But that is not the object
00:08:53,00:08:56,And it said if you even get one face done
00:08:56,00:08:58,Of the cube in 20 minutes
00:08:58,00:08:59,Then you've done well
00:08:59,00:09:01,"And it says, but there are several people"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"Brackets, well at least three"
00:09:03,00:09:06,That are able to solve the cube in less than five minutes
00:09:06,00:09:10,"Dan, you mentioned that there are 43 quintillion different states"
00:09:10,00:09:12,That you can have
00:09:12,00:09:15,"The newspaper said, and this was in 1979"
00:09:15,00:09:17,At one per microsecond
00:09:17,00:09:20,"A computer would take around 3,000 million years"
00:09:20,00:09:22,Just to count up the number of states
00:09:22,00:09:25,And in 2022
00:09:25,00:09:28,We got the first ever quintillion per second computer
00:09:28,00:09:31,So today a computer could reach it in just under a minute
00:09:31,00:09:33,I think what's extraordinary
00:09:33,00:09:35,The numbers are so bamboozlingly big
00:09:35,00:09:38,I remember reading an interview with Erno Rubik
00:09:38,00:09:41,Where he was talking about the fact that he'd invented
00:09:41,00:09:43,More kinds of Rubik's cubes now
00:09:43,00:09:45,There was a Snake Rubik's cube that he'd invented
00:09:45,00:09:47,Did you buy that Lucy?
00:09:47,00:09:48,I did have it
00:09:48,00:09:51,"Rubik's snake, which sounds a bit dodgy now"
00:09:51,00:09:54,Why did they call it the Snake and not the Rubik's tube?
00:09:54,00:09:56,"Sorry, very nice"
00:09:56,00:10:00,But he said that and this one has potentially even more permutations
00:10:00,00:10:02,And the guy writing the article just went
00:10:02,00:10:06,"""Yeah, once you've hit 43 quintillion, I'm not impressed anymore"""
00:10:06,00:10:09,"But what's interesting, so very randomly"
00:10:09,00:10:12,Day before yesterday I bumped into
00:10:12,00:10:15,A Rubik's cube Guinness world record holder
00:10:15,00:10:17,He's a guy called George
00:10:17,00:10:19,"He holds two records, one which he's just done"
00:10:19,00:10:21,Which I'm not allowed to reveal
00:10:21,00:10:23,"I know, of course that"
00:10:23,00:10:26,"Rubik's cube Goss, I'll tell you guys after the show"
00:10:26,00:10:29,The other one is that he has the most Rubik's cubes
00:10:29,00:10:32,Solved while riding on a skateboard
00:10:32,00:10:34,"For, I think, like an hour or something"
00:10:34,00:10:37,He did like 500 of them just going around a skate park
00:10:37,00:10:39,"Quick question, Dan"
00:10:39,00:10:42,Did he have on him a bag of 500 Rubik's cubes
00:10:42,00:10:45,Which he then had to get out of the skateboard?
00:10:45,00:10:47,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
00:10:47,00:10:49,"It wasn't like Santa, yeah"
00:10:49,00:10:52,What he was was he had people stationed around the skate park
00:10:52,00:10:54,So he'd hand the solved one to the person
00:10:54,00:10:56,They would mix it back up and he'd grab a new one
00:10:56,00:10:58,As he was travelling around
00:10:58,00:11:00,So they mixed them back up again and so he used the same one
00:11:00,00:11:02,It feels kind of pointless
00:11:02,00:11:04,"It's like a punishment for the gods, actually"
00:11:04,00:11:06,"It is, it is, it is"
00:11:06,00:11:08,So he demonstrated one thing I found amazing
00:11:08,00:11:10,Which is to do with the bamboozling numbers
00:11:10,00:11:12,If I took this right now and I mixed this up
00:11:12,00:11:14,To give to him to solve
00:11:14,00:11:16,Whatever I've just done here
00:11:16,00:11:18,Is a combination that he will have never seen
00:11:18,00:11:20,In his life
00:11:20,00:11:22,The combination is unique because of the 43 quintillion
00:11:22,00:11:24,I just spent 2 and a half minutes in
00:11:24,00:11:30,I think what's extraordinary
00:11:30,00:11:32,Like when it started getting big
00:11:32,00:11:34,There was a big concern that is this thing solvable
00:11:34,00:11:36,So there was a world fair that he was taken to
00:11:36,00:11:38,And he's not a particular
00:11:38,00:11:40,He's quite a philosophical guy
00:11:40,00:11:42,He's quite sort of very serious
00:11:42,00:11:44,And he wasn't the best ambassador of what this item was
00:11:44,00:11:46,But they needed him there
00:11:46,00:11:48,To prove it could be solved
00:11:48,00:11:50,"Otherwise it was the Americans, wasn't it?"
00:11:50,00:11:52,"Yeah, they got sent to an American toy company"
00:11:52,00:11:54,And they thought this is a good toy
00:11:54,00:11:56,But it probably can't actually be done
00:11:56,00:11:58,And I think they sent an executive to Budapest
00:11:58,00:12:00,To meet Rubik
00:12:00,00:12:02,"If you can solve this, we'll make it"
00:12:02,00:12:04,We'll manufacture it and we'll distribute it
00:12:04,00:12:06,And then they sold 150 million in those 3 years
00:12:06,00:12:08,But they sold it thanks to the most famous
00:12:08,00:12:10,Hungarian at the time
00:12:10,00:12:12,So Rubik obviously couldn't really do all the press and stuff
00:12:12,00:12:14,Such a great question
00:12:14,00:12:16,I'm going chajagaboor
00:12:16,00:12:18,Was it?
00:12:18,00:12:20,"Absolutely, chajagaboor"
00:12:20,00:12:22,Rubik's Cube? That is not a Venn diagram
00:12:22,00:12:24,"Amazing, right?"
00:12:24,00:12:26,So this is the earliest mention of the actual phrase
00:12:26,00:12:28,Rubik's Cube I could find
00:12:28,00:12:30,This was from 1980
00:12:30,00:12:32,And chajagaboor had put on a party for the Rubik's Cube
00:12:32,00:12:34,Where she invited all of her Hollywood friends
00:12:34,00:12:36,Wow
00:12:36,00:12:38,With a buffet of Hungarian delicacies
00:12:38,00:12:40,"That said, but he didn't say what I supposed"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"Goulash, but I'm not sure what else was there"
00:12:42,00:12:44,Wow
00:12:44,00:12:46,Rubik's Cube was hired by the ideal toy
00:12:46,00:12:48,Corporation to promote
00:12:48,00:12:50,The Rubik's Cube
00:12:50,00:12:52,"As she said, even if you can't solve it"
00:12:52,00:12:54,The Cube feels so good in your hands
00:12:54,00:12:56,It may replace worry beads
00:12:56,00:12:58,"Oh, nice"
00:12:58,00:13:00,Like the original fidget spinner
00:13:00,00:13:02,Or like those new poppers
00:13:02,00:13:04,"That is true, if you do just play with the Rubik's Cube"
00:13:04,00:13:06,Even if you don't solve it
00:13:06,00:13:08,"It is fun to play with, isn't it?"
00:13:08,00:13:10,Especially if you've got Cube Lube
00:13:10,00:13:12,"Oh, it flies through your hand"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"You know, I told him from quite early"
00:13:14,00:13:16,And he said that children are better than adults
00:13:16,00:13:18,"Solving it, which would you agree with that, Lucy?"
00:13:18,00:13:20,"Yeah, my own anecdotal experience"
00:13:20,00:13:22,Who was saying all this? Was it Rubik?
00:13:22,00:13:24,That was Rubik saying that
00:13:24,00:13:26,He had a couple of reasons why he thought
00:13:26,00:13:28,That kids would be better
00:13:28,00:13:30,"More nimble, wrists"
00:13:30,00:13:32,I think purely physical terms
00:13:32,00:13:34,Smaller hands
00:13:34,00:13:36,I always think with technology
00:13:36,00:13:38,My kids will just pick up anything
00:13:38,00:13:40,"And go ""blah, blah, blah, blah"""
00:13:40,00:13:42,Whereas I am hovering
00:13:42,00:13:44,I am tempted to think
00:13:44,00:13:46,And I overthink it
00:13:46,00:13:48,Maybe there's an impulsiveness
00:13:48,00:13:50,"Yeah, I think overthinking"
00:13:50,00:13:52,Is kind of one thing he said
00:13:52,00:13:54,He said it requires a certain innocence
00:13:54,00:13:56,That children had
00:13:56,00:13:58,Because adults will try out a pattern
00:13:58,00:14:00,And it doesn't quite work out
00:14:00,00:14:02,And they'll just never do that again
00:14:02,00:14:04,Whereas kids will keep trying things
00:14:04,00:14:06,The thing is with the Rubik's Cube
00:14:06,00:14:08,It is all algorithms and it's just repeating things
00:14:08,00:14:10,And so kids are good at that
00:14:10,00:14:12,He also said that kids
00:14:12,00:14:14,And I think this is probably quite true
00:14:14,00:14:16,Is at certain kids anyway
00:14:16,00:14:18,Will get very absorbed with one thing
00:14:18,00:14:20,And won't let anything else distract them
00:14:20,00:14:22,Just kind of concentrate on it and do it
00:14:22,00:14:24,And the other thing he said
00:14:24,00:14:26,Is that kids have good visual memory
00:14:26,00:14:28,And that is true
00:14:28,00:14:30,Children can have much better visual
00:14:30,00:14:32,Until around 10 or 11 or 12
00:14:32,00:14:34,They have almost idetic memories
00:14:34,00:14:36,That they can just remember things really well
00:14:36,00:14:38,He didn't mention nimble fingers
00:14:38,00:14:40,It's weird
00:14:40,00:14:42,Cos I know Rubik was Hungarian
00:14:42,00:14:44,In 1981
00:14:44,00:14:46,The spokesman at the Hungarian Embassy in London
00:14:46,00:14:48,Said the cube is our secret weapon
00:14:48,00:14:50,To pacify the West
00:14:50,00:14:52,Wow
00:14:52,00:14:54,There was even a cartoon
00:14:54,00:14:56,Did you guys see the cartoon?
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Rubik's Cube, it's a sentient Rubik's Cube"
00:14:58,00:15:00,That is an alien
00:15:00,00:15:02,So great and it was a Rubik's Cube
00:15:02,00:15:04,That was completely useless if it was out of position
00:15:04,00:15:06,And that could happen quite easily
00:15:06,00:15:08,If a passing pigeon knocked it
00:15:08,00:15:10,And it would become useless
00:15:10,00:15:12,But if it was in its right sold state
00:15:12,00:15:14,It was this powerful sentient thing
00:15:14,00:15:16,Could he change?
00:15:16,00:15:18,Could he solve himself or did he require?
00:15:18,00:15:20,He required
00:15:20,00:15:22,So it's called Rubik the Amazing Cube
00:15:22,00:15:24,And it has
00:15:24,00:15:26,"I love it, his IMDB page has goofs"
00:15:26,00:15:28,One of the goofs is
00:15:28,00:15:30,Even in its sold state
00:15:30,00:15:32,The colours of Rubik are often in the wrong position
00:15:32,00:15:34,The light is always across from yellow
00:15:34,00:15:36,Correct?
00:15:36,00:15:38,So it says in many of its sold states
00:15:38,00:15:40,The colours are sitting next to each other
00:15:40,00:15:42,That shouldn't be
00:15:42,00:15:44,What a blue colour
00:15:44,00:15:46,But it was actually
00:15:46,00:15:48,It was not a long lasting series
00:15:48,00:15:50,But it was very much praised
00:15:50,00:15:52,It sounds like such a long lasting form though
00:15:52,00:15:56,The family that
00:15:56,00:15:58,When trusted with the sentient cube
00:15:58,00:16:00,Was a Latino family
00:16:00,00:16:02,That was shown on TV really back then
00:16:02,00:16:04,So it was a very progressive show
00:16:04,00:16:06,It was seen as a
00:16:06,00:16:08,It's nice to see a family who aren't white
00:16:08,00:16:10,It's the leads in a cartoon
00:16:10,00:16:12,Bring it back it's what I'm saying
00:16:12,00:16:14,They didn't announce a film in 2010
00:16:14,00:16:16,Which I'm not sure
00:16:16,00:16:18,They did that with loads of them didn't they?
00:16:18,00:16:20,Like loads of toys
00:16:20,00:16:22,And they made one or two battleships they made
00:16:22,00:16:24,Battleships got made
00:16:24,00:16:26,But they also announced Ridley Scott's Monopoly
00:16:26,00:16:28,Which I don't think
00:16:28,00:16:30,Happened unless I really missed it
00:16:30,00:16:32,But they're about to do Tetris as a big series
00:16:32,00:16:34,They're about to do a big Netflix series about Tetris
00:16:34,00:16:36,I think Guess Who
00:16:36,00:16:38,Would be a very good one
00:16:38,00:16:40,Very instantly recognisable characters
00:16:40,00:16:42,"A mystery, do you think like a mystery thing?"
00:16:42,00:16:44,Yeah
00:16:44,00:16:46,Did the suspect
00:16:46,00:16:48,Wear a hat
00:16:48,00:16:52,Weirdest follow up to Knives Out
00:16:52,00:16:56,Operation that would be another good one
00:16:56,00:16:58,"Operation, yeah"
00:16:58,00:17:00,Gruelling harrowing medical job
00:17:00,00:17:04,It's his funny bone
00:17:04,00:17:06,Let's get the tweezers
00:17:06,00:17:14,"Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:17:14,00:17:16,And that is Lucy
00:17:16,00:17:18,It is this fact
00:17:18,00:17:20,On at least three occasions in the last 16 years
00:17:20,00:17:22,The government of Shanghai has tried and failed
00:17:22,00:17:24,To stop people wearing pyjamas
00:17:24,00:17:26,Outdoors
00:17:26,00:17:28,Which seems
00:17:28,00:17:30,Famously Chinese authorities
00:17:30,00:17:32,Are so laissez-faire
00:17:32,00:17:36,The fact they've tried and failed is quite interesting
00:17:36,00:17:38,It doesn't say much for the all powerful machinery
00:17:38,00:17:40,Of the state
00:17:40,00:17:42,You can't even stop people wearing pyjamas out
00:17:42,00:17:44,I don't think they've sent the army in
00:17:44,00:17:46,They've just disapprovingly said
00:17:46,00:17:48,You shouldn't do this
00:17:48,00:17:50,They haven't really tried then
00:17:50,00:17:52,There's been several attempts
00:17:52,00:17:54,"It's quite a big thing, particularly in Shanghai"
00:17:54,00:17:56,For people to wear pyjamas
00:17:56,00:17:58,Out and about
00:17:58,00:18:00,They think it's partly because
00:18:00,00:18:02,In the early 20th century
00:18:02,00:18:04,It was a real status symbol to be able to
00:18:04,00:18:06,Afford imported pyjamas
00:18:06,00:18:08,So people would take to the streets
00:18:08,00:18:10,In their firing and are going look I can afford these
00:18:10,00:18:12,And slippers
00:18:12,00:18:14,They've got little teddy bears on them or whatever
00:18:14,00:18:16,And so it was sort of
00:18:16,00:18:18,A status symbol and then it's just become a thing
00:18:18,00:18:20,I mean I'm all into it
00:18:20,00:18:22,Because I wear pyjamas at all times
00:18:22,00:18:24,I'm doing a tour at the moment
00:18:24,00:18:26,In which I wear pyjamas so I'm very much on the side
00:18:26,00:18:28,On stage you're a pyjama
00:18:28,00:18:30,Because I decided during lockdown
00:18:30,00:18:32,There's nothing you can't
00:18:32,00:18:34,If I do a zoom and the other person is wearing something smart
00:18:34,00:18:36,I think you absolutely lose her
00:18:36,00:18:38,Why would you dress up
00:18:38,00:18:40,To have a meeting in your own home
00:18:40,00:18:42,Especially now you think if they're not wearing
00:18:42,00:18:44,Three layers and a blankie you think
00:18:44,00:18:46,Oh showing off you can afford heating
00:18:46,00:18:48,So what you're doing then is possibly
00:18:48,00:18:50,Doing in China as well
00:18:50,00:18:52,Which is you've got daytime pyjamas
00:18:52,00:18:54,And then you'll go home and you probably
00:18:54,00:18:56,Have nighttime pyjamas that you wear right
00:18:56,00:18:58,This is what they do in China so
00:18:58,00:19:00,These aren't the pyjamas they're waking up in
00:19:00,00:19:02,And just going out onto the street
00:19:02,00:19:04,They'll get out of their pyjamas to put on some pyjamas
00:19:04,00:19:06,To then go out into the street
00:19:06,00:19:08,Yeah they are the day wearer pyjamas
00:19:08,00:19:10,I can't say that for everyone but that's
00:19:10,00:19:12,For a lot of people
00:19:12,00:19:14,To be honest I would try and get away with
00:19:14,00:19:16,Going oh no these are my fancy pyjamas
00:19:16,00:19:18,No no I definitely didn't sleep in these
00:19:18,00:19:20,Definitely didn't
00:19:20,00:19:22,Have you ever done a school run or anything in your pyjamas Lucy
00:19:22,00:19:24,Well do you know I was on Five Live the other day
00:19:24,00:19:26,Because the Prime Minister's wife
00:19:26,00:19:28,Had gone and done the school run in her slippers
00:19:28,00:19:30,Except they were like five hundred
00:19:30,00:19:32,Pounds slippers
00:19:32,00:19:34,And Five Live phoned me up and said oh for our
00:19:34,00:19:36,Breakfast show tomorrow do you want to do a
00:19:36,00:19:38,Phoning about should you be allowed to wear
00:19:38,00:19:40,Slippers on the school run and of course
00:19:40,00:19:42,I'm desperate to promote my tours so I said yes
00:19:42,00:19:44,But the great thing was nobody cared
00:19:44,00:19:46,And it was one of those
00:19:46,00:19:48,It was lovely when you're part of a sort of
00:19:48,00:19:50,Supposedly controversial phoning that is not at all
00:19:50,00:19:50,Controversial
00:19:50,00:19:52,Did people just phone in and say I don't care
00:19:52,00:19:54,Yeah they just said well you can wear what you want
00:19:54,00:19:56,This is a tantrum do you know the most amazing radio phoning
00:19:56,00:19:58,I've ever heard
00:19:58,00:20:00,I was in a cab on the way somewhere or something
00:20:00,00:20:02,It was quite a long journey this was 2020
00:20:02,00:20:04,And it was if we get
00:20:04,00:20:06,A new royal yacht right
00:20:06,00:20:08,Should Prince Andrew be allowed
00:20:08,00:20:10,To go on it
00:20:10,00:20:12,There's not going to be a new royal yacht
00:20:12,00:20:14,Just not
00:20:14,00:20:16,And people had such strong opinions
00:20:16,00:20:18,This must have been in the first two months
00:20:18,00:20:20,Of 2020 I assume
00:20:20,00:20:22,It was yeah yeah
00:20:22,00:20:24,Events overtook
00:20:24,00:20:26,That one
00:20:26,00:20:28,Where do you stand on
00:20:28,00:20:30,Should Prince Andrew be allowed on the royal yacht
00:20:30,00:20:34,Oh god he's actually thinking about it
00:20:34,00:20:36,It's a tricky one isn't it
00:20:36,00:20:38,It's a taxpayer funded yacht
00:20:38,00:20:40,If they're buying their own yacht
00:20:40,00:20:42,I guess
00:20:42,00:20:44,But if I'm paying for this yacht
00:20:44,00:20:46,Yeah I think I am actually angry about it
00:20:46,00:20:48,I think I shouldn't be allowed to go on it
00:20:48,00:20:50,What if he's not allowed to come above decks
00:20:50,00:20:52,What if he's only allowed in the
00:20:52,00:20:54,I think he should be allowed to be in steerage
00:20:54,00:20:56,That's fine
00:20:56,00:20:58,You can't keep him hidden in a basement
00:20:58,00:21:00,You don't want to get on that yacht and discover Andrew
00:21:00,00:21:02,That's it
00:21:02,00:21:04,Oh god no
00:21:04,00:21:06,They used to use sign language on the old royal yacht
00:21:06,00:21:08,Yeah because they wanted to keep it quiet for the royals
00:21:08,00:21:10,And they had this complicated system of
00:21:10,00:21:12,Waving at each other
00:21:12,00:21:16,That's not typical BSL sign language
00:21:16,00:21:18,No sorry they had a royal yacht
00:21:18,00:21:20,Based hand language
00:21:20,00:21:22,Like the people on Ryanair
00:21:22,00:21:24,When they need a new tin of Pringles
00:21:24,00:21:26,They have a special sign that they make
00:21:26,00:21:28,The attendance
00:21:28,00:21:30,They have a secret sign language code
00:21:30,00:21:32,For whatever they've run out of
00:21:32,00:21:34,You'll notice it now next time you've got a flight
00:21:34,00:21:36,You can't wait
00:21:36,00:21:38,Paraboloid for a Pringle
00:21:38,00:21:40,I'm not party to the code
00:21:40,00:21:42,But I know that it exists
00:21:42,00:21:44,Like bookmakers
00:21:44,00:21:46,Bookmakers and the aircrew
00:21:46,00:21:48,Nice
00:21:48,00:21:50,I can get us back to pyjamas
00:21:50,00:21:52,The other thing they did on the royal yacht was
00:21:52,00:21:54,I think they wore soft sole shoes
00:21:54,00:21:56,The crew so they weren't stamping around the decks
00:21:56,00:21:58,And presumably infuriating Princess Margaret or something
00:21:58,00:22:00,So they had a specific
00:22:00,00:22:02,Well speaking of pyjamas
00:22:02,00:22:04,They did used to be
00:22:04,00:22:06,Outdoor things didn't they
00:22:06,00:22:08,Well they originated in
00:22:08,00:22:10,Like Persia
00:22:10,00:22:12,Ottoman Empire
00:22:12,00:22:14,And they were just basically
00:22:14,00:22:16,Loose fit trousers which you would tie around the waist
00:22:16,00:22:18,They were taken by the
00:22:18,00:22:20,Colonial British
00:22:20,00:22:22,And they realised that they were quite nice to sleep in
00:22:22,00:22:24,So that's how they became pyjamas
00:22:24,00:22:26,But Coco Chanel thought that we should wear them down the beach
00:22:26,00:22:28,And they became really fashionable
00:22:28,00:22:30,People wearing pyjamas down the beach
00:22:30,00:22:32,In the 1920s and 30s
00:22:32,00:22:34,Really? Yeah
00:22:34,00:22:36,There was a place called
00:22:36,00:22:38,"I don't know how to pronounce it, it's in France"
00:22:38,00:22:40,So it's J-U-A-N
00:22:40,00:22:42,I think it is
00:22:42,00:22:44,I think it's Huan Le Pan
00:22:44,00:22:46,I've seen it and not been able to pronounce it
00:22:46,00:22:48,It feels like Huan Le Pan
00:22:48,00:22:50,Feels like the nice way to say it
00:22:50,00:22:52,But it was called 'Pajamaland'
00:22:52,00:22:54,In English and 'Pajamapolis'
00:22:54,00:22:56,In French because there were so many people in pyjamas
00:22:56,00:22:58,On the beach in that town
00:22:58,00:23:00,I think it does come and go as a fashion
00:23:00,00:23:02,And there's pockets of it
00:23:02,00:23:04,I remember being in Cardiff for quite a long time
00:23:04,00:23:06,And there was one area of Cardiff
00:23:06,00:23:08,Where everybody went out in their pyjamas all the time
00:23:08,00:23:10,Is that right? Do they wear pyjamas
00:23:10,00:23:12,Or the ones they slept in?
00:23:12,00:23:14,I think sort of the ones they slept in
00:23:14,00:23:16,But it's a fine line between leisure wear
00:23:16,00:23:18,Shall I tell you about the various attempts
00:23:18,00:23:20,To shut down a pyjama wearing in China?
00:23:20,00:23:22,"Oh yes, yeah"
00:23:22,00:23:24,So in the 1990s
00:23:24,00:23:26,There was an education campaign
00:23:26,00:23:28,And they put signs up in Shanghai
00:23:28,00:23:30,Saying 'Please don't wear your pyjamas'
00:23:30,00:23:32,"2008, the Rixin neighbourhood"
00:23:32,00:23:34,In northeast Shanghai had a public campaign
00:23:34,00:23:36,Saying 'Don't wear your pyjamas'
00:23:36,00:23:38,"But then, 2020"
00:23:38,00:23:40,In Xuzhan city
00:23:40,00:23:42,Which is near to Shanghai
00:23:42,00:23:44,There was a social media post
00:23:44,00:23:46,Exposing uncivilised behaviour
00:23:46,00:23:48,Increasing the quality of residents
00:23:48,00:23:50,And the local government
00:23:50,00:23:52,Put out various pictures of people
00:23:52,00:23:54,Who were engaged in antisocial behaviour
00:23:54,00:23:56,Including seven people in pyjamas
00:23:56,00:23:58,And they used facial recognition technology
00:23:58,00:24:00,To find out who they were
00:24:00,00:24:02,And put their names up
00:24:02,00:24:04,"Which, what you need there"
00:24:04,00:24:06,Is you need pyjamas that have got some sort of balaclava
00:24:06,00:24:08,A sleep mask
00:24:08,00:24:10,A sleep mask exactly
00:24:10,00:24:12,"But yeah, it does seem extraordinary"
00:24:12,00:24:14,I think around the Shanghai World Expo
00:24:14,00:24:16,"In 2010 as well, there was quite a campaign"
00:24:16,00:24:18,To stop people wearing their pyjamas
00:24:18,00:24:20,"Yeah, that was a big one, wasn't it?"
00:24:20,00:24:22,The government at that one hired
00:24:22,00:24:24,500 members of the public
00:24:24,00:24:26,To volunteer to sort of stand at bus stops
00:24:26,00:24:28,"And just, just if someone in pyjamas came along"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"Go 'Hey, that looks daggy"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"You need a change out of that, mate?'"
00:24:32,00:24:34,"Yeah, 500 alties"
00:24:34,00:24:36,Do you know what kind of pyjamas
00:24:36,00:24:38,James Bond wears?
00:24:38,00:24:40,Or what he wears to bed?
00:24:40,00:24:42,Surely he doesn't wear anything
00:24:42,00:24:44,"I mean, because I don't think pyjamas are sexy"
00:24:44,00:24:46,Can they be sexy?
00:24:46,00:24:48,"Well, great point"
00:24:48,00:24:50,Because there are obviously fancy silk pyjamas
00:24:50,00:24:52,Which might be sexy
00:24:52,00:24:54,And the switch might not be
00:24:54,00:24:56,The pyjamas aren't sexy because they cling
00:24:56,00:24:58,Unless it's proper silk
00:24:58,00:25:00,"Yeah, silk"
00:25:00,00:25:02,That's a problem
00:25:02,00:25:04,All the balloons in the house
00:25:04,00:25:06,So Anthony Horowitz
00:25:06,00:25:08,Is a thriller writer
00:25:08,00:25:10,He writes lots and lots and lots of books
00:25:10,00:25:12,"And he, for a while, was the"
00:25:12,00:25:14,James Bond sequels
00:25:14,00:25:16,He was the official state's choice
00:25:16,00:25:18,And he wrote a couple of Bond books
00:25:18,00:25:20,And one of them was called Trigger Mortis
00:25:20,00:25:22,Great name
00:25:22,00:25:24,"And in the start of the book, in the opening chapter"
00:25:24,00:25:26,Anthony Horowitz wrote a description of Bond
00:25:26,00:25:28,"Jumping out of bed, naked"
00:25:28,00:25:30,And he sent this off to the flaming estate
00:25:30,00:25:32,"And they got back it up and they said, 'You can't have that'"
00:25:32,00:25:34,Because it's official Bond canon
00:25:34,00:25:36,"In one of the books, I can't remember which one it is"
00:25:36,00:25:38,I think it's 'You Only Live Twice' or something
00:25:38,00:25:40,Bond wears a bed jacket
00:25:40,00:25:42,Which is maybe the least sexy item
00:25:42,00:25:44,Of clothing you could possibly imagine
00:25:44,00:25:46,It kind of buttons up to the neck
00:25:46,00:25:48,And it goes down to the knees
00:25:48,00:25:50,The winky night shirt style
00:25:50,00:25:52,So he just rewrote it not saying that Bond was naked
00:25:52,00:25:54,He didn't describe the bed jacket
00:25:54,00:25:56,Because he thought that would be a way of destroying the character
00:25:56,00:25:58,Bond undid the top button of his night jacket
00:25:58,00:26:00,Bond hung up his night cap
00:26:00,00:26:02,On the side
00:26:02,00:26:04,He just imagine a little packet of Renny's in the pocket
00:26:04,00:26:06,"Oh, there's a hand key in there"
00:26:06,00:26:08,How long has that been in there for?
00:26:08,00:26:10,"Interestingly, for a very long time"
00:26:10,00:26:12,The classic trouser pajama
00:26:12,00:26:14,With the jacket button up kind of thing
00:26:14,00:26:16,"For a long time, worn by men"
00:26:16,00:26:18,And that changed during World War I
00:26:18,00:26:20,This is where women started wearing it
00:26:20,00:26:22,This is according to a professor
00:26:22,00:26:24,At the University of Glasgow called Lucy Whitmore
00:26:24,00:26:26,Who talked about the fact that zeppelin raids
00:26:26,00:26:28,Meant that whenever you heard the alarm
00:26:28,00:26:30,And you needed to run out of your house
00:26:30,00:26:32,It got to a point where
00:26:32,00:26:34,You became quite conscious of what you were wearing
00:26:34,00:26:36,You would come out in your nightie
00:26:36,00:26:38,You might look a bit dishevelled
00:26:38,00:26:40,And also it's not the most practical thing
00:26:40,00:26:42,To be running around in a nightie
00:26:42,00:26:44,"So to begin with, at the start of it"
00:26:44,00:26:46,It would be people would leave
00:26:46,00:26:48,Very nice looking jackets in a very good spot
00:26:48,00:26:50,So that as the raid was happening
00:26:50,00:26:52,And they would grab it and go out
00:26:52,00:26:54,And look fashionable
00:26:54,00:26:56,There was an old lady who suggested leaving
00:26:56,00:26:58,An emergency toupee by the door as well
00:26:58,00:27:00,So you could grab that on the way out
00:27:00,00:27:02,And then eventually people started wearing
00:27:02,00:27:04,Women rather started wearing pajamas
00:27:04,00:27:06,And the popular colour was dark blue
00:27:06,00:27:08,Because if you're outside
00:27:08,00:27:10,You obviously don't want any extras
00:27:10,00:27:12,Come on
00:27:12,00:27:14,You don't want to give away
00:27:14,00:27:16,I guess if you're being bombed
00:27:16,00:27:18,You want to do everything to stop yourself from being seen
00:27:18,00:27:20,Is that also why you need the toupee
00:27:20,00:27:22,To stop the bald head
00:27:22,00:27:24,And light reflecting back up
00:27:24,00:27:26,"Dan Widley, I found the same zeppelin based"
00:27:26,00:27:28,First World War fact in it
00:27:28,00:27:30,I went to the library and did a bit of research
00:27:30,00:27:32,There are a couple of books about the history of underclothes
00:27:32,00:27:34,And I sat there looking like a dirty old man
00:27:34,00:27:36,Sitting in the library
00:27:36,00:27:38,Or you did have your penis out
00:27:38,00:27:40,You should never
00:27:40,00:27:42,Believe me
00:27:42,00:27:44,But almost
00:27:44,00:27:46,Every page of the book had a
00:27:46,00:27:48,Line drawing of some corset
00:27:48,00:27:50,Or some girdle
00:27:50,00:27:52,Or something and I just started quickly flipping
00:27:52,00:27:54,"Through the line, I'm just here for the pyjamas"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"Actually, I want the least sexy stuff"
00:27:56,00:27:58,"Do you know what though, anyone looking at that would go"
00:27:58,00:28:00,That is the most adorable thing
00:28:00,00:28:02,If that's how you're getting your kicks
00:28:02,00:28:04,I'm looking at line drawings of ladies petticoats
00:28:04,00:28:08,It's not Andrew Tate
00:28:08,00:28:10,Let's be honest
00:28:10,00:28:14,And what did you find anything extra
00:28:14,00:28:16,On the underclothes
00:28:16,00:28:18,The onesie was sort of invented in that period
00:28:18,00:28:20,Wasn't it? We know Winston Churchill
00:28:20,00:28:22,He's still not wearing a onesie and that was
00:28:22,00:28:24,A World War one
00:28:24,00:28:26,He called his like a bilus
00:28:26,00:28:28,Siren suit
00:28:28,00:28:30,I think that was later
00:28:30,00:28:32,He meant siren suit because of the air raid sirens
00:28:32,00:28:34,I was thinking that he would sit on a rock and sing
00:28:36,00:28:38,Imagine if he had a lovely singing voice
00:28:38,00:28:40,We never really heard him sing
00:28:40,00:28:42,So I wanted to meet them on the beaches
00:28:42,00:28:46,We will seduce them on the beaches
00:28:46,00:28:50,Most men
00:28:50,00:28:52,Claim not to wear anything to bed
00:28:52,00:28:58,But you're doubting them
00:28:58,00:29:00,"Okay, interesting"
00:29:00,00:29:02,"I am doubting them, I think"
00:29:02,00:29:04,I think the dramas have a reputation of being a bit cosy
00:29:04,00:29:06,I think there is a sense
00:29:06,00:29:08,That men want to be thought of as being tough
00:29:08,00:29:10,And rugged and like I don't wear anything to bed
00:29:10,00:29:12,Even if it's minus four in the house or whatever
00:29:12,00:29:14,Is there not and now listen
00:29:14,00:29:16,I know nothing of the male anatomy
00:29:16,00:29:18,I'll put that right out there but is there not
00:29:18,00:29:20,Do things not get a bit twisted and I would
00:29:20,00:29:22,Imagine discomfort if you slept completely
00:29:22,00:29:24,"Naked as a man, do things not"
00:29:24,00:29:26,Is it not nice at all? Is it alright?
00:29:26,00:29:28,Is it alright? Good to know
00:29:28,00:29:30,"Good to know, thanks for that"
00:29:30,00:29:32,I've never been woken up by that
00:29:32,00:29:34,I've never twisted anything
00:29:34,00:29:36,It's got a trap under the bed again
00:29:36,00:29:42,Finally you're going to have to fold in the fibre game again
00:29:42,00:29:48,If you tried to leap out for an air raid
00:29:48,00:29:52,I feel like that was one of the weirdest moments
00:29:52,00:29:54,Ever on our podcast where you had
00:29:54,00:29:56,Three guys sitting here picturing ourselves
00:29:56,00:29:58,Naked in bed
00:29:58,00:30:00,There are four listeners now
00:30:00,00:30:02,The mental images
00:30:02,00:30:04,Please send in your fan art
00:30:04,00:30:12,"Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:30:12,00:30:14,And that is Andy
00:30:14,00:30:16,My fact is the flow of the Amazon
00:30:16,00:30:18,Is so big that even a hundred miles
00:30:18,00:30:20,Into the Atlantic you could
00:30:20,00:30:22,Drink over the side of your ship
00:30:22,00:30:24,And the water would still be fresh
00:30:24,00:30:26,"That's incredible, I love it"
00:30:26,00:30:28,I should tell where I got this fact first
00:30:28,00:30:30,It's called Thomas Pueyo on Twitter
00:30:30,00:30:34,I couldn't believe it when I first read it
00:30:34,00:30:36,So I did a bit more looking
00:30:36,00:30:38,Some sources say the water is going to be a bit brackish
00:30:38,00:30:40,It might not be totally
00:30:40,00:30:42,"Sparkling, Evian style fresh"
00:30:42,00:30:44,But it would definitely be noticeably less salty
00:30:44,00:30:46,So you would not be able to see South America
00:30:46,00:30:48,If you were a hundred miles out
00:30:48,00:30:50,And you would still get water that was much less salty
00:30:50,00:30:52,"If you were, let's say"
00:30:52,00:30:54,You were sailing across the ocean
00:30:54,00:30:56,Before you knew where you were
00:30:56,00:30:58,You could keep tasting the water
00:30:58,00:31:00,And as it got less and less salty
00:31:00,00:31:02,You could almost find your way to the shore
00:31:02,00:31:04,"What an incredible idea, yeah"
00:31:04,00:31:06,To navigate your way there
00:31:06,00:31:08,Sailors must have worked that out though
00:31:08,00:31:10,Because they're very wise
00:31:10,00:31:12,There will be some sort of sailor rhyme
00:31:12,00:31:14,Like if the water tastes nice
00:31:14,00:31:16,If the water tastes nice
00:31:16,00:31:18,Brazil will be in a trice
00:31:18,00:31:20,If the water tastes salty
00:31:20,00:31:22,Then your
00:31:22,00:31:24,Compass is faulty
00:31:24,00:31:26,There you go
00:31:26,00:31:28,So every single day
00:31:28,00:31:30,The water that we're talking about
00:31:30,00:31:32,That sort of pushes out
00:31:32,00:31:34,Into the Atlantic
00:31:34,00:31:36,It's 17 billion metric tonnes
00:31:36,00:31:38,Of water that flows out
00:31:38,00:31:40,It's hard to work out what that is
00:31:40,00:31:42,"What that equates to, if you were getting fresh water"
00:31:42,00:31:44,In New York City
00:31:44,00:31:46,That's the daily amount for nine years
00:31:46,00:31:48,That would be used
00:31:48,00:31:50,Nine years worth of fresh water in New York City
00:31:50,00:31:52,Is what goes out daily
00:31:52,00:31:54,In the Atlantic
00:31:54,00:31:56,They should move New York
00:31:56,00:31:58,I don't know if that's practical
00:31:58,00:32:00,But it's weird that we can't somehow
00:32:00,00:32:02,"Harvest it, it's just going"
00:32:02,00:32:04,It's just disappearing
00:32:04,00:32:06,Becoming salty
00:32:06,00:32:08,It goes into the water cycle
00:32:08,00:32:10,And eventually rains down on us
00:32:10,00:32:12,"Yeah, but we could use the planet alive"
00:32:12,00:32:14,I think we've done enough mucking around
00:32:14,00:32:16,"Actually, maybe we should just meet the Amazon"
00:32:16,00:32:18,"I actually disagree, I think a huge pike"
00:32:18,00:32:20,At the mouth of the Amazon
00:32:20,00:32:22,That just takes it all the way to New York
00:32:22,00:32:24,"Brilliant, not New York, but somewhere that needs fresh water"
00:32:24,00:32:26,There's lots of places where they don't have water
00:32:26,00:32:28,Somewhere closer
00:32:28,00:32:30,"Yeah, exactly"
00:32:30,00:32:32,New Orleans
00:32:32,00:32:34,I can't see it not working
00:32:34,00:32:36,"I'm just saying, it's a bit of a waste"
00:32:36,00:32:38,That's 17 billion metric tonnes
00:32:38,00:32:40,"It's a waste, I really don't think it's a waste"
00:32:40,00:32:42,Donald Trump listening to this
00:32:42,00:32:44,Is going to be diverted to his golf courses
00:32:48,00:32:50,"Anyway, the Amazon, it's big"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"It's big, it blows my mind"
00:32:52,00:32:54,My mate's got a new Brazilian girlfriend
00:32:54,00:32:56,"And he was saying, you know, you go to Brazil"
00:32:56,00:32:58,"It's just massive, mate"
00:32:58,00:33:00,It's just massive
00:33:00,00:33:02,The thing I always find interesting
00:33:02,00:33:04,About the Amazon is that you can't build bridges
00:33:04,00:33:06,Yeah
00:33:06,00:33:08,Because it's too
00:33:08,00:33:10,Because the width of it
00:33:10,00:33:12,Varies so much
00:33:12,00:33:14,"And it's so soft, crumbly at the edges"
00:33:14,00:33:16,So it would have to be such a massive bridge
00:33:16,00:33:18,Because it would have to start
00:33:18,00:33:20,"And so what, they just go across on boats and stuff"
00:33:20,00:33:22,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
00:33:22,00:33:24,I think they've built one now
00:33:24,00:33:26,"There is one, but it's right up at the north"
00:33:26,00:33:28,It's over a tributary
00:33:28,00:33:30,It's the Rio Negro
00:33:30,00:33:32,Which is a tributary of the Amazon
00:33:32,00:33:34,But it's before it joins the river proper
00:33:34,00:33:36,"Basically, so there are no bridges across the Amazon-Amazon"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"Like you say, Lucy"
00:33:38,00:33:40,"During the wet season, the Amazon"
00:33:40,00:33:42,Is 190 kilometres wide
00:33:42,00:33:44,But it's widest
00:33:44,00:33:46,That's why this is really wide
00:33:46,00:33:48,Imagine from here to Stoke
00:33:48,00:33:50,Maybe Stafford
00:33:50,00:33:52,"That's further, in fact"
00:33:52,00:33:54,My electric car wouldn't be able to drive
00:33:54,00:33:56,If there was a bridge that went over that net
00:33:56,00:33:58,They would have to be a charging point
00:33:58,00:34:00,On that bridge
00:34:00,00:34:02,Otherwise they wouldn't be able to get across
00:34:02,00:34:04,"God, it's that wide, that is insane"
00:34:04,00:34:06,I like that the Amazon River is part of
00:34:06,00:34:08,Effectively an Amazon River sandwich
00:34:08,00:34:10,It's the meat
00:34:10,00:34:12,Of a sandwich
00:34:12,00:34:14,In that
00:34:14,00:34:16,This is a tortured metaphor
00:34:16,00:34:18,I know what you're talking about and even I'm struggling
00:34:18,00:34:20,To come up with this
00:34:20,00:34:22,There's a river below it
00:34:22,00:34:24,And there's a river above it
00:34:24,00:34:26,There's more water above the Amazon River
00:34:26,00:34:28,In the clouds
00:34:28,00:34:30,Above the actual Amazon itself
00:34:30,00:34:32,The clouds follow the shape of the river
00:34:32,00:34:34,I believe so
00:34:34,00:34:36,"It's water vapor stream, isn't it?"
00:34:36,00:34:38,It's amazing
00:34:38,00:34:40,I think it's 20 billion tonnes of water
00:34:40,00:34:42,"Yeah, and that's more water"
00:34:42,00:34:44,Than it's actually in the river itself
00:34:44,00:34:46,They say
00:34:46,00:34:48,Isn't it something like a big tree
00:34:48,00:34:50,"In the Amazon, perspires"
00:34:50,00:34:52,Or transpires or whatever it is
00:34:52,00:34:54,A thousand litres of water in a day
00:34:54,00:34:56,One tree
00:34:56,00:34:58,And then underneath
00:34:58,00:35:00,You've got the Hamza
00:35:00,00:35:02,So secret underground river
00:35:02,00:35:04,You can only get to it
00:35:04,00:35:06,If you defeat an Aztec boss
00:35:06,00:35:08,On the final level
00:35:08,00:35:10,On the final level
00:35:10,00:35:12,So
00:35:12,00:35:14,Under the Amazon there is a sort of aquifer
00:35:14,00:35:16,That is even wider
00:35:16,00:35:18,Even bigger
00:35:18,00:35:20,"Even bolder, even fresher"
00:35:20,00:35:22,"It's Amazon 2, the revenge"
00:35:22,00:35:24,The River Hamza named after the
00:35:24,00:35:26,Strictly winner this year obviously
00:35:26,00:35:28,"Oh, not Abu Hamza"
00:35:28,00:35:30,It's got a big hook in it
00:35:30,00:35:32,Ranger Hamza
00:35:32,00:35:34,"It's quite recently discovered, isn't it?"
00:35:34,00:35:36,So Hamza was the name of the head of the team
00:35:36,00:35:38,"That discovered it, and it's"
00:35:38,00:35:40,Very low down
00:35:40,00:35:42,"4,000 metres below the river itself"
00:35:42,00:35:44,Super slow moving
00:35:44,00:35:46,To the point where you can't really call it a river
00:35:46,00:35:48,"Like, it's not flowing"
00:35:48,00:35:50,It moves at one millimetre an hour
00:35:50,00:35:52,I relate to this river very hard
00:35:52,00:35:54,"It's very slow, low down"
00:35:54,00:35:56,If you drop something in it
00:35:56,00:35:58,You'll be reunited with it quite quickly
00:35:58,00:36:00,It won't be swept away
00:36:00,00:36:02,Suddenly
00:36:02,00:36:04,"You game of poostics would be quite low stakes, wouldn't it?"
00:36:04,00:36:06,Exactly
00:36:06,00:36:08,The Giant Amazon Leech
00:36:08,00:36:10,Which you find in the Amazon River
00:36:10,00:36:12,Do you think it's longer or shorter
00:36:12,00:36:14,Than the world's longest
00:36:14,00:36:16,Cattail?
00:36:16,00:36:18,"No, I actually"
00:36:18,00:36:20,Know the length of the leech
00:36:20,00:36:22,But I have no idea about the world's longest cattail
00:36:22,00:36:24,That's the difficulty of this quiz question
00:36:24,00:36:26,You actually need two quite arcade bits of knowledge
00:36:26,00:36:28,To even make a guess
00:36:28,00:36:30,I think the longest cattail is not that long
00:36:30,00:36:32,Really?
00:36:32,00:36:34,It's a domestic cat
00:36:34,00:36:36,Here we go
00:36:36,00:36:38,I think the leech is about a forearm
00:36:38,00:36:40,I think it's about 18 inches
00:36:40,00:36:42,The biggest giant leech
00:36:42,00:36:44,The longest ever cattail is longer or shorter than 18 inches
00:36:44,00:36:46,This gives it away a bit
00:36:46,00:36:48,It's a Ferndale cat
00:36:48,00:36:50,"Well no, you've made it too easy"
00:36:50,00:36:52,I don't want to submit an answer anymore
00:36:52,00:36:54,Is it exactly the same length?
00:36:54,00:36:56,Andy is spot on with the 18 inches
00:36:56,00:36:58,For the Amazon Leech
00:36:58,00:37:00,And the longest cattail
00:37:00,00:37:02,According to Guinness
00:37:02,00:37:04,Is 17 inches
00:37:04,00:37:06,Do you think
00:37:06,00:37:08,That the giant Amazon Leech
00:37:08,00:37:10,Is longer or shorter
00:37:10,00:37:12,Than the height
00:37:12,00:37:14,Of the world's tallest donut
00:37:14,00:37:16,"Right, so"
00:37:16,00:37:18,It's good now we know we've got 18 inches
00:37:18,00:37:20,Put the donut down flat
00:37:20,00:37:22,So not the diameter
00:37:22,00:37:24,"Not the roundness, it's how tall it goes"
00:37:24,00:37:26,I think the donut's taller
00:37:26,00:37:28,"No, I think it's still the leech"
00:37:28,00:37:30,"Yeah, Andy knows his stuff"
00:37:30,00:37:32,"Tallest donut, 16 inches tall"
00:37:32,00:37:34,It was quite wide and fairness
00:37:34,00:37:36,"Yeah, but actually what's that foot and heart"
00:37:36,00:37:38,I mean that's a tall donut
00:37:38,00:37:40,I could eat that then
00:37:40,00:37:42,I want the world's biggest donut
00:37:42,00:37:44,To be a donut that I was like
00:37:44,00:37:46,I couldn't eat that
00:37:46,00:37:48,You could make lovely donuts that big
00:37:48,00:37:50,Or like the ring road of a small town
00:37:50,00:37:52,Exactly
00:37:52,00:37:54,Oh this is a great quiz
00:37:54,00:37:56,"Well I loved it, I had a great time"
00:37:56,00:37:58,So this is the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory
00:37:58,00:38:00,This is a cool thing
00:38:00,00:38:02,And it's a really new thing as well actually
00:38:02,00:38:04,So it's an observatory
00:38:04,00:38:06,But not a space observatory
00:38:06,00:38:08,It's to look down at the Amazon
00:38:08,00:38:10,And so it's in the middle of the rainforest
00:38:10,00:38:12,And the trees are
00:38:12,00:38:14,"What are tall trees, they're about 80 to 100 meters aren't they"
00:38:14,00:38:16,A good tall tree is up to
00:38:16,00:38:18,You know it's a really tall tree 100 meters
00:38:18,00:38:20,"And the tower, I think the tallest ever tree"
00:38:20,00:38:22,"Is about 120 meters, like the tallest ever measured"
00:38:22,00:38:24,But this tower is 325 meters
00:38:24,00:38:26,"Okay, it's about as tall as the Eiffel Tower"
00:38:26,00:38:28,Which actually is really tall when you look at it
00:38:28,00:38:30,The Eiffel Tower
00:38:30,00:38:32,Wow busting some myths today out me
00:38:32,00:38:34,I never think of it as tall
00:38:34,00:38:36,But actually I went there
00:38:36,00:38:38,"It's big, the Eiffel Tower"
00:38:38,00:38:40,You can see it from a long way away
00:38:40,00:38:42,"Exactly, and this is much thinner than the Eiffel Tower"
00:38:42,00:38:44,It's just one needle going up
00:38:44,00:38:46,It looks mad this thing
00:38:46,00:38:48,I was up the Eiffel Tower once
00:38:48,00:38:50,In a restaurant
00:38:50,00:38:52,And we had a table next to the window
00:38:52,00:38:54,"It was really nice, it was overlooking the bridge"
00:38:54,00:38:56,And what you would see is
00:38:56,00:38:58,They had these guys playing
00:38:58,00:39:00,You know we have three cups and you have to hide the ball
00:39:00,00:39:02,And just taking loads of money
00:39:02,00:39:04,And then about every 20 minutes the police would turn up
00:39:04,00:39:06,And they would leg it
00:39:06,00:39:08,And then you could watch them go all the way down the river
00:39:08,00:39:10,"Over the next bridge, back over again"
00:39:10,00:39:12,And then back on the bridge and then start playing again
00:39:12,00:39:14,And then the police would turn up
00:39:14,00:39:16,It was like a cat and mouse
00:39:16,00:39:18,I really thought you were going to say that from your perspective
00:39:18,00:39:20,You could see which carpet was under
00:39:20,00:39:22,I just yelled
00:39:22,00:39:24,"""Bettle on"""
00:39:24,00:39:26,Your wife's down there looking up
00:39:26,00:39:28,You've got special cup ball sign language
00:39:28,00:39:30,You've developed
00:39:30,00:39:32,How's they doing it?
00:39:32,00:39:34,We have never been fucked before
00:39:34,00:39:40,What's done in that restaurant too? We didn't get a window seat
00:39:40,00:39:42,"No, well you need to"
00:39:42,00:39:46,Are there tables where you don't have window seats?
00:39:46,00:39:48,You're just looking at a big piece of iron
00:39:48,00:39:50,[Laughter]
00:39:50,00:39:52,They really saw you coming
00:39:52,00:39:54,Was it on the ground floor?
00:39:54,00:39:56,Did you get the basement table?
00:39:56,00:39:58,[Laughter]
00:39:58,00:40:02,Didn't know Peter Express was it
00:40:02,00:40:04,France?
00:40:04,00:40:06,"Wow, oh that's funny"
00:40:06,00:40:08,Is the restaurant still going?
00:40:08,00:40:12,I didn't even get into the restaurant
00:40:12,00:40:14,"We need it, we'll go together"
00:40:14,00:40:16,I'd love that
00:40:16,00:40:18,"Oh yeah, this observatory is"
00:40:18,00:40:20,325 metres
00:40:20,00:40:22,It's one metre taller than the Eiffel Tower
00:40:22,00:40:24,And it's got 1500 steps up
00:40:24,00:40:26,And it takes about an hour
00:40:26,00:40:28,to walk up to the top
00:40:28,00:40:30,I don't know if there's a lift actually
00:40:30,00:40:32,And basically it's just to sniff
00:40:32,00:40:34,the breath of the forest
00:40:34,00:40:36,They're measuring all the chemicals in the air
00:40:36,00:40:38,Where there are forest fires
00:40:38,00:40:40,They measure the concentrations and how dangerous that is
00:40:40,00:40:42,Deforestation
00:40:42,00:40:44,They can tell things about that
00:40:44,00:40:46,I think it's amazing
00:40:46,00:40:48,Imagine you go up and you've forgotten your glasses
00:40:48,00:40:50,[Laughter]
00:40:50,00:40:52,I can't even see the guy with the cup and the ball
00:40:52,00:40:54,[Laughter]
00:40:54,00:41:00,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:41:00,00:41:02,And that is James
00:41:02,00:41:04,"OK, my fact this week"
00:41:04,00:41:06,is that while playing a psychiatric patient
00:41:06,00:41:08,in one flew over the cuckoo's nest
00:41:08,00:41:10,Danny DeVito ended up becoming
00:41:10,00:41:12,a psychiatric patient himself
00:41:12,00:41:14,[Groans]
00:41:14,00:41:16,Was he going method?
00:41:16,00:41:18,Some people did go method
00:41:18,00:41:20,We might get to that
00:41:20,00:41:22,But DeVito's problem
00:41:22,00:41:24,really is quite sweet actually
00:41:24,00:41:26,He had recently
00:41:26,00:41:28,gotten together with Rhea Perlman
00:41:28,00:41:30,The amazing Rhea Perlman
00:41:30,00:41:32,And cheers right? Just to put
00:41:32,00:41:34,her head in your
00:41:34,00:41:36,Carla can cheers
00:41:36,00:41:38,And obviously they were filming
00:41:38,00:41:40,or not obviously but they were filming a long way away
00:41:40,00:41:42,from where she was
00:41:42,00:41:44,3000 miles in fact
00:41:44,00:41:46,and so he was really missed her
00:41:46,00:41:48,and in order to deal with that separation
00:41:48,00:41:50,he invented an imaginary friend to talk to at night
00:41:50,00:41:52,and he became a little bit
00:41:52,00:41:54,concerned about his mental health
00:41:54,00:41:56,perhaps because they were making this film
00:41:56,00:41:58,and there was a lot of it in the air
00:41:58,00:42:00,and so he decided to see the doctor
00:42:00,00:42:02,on set who was called Dr. Brooks
00:42:02,00:42:04,and asked for his advice and Dr. Brooks said
00:42:04,00:42:06,yeah don't worry about it as long as you're aware that it's an imaginary friend
00:42:06,00:42:08,imaginary friend is a perfectly normal
00:42:08,00:42:10,thing to have it's no problem at all
00:42:10,00:42:12,But also that doctor
00:42:12,00:42:14,the on set doctor was actually
00:42:14,00:42:16,in the movie of course
00:42:16,00:42:18,Was he? It was the weirdest thing was there
00:42:18,00:42:20,But an amazing man because he owned
00:42:20,00:42:22,the clinic in which they filmed it
00:42:22,00:42:24,so it's no wonder they were all a little bit
00:42:24,00:42:26,stir crazy because they were in an actual mental institution
00:42:26,00:42:28,filming this very intense
00:42:28,00:42:30,movie
00:42:30,00:42:32,He's the one who sort of checks in
00:42:32,00:42:34,"Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy at the start of the film"
00:42:34,00:42:36,and interviews him and I think
00:42:36,00:42:38,I don't know if he was going to be in it
00:42:38,00:42:40,but he was really insistent that everyone in the institution
00:42:40,00:42:42,or the patients got involved with the film
00:42:42,00:42:44,"he was quite forward thinking, you know"
00:42:44,00:42:46,he took lots of the patients on expeditions
00:42:46,00:42:48,he took them white water rafting
00:42:48,00:42:50,and he taught them kind of to rappel down cliffs
00:42:50,00:42:52,"and things like, I mean really"
00:42:52,00:42:54,because this was in the 70s they were filming it
00:42:54,00:42:56,it was pretty progressive at the time
00:42:56,00:42:58,and I think about 90 inmates ended up involved in the film
00:42:58,00:43:00,in some capacity or another
00:43:00,00:43:02,I must say I haven't seen the film
00:43:02,00:43:04,It's pretty amazing
00:43:04,00:43:06,and I started reading the book this week
00:43:06,00:43:08,and got about a third of the way through
00:43:08,00:43:10,but I think the book's amazing
00:43:10,00:43:12,and apparently the film's even better
00:43:12,00:43:14,Tell you what was even better
00:43:14,00:43:16,it was a stage production
00:43:16,00:43:18,that was put on about 20 years ago
00:43:18,00:43:20,2004
00:43:20,00:43:22,I was in a stage production
00:43:22,00:43:24,Who were you?
00:43:24,00:43:26,Were you the giant
00:43:26,00:43:28,"Yes that's me, Chief Brompton"
00:43:28,00:43:30,that was me
00:43:30,00:43:32,"You know what though, so we did this basically"
00:43:32,00:43:34,it was Christian Slater
00:43:34,00:43:36,from Heather's etc
00:43:36,00:43:38,came over and was Mc Murphy
00:43:38,00:43:40,and it was amazing
00:43:40,00:43:42,because at that time there weren't that many
00:43:42,00:43:44,Western shows with big Hollywood stars
00:43:44,00:43:46,Mc Murphy being Jack Dawkins' role in the movie
00:43:46,00:43:48,"Exactly yes, the main guy"
00:43:48,00:43:50,and I played
00:43:50,00:43:52,I played a nurse who had about two lines
00:43:52,00:43:54,and some of my friends came to see it
00:43:54,00:43:56,"and they said, we just thought you were being modest"
00:43:56,00:43:58,because I said I'm playing a nurse
00:43:58,00:44:00,he mumbled over the cookie's nest
00:44:00,00:44:02,you were just being modest and you were playing nurse ratchet
00:44:02,00:44:04,but you really were just
00:44:04,00:44:06,a nurse who has two lines
00:44:06,00:44:08,because Francis Barber was nurse ratchet
00:44:08,00:44:10,and Mackenzie Crook was in it
00:44:10,00:44:12,Mackenzie Crook?
00:44:12,00:44:14,"He played Billy, the little shine"
00:44:14,00:44:16,That's a good role for him
00:44:16,00:44:18,Shall we super quickly just say what the basic premise is?
00:44:18,00:44:20,Just for anyone who hasn't seen it
00:44:20,00:44:22,it's a bit confused
00:44:22,00:44:24,Jack Nicholson
00:44:24,00:44:26,it's been so long
00:44:26,00:44:28,Jack Nicholson plays Mc Murphy
00:44:28,00:44:30,who is this sort of tear away
00:44:30,00:44:32,who is sent to this
00:44:32,00:44:34,secure psychiatric facility
00:44:34,00:44:36,which nurse ratchet is this
00:44:36,00:44:38,horrible nurse who
00:44:38,00:44:40,rules with the reign of terror over everybody
00:44:40,00:44:42,There is one nice nurse though
00:44:42,00:44:44,who just has a couple of lines
00:44:44,00:44:46,To star of
00:44:46,00:44:48,the entire production
00:44:48,00:44:50,is that nice nurse
00:44:50,00:44:52,and then the Indian chief
00:44:52,00:44:54,spoilers are we worried about that
00:44:54,00:44:56,I think it came out quite a long time ago
00:44:56,00:44:58,So anyway
00:44:58,00:45:00,Jack Nicholson creates this air of chaos
00:45:00,00:45:02,and rebellion in the place and rebels against
00:45:02,00:45:04,nurse ratchet and then the chief
00:45:04,00:45:06,"Brompton, the Native American chief"
00:45:06,00:45:08,smothers him with a pillow
00:45:08,00:45:10,We should maybe say that Jack Nicholson's character
00:45:10,00:45:12,suffers a lobotomy
00:45:12,00:45:14,not just the chief Brompton wants to restore
00:45:14,00:45:16,order in the hospital
00:45:16,00:45:18,It's a mercy killing
00:45:18,00:45:20,and the whole sort of thing is
00:45:20,00:45:22,"hey we're not mad, society's"
00:45:22,00:45:24,mad and
00:45:24,00:45:26,there's a bit of a book where
00:45:26,00:45:28,Murphy finds out that all the patients
00:45:28,00:45:30,"are allowed to leave if they want to, they just don't"
00:45:30,00:45:32,"He's incredibly freaked out by, he says"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"why don't you just go home, you're allowed"
00:45:34,00:45:36,and he says I'm not ready to
00:45:36,00:45:38,It's amazing anyway
00:45:38,00:45:40,It was a very tense filming experience
00:45:40,00:45:42,in lots of ways as well because you had a lot of big personalities
00:45:42,00:45:44,You had Ken Casey
00:45:44,00:45:46,who wrote the book and then ended up hating the film
00:45:46,00:45:48,never watched it
00:45:48,00:45:50,He once started watching it when it was just on TV
00:45:50,00:45:52,and then he realised what filming he was watching and changed channel
00:45:52,00:45:54,I love that
00:45:54,00:45:56,He was channel flipping
00:45:56,00:45:58,and he was like oh what's this
00:45:58,00:46:00,"This looks great, oh no"
00:46:00,00:46:02,And then so the director was
00:46:02,00:46:04,Milos Forman and Jack Nicholson
00:46:04,00:46:06,and Milos Forman had a big disagreement
00:46:06,00:46:08,about Murphy's character
00:46:08,00:46:10,and basically it's very ordered
00:46:10,00:46:12,and then Jack Nicholson arrives
00:46:12,00:46:14,and he turns the place upside down and
00:46:14,00:46:16,Milos Forman wanted it to be more like it was already chaotic
00:46:16,00:46:18,and then he arrives and he sort of draws
00:46:18,00:46:20,the patients together and they become a team
00:46:20,00:46:22,and there was a big falling out over there
00:46:22,00:46:24,and they ended up talking to each other through the cinematographer
00:46:24,00:46:26,so it would have to be kind of
00:46:26,00:46:28,Can you tell
00:46:28,00:46:30,Jack Nicholson to act this way
00:46:30,00:46:32,I mean it just sounds so tense
00:46:32,00:46:34,Danny DeVito as well
00:46:34,00:46:36,I'm a huge fan of Danny DeVito
00:46:36,00:46:38,and I remembered him as Lou
00:46:38,00:46:40,in Taxi
00:46:40,00:46:42,the sort of doer dispatcher
00:46:42,00:46:44,but when he was in Matilda
00:46:44,00:46:46,he actually played Matilda
00:46:46,00:46:48,although he was playing a horrible dad
00:46:48,00:46:50,but he actually became like a really lovely
00:46:50,00:46:52,father figure to her
00:46:52,00:46:54,and then you know in Mum Play with the Cuckoo's Nest
00:46:54,00:46:56,you could argue that he actually
00:46:56,00:46:58,was playing a sort of psychiatric patient
00:46:58,00:47:00,but he was taking care of his mental health
00:47:00,00:47:02,what I'm saying is he's always the opposite
00:47:02,00:47:04,of how he appears and actually
00:47:04,00:47:06,in Twins
00:47:06,00:47:08,if you put him and Arnold Schwarzenegger together he's taller
00:47:08,00:47:12,What a film
00:47:12,00:47:14,he was inducted
00:47:14,00:47:16,into the New Jersey Hall of Fame
00:47:16,00:47:18,in 2010
00:47:18,00:47:20,so I thought I'd look at some other people who are in
00:47:20,00:47:22,New Jersey Hall of Fame
00:47:22,00:47:24,so you've got Buzz Aldrin
00:47:24,00:47:26,Frank Sinatra
00:47:26,00:47:28,Do you have to be from New Jersey can I just ask
00:47:28,00:47:30,Well Thomas Edison is there born in Ohio
00:47:30,00:47:32,Yogi Berra born in Missouri
00:47:32,00:47:34,Harriet Tubman born in Maryland
00:47:34,00:47:36,and Albert Einstein
00:47:36,00:47:38,not even born in America
00:47:38,00:47:40,so we've all got a shot at the New Jersey Hall of Fame
00:47:40,00:47:42,proud son of New Jersey
00:47:42,00:47:44,I think you have to have lived there for a while
00:47:44,00:47:46,because Einstein worked in Princeton of course
00:47:46,00:47:50,that's great
00:47:50,00:47:52,on one from over
00:47:52,00:47:54,it was nearly defeated by the Cold War
00:47:54,00:47:56,it didn't get turned into a film because of the Iron Curtain
00:47:56,00:47:58,you know this
00:47:58,00:48:00,this is cool
00:48:00,00:48:02,so the book came out in the early 60s
00:48:02,00:48:04,and Michael Douglas
00:48:04,00:48:06,no sorry
00:48:06,00:48:08,Kirk Douglas bought the rights
00:48:08,00:48:10,he was in the play
00:48:10,00:48:12,he was in the first play version
00:48:12,00:48:14,based on the play not on the book
00:48:14,00:48:16,which is maybe why Ken Casey hated the film
00:48:16,00:48:18,so Kirk Douglas was the initial Mc Murphy
00:48:18,00:48:20,which is mad it's so strange for him to imagine now
00:48:20,00:48:22,because it's so Jack Nicholson's role
00:48:22,00:48:24,and then he bought the rights
00:48:24,00:48:26,and he wrote to Milos Forman in Czechoslovakia
00:48:26,00:48:28,and said got this great play
00:48:28,00:48:30,got the rights to where I think it should be a film
00:48:30,00:48:32,I'll send you a copy of the book
00:48:32,00:48:34,Milos Forman said great
00:48:34,00:48:36,the book was then seized by Czech Customs
00:48:36,00:48:38,in 1963
00:48:38,00:48:40,and Forman was really annoyed
00:48:40,00:48:42,because Milos Forman never said thank you for the book
00:48:42,00:48:44,rude
00:48:44,00:48:46,it took a decade to sort out
00:48:46,00:48:48,this misunderstanding between them
00:48:48,00:48:50,the film was made in something like 1975
00:48:50,00:48:52,I think
00:48:52,00:48:54,it took a long time
00:48:54,00:48:56,and eventually Kirk Douglas gave the rights to his son Michael
00:48:56,00:48:58,who then said
00:48:58,00:49:00,shall we just try again with this book thing
00:49:00,00:49:02,do we think that the Czech Customs
00:49:02,00:49:04,didn't let the book go initially
00:49:04,00:49:06,because they were worried
00:49:06,00:49:08,that it was seditious
00:49:08,00:49:10,maybe it's not clear
00:49:10,00:49:12,maybe they just wanted to read it
00:49:12,00:49:14,I was wondering if it was like the Rubik's Cube
00:49:14,00:49:16,going in the opposite direction
00:49:16,00:49:18,I have no idea
00:49:18,00:49:20,I don't know what their reasoning was
00:49:20,00:49:22,Kessie was quite notorious
00:49:22,00:49:24,as a LSD proponent
00:49:24,00:49:26,he was quite famous with the counterculture of America
00:49:26,00:49:28,at that point
00:49:28,00:49:30,he had a bus that he used to take everyone on
00:49:30,00:49:32,what a radical free thinker
00:49:32,00:49:34,it was a psychedelic bus
00:49:34,00:49:36,oh my god a multicoloured bus
00:49:36,00:49:38,we have those all the time
00:49:38,00:49:40,London buses are bright red
00:49:40,00:49:42,that's what it represented
00:49:42,00:49:44,they were called the Merry Pranksters
00:49:44,00:49:46,and Tom Warf wrote a whole book about this
00:49:46,00:49:48,it was a non-fiction book about these guys
00:49:48,00:49:50,who just would go around
00:49:50,00:49:52,they used to do things like
00:49:52,00:49:54,they would have people playing flutes on the top of the bus
00:49:54,00:49:56,who would feel buses where people have been playing the flute
00:49:56,00:49:58,were they on LSD?
00:49:58,00:50:00,just a public safety warning
00:50:00,00:50:02,do not take acid on a London bus
00:50:02,00:50:04,it's not a friendly environment to do that
00:50:04,00:50:06,but it is possible it was the counterculture thing
00:50:06,00:50:08,and his name was very much associated with that
00:50:08,00:50:10,it has a good point
00:50:10,00:50:12,it's interesting because he was an author
00:50:12,00:50:14,already at this point Kessie
00:50:14,00:50:16,before he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
00:50:16,00:50:18,and he was working on a book called Zoo
00:50:18,00:50:20,and in order to fund it he needed a job
00:50:20,00:50:22,so he worked at a psychiatric ward
00:50:22,00:50:24,in order to fund it
00:50:24,00:50:26,and the book idea came to him when one night he was in there
00:50:26,00:50:28,I think he was cleaning
00:50:28,00:50:30,and he was on peyote
00:50:30,00:50:32,and he was tripping and he saw a full-blown
00:50:32,00:50:34,Chief Broomden there
00:50:34,00:50:36,as a sort of vision
00:50:36,00:50:38,and a psychedelic part of his peyote
00:50:38,00:50:40,is it like a cactus or something?
00:50:40,00:50:42,yeah it's like a cactus which you
00:50:42,00:50:44,it's a drug
00:50:44,00:50:46,I know it is a word and I know it is a drug but I can't tell you the specifics
00:50:46,00:50:48,come on and do the big ol' squass
00:50:48,00:50:50,sorry not to hurt
00:50:50,00:50:52,but he said he saw a full-blown
00:50:52,00:50:54,"Native American, he said Indian"
00:50:54,00:50:56,"Chief Broom, the solution, the whole mothering key to the novel"
00:50:56,00:50:58,and that's how he wrote
00:50:58,00:51:00,the novel in the novel
00:51:00,00:51:02,and he's the main like the narrator
00:51:02,00:51:04,sorry and in the movie not
00:51:04,00:51:06,he's not and that's why Kessie
00:51:06,00:51:08,"immediately hated it, it wasn't told from the perspective of him"
00:51:08,00:51:10,he's a big character in it
00:51:10,00:51:12,but he's not
00:51:12,00:51:14,interestingly the guy who got the role of
00:51:14,00:51:16,Chief Broomden got it because
00:51:16,00:51:18,Michael Douglas was sitting next to a used car dealer
00:51:18,00:51:20,on a plane
00:51:20,00:51:22,and the used car dealer's dad was an acting agent
00:51:22,00:51:24,who had a load of Native American actors on his books
00:51:24,00:51:26,and the thing about Chief
00:51:26,00:51:28,Broomden is he's about eight feet tall
00:51:28,00:51:30,and Michael Douglas got a phone call saying
00:51:30,00:51:32,I just met the tallest Native American guy
00:51:32,00:51:34,you've ever seen
00:51:34,00:51:36,"and it was Will, something I can't remember his name"
00:51:36,00:51:38,anyway he got the role as Chief
00:51:38,00:51:40,Will Sampson
00:51:40,00:51:42,nice name for someone incredibly tall
00:51:42,00:51:44,and he's got long hair
00:51:44,00:51:46,so this movie was made
00:51:46,00:51:48,in an actual as we've said
00:51:48,00:51:50,hospital
00:51:50,00:51:52,that was originally it was called
00:51:52,00:51:54,the Oregon State Mental Hospital
00:51:54,00:51:56,it's since been renamed as now
00:51:56,00:51:58,Oregon State Hospital
00:51:58,00:52:00,and it's an interesting place
00:52:00,00:52:02,"in its own right, it had"
00:52:02,00:52:04,a really controversial bit
00:52:04,00:52:06,"which was they found 5,000 canisters"
00:52:06,00:52:08,of unclaimed human remains in there
00:52:08,00:52:10,and this was a lot of the patients
00:52:10,00:52:12,who had been cremated but no one
00:52:12,00:52:14,had come to collect them
00:52:14,00:52:16,"and they put out the list, they found all the names of the people"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"and a lot of relatives, distant relatives"
00:52:18,00:52:20,came and reclaimed them
00:52:20,00:52:22,and there was a documentary called
00:52:22,00:52:24,"""Lust"" that was made about it"
00:52:24,00:52:26,it was pretty mad
00:52:26,00:52:28,but also they had a railroad
00:52:28,00:52:30,underneath the hospital
00:52:30,00:52:32,specifically built one so that they could deliver
00:52:32,00:52:34,items to different bits of the hospital
00:52:34,00:52:36,but also to transport patients
00:52:36,00:52:38,that they didn't want the members of the public
00:52:38,00:52:40,to have to come across if they were visiting the hospital
00:52:40,00:52:42,because they were worried something might go wrong
00:52:42,00:52:44,"dangerous, you know, all that sort of stuff"
00:52:44,00:52:46,and some of the tunnels possibly are still there
00:52:46,00:52:48,but you just walk them now or use bicycles
00:52:48,00:52:50,it's just Prince Andrew
00:52:50,00:52:52,in there now
00:52:52,00:52:56,and then they had a horrible thing
00:52:56,00:52:58,I found just horrible things about it
00:52:58,00:53:00,"unfortunately, 1942"
00:53:00,00:53:02,there was a mass poisoning by accident
00:53:02,00:53:04,they were serving scrambled eggs
00:53:04,00:53:06,and 47 people died from this
00:53:06,00:53:08,they used
00:53:08,00:53:10,instead of powdered milk
00:53:10,00:53:12,they used sodium fluoride
00:53:12,00:53:14,which is a poison you would use to kill cockroaches
00:53:14,00:53:16,and that was accidentally added to the scrambled eggs
00:53:16,00:53:18,and 47 died from that
00:53:18,00:53:20,in a kitchen
00:53:20,00:53:22,we had a Christmas party
00:53:22,00:53:24,and instead of putting white sauce
00:53:24,00:53:26,"on the Christmas pudding, they put garlic sauce on"
00:53:26,00:53:28,which is a very
00:53:28,00:53:30,less problematic version
00:53:30,00:53:32,of what you just said
00:53:32,00:53:34,it's good to know you can relate
00:53:34,00:53:38,"I mean, just saying it's easily done"
00:53:38,00:53:40,"yeah, it's easily done"
00:53:40,00:53:42,I want to use cube lube
00:53:42,00:53:44,instead of
00:53:44,00:53:46,instead of what?
00:53:46,00:53:48,"it twisted sideways, didn't it?"
00:53:48,00:53:56,should we just quickly mention Louise Fletcher
00:53:56,00:53:58,she played Nurse Fletcher
00:53:58,00:54:00,in the film and died last year sadly
00:54:00,00:54:02,but she was
00:54:02,00:54:04,amazing and she
00:54:04,00:54:06,I think she kept herself separate from the rest of the cast
00:54:06,00:54:08,"didn't she, for a lot of the filming"
00:54:08,00:54:10,so that she could be an icy
00:54:10,00:54:12,authority figure
00:54:12,00:54:14,and did you do that when you were in the play of Lucy?
00:54:14,00:54:16,she was an icy authority figure
00:54:16,00:54:18,in every situation
00:54:18,00:54:20,didn't she also take all the clothes off though
00:54:20,00:54:22,at one point
00:54:22,00:54:24,"at the end of filming, wasn't it?"
00:54:24,00:54:26,"yeah, she'd go hey guys"
00:54:26,00:54:28,"look at this, all along I was fun"
00:54:28,00:54:30,it was her saying
00:54:30,00:54:32,"I'm fun, that's right"
00:54:32,00:54:34,I think she had her underwear on
00:54:34,00:54:36,I don't think she was fully naked
00:54:36,00:54:38,she wasn't that much fun
00:54:38,00:54:40,"I'm fun, but I'm not like fun"
00:54:40,00:54:42,there must be a better way
00:54:42,00:54:44,to have cupcakes
00:54:44,00:54:46,to ingratiate yourself with their colleagues
00:54:46,00:54:48,just wait till the end of this podcast
00:54:48,00:54:52,there were two others
00:54:52,00:54:54,Anne Bancroft and Angela Lansbury
00:54:54,00:54:56,were both offered the role but turned it down
00:54:56,00:54:58,because they didn't want to appear so evil on screen
00:54:58,00:55:00,wow
00:55:00,00:55:02,this was in a no-bituary of Louise Fletcher that I read
00:55:02,00:55:04,and also
00:55:04,00:55:06,she was repeatedly turned down from roles
00:55:06,00:55:08,because she was 5 foot 10
00:55:08,00:55:10,and in those days a lot of the leading men
00:55:10,00:55:12,were much shorter than that
00:55:12,00:55:14,and she couldn't play roles opposite people
00:55:14,00:55:16,who were shorter or about the same height
00:55:16,00:55:18,and actually in the nurses' cap
00:55:18,00:55:20,she'll be more than 6 foot
00:55:20,00:55:22,and Jack Nilsson is quite a short guy
00:55:22,00:55:24,but it really works for the authority
00:55:24,00:55:26,for the sort of power struggle happening between them
00:55:26,00:55:28,she's brilliant
00:55:28,00:55:30,on Star Trek
00:55:30,00:55:32,"yeah, that's right"
00:55:32,00:55:34,she said that she found
00:55:34,00:55:36,her role so disturbing
00:55:36,00:55:38,that she also couldn't watch the film
00:55:38,00:55:40,on Star Trek
00:55:40,00:55:42,yeah
00:55:42,00:55:44,aliens are scary
00:55:44,00:55:46,"did she, as Nurse Ratchet"
00:55:46,00:55:48,she found it really hard
00:55:48,00:55:50,and she just found it too disturbing
00:55:50,00:55:52,to watch as a role
00:55:52,00:55:54,actually the last time I watched it
00:55:54,00:55:56,"which was a couple of years ago, the person I was watching it with"
00:55:56,00:55:58,sided with Nurse Ratchet
00:55:58,00:56:00,"which didn't make me think, no, hang on"
00:56:00,00:56:02,you've taken the wrong message there
00:56:02,00:56:04,"and she said, no, no, no, look, the point is"
00:56:04,00:56:06,someone's got to keep order
00:56:06,00:56:08,just take a job from where he was running the place
00:56:08,00:56:10,it would be an absolute mayhem
00:56:10,00:56:12,one last thing just about Ken Cassie
00:56:12,00:56:14,"the author, because he was a pretty amazing author"
00:56:14,00:56:16,his method for a certain period when he was writing
00:56:16,00:56:18,was to be completely
00:56:18,00:56:20,off his head on drugs
00:56:20,00:56:22,and he would write a crazy amount
00:56:22,00:56:24,"then in the morning, he'd sober up and become his own editor"
00:56:24,00:56:26,"so he'd sort of say, okay"
00:56:26,00:56:28,let's see what the author's written
00:56:28,00:56:30,and chop out all the junk
00:56:30,00:56:32,and get down to the good meat of it
00:56:32,00:56:34,"wow, that's clever"
00:56:34,00:56:36,apart from presumably the first draft was absolute junk
00:56:36,00:56:38,shit
00:56:38,00:56:40,just didn't make any sense at all
00:56:40,00:56:42,"and then you'd think, hang on"
00:56:42,00:56:44,what if the editor was drunk as well
00:56:44,00:56:46,but I'll do different drugs
00:56:46,00:56:48,then I'll make the copy editor will be sober
00:56:48,00:56:50,so that'll be fine
00:56:50,00:56:52,"okay, as long as the printer is sober"
00:56:52,00:56:54,it'll be fine
00:56:54,00:57:00,"okay, that's it"
00:57:00,00:57:02,"that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening"
