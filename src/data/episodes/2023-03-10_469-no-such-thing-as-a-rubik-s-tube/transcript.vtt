00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.040
 Hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish we have another very special guest for you today and

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.760
 That guest is our very good friend Lucy Porter. You will remember Lucy from previous episodes on fish

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.760
 I know you'll love her. She's so smart. She's so funny

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.200
 In fact, she's got a stand-up show that is touring at this very moment

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.920
 Which is called wake up call and really I'll be honest the best way to find out about that is to Google

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.500
 Lucy Porter wake up call and you'll find all the dates, but she's doing the whole of the UK

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.300
 It's definitely a show that's worth going to see. She also has a podcast called fingers on buzzers

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 It's all about quizzing and she does that with my very good old friend Jenny Ryan

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.440
 It's a brilliant podcast so listen to that and she has a radio for stand-up special called Lucy Porter's lucky dip

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.720
 Which is going out at 11 30 on March the 15th

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.980
 It'll probably be on the BBC sounds app after that so again Google Lucy Potter's lucky dip and you'll find that and apart from that

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.880
 Just enjoy the show so nothing more to say apart from on with the podcast on with the show. Oh hi Andy. I've been here the whole time

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin and Lucy Porter

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.940
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.920
 We go starting with fact number one and that is my fact

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.720
 My fact this week is that it took the creator of the Rubik's Cube a month to solve it the first time he tried

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:02.120
 It's so crazy you I would have thought after about 20 or 30 days you would just make a new one

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.480
 So yeah invented 1974 he was a professor and he just had this idea

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.640
 What if I could make something that was static on the inside but fluid on the outside and that's what gave him the idea and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.220
 He had a bash it it's later been worked out quite a famous number if you know Rubik's cubes that 43

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.080
 Quintillion is the number of permutations that you can make on the Rubik's Cube

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.760
 And so luckily he got there within a month. Yeah, it's pretty good. Well, I'll tell you what's weird. His prototype

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.960
 Wasn't three by three. His prototype was two by two. So I've got that took him a month

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.040
 That's the thing. Well, I'm curious to know if this is the one that took him a month because this is okay

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.600
 So Dan's showing us an image and it's like four wooden blocks

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.720
 That I've got various colors and numbers on it and they're held together almost by bits of wire

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.320
 Yeah, there's a wire meshing inside and he took a month to do a Rubik's Cube

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.120
 Yeah, that one's piss easy. Yeah, it's clever enough to make that you're clever enough to solve it. Yes

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440
 You can do a Rubik's Cube, James. I can I think you can Lucy

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.560
 Well, I am yeah, my children obsessed with them

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.240
 We've got hundreds in the house and all those weird one, you know

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.360
 There's like weird different shaped ones and mirror ones where there's absolutely, you know

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.800
 Colors on it and stuff. So this is a long way of me saying I should be

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360
 And I have at one point

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.360
 That one's tough because it's got like Dan's mixing up one from the Transport Museum

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 I'd rather do the one with the colors

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.520
 But the other thing is about the Rubik's Cube is that I find that when you're under pressure

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.600
 It's almost impossible. Yes, because you do it kind of with muscle memory

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.400
 Yes, and then as soon as you start thinking about it, you can't really do it at all

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.960
 Yeah

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.040
 I made a terrible decision when because I did learn to do it when my kids got into it and then I

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.560
 Decided we were doing a live podcast recording of fingers on buzzers and I said, oh, I tell you what'll be fun

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.320
 I'll solve a Rubik's Cube while we do this round, and it took about 15 minutes

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.320
 Is there an algorithm basically? It's like a set pattern of moves that will help you work on the side you're working on

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.320
 So layers, that's the key

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.320
 Yeah, exactly so

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 It's layers not sides, so you can see at the moment that I've done the bottom layer

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320
 Right

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.320
 Or the top layer

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.320
 And then you do the middle one, then you do the top one

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.320
 Remember when we went on only connect and they asked you for facts about yourself

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 And my fact was that I could do a Rubik's Cube in less than a minute

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 And the team that we were playing with apparently one of them said that he could do three Rubik's Cubes in 30 seconds

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.320
 They decided they weren't going to use that fact

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.320
 Made you look pretty foolish

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.320
 But it's huge, the speed cubing because we had to get a timer so that we could record my kids' times

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.320
 And also my kids said "Oh, can we have some Cubelube?"

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.320
 And that's the moment that I was like "I'm sorry"

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.320
 As a mother you've got to worry

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 Couldn't we have some Cubelube?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.320
 Is there a brand? Is it a specifically sold lube?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.320
 There is one of the best Cubelube, we didn't get good Cubelube

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320
 It's called Cubelube

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.320
 Yeah, we got dodgy Cubelube

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320
 And it's allowed as well, it's allowed in competition

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.320
 It's legit, it's like chalk on your hands if you're an athlete

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320
 Yes

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.320
 Well there's just a piece about the, you know, there are so many cubes, the world, there we go

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.320
 But listen, the change has just completed the rubies

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.320
 That's why I've been silent for the last three minutes

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.320
 But by the time I've edited this it'll be about twenty seconds

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.320
 And it just listed the GAN 356 iCarry, the MoU RS3M Maglev, the GAN 11M Pro

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.320
 And it's all, there's kind of FIFA of cubing

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320
 The World Cube Association

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.320
 Are they corrupt?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.320
 They're hugely corrupt, millions and millions of dollars change hands

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.320
 So 1981, the top selling book in America was a book that was called The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.320
 It sold six million copies and it was the number one book of the year

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.320
 It was massive, a guy called James G. Norris, he was a professor

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.320
 He did it as a pamphlet for his university and then someone saw it

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.320
 Said can you expand that into a like sixty four page book

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.320
 So it wasn't that big, it was double the expansion of the pamphlet

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 And so he published it and in it he gives categories of what you're labeled as as a cuber if you manage to do it in certain times

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.320
 So this is 1981, twenty minutes, if you did it in that time you were a whiz

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.320
 Ten minutes, you were a speed demon

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320
 Five minutes, you were an expert

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.320
 And three minutes, you were an emcee, the master of the cube

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320
 Oh that's what I am then, I can tell you

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320
 Yeah, you're a master of the cube

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.320
 Well in the 80s you were a famous person

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.320
 It's actually been updated since 2013

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320
 You're now adult

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 Yeah, unfortunately

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.320
 Well you James, if you take longer than sixty seconds

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.320
 I do, I take probably about a minute and a half first

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.320
 Okay, I'm afraid you don't even qualify as a whiz at this point

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.320
 Whereas a whiz was twenty minutes it's now sixty seconds

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.320
 Speed demon has gone from ten minutes to forty seconds

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320
 Oh my god

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.320
 An expert has gone from five minutes to fifteen to twenty five seconds

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.320
 And the master of the cube which is now called world champion

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320
 From three minutes to three to five seconds

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.320
 That's amazing the difference isn't it

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.320
 I can't even pick it up within three seconds

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.320
 My old arthritic fingers

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.320
 Because I remember the original crates in the 80s

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.320
 I'm old enough for that

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.320
 But it was one of those things that boys would learn to do

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.320
 And this is a terrible sexist generalisation

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.320
 But it did tend to be boys would learn to do it thinking it would really impress the girls

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.320
 And all girls just went meh

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.320
 I found that I've never ever pressed a girl with a Rubik's cube

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.320
 I impressed the QI's accountant once

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.320
 With a few Rubik's cube tricks

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.320
 But he wasn't my type

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.320
 I did because I brought mine in today

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.320
 So I did sit on the tube doing it

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.320
 And people don't look at you with admiration

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320
 I'll be honest

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.320
 Really?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.320
 It's pity

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.320
 No honey, honey, we'll just have to get up at the next stop

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.320
 Is she gonna do it?

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.320
 The craze just is unbelievable

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320
 The 80s craze

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.320
 So it was the UK toy of the year in 1980

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.320
 And then again in 1981

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.320
 As if they just thought

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.320
 We're gonna give it to the cube again

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.320
 So Dan, you were mentioning the books that sold out very well

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.320
 So at one point in 1982

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.320
 I think it was four or five different books on the New York Times bestsellers list

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.320
 For Rubik's cube books

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.320
 There was a boy called Patrick Bossert

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.320
 Who was 13 years old

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320
 And wrote a book called You Can Do the Cube

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.320
 And sold nearly a million copies of it

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.320
 He was the youngest ever author on the New York Times bestseller list

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.320
 It kind of came from nowhere, right?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320
 Like Dan says, it was invented in 1974

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.320
 And this was 1980

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.320
 In 1981 it was absolutely huge

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.320
 I looked on the newspaper archives

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320
 And the first mention of it

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.320
 It doesn't even call it the Rubik's cube

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320
 It calls it the Hungarian magic cube

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320
 This was in 1979

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.320
 This was in The Observer

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.320
 And they said that at first most people tried to take the cube apart

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.320
 But that is not the object

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.320
 And it said if you even get one face done

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.320
 Of the cube in 20 minutes

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.320
 Then you've done well

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.320
 And it says, but there are several people

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.320
 Brackets, well at least three

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.320
 That are able to solve the cube in less than five minutes

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.320
 Dan, you mentioned that there are 43 quintillion different states

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320
 That you can have

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.320
 The newspaper said, and this was in 1979

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 At one per microsecond

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.320
 A computer would take around 3,000 million years

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.320
 Just to count up the number of states

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.320
 And in 2022

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.320
 We got the first ever quintillion per second computer

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.320
 So today a computer could reach it in just under a minute

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320
 I think what's extraordinary

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.320
 The numbers are so bamboozlingly big

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.320
 I remember reading an interview with Erno Rubik

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.320
 Where he was talking about the fact that he'd invented

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.320
 More kinds of Rubik's cubes now

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.320
 There was a Snake Rubik's cube that he'd invented

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.320
 Did you buy that Lucy?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320
 I did have it

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.320
 Rubik's snake, which sounds a bit dodgy now

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.320
 Why did they call it the Snake and not the Rubik's tube?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.320
 Sorry, very nice

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.320
 But he said that and this one has potentially even more permutations

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320
 And the guy writing the article just went

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.320
 "Yeah, once you've hit 43 quintillion, I'm not impressed anymore"

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.320
 But what's interesting, so very randomly

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.320
 Day before yesterday I bumped into

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.320
 A Rubik's cube Guinness world record holder

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.320
 He's a guy called George

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.320
 He holds two records, one which he's just done

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.320
 Which I'm not allowed to reveal

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.320
 I know, of course that

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.320
 Rubik's cube Goss, I'll tell you guys after the show

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.320
 The other one is that he has the most Rubik's cubes

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.320
 Solved while riding on a skateboard

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.320
 For, I think, like an hour or something

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.320
 He did like 500 of them just going around a skate park

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.320
 Quick question, Dan

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 Did he have on him a bag of 500 Rubik's cubes

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.320
 Which he then had to get out of the skateboard?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320
 It wasn't like Santa, yeah

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.320
 What he was was he had people stationed around the skate park

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.320
 So he'd hand the solved one to the person

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.320
 They would mix it back up and he'd grab a new one

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.320
 As he was travelling around

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.320
 So they mixed them back up again and so he used the same one

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.320
 It feels kind of pointless

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.320
 It's like a punishment for the gods, actually

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.320
 It is, it is, it is

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320
 So he demonstrated one thing I found amazing

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.320
 Which is to do with the bamboozling numbers

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.320
 If I took this right now and I mixed this up

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.320
 To give to him to solve

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.320
 Whatever I've just done here

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.320
 Is a combination that he will have never seen

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.320
 In his life

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.320
 The combination is unique because of the 43 quintillion

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.320
 I just spent 2 and a half minutes in

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.320
 I think what's extraordinary

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.320
 Like when it started getting big

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.320
 There was a big concern that is this thing solvable

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.320
 So there was a world fair that he was taken to

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.320
 And he's not a particular

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.320
 He's quite a philosophical guy

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.320
 He's quite sort of very serious

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.320
 And he wasn't the best ambassador of what this item was

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.320
 But they needed him there

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.320
 To prove it could be solved

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.320
 Otherwise it was the Americans, wasn't it?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.320
 Yeah, they got sent to an American toy company

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.320
 And they thought this is a good toy

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.320
 But it probably can't actually be done

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.320
 And I think they sent an executive to Budapest

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.320
 To meet Rubik

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.320
 If you can solve this, we'll make it

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.320
 We'll manufacture it and we'll distribute it

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.320
 And then they sold 150 million in those 3 years

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.320
 But they sold it thanks to the most famous

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
 Hungarian at the time

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.320
 So Rubik obviously couldn't really do all the press and stuff

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.320
 Such a great question

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320
 I'm going chajagaboor

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.320
 Was it?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.320
 Absolutely, chajagaboor

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.320
 Rubik's Cube? That is not a Venn diagram

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.320
 Amazing, right?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.320
 So this is the earliest mention of the actual phrase

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.320
 Rubik's Cube I could find

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.320
 This was from 1980

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.320
 And chajagaboor had put on a party for the Rubik's Cube

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.320
 Where she invited all of her Hollywood friends

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.320
 Wow

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.320
 With a buffet of Hungarian delicacies

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.320
 That said, but he didn't say what I supposed

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.320
 Goulash, but I'm not sure what else was there

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.320
 Wow

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.320
 Rubik's Cube was hired by the ideal toy

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.320
 Corporation to promote

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.320
 The Rubik's Cube

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.320
 As she said, even if you can't solve it

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320
 The Cube feels so good in your hands

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.320
 It may replace worry beads

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.320
 Oh, nice

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.320
 Like the original fidget spinner

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.320
 Or like those new poppers

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.320
 That is true, if you do just play with the Rubik's Cube

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320
 Even if you don't solve it

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.320
 It is fun to play with, isn't it?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.320
 Especially if you've got Cube Lube

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320
 Oh, it flies through your hand

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.320
 You know, I told him from quite early

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.320
 And he said that children are better than adults

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.320
 Solving it, which would you agree with that, Lucy?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.320
 Yeah, my own anecdotal experience

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.320
 Who was saying all this? Was it Rubik?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.320
 That was Rubik saying that

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.320
 He had a couple of reasons why he thought

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.320
 That kids would be better

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.320
 More nimble, wrists

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.320
 I think purely physical terms

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320
 Smaller hands

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.320
 I always think with technology

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.320
 My kids will just pick up anything

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.320
 And go "blah, blah, blah, blah"

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.320
 Whereas I am hovering

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.320
 I am tempted to think

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.320
 And I overthink it

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.320
 Maybe there's an impulsiveness

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.320
 Yeah, I think overthinking

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.320
 Is kind of one thing he said

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.320
 He said it requires a certain innocence

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.320
 That children had

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.320
 Because adults will try out a pattern

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.320
 And it doesn't quite work out

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.320
 And they'll just never do that again

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.320
 Whereas kids will keep trying things

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.320
 The thing is with the Rubik's Cube

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.320
 It is all algorithms and it's just repeating things

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320
 And so kids are good at that

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.320
 He also said that kids

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320
 And I think this is probably quite true

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.320
 Is at certain kids anyway

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.320
 Will get very absorbed with one thing

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320
 And won't let anything else distract them

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.320
 Just kind of concentrate on it and do it

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.320
 And the other thing he said

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 Is that kids have good visual memory

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.320
 And that is true

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.320
 Children can have much better visual

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.320
 Until around 10 or 11 or 12

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.320
 They have almost idetic memories

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320
 That they can just remember things really well

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.320
 He didn't mention nimble fingers

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320
 It's weird

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.320
 Cos I know Rubik was Hungarian

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.320
 In 1981

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.320
 The spokesman at the Hungarian Embassy in London

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.320
 Said the cube is our secret weapon

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.320
 To pacify the West

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320
 Wow

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.320
 There was even a cartoon

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.320
 Did you guys see the cartoon?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320
 Rubik's Cube, it's a sentient Rubik's Cube

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.320
 That is an alien

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.320
 So great and it was a Rubik's Cube

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.320
 That was completely useless if it was out of position

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.320
 And that could happen quite easily

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.320
 If a passing pigeon knocked it

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.320
 And it would become useless

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320
 But if it was in its right sold state

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.320
 It was this powerful sentient thing

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.320
 Could he change?

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.320
 Could he solve himself or did he require?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.320
 He required

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320
 So it's called Rubik the Amazing Cube

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.320
 And it has

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.320
 I love it, his IMDB page has goofs

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.320
 One of the goofs is

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.320
 Even in its sold state

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.320
 The colours of Rubik are often in the wrong position

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.320
 The light is always across from yellow

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.320
 Correct?

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.320
 So it says in many of its sold states

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.320
 The colours are sitting next to each other

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.320
 That shouldn't be

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.320
 What a blue colour

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.320
 But it was actually

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320
 It was not a long lasting series

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.320
 But it was very much praised

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.320
 It sounds like such a long lasting form though

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.320
 The family that

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.320
 When trusted with the sentient cube

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 Was a Latino family

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.320
 That was shown on TV really back then

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
 So it was a very progressive show

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.320
 It was seen as a

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.320
 It's nice to see a family who aren't white

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.320
 It's the leads in a cartoon

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.320
 Bring it back it's what I'm saying

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.320
 They didn't announce a film in 2010

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.320
 Which I'm not sure

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.320
 They did that with loads of them didn't they?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.320
 Like loads of toys

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.320
 And they made one or two battleships they made

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.320
 Battleships got made

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.320
 But they also announced Ridley Scott's Monopoly

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.320
 Which I don't think

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.320
 Happened unless I really missed it

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 But they're about to do Tetris as a big series

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 They're about to do a big Netflix series about Tetris

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.320
 I think Guess Who

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.320
 Would be a very good one

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.320
 Very instantly recognisable characters

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.320
 A mystery, do you think like a mystery thing?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.320
 Yeah

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.320
 Did the suspect

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.320
 Wear a hat

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.320
 Weirdest follow up to Knives Out

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.320
 Operation that would be another good one

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.320
 Operation, yeah

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.320
 Gruelling harrowing medical job

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.320
 It's his funny bone

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.320
 Let's get the tweezers

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:14.320
 Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.320
 And that is Lucy

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.320
 It is this fact

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.320
 On at least three occasions in the last 16 years

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.320
 The government of Shanghai has tried and failed

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.320
 To stop people wearing pyjamas

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.320
 Outdoors

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.320
 Which seems

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.320
 Famously Chinese authorities

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.320
 Are so laissez-faire

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.320
 The fact they've tried and failed is quite interesting

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.320
 It doesn't say much for the all powerful machinery

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.320
 Of the state

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.320
 You can't even stop people wearing pyjamas out

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.320
 I don't think they've sent the army in

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.320
 They've just disapprovingly said

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.320
 You shouldn't do this

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.320
 They haven't really tried then

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.320
 There's been several attempts

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.320
 It's quite a big thing, particularly in Shanghai

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.320
 For people to wear pyjamas

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.320
 Out and about

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.320
 They think it's partly because

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.320
 In the early 20th century

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.320
 It was a real status symbol to be able to

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 Afford imported pyjamas

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.320
 So people would take to the streets

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.320
 In their firing and are going look I can afford these

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.320
 And slippers

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.320
 They've got little teddy bears on them or whatever

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.320
 And so it was sort of

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.320
 A status symbol and then it's just become a thing

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.320
 I mean I'm all into it

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.320
 Because I wear pyjamas at all times

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.320
 I'm doing a tour at the moment

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.320
 In which I wear pyjamas so I'm very much on the side

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.320
 On stage you're a pyjama

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320
 Because I decided during lockdown

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.320
 There's nothing you can't

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.320
 If I do a zoom and the other person is wearing something smart

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.320
 I think you absolutely lose her

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.320
 Why would you dress up

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.320
 To have a meeting in your own home

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.320
 Especially now you think if they're not wearing

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.320
 Three layers and a blankie you think

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320
 Oh showing off you can afford heating

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.320
 So what you're doing then is possibly

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.320
 Doing in China as well

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.320
 Which is you've got daytime pyjamas

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.320
 And then you'll go home and you probably

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.320
 Have nighttime pyjamas that you wear right

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.320
 This is what they do in China so

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.320
 These aren't the pyjamas they're waking up in

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.320
 And just going out onto the street

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.320
 They'll get out of their pyjamas to put on some pyjamas

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.320
 To then go out into the street

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320
 Yeah they are the day wearer pyjamas

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.320
 I can't say that for everyone but that's

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.320
 For a lot of people

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.320
 To be honest I would try and get away with

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320
 Going oh no these are my fancy pyjamas

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.320
 No no I definitely didn't sleep in these

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.320
 Definitely didn't

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
 Have you ever done a school run or anything in your pyjamas Lucy

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.320
 Well do you know I was on Five Live the other day

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.320
 Because the Prime Minister's wife

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.320
 Had gone and done the school run in her slippers

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 Except they were like five hundred

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.320
 Pounds slippers

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.320
 And Five Live phoned me up and said oh for our

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.320
 Breakfast show tomorrow do you want to do a

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.320
 Phoning about should you be allowed to wear

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320
 Slippers on the school run and of course

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320
 I'm desperate to promote my tours so I said yes

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320
 But the great thing was nobody cared

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.320
 And it was one of those

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.320
 It was lovely when you're part of a sort of

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.320
 Supposedly controversial phoning that is not at all

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:50.320
 Controversial

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.320
 Did people just phone in and say I don't care

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.320
 Yeah they just said well you can wear what you want

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.320
 This is a tantrum do you know the most amazing radio phoning

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.320
 I've ever heard

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.320
 I was in a cab on the way somewhere or something

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.320
 It was quite a long journey this was 2020

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.320
 And it was if we get

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.320
 A new royal yacht right

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.320
 Should Prince Andrew be allowed

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.320
 To go on it

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.320
 There's not going to be a new royal yacht

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.320
 Just not

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.320
 And people had such strong opinions

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.320
 This must have been in the first two months

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.320
 Of 2020 I assume

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.320
 It was yeah yeah

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320
 Events overtook

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.320
 That one

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320
 Where do you stand on

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320
 Should Prince Andrew be allowed on the royal yacht

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.320
 Oh god he's actually thinking about it

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320
 It's a tricky one isn't it

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.320
 It's a taxpayer funded yacht

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.320
 If they're buying their own yacht

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.320
 I guess

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.320
 But if I'm paying for this yacht

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.320
 Yeah I think I am actually angry about it

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.320
 I think I shouldn't be allowed to go on it

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.320
 What if he's not allowed to come above decks

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.320
 What if he's only allowed in the

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.320
 I think he should be allowed to be in steerage

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.320
 That's fine

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320
 You can't keep him hidden in a basement

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.320
 You don't want to get on that yacht and discover Andrew

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.320
 That's it

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 Oh god no

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320
 They used to use sign language on the old royal yacht

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320
 Yeah because they wanted to keep it quiet for the royals

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.320
 And they had this complicated system of

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 Waving at each other

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.320
 That's not typical BSL sign language

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.320
 No sorry they had a royal yacht

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.320
 Based hand language

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.320
 Like the people on Ryanair

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320
 When they need a new tin of Pringles

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.320
 They have a special sign that they make

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.320
 The attendance

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.320
 They have a secret sign language code

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320
 For whatever they've run out of

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.320
 You'll notice it now next time you've got a flight

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320
 You can't wait

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.320
 Paraboloid for a Pringle

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.320
 I'm not party to the code

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.320
 But I know that it exists

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.320
 Like bookmakers

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.320
 Bookmakers and the aircrew

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.320
 Nice

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320
 I can get us back to pyjamas

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.320
 The other thing they did on the royal yacht was

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.320
 I think they wore soft sole shoes

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.320
 The crew so they weren't stamping around the decks

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.320
 And presumably infuriating Princess Margaret or something

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.320
 So they had a specific

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.320
 Well speaking of pyjamas

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.320
 They did used to be

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.320
 Outdoor things didn't they

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 Well they originated in

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.320
 Like Persia

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.320
 Ottoman Empire

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.320
 And they were just basically

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.320
 Loose fit trousers which you would tie around the waist

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.320
 They were taken by the

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.320
 Colonial British

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.320
 And they realised that they were quite nice to sleep in

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.320
 So that's how they became pyjamas

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.320
 But Coco Chanel thought that we should wear them down the beach

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 And they became really fashionable

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.320
 People wearing pyjamas down the beach

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.320
 In the 1920s and 30s

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.320
 Really? Yeah

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.320
 There was a place called

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.320
 I don't know how to pronounce it, it's in France

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.320
 So it's J-U-A-N

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 I think it is

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.320
 I think it's Huan Le Pan

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.320
 I've seen it and not been able to pronounce it

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.320
 It feels like Huan Le Pan

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 Feels like the nice way to say it

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320
 But it was called 'Pajamaland'

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.320
 In English and 'Pajamapolis'

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320
 In French because there were so many people in pyjamas

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.320
 On the beach in that town

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 I think it does come and go as a fashion

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.320
 And there's pockets of it

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.320
 I remember being in Cardiff for quite a long time

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.320
 And there was one area of Cardiff

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.320
 Where everybody went out in their pyjamas all the time

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.320
 Is that right? Do they wear pyjamas

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320
 Or the ones they slept in?

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320
 I think sort of the ones they slept in

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.320
 But it's a fine line between leisure wear

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.320
 Shall I tell you about the various attempts

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.320
 To shut down a pyjama wearing in China?

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.320
 Oh yes, yeah

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 So in the 1990s

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.320
 There was an education campaign

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 And they put signs up in Shanghai

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.320
 Saying 'Please don't wear your pyjamas'

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320
 2008, the Rixin neighbourhood

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.320
 In northeast Shanghai had a public campaign

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.320
 Saying 'Don't wear your pyjamas'

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.320
 But then, 2020

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320
 In Xuzhan city

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.320
 Which is near to Shanghai

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.320
 There was a social media post

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.320
 Exposing uncivilised behaviour

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.320
 Increasing the quality of residents

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320
 And the local government

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320
 Put out various pictures of people

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320
 Who were engaged in antisocial behaviour

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.320
 Including seven people in pyjamas

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.320
 And they used facial recognition technology

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.320
 To find out who they were

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320
 And put their names up

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320
 Which, what you need there

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.320
 Is you need pyjamas that have got some sort of balaclava

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.320
 A sleep mask

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.320
 A sleep mask exactly

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.320
 But yeah, it does seem extraordinary

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.320
 I think around the Shanghai World Expo

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.320
 In 2010 as well, there was quite a campaign

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.320
 To stop people wearing their pyjamas

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.320
 Yeah, that was a big one, wasn't it?

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.320
 The government at that one hired

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.320
 500 members of the public

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320
 To volunteer to sort of stand at bus stops

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.320
 And just, just if someone in pyjamas came along

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.320
 Go 'Hey, that looks daggy

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.320
 You need a change out of that, mate?'

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.320
 Yeah, 500 alties

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.320
 Do you know what kind of pyjamas

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.320
 James Bond wears?

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.320
 Or what he wears to bed?

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.320
 Surely he doesn't wear anything

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 I mean, because I don't think pyjamas are sexy

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320
 Can they be sexy?

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.320
 Well, great point

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.320
 Because there are obviously fancy silk pyjamas

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.320
 Which might be sexy

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320
 And the switch might not be

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.320
 The pyjamas aren't sexy because they cling

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.320
 Unless it's proper silk

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.320
 Yeah, silk

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320
 That's a problem

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320
 All the balloons in the house

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.320
 So Anthony Horowitz

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.320
 Is a thriller writer

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320
 He writes lots and lots and lots of books

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.320
 And he, for a while, was the

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.320
 James Bond sequels

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.320
 He was the official state's choice

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.320
 And he wrote a couple of Bond books

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.320
 And one of them was called Trigger Mortis

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.320
 Great name

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.320
 And in the start of the book, in the opening chapter

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.320
 Anthony Horowitz wrote a description of Bond

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.320
 Jumping out of bed, naked

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.320
 And he sent this off to the flaming estate

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.320
 And they got back it up and they said, 'You can't have that'

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.320
 Because it's official Bond canon

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320
 In one of the books, I can't remember which one it is

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.320
 I think it's 'You Only Live Twice' or something

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.320
 Bond wears a bed jacket

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.320
 Which is maybe the least sexy item

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.320
 Of clothing you could possibly imagine

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.320
 It kind of buttons up to the neck

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.320
 And it goes down to the knees

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.320
 The winky night shirt style

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.320
 So he just rewrote it not saying that Bond was naked

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.320
 He didn't describe the bed jacket

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.320
 Because he thought that would be a way of destroying the character

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.320
 Bond undid the top button of his night jacket

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.320
 Bond hung up his night cap

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.320
 On the side

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.320
 He just imagine a little packet of Renny's in the pocket

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 Oh, there's a hand key in there

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 How long has that been in there for?

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.320
 Interestingly, for a very long time

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.320
 The classic trouser pajama

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.320
 With the jacket button up kind of thing

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.320
 For a long time, worn by men

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.320
 And that changed during World War I

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.320
 This is where women started wearing it

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.320
 This is according to a professor

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.320
 At the University of Glasgow called Lucy Whitmore

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320
 Who talked about the fact that zeppelin raids

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.320
 Meant that whenever you heard the alarm

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.320
 And you needed to run out of your house

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.320
 It got to a point where

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.320
 You became quite conscious of what you were wearing

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.320
 You would come out in your nightie

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.320
 You might look a bit dishevelled

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.320
 And also it's not the most practical thing

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.320
 To be running around in a nightie

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.320
 So to begin with, at the start of it

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.320
 It would be people would leave

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.320
 Very nice looking jackets in a very good spot

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.320
 So that as the raid was happening

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.320
 And they would grab it and go out

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.320
 And look fashionable

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.320
 There was an old lady who suggested leaving

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.320
 An emergency toupee by the door as well

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.320
 So you could grab that on the way out

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.320
 And then eventually people started wearing

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.320
 Women rather started wearing pajamas

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.320
 And the popular colour was dark blue

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.320
 Because if you're outside

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.320
 You obviously don't want any extras

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.320
 Come on

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320
 You don't want to give away

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.320
 I guess if you're being bombed

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.320
 You want to do everything to stop yourself from being seen

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.320
 Is that also why you need the toupee

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 To stop the bald head

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320
 And light reflecting back up

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.320
 Dan Widley, I found the same zeppelin based

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.320
 First World War fact in it

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.320
 I went to the library and did a bit of research

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.320
 There are a couple of books about the history of underclothes

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.320
 And I sat there looking like a dirty old man

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.320
 Sitting in the library

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.320
 Or you did have your penis out

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.320
 You should never

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.320
 Believe me

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.320
 But almost

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.320
 Every page of the book had a

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.320
 Line drawing of some corset

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.320
 Or some girdle

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.320
 Or something and I just started quickly flipping

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.320
 Through the line, I'm just here for the pyjamas

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.320
 Actually, I want the least sexy stuff

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.320
 Do you know what though, anyone looking at that would go

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.320
 That is the most adorable thing

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.320
 If that's how you're getting your kicks

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320
 I'm looking at line drawings of ladies petticoats

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.320
 It's not Andrew Tate

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.320
 Let's be honest

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.320
 And what did you find anything extra

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.320
 On the underclothes

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.320
 The onesie was sort of invented in that period

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.320
 Wasn't it? We know Winston Churchill

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.320
 He's still not wearing a onesie and that was

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.320
 A World War one

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320
 He called his like a bilus

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320
 Siren suit

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.320
 I think that was later

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.320
 He meant siren suit because of the air raid sirens

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.320
 I was thinking that he would sit on a rock and sing

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.320
 Imagine if he had a lovely singing voice

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.320
 We never really heard him sing

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.320
 So I wanted to meet them on the beaches

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.320
 We will seduce them on the beaches

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.320
 Most men

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.320
 Claim not to wear anything to bed

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:58.320
 But you're doubting them

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.320
 Okay, interesting

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.320
 I am doubting them, I think

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.320
 I think the dramas have a reputation of being a bit cosy

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.320
 I think there is a sense

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.320
 That men want to be thought of as being tough

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.320
 And rugged and like I don't wear anything to bed

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.320
 Even if it's minus four in the house or whatever

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.320
 Is there not and now listen

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.320
 I know nothing of the male anatomy

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.320
 I'll put that right out there but is there not

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320
 Do things not get a bit twisted and I would

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.320
 Imagine discomfort if you slept completely

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.320
 Naked as a man, do things not

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.320
 Is it not nice at all? Is it alright?

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.320
 Is it alright? Good to know

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.320
 Good to know, thanks for that

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320
 I've never been woken up by that

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.320
 I've never twisted anything

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.320
 It's got a trap under the bed again

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:42.320
 Finally you're going to have to fold in the fibre game again

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.320
 If you tried to leap out for an air raid

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.320
 I feel like that was one of the weirdest moments

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320
 Ever on our podcast where you had

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.320
 Three guys sitting here picturing ourselves

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.320
 Naked in bed

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.320
 There are four listeners now

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.320
 The mental images

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.320
 Please send in your fan art

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:12.320
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.320
 And that is Andy

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.320
 My fact is the flow of the Amazon

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.320
 Is so big that even a hundred miles

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.320
 Into the Atlantic you could

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320
 Drink over the side of your ship

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.320
 And the water would still be fresh

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.320
 That's incredible, I love it

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.320
 I should tell where I got this fact first

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.320
 It's called Thomas Pueyo on Twitter

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.320
 I couldn't believe it when I first read it

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.320
 So I did a bit more looking

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.320
 Some sources say the water is going to be a bit brackish

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.320
 It might not be totally

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.320
 Sparkling, Evian style fresh

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.320
 But it would definitely be noticeably less salty

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320
 So you would not be able to see South America

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320
 If you were a hundred miles out

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.320
 And you would still get water that was much less salty

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.320
 If you were, let's say

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.320
 You were sailing across the ocean

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.320
 Before you knew where you were

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.320
 You could keep tasting the water

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.320
 And as it got less and less salty

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.320
 You could almost find your way to the shore

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.320
 What an incredible idea, yeah

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.320
 To navigate your way there

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.320
 Sailors must have worked that out though

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.320
 Because they're very wise

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.320
 There will be some sort of sailor rhyme

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.320
 Like if the water tastes nice

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.320
 If the water tastes nice

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.320
 Brazil will be in a trice

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.320
 If the water tastes salty

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.320
 Then your

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.320
 Compass is faulty

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.320
 There you go

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.320
 So every single day

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.320
 The water that we're talking about

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.320
 That sort of pushes out

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.320
 Into the Atlantic

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.320
 It's 17 billion metric tonnes

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.320
 Of water that flows out

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320
 It's hard to work out what that is

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320
 What that equates to, if you were getting fresh water

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.320
 In New York City

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.320
 That's the daily amount for nine years

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.320
 That would be used

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.320
 Nine years worth of fresh water in New York City

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.320
 Is what goes out daily

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.320
 In the Atlantic

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.320
 They should move New York

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.320
 I don't know if that's practical

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.320
 But it's weird that we can't somehow

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.320
 Harvest it, it's just going

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.320
 It's just disappearing

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.320
 Becoming salty

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.320
 It goes into the water cycle

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.320
 And eventually rains down on us

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.320
 Yeah, but we could use the planet alive

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.320
 I think we've done enough mucking around

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.320
 Actually, maybe we should just meet the Amazon

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.320
 I actually disagree, I think a huge pike

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.320
 At the mouth of the Amazon

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.320
 That just takes it all the way to New York

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.320
 Brilliant, not New York, but somewhere that needs fresh water

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.320
 There's lots of places where they don't have water

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.320
 Somewhere closer

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.320
 Yeah, exactly

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.320
 New Orleans

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.320
 I can't see it not working

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.320
 I'm just saying, it's a bit of a waste

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.320
 That's 17 billion metric tonnes

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.320
 It's a waste, I really don't think it's a waste

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.320
 Donald Trump listening to this

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.320
 Is going to be diverted to his golf courses

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.320
 Anyway, the Amazon, it's big

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.320
 It's big, it blows my mind

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.320
 My mate's got a new Brazilian girlfriend

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.320
 And he was saying, you know, you go to Brazil

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.320
 It's just massive, mate

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.320
 It's just massive

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.320
 The thing I always find interesting

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.320
 About the Amazon is that you can't build bridges

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.320
 Yeah

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.320
 Because it's too

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.320
 Because the width of it

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.320
 Varies so much

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.320
 And it's so soft, crumbly at the edges

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.320
 So it would have to be such a massive bridge

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.320
 Because it would have to start

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.320
 And so what, they just go across on boats and stuff

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.320
 I think they've built one now

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.320
 There is one, but it's right up at the north

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.320
 It's over a tributary

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.320
 It's the Rio Negro

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.320
 Which is a tributary of the Amazon

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.320
 But it's before it joins the river proper

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.320
 Basically, so there are no bridges across the Amazon-Amazon

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.320
 Like you say, Lucy

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.320
 During the wet season, the Amazon

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.320
 Is 190 kilometres wide

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.320
 But it's widest

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320
 That's why this is really wide

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.320
 Imagine from here to Stoke

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.320
 Maybe Stafford

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.320
 That's further, in fact

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.320
 My electric car wouldn't be able to drive

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.320
 If there was a bridge that went over that net

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.320
 They would have to be a charging point

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.320
 On that bridge

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320
 Otherwise they wouldn't be able to get across

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.320
 God, it's that wide, that is insane

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.320
 I like that the Amazon River is part of

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.320
 Effectively an Amazon River sandwich

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.320
 It's the meat

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.320
 Of a sandwich

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.320
 In that

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.320
 This is a tortured metaphor

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.320
 I know what you're talking about and even I'm struggling

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.320
 To come up with this

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.320
 There's a river below it

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.320
 And there's a river above it

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.320
 There's more water above the Amazon River

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.320
 In the clouds

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.320
 Above the actual Amazon itself

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.320
 The clouds follow the shape of the river

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.320
 I believe so

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.320
 It's water vapor stream, isn't it?

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.320
 It's amazing

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.320
 I think it's 20 billion tonnes of water

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.320
 Yeah, and that's more water

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.320
 Than it's actually in the river itself

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.320
 They say

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.320
 Isn't it something like a big tree

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.320
 In the Amazon, perspires

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.320
 Or transpires or whatever it is

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.320
 A thousand litres of water in a day

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.320
 One tree

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.320
 And then underneath

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.320
 You've got the Hamza

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.320
 So secret underground river

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.320
 You can only get to it

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.320
 If you defeat an Aztec boss

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.320
 On the final level

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.320
 On the final level

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.320
 So

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.320
 Under the Amazon there is a sort of aquifer

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.320
 That is even wider

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.320
 Even bigger

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.320
 Even bolder, even fresher

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.320
 It's Amazon 2, the revenge

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.320
 The River Hamza named after the

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.320
 Strictly winner this year obviously

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.320
 Oh, not Abu Hamza

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.320
 It's got a big hook in it

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.320
 Ranger Hamza

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.320
 It's quite recently discovered, isn't it?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.320
 So Hamza was the name of the head of the team

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.320
 That discovered it, and it's

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.320
 Very low down

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.320
 4,000 metres below the river itself

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.320
 Super slow moving

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.320
 To the point where you can't really call it a river

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.320
 Like, it's not flowing

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.320
 It moves at one millimetre an hour

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.320
 I relate to this river very hard

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.320
 It's very slow, low down

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.320
 If you drop something in it

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.320
 You'll be reunited with it quite quickly

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.320
 It won't be swept away

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.320
 Suddenly

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.320
 You game of poostics would be quite low stakes, wouldn't it?

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.320
 Exactly

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.320
 The Giant Amazon Leech

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.320
 Which you find in the Amazon River

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.320
 Do you think it's longer or shorter

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.320
 Than the world's longest

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.320
 Cattail?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.320
 No, I actually

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.320
 Know the length of the leech

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.320
 But I have no idea about the world's longest cattail

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.320
 That's the difficulty of this quiz question

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.320
 You actually need two quite arcade bits of knowledge

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.320
 To even make a guess

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.320
 I think the longest cattail is not that long

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.320
 Really?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.320
 It's a domestic cat

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.320
 Here we go

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.320
 I think the leech is about a forearm

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.320
 I think it's about 18 inches

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.320
 The biggest giant leech

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.320
 The longest ever cattail is longer or shorter than 18 inches

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.320
 This gives it away a bit

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.320
 It's a Ferndale cat

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.320
 Well no, you've made it too easy

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.320
 I don't want to submit an answer anymore

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.320
 Is it exactly the same length?

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.320
 Andy is spot on with the 18 inches

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.320
 For the Amazon Leech

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.320
 And the longest cattail

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.320
 According to Guinness

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.320
 Is 17 inches

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.320
 Do you think

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.320
 That the giant Amazon Leech

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.320
 Is longer or shorter

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.320
 Than the height

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.320
 Of the world's tallest donut

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.320
 Right, so

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.320
 It's good now we know we've got 18 inches

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.320
 Put the donut down flat

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.320
 So not the diameter

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.320
 Not the roundness, it's how tall it goes

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.320
 I think the donut's taller

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.320
 No, I think it's still the leech

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.320
 Yeah, Andy knows his stuff

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.320
 Tallest donut, 16 inches tall

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.320
 It was quite wide and fairness

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.320
 Yeah, but actually what's that foot and heart

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320
 I mean that's a tall donut

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.320
 I could eat that then

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.320
 I want the world's biggest donut

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.320
 To be a donut that I was like

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.320
 I couldn't eat that

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.320
 You could make lovely donuts that big

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.320
 Or like the ring road of a small town

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.320
 Exactly

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.320
 Oh this is a great quiz

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.320
 Well I loved it, I had a great time

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.320
 So this is the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.320
 This is a cool thing

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.320
 And it's a really new thing as well actually

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.320
 So it's an observatory

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.320
 But not a space observatory

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.320
 It's to look down at the Amazon

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.320
 And so it's in the middle of the rainforest

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.320
 And the trees are

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.320
 What are tall trees, they're about 80 to 100 meters aren't they

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.320
 A good tall tree is up to

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.320
 You know it's a really tall tree 100 meters

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.320
 And the tower, I think the tallest ever tree

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.320
 Is about 120 meters, like the tallest ever measured

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.320
 But this tower is 325 meters

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.320
 Okay, it's about as tall as the Eiffel Tower

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.320
 Which actually is really tall when you look at it

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.320
 The Eiffel Tower

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.320
 Wow busting some myths today out me

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.320
 I never think of it as tall

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320
 But actually I went there

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.320
 It's big, the Eiffel Tower

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.320
 You can see it from a long way away

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.320
 Exactly, and this is much thinner than the Eiffel Tower

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.320
 It's just one needle going up

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.320
 It looks mad this thing

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.320
 I was up the Eiffel Tower once

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.320
 In a restaurant

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.320
 And we had a table next to the window

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.320
 It was really nice, it was overlooking the bridge

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.320
 And what you would see is

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.320
 They had these guys playing

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.320
 You know we have three cups and you have to hide the ball

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.320
 And just taking loads of money

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.320
 And then about every 20 minutes the police would turn up

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.320
 And they would leg it

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.320
 And then you could watch them go all the way down the river

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.320
 Over the next bridge, back over again

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.320
 And then back on the bridge and then start playing again

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.320
 And then the police would turn up

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.320
 It was like a cat and mouse

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.320
 I really thought you were going to say that from your perspective

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.320
 You could see which carpet was under

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.320
 I just yelled

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.320
 "Bettle on"

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.320
 Your wife's down there looking up

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.320
 You've got special cup ball sign language

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.320
 You've developed

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.320
 How's they doing it?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.320
 We have never been fucked before

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.320
 What's done in that restaurant too? We didn't get a window seat

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.320
 No, well you need to

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.320
 Are there tables where you don't have window seats?

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.320
 You're just looking at a big piece of iron

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.320
 [Laughter]

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.320
 They really saw you coming

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.320
 Was it on the ground floor?

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320
 Did you get the basement table?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.320
 [Laughter]

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.320
 Didn't know Peter Express was it

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.320
 France?

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.320
 Wow, oh that's funny

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.320
 Is the restaurant still going?

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.320
 I didn't even get into the restaurant

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.320
 We need it, we'll go together

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.320
 I'd love that

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.320
 Oh yeah, this observatory is

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.320
 325 metres

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.320
 It's one metre taller than the Eiffel Tower

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.320
 And it's got 1500 steps up

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.320
 And it takes about an hour

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.320
 to walk up to the top

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.320
 I don't know if there's a lift actually

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.320
 And basically it's just to sniff

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.320
 the breath of the forest

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.320
 They're measuring all the chemicals in the air

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.320
 Where there are forest fires

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.320
 They measure the concentrations and how dangerous that is

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.320
 Deforestation

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.320
 They can tell things about that

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.320
 I think it's amazing

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.320
 Imagine you go up and you've forgotten your glasses

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.320
 [Laughter]

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.320
 I can't even see the guy with the cup and the ball

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.320
 [Laughter]

00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.320
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.320
 And that is James

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.320
 OK, my fact this week

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.320
 is that while playing a psychiatric patient

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.320
 in one flew over the cuckoo's nest

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.320
 Danny DeVito ended up becoming

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.320
 a psychiatric patient himself

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.320
 [Groans]

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.320
 Was he going method?

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.320
 Some people did go method

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.320
 We might get to that

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.320
 But DeVito's problem

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.320
 really is quite sweet actually

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.320
 He had recently

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.320
 gotten together with Rhea Perlman

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.320
 The amazing Rhea Perlman

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.320
 And cheers right? Just to put

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.320
 her head in your

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.320
 Carla can cheers

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.320
 And obviously they were filming

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.320
 or not obviously but they were filming a long way away

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.320
 from where she was

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.320
 3000 miles in fact

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.320
 and so he was really missed her

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.320
 and in order to deal with that separation

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.320
 he invented an imaginary friend to talk to at night

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.320
 and he became a little bit

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.320
 concerned about his mental health

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.320
 perhaps because they were making this film

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.320
 and there was a lot of it in the air

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.320
 and so he decided to see the doctor

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.320
 on set who was called Dr. Brooks

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.320
 and asked for his advice and Dr. Brooks said

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.320
 yeah don't worry about it as long as you're aware that it's an imaginary friend

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 imaginary friend is a perfectly normal

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.320
 thing to have it's no problem at all

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.320
 But also that doctor

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.320
 the on set doctor was actually

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.320
 in the movie of course

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.320
 Was he? It was the weirdest thing was there

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.320
 But an amazing man because he owned

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.320
 the clinic in which they filmed it

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.320
 so it's no wonder they were all a little bit

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.320
 stir crazy because they were in an actual mental institution

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.320
 filming this very intense

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.320
 movie

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.320
 He's the one who sort of checks in

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.320
 Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy at the start of the film

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.320
 and interviews him and I think

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.320
 I don't know if he was going to be in it

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.320
 but he was really insistent that everyone in the institution

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.320
 or the patients got involved with the film

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.320
 he was quite forward thinking, you know

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.320
 he took lots of the patients on expeditions

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 he took them white water rafting

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.320
 and he taught them kind of to rappel down cliffs

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.320
 and things like, I mean really

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.320
 because this was in the 70s they were filming it

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.320
 it was pretty progressive at the time

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.320
 and I think about 90 inmates ended up involved in the film

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.320
 in some capacity or another

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.320
 I must say I haven't seen the film

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.320
 It's pretty amazing

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.320
 and I started reading the book this week

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.320
 and got about a third of the way through

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.320
 but I think the book's amazing

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.320
 and apparently the film's even better

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.320
 Tell you what was even better

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.320
 it was a stage production

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.320
 that was put on about 20 years ago

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.320
 2004

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.320
 I was in a stage production

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.320
 Who were you?

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.320
 Were you the giant

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.320
 Yes that's me, Chief Brompton

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.320
 that was me

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.320
 You know what though, so we did this basically

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.320
 it was Christian Slater

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.320
 from Heather's etc

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.320
 came over and was Mc Murphy

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.320
 and it was amazing

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.320
 because at that time there weren't that many

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.320
 Western shows with big Hollywood stars

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320
 Mc Murphy being Jack Dawkins' role in the movie

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.320
 Exactly yes, the main guy

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.320
 and I played

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.320
 I played a nurse who had about two lines

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320
 and some of my friends came to see it

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.320
 and they said, we just thought you were being modest

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.320
 because I said I'm playing a nurse

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.320
 he mumbled over the cookie's nest

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.320
 you were just being modest and you were playing nurse ratchet

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.320
 but you really were just

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.320
 a nurse who has two lines

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.320
 because Francis Barber was nurse ratchet

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.320
 and Mackenzie Crook was in it

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.320
 Mackenzie Crook?

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.320
 He played Billy, the little shine

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.320
 That's a good role for him

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.320
 Shall we super quickly just say what the basic premise is?

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.320
 Just for anyone who hasn't seen it

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.320
 it's a bit confused

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.320
 Jack Nicholson

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.320
 it's been so long

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.320
 Jack Nicholson plays Mc Murphy

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.320
 who is this sort of tear away

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.320
 who is sent to this

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.320
 secure psychiatric facility

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.320
 which nurse ratchet is this

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.320
 horrible nurse who

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.320
 rules with the reign of terror over everybody

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.320
 There is one nice nurse though

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.320
 who just has a couple of lines

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.320
 To star of

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.320
 the entire production

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.320
 is that nice nurse

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.320
 and then the Indian chief

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.320
 spoilers are we worried about that

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.320
 I think it came out quite a long time ago

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.320
 So anyway

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.320
 Jack Nicholson creates this air of chaos

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.320
 and rebellion in the place and rebels against

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.320
 nurse ratchet and then the chief

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.320
 Brompton, the Native American chief

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.320
 smothers him with a pillow

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.320
 We should maybe say that Jack Nicholson's character

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.320
 suffers a lobotomy

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.320
 not just the chief Brompton wants to restore

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.320
 order in the hospital

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.320
 It's a mercy killing

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.320
 and the whole sort of thing is

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.320
 hey we're not mad, society's

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.320
 mad and

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.320
 there's a bit of a book where

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.320
 Murphy finds out that all the patients

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.320
 are allowed to leave if they want to, they just don't

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.320
 He's incredibly freaked out by, he says

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.320
 why don't you just go home, you're allowed

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.320
 and he says I'm not ready to

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.320
 It's amazing anyway

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.320
 It was a very tense filming experience

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.320
 in lots of ways as well because you had a lot of big personalities

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.320
 You had Ken Casey

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.320
 who wrote the book and then ended up hating the film

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.320
 never watched it

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.320
 He once started watching it when it was just on TV

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.320
 and then he realised what filming he was watching and changed channel

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.320
 I love that

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.320
 He was channel flipping

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.320
 and he was like oh what's this

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.320
 This looks great, oh no

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.320
 And then so the director was

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.320
 Milos Forman and Jack Nicholson

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.320
 and Milos Forman had a big disagreement

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.320
 about Murphy's character

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.320
 and basically it's very ordered

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.320
 and then Jack Nicholson arrives

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320
 and he turns the place upside down and

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.320
 Milos Forman wanted it to be more like it was already chaotic

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.320
 and then he arrives and he sort of draws

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.320
 the patients together and they become a team

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.320
 and there was a big falling out over there

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.320
 and they ended up talking to each other through the cinematographer

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.320
 so it would have to be kind of

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.320
 Can you tell

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.320
 Jack Nicholson to act this way

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.320
 I mean it just sounds so tense

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.320
 Danny DeVito as well

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.320
 I'm a huge fan of Danny DeVito

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.320
 and I remembered him as Lou

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.320
 in Taxi

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.320
 the sort of doer dispatcher

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.320
 but when he was in Matilda

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.320
 he actually played Matilda

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.320
 although he was playing a horrible dad

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.320
 but he actually became like a really lovely

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.320
 father figure to her

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.320
 and then you know in Mum Play with the Cuckoo's Nest

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.320
 you could argue that he actually

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.320
 was playing a sort of psychiatric patient

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.320
 but he was taking care of his mental health

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.320
 what I'm saying is he's always the opposite

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.320
 of how he appears and actually

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.320
 in Twins

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.320
 if you put him and Arnold Schwarzenegger together he's taller

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.320
 What a film

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.320
 he was inducted

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.320
 into the New Jersey Hall of Fame

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.320
 in 2010

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.320
 so I thought I'd look at some other people who are in

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.320
 New Jersey Hall of Fame

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.320
 so you've got Buzz Aldrin

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.320
 Frank Sinatra

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.320
 Do you have to be from New Jersey can I just ask

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.320
 Well Thomas Edison is there born in Ohio

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.320
 Yogi Berra born in Missouri

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.320
 Harriet Tubman born in Maryland

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.320
 and Albert Einstein

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.320
 not even born in America

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.320
 so we've all got a shot at the New Jersey Hall of Fame

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.320
 proud son of New Jersey

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.320
 I think you have to have lived there for a while

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.320
 because Einstein worked in Princeton of course

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.320
 that's great

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.320
 on one from over

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.320
 it was nearly defeated by the Cold War

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.320
 it didn't get turned into a film because of the Iron Curtain

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.320
 you know this

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.320
 this is cool

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.320
 so the book came out in the early 60s

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.320
 and Michael Douglas

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.320
 no sorry

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.320
 Kirk Douglas bought the rights

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.320
 he was in the play

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.320
 he was in the first play version

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.320
 based on the play not on the book

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.320
 which is maybe why Ken Casey hated the film

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.320
 so Kirk Douglas was the initial Mc Murphy

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.320
 which is mad it's so strange for him to imagine now

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.320
 because it's so Jack Nicholson's role

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.320
 and then he bought the rights

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.320
 and he wrote to Milos Forman in Czechoslovakia

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.320
 and said got this great play

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.320
 got the rights to where I think it should be a film

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.320
 I'll send you a copy of the book

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.320
 Milos Forman said great

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.320
 the book was then seized by Czech Customs

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.320
 in 1963

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.320
 and Forman was really annoyed

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.320
 because Milos Forman never said thank you for the book

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.320
 rude

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.320
 it took a decade to sort out

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.320
 this misunderstanding between them

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.320
 the film was made in something like 1975

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.320
 I think

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.320
 it took a long time

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.320
 and eventually Kirk Douglas gave the rights to his son Michael

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.320
 who then said

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.320
 shall we just try again with this book thing

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.320
 do we think that the Czech Customs

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.320
 didn't let the book go initially

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.320
 because they were worried

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.320
 that it was seditious

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.320
 maybe it's not clear

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.320
 maybe they just wanted to read it

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.320
 I was wondering if it was like the Rubik's Cube

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.320
 going in the opposite direction

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.320
 I have no idea

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.320
 I don't know what their reasoning was

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.320
 Kessie was quite notorious

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.320
 as a LSD proponent

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.320
 he was quite famous with the counterculture of America

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.320
 at that point

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.320
 he had a bus that he used to take everyone on

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.320
 what a radical free thinker

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.320
 it was a psychedelic bus

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.320
 oh my god a multicoloured bus

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.320
 we have those all the time

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.320
 London buses are bright red

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.320
 that's what it represented

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.320
 they were called the Merry Pranksters

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.320
 and Tom Warf wrote a whole book about this

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.320
 it was a non-fiction book about these guys

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.320
 who just would go around

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.320
 they used to do things like

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.320
 they would have people playing flutes on the top of the bus

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.320
 who would feel buses where people have been playing the flute

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.320
 were they on LSD?

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.320
 just a public safety warning

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.320
 do not take acid on a London bus

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.320
 it's not a friendly environment to do that

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.320
 but it is possible it was the counterculture thing

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.320
 and his name was very much associated with that

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.320
 it has a good point

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.320
 it's interesting because he was an author

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.320
 already at this point Kessie

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.320
 before he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.320
 and he was working on a book called Zoo

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.320
 and in order to fund it he needed a job

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.320
 so he worked at a psychiatric ward

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.320
 in order to fund it

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.320
 and the book idea came to him when one night he was in there

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.320
 I think he was cleaning

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.320
 and he was on peyote

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.320
 and he was tripping and he saw a full-blown

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.320
 Chief Broomden there

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.320
 as a sort of vision

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.320
 and a psychedelic part of his peyote

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.320
 is it like a cactus or something?

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.320
 yeah it's like a cactus which you

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.320
 it's a drug

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.320
 I know it is a word and I know it is a drug but I can't tell you the specifics

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.320
 come on and do the big ol' squass

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.320
 sorry not to hurt

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.320
 but he said he saw a full-blown

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.320
 Native American, he said Indian

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.320
 Chief Broom, the solution, the whole mothering key to the novel

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.320
 and that's how he wrote

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.320
 the novel in the novel

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.320
 and he's the main like the narrator

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.320
 sorry and in the movie not

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.320
 he's not and that's why Kessie

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.320
 immediately hated it, it wasn't told from the perspective of him

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.320
 he's a big character in it

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.320
 but he's not

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.320
 interestingly the guy who got the role of

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.320
 Chief Broomden got it because

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.320
 Michael Douglas was sitting next to a used car dealer

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.320
 on a plane

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.320
 and the used car dealer's dad was an acting agent

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.320
 who had a load of Native American actors on his books

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.320
 and the thing about Chief

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.320
 Broomden is he's about eight feet tall

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.320
 and Michael Douglas got a phone call saying

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.320
 I just met the tallest Native American guy

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.320
 you've ever seen

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.320
 and it was Will, something I can't remember his name

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.320
 anyway he got the role as Chief

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.320
 Will Sampson

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.320
 nice name for someone incredibly tall

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.320
 and he's got long hair

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.320
 so this movie was made

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.320
 in an actual as we've said

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.320
 hospital

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.320
 that was originally it was called

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.320
 the Oregon State Mental Hospital

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.320
 it's since been renamed as now

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.320
 Oregon State Hospital

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.320
 and it's an interesting place

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.320
 in its own right, it had

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.320
 a really controversial bit

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.320
 which was they found 5,000 canisters

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.320
 of unclaimed human remains in there

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.320
 and this was a lot of the patients

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.320
 who had been cremated but no one

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.320
 had come to collect them

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.320
 and they put out the list, they found all the names of the people

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.320
 and a lot of relatives, distant relatives

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.320
 came and reclaimed them

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.320
 and there was a documentary called

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.320
 "Lust" that was made about it

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.320
 it was pretty mad

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.320
 but also they had a railroad

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.320
 underneath the hospital

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.320
 specifically built one so that they could deliver

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.320
 items to different bits of the hospital

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.320
 but also to transport patients

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.320
 that they didn't want the members of the public

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.320
 to have to come across if they were visiting the hospital

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.320
 because they were worried something might go wrong

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.320
 dangerous, you know, all that sort of stuff

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.320
 and some of the tunnels possibly are still there

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.320
 but you just walk them now or use bicycles

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.320
 it's just Prince Andrew

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.320
 in there now

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.320
 and then they had a horrible thing

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.320
 I found just horrible things about it

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.320
 unfortunately, 1942

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.320
 there was a mass poisoning by accident

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.320
 they were serving scrambled eggs

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.320
 and 47 people died from this

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.320
 they used

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.320
 instead of powdered milk

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.320
 they used sodium fluoride

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.320
 which is a poison you would use to kill cockroaches

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.320
 and that was accidentally added to the scrambled eggs

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.320
 and 47 died from that

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.320
 in a kitchen

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.320
 we had a Christmas party

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.320
 and instead of putting white sauce

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.320
 on the Christmas pudding, they put garlic sauce on

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.320
 which is a very

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.320
 less problematic version

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.320
 of what you just said

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.320
 it's good to know you can relate

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.320
 I mean, just saying it's easily done

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.320
 yeah, it's easily done

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.320
 I want to use cube lube

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.320
 instead of

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.320
 instead of what?

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.320
 it twisted sideways, didn't it?

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:56.320
 should we just quickly mention Louise Fletcher

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.320
 she played Nurse Fletcher

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.320
 in the film and died last year sadly

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.320
 but she was

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.320
 amazing and she

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.320
 I think she kept herself separate from the rest of the cast

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.320
 didn't she, for a lot of the filming

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.320
 so that she could be an icy

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.320
 authority figure

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.320
 and did you do that when you were in the play of Lucy?

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.320
 she was an icy authority figure

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.320
 in every situation

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.320
 didn't she also take all the clothes off though

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.320
 at one point

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.320
 at the end of filming, wasn't it?

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.320
 yeah, she'd go hey guys

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.320
 look at this, all along I was fun

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.320
 it was her saying

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.320
 I'm fun, that's right

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.320
 I think she had her underwear on

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.320
 I don't think she was fully naked

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.320
 she wasn't that much fun

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.320
 I'm fun, but I'm not like fun

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.320
 there must be a better way

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.320
 to have cupcakes

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.320
 to ingratiate yourself with their colleagues

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.320
 just wait till the end of this podcast

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.320
 there were two others

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.320
 Anne Bancroft and Angela Lansbury

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.320
 were both offered the role but turned it down

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.320
 because they didn't want to appear so evil on screen

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.320
 wow

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.320
 this was in a no-bituary of Louise Fletcher that I read

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.320
 and also

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.320
 she was repeatedly turned down from roles

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.320
 because she was 5 foot 10

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.320
 and in those days a lot of the leading men

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.320
 were much shorter than that

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.320
 and she couldn't play roles opposite people

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.320
 who were shorter or about the same height

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.320
 and actually in the nurses' cap

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.320
 she'll be more than 6 foot

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.320
 and Jack Nilsson is quite a short guy

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.320
 but it really works for the authority

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.320
 for the sort of power struggle happening between them

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.320
 she's brilliant

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.320
 on Star Trek

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.320
 yeah, that's right

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.320
 she said that she found

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.320
 her role so disturbing

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.320
 that she also couldn't watch the film

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.320
 on Star Trek

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.320
 yeah

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.320
 aliens are scary

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.320
 did she, as Nurse Ratchet

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.320
 she found it really hard

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.320
 and she just found it too disturbing

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.320
 to watch as a role

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.320
 actually the last time I watched it

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.320
 which was a couple of years ago, the person I was watching it with

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.320
 sided with Nurse Ratchet

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.320
 which didn't make me think, no, hang on

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.320
 you've taken the wrong message there

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.320
 and she said, no, no, no, look, the point is

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.320
 someone's got to keep order

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.320
 just take a job from where he was running the place

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.320
 it would be an absolute mayhem

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.320
 one last thing just about Ken Cassie

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.320
 the author, because he was a pretty amazing author

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.320
 his method for a certain period when he was writing

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.320
 was to be completely

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.320
 off his head on drugs

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.320
 and he would write a crazy amount

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.320
 then in the morning, he'd sober up and become his own editor

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.320
 so he'd sort of say, okay

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.320
 let's see what the author's written

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.320
 and chop out all the junk

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.320
 and get down to the good meat of it

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.320
 wow, that's clever

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.320
 apart from presumably the first draft was absolute junk

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.320
 shit

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.320
 just didn't make any sense at all

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.320
 and then you'd think, hang on

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.320
 what if the editor was drunk as well

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.320
 but I'll do different drugs

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.320
 then I'll make the copy editor will be sober

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.320
 so that'll be fine

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.320
 okay, as long as the printer is sober

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.320
 it'll be fine

00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:00.320
 okay, that's it

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.320

 make sure to get out

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.320
 of your house and into

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.320
 a comedy club to see "Wake Up Call"

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.320
 it's the show that she's touring

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.320
 and she's going to be going around the UK doing that

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.320
 so go google it, see where she's going

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.320
 and try and see it

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.320
 okay, that's it, we're going to be back again next week with another episode
