 Hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish we have another very special guest for you today and
 That guest is our very good friend Lucy Porter. You will remember Lucy from previous episodes on fish
 I know you'll love her. She's so smart. She's so funny
 In fact, she's got a stand-up show that is touring at this very moment
 Which is called wake up call and really I'll be honest the best way to find out about that is to Google
 Lucy Porter wake up call and you'll find all the dates, but she's doing the whole of the UK
 It's definitely a show that's worth going to see. She also has a podcast called fingers on buzzers
 It's all about quizzing and she does that with my very good old friend Jenny Ryan
 It's a brilliant podcast so listen to that and she has a radio for stand-up special called Lucy Porter's lucky dip
 Which is going out at 11 30 on March the 15th
 It'll probably be on the BBC sounds app after that so again Google Lucy Potter's lucky dip and you'll find that and apart from that
 Just enjoy the show so nothing more to say apart from on with the podcast on with the show. Oh hi Andy. I've been here the whole time
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin and Lucy Porter
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here
 We go starting with fact number one and that is my fact
 My fact this week is that it took the creator of the Rubik's Cube a month to solve it the first time he tried
 It's so crazy you I would have thought after about 20 or 30 days you would just make a new one
 So yeah invented 1974 he was a professor and he just had this idea
 What if I could make something that was static on the inside but fluid on the outside and that's what gave him the idea and
 He had a bash it it's later been worked out quite a famous number if you know Rubik's cubes that 43
 Quintillion is the number of permutations that you can make on the Rubik's Cube
 And so luckily he got there within a month. Yeah, it's pretty good. Well, I'll tell you what's weird. His prototype
 Wasn't three by three. His prototype was two by two. So I've got that took him a month
 That's the thing. Well, I'm curious to know if this is the one that took him a month because this is okay
 So Dan's showing us an image and it's like four wooden blocks
 That I've got various colors and numbers on it and they're held together almost by bits of wire
 Yeah, there's a wire meshing inside and he took a month to do a Rubik's Cube
 Yeah, that one's piss easy. Yeah, it's clever enough to make that you're clever enough to solve it. Yes
 You can do a Rubik's Cube, James. I can I think you can Lucy
 Well, I am yeah, my children obsessed with them
 We've got hundreds in the house and all those weird one, you know
 There's like weird different shaped ones and mirror ones where there's absolutely, you know
 Colors on it and stuff. So this is a long way of me saying I should be
 And I have at one point
 That one's tough because it's got like Dan's mixing up one from the Transport Museum
 I'd rather do the one with the colors
 But the other thing is about the Rubik's Cube is that I find that when you're under pressure
 It's almost impossible. Yes, because you do it kind of with muscle memory
 Yes, and then as soon as you start thinking about it, you can't really do it at all
 Yeah
 I made a terrible decision when because I did learn to do it when my kids got into it and then I
 Decided we were doing a live podcast recording of fingers on buzzers and I said, oh, I tell you what'll be fun
 I'll solve a Rubik's Cube while we do this round, and it took about 15 minutes
 Is there an algorithm basically? It's like a set pattern of moves that will help you work on the side you're working on
 So layers, that's the key
 Yeah, exactly so
 It's layers not sides, so you can see at the moment that I've done the bottom layer
 Right
 Or the top layer
 And then you do the middle one, then you do the top one
 Remember when we went on only connect and they asked you for facts about yourself
 And my fact was that I could do a Rubik's Cube in less than a minute
 And the team that we were playing with apparently one of them said that he could do three Rubik's Cubes in 30 seconds
 They decided they weren't going to use that fact
 Made you look pretty foolish
 But it's huge, the speed cubing because we had to get a timer so that we could record my kids' times
 And also my kids said "Oh, can we have some Cubelube?"
 And that's the moment that I was like "I'm sorry"
 As a mother you've got to worry
 Couldn't we have some Cubelube?
 Is there a brand? Is it a specifically sold lube?
 There is one of the best Cubelube, we didn't get good Cubelube
 It's called Cubelube
 Yeah, we got dodgy Cubelube
 And it's allowed as well, it's allowed in competition
 It's legit, it's like chalk on your hands if you're an athlete
 Yes
 Well there's just a piece about the, you know, there are so many cubes, the world, there we go
 But listen, the change has just completed the rubies
 That's why I've been silent for the last three minutes
 But by the time I've edited this it'll be about twenty seconds
 And it just listed the GAN 356 iCarry, the MoU RS3M Maglev, the GAN 11M Pro
 And it's all, there's kind of FIFA of cubing
 The World Cube Association
 Are they corrupt?
 They're hugely corrupt, millions and millions of dollars change hands
 So 1981, the top selling book in America was a book that was called The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube
 It sold six million copies and it was the number one book of the year
 It was massive, a guy called James G. Norris, he was a professor
 He did it as a pamphlet for his university and then someone saw it
 Said can you expand that into a like sixty four page book
 So it wasn't that big, it was double the expansion of the pamphlet
 And so he published it and in it he gives categories of what you're labeled as as a cuber if you manage to do it in certain times
 So this is 1981, twenty minutes, if you did it in that time you were a whiz
 Ten minutes, you were a speed demon
 Five minutes, you were an expert
 And three minutes, you were an emcee, the master of the cube
 Oh that's what I am then, I can tell you
 Yeah, you're a master of the cube
 Well in the 80s you were a famous person
 It's actually been updated since 2013
 You're now adult
 Yeah, unfortunately
 Well you James, if you take longer than sixty seconds
 I do, I take probably about a minute and a half first
 Okay, I'm afraid you don't even qualify as a whiz at this point
 Whereas a whiz was twenty minutes it's now sixty seconds
 Speed demon has gone from ten minutes to forty seconds
 Oh my god
 An expert has gone from five minutes to fifteen to twenty five seconds
 And the master of the cube which is now called world champion
 From three minutes to three to five seconds
 That's amazing the difference isn't it
 I can't even pick it up within three seconds
 My old arthritic fingers
 Because I remember the original crates in the 80s
 I'm old enough for that
 But it was one of those things that boys would learn to do
 And this is a terrible sexist generalisation
 But it did tend to be boys would learn to do it thinking it would really impress the girls
 And all girls just went meh
 I found that I've never ever pressed a girl with a Rubik's cube
 I impressed the QI's accountant once
 With a few Rubik's cube tricks
 But he wasn't my type
 I did because I brought mine in today
 So I did sit on the tube doing it
 And people don't look at you with admiration
 I'll be honest
 Really?
 It's pity
 No honey, honey, we'll just have to get up at the next stop
 Is she gonna do it?
 The craze just is unbelievable
 The 80s craze
 So it was the UK toy of the year in 1980
 And then again in 1981
 As if they just thought
 We're gonna give it to the cube again
 So Dan, you were mentioning the books that sold out very well
 So at one point in 1982
 I think it was four or five different books on the New York Times bestsellers list
 For Rubik's cube books
 There was a boy called Patrick Bossert
 Who was 13 years old
 And wrote a book called You Can Do the Cube
 And sold nearly a million copies of it
 He was the youngest ever author on the New York Times bestseller list
 It kind of came from nowhere, right?
 Like Dan says, it was invented in 1974
 And this was 1980
 In 1981 it was absolutely huge
 I looked on the newspaper archives
 And the first mention of it
 It doesn't even call it the Rubik's cube
 It calls it the Hungarian magic cube
 This was in 1979
 This was in The Observer
 And they said that at first most people tried to take the cube apart
 But that is not the object
 And it said if you even get one face done
 Of the cube in 20 minutes
 Then you've done well
 And it says, but there are several people
 Brackets, well at least three
 That are able to solve the cube in less than five minutes
 Dan, you mentioned that there are 43 quintillion different states
 That you can have
 The newspaper said, and this was in 1979
 At one per microsecond
 A computer would take around 3,000 million years
 Just to count up the number of states
 And in 2022
 We got the first ever quintillion per second computer
 So today a computer could reach it in just under a minute
 I think what's extraordinary
 The numbers are so bamboozlingly big
 I remember reading an interview with Erno Rubik
 Where he was talking about the fact that he'd invented
 More kinds of Rubik's cubes now
 There was a Snake Rubik's cube that he'd invented
 Did you buy that Lucy?
 I did have it
 Rubik's snake, which sounds a bit dodgy now
 Why did they call it the Snake and not the Rubik's tube?
 Sorry, very nice
 But he said that and this one has potentially even more permutations
 And the guy writing the article just went
 "Yeah, once you've hit 43 quintillion, I'm not impressed anymore"
 But what's interesting, so very randomly
 Day before yesterday I bumped into
 A Rubik's cube Guinness world record holder
 He's a guy called George
 He holds two records, one which he's just done
 Which I'm not allowed to reveal
 I know, of course that
 Rubik's cube Goss, I'll tell you guys after the show
 The other one is that he has the most Rubik's cubes
 Solved while riding on a skateboard
 For, I think, like an hour or something
 He did like 500 of them just going around a skate park
 Quick question, Dan
 Did he have on him a bag of 500 Rubik's cubes
 Which he then had to get out of the skateboard?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 It wasn't like Santa, yeah
 What he was was he had people stationed around the skate park
 So he'd hand the solved one to the person
 They would mix it back up and he'd grab a new one
 As he was travelling around
 So they mixed them back up again and so he used the same one
 It feels kind of pointless
 It's like a punishment for the gods, actually
 It is, it is, it is
 So he demonstrated one thing I found amazing
 Which is to do with the bamboozling numbers
 If I took this right now and I mixed this up
 To give to him to solve
 Whatever I've just done here
 Is a combination that he will have never seen
 In his life
 The combination is unique because of the 43 quintillion
 I just spent 2 and a half minutes in
 I think what's extraordinary
 Like when it started getting big
 There was a big concern that is this thing solvable
 So there was a world fair that he was taken to
 And he's not a particular
 He's quite a philosophical guy
 He's quite sort of very serious
 And he wasn't the best ambassador of what this item was
 But they needed him there
 To prove it could be solved
 Otherwise it was the Americans, wasn't it?
 Yeah, they got sent to an American toy company
 And they thought this is a good toy
 But it probably can't actually be done
 And I think they sent an executive to Budapest
 To meet Rubik
 If you can solve this, we'll make it
 We'll manufacture it and we'll distribute it
 And then they sold 150 million in those 3 years
 But they sold it thanks to the most famous
 Hungarian at the time
 So Rubik obviously couldn't really do all the press and stuff
 Such a great question
 I'm going chajagaboor
 Was it?
 Absolutely, chajagaboor
 Rubik's Cube? That is not a Venn diagram
 Amazing, right?
 So this is the earliest mention of the actual phrase
 Rubik's Cube I could find
 This was from 1980
 And chajagaboor had put on a party for the Rubik's Cube
 Where she invited all of her Hollywood friends
 Wow
 With a buffet of Hungarian delicacies
 That said, but he didn't say what I supposed
 Goulash, but I'm not sure what else was there
 Wow
 Rubik's Cube was hired by the ideal toy
 Corporation to promote
 The Rubik's Cube
 As she said, even if you can't solve it
 The Cube feels so good in your hands
 It may replace worry beads
 Oh, nice
 Like the original fidget spinner
 Or like those new poppers
 That is true, if you do just play with the Rubik's Cube
 Even if you don't solve it
 It is fun to play with, isn't it?
 Especially if you've got Cube Lube
 Oh, it flies through your hand
 You know, I told him from quite early
 And he said that children are better than adults
 Solving it, which would you agree with that, Lucy?
 Yeah, my own anecdotal experience
 Who was saying all this? Was it Rubik?
 That was Rubik saying that
 He had a couple of reasons why he thought
 That kids would be better
 More nimble, wrists
 I think purely physical terms
 Smaller hands
 I always think with technology
 My kids will just pick up anything
 And go "blah, blah, blah, blah"
 Whereas I am hovering
 I am tempted to think
 And I overthink it
 Maybe there's an impulsiveness
 Yeah, I think overthinking
 Is kind of one thing he said
 He said it requires a certain innocence
 That children had
 Because adults will try out a pattern
 And it doesn't quite work out
 And they'll just never do that again
 Whereas kids will keep trying things
 The thing is with the Rubik's Cube
 It is all algorithms and it's just repeating things
 And so kids are good at that
 He also said that kids
 And I think this is probably quite true
 Is at certain kids anyway
 Will get very absorbed with one thing
 And won't let anything else distract them
 Just kind of concentrate on it and do it
 And the other thing he said
 Is that kids have good visual memory
 And that is true
 Children can have much better visual
 Until around 10 or 11 or 12
 They have almost idetic memories
 That they can just remember things really well
 He didn't mention nimble fingers
 It's weird
 Cos I know Rubik was Hungarian
 In 1981
 The spokesman at the Hungarian Embassy in London
 Said the cube is our secret weapon
 To pacify the West
 Wow
 There was even a cartoon
 Did you guys see the cartoon?
 Rubik's Cube, it's a sentient Rubik's Cube
 That is an alien
 So great and it was a Rubik's Cube
 That was completely useless if it was out of position
 And that could happen quite easily
 If a passing pigeon knocked it
 And it would become useless
 But if it was in its right sold state
 It was this powerful sentient thing
 Could he change?
 Could he solve himself or did he require?
 He required
 So it's called Rubik the Amazing Cube
 And it has
 I love it, his IMDB page has goofs
 One of the goofs is
 Even in its sold state
 The colours of Rubik are often in the wrong position
 The light is always across from yellow
 Correct?
 So it says in many of its sold states
 The colours are sitting next to each other
 That shouldn't be
 What a blue colour
 But it was actually
 It was not a long lasting series
 But it was very much praised
 It sounds like such a long lasting form though
 The family that
 When trusted with the sentient cube
 Was a Latino family
 That was shown on TV really back then
 So it was a very progressive show
 It was seen as a
 It's nice to see a family who aren't white
 It's the leads in a cartoon
 Bring it back it's what I'm saying
 They didn't announce a film in 2010
 Which I'm not sure
 They did that with loads of them didn't they?
 Like loads of toys
 And they made one or two battleships they made
 Battleships got made
 But they also announced Ridley Scott's Monopoly
 Which I don't think
 Happened unless I really missed it
 But they're about to do Tetris as a big series
 They're about to do a big Netflix series about Tetris
 I think Guess Who
 Would be a very good one
 Very instantly recognisable characters
 A mystery, do you think like a mystery thing?
 Yeah
 Did the suspect
 Wear a hat
 Weirdest follow up to Knives Out
 Operation that would be another good one
 Operation, yeah
 Gruelling harrowing medical job
 It's his funny bone
 Let's get the tweezers
 Okay, it is time for fact number two
 And that is Lucy
 It is this fact
 On at least three occasions in the last 16 years
 The government of Shanghai has tried and failed
 To stop people wearing pyjamas
 Outdoors
 Which seems
 Famously Chinese authorities
 Are so laissez-faire
 The fact they've tried and failed is quite interesting
 It doesn't say much for the all powerful machinery
 Of the state
 You can't even stop people wearing pyjamas out
 I don't think they've sent the army in
 They've just disapprovingly said
 You shouldn't do this
 They haven't really tried then
 There's been several attempts
 It's quite a big thing, particularly in Shanghai
 For people to wear pyjamas
 Out and about
 They think it's partly because
 In the early 20th century
 It was a real status symbol to be able to
 Afford imported pyjamas
 So people would take to the streets
 In their firing and are going look I can afford these
 And slippers
 They've got little teddy bears on them or whatever
 And so it was sort of
 A status symbol and then it's just become a thing
 I mean I'm all into it
 Because I wear pyjamas at all times
 I'm doing a tour at the moment
 In which I wear pyjamas so I'm very much on the side
 On stage you're a pyjama
 Because I decided during lockdown
 There's nothing you can't
 If I do a zoom and the other person is wearing something smart
 I think you absolutely lose her
 Why would you dress up
 To have a meeting in your own home
 Especially now you think if they're not wearing
 Three layers and a blankie you think
 Oh showing off you can afford heating
 So what you're doing then is possibly
 Doing in China as well
 Which is you've got daytime pyjamas
 And then you'll go home and you probably
 Have nighttime pyjamas that you wear right
 This is what they do in China so
 These aren't the pyjamas they're waking up in
 And just going out onto the street
 They'll get out of their pyjamas to put on some pyjamas
 To then go out into the street
 Yeah they are the day wearer pyjamas
 I can't say that for everyone but that's
 For a lot of people
 To be honest I would try and get away with
 Going oh no these are my fancy pyjamas
 No no I definitely didn't sleep in these
 Definitely didn't
 Have you ever done a school run or anything in your pyjamas Lucy
 Well do you know I was on Five Live the other day
 Because the Prime Minister's wife
 Had gone and done the school run in her slippers
 Except they were like five hundred
 Pounds slippers
 And Five Live phoned me up and said oh for our
 Breakfast show tomorrow do you want to do a
 Phoning about should you be allowed to wear
 Slippers on the school run and of course
 I'm desperate to promote my tours so I said yes
 But the great thing was nobody cared
 And it was one of those
 It was lovely when you're part of a sort of
 Supposedly controversial phoning that is not at all
 Controversial
 Did people just phone in and say I don't care
 Yeah they just said well you can wear what you want
 This is a tantrum do you know the most amazing radio phoning
 I've ever heard
 I was in a cab on the way somewhere or something
 It was quite a long journey this was 2020
 And it was if we get
 A new royal yacht right
 Should Prince Andrew be allowed
 To go on it
 There's not going to be a new royal yacht
 Just not
 And people had such strong opinions
 This must have been in the first two months
 Of 2020 I assume
 It was yeah yeah
 Events overtook
 That one
 Where do you stand on
 Should Prince Andrew be allowed on the royal yacht
 Oh god he's actually thinking about it
 It's a tricky one isn't it
 It's a taxpayer funded yacht
 If they're buying their own yacht
 I guess
 But if I'm paying for this yacht
 Yeah I think I am actually angry about it
 I think I shouldn't be allowed to go on it
 What if he's not allowed to come above decks
 What if he's only allowed in the
 I think he should be allowed to be in steerage
 That's fine
 You can't keep him hidden in a basement
 You don't want to get on that yacht and discover Andrew
 That's it
 Oh god no
 They used to use sign language on the old royal yacht
 Yeah because they wanted to keep it quiet for the royals
 And they had this complicated system of
 Waving at each other
 That's not typical BSL sign language
 No sorry they had a royal yacht
 Based hand language
 Like the people on Ryanair
 When they need a new tin of Pringles
 They have a special sign that they make
 The attendance
 They have a secret sign language code
 For whatever they've run out of
 You'll notice it now next time you've got a flight
 You can't wait
 Paraboloid for a Pringle
 I'm not party to the code
 But I know that it exists
 Like bookmakers
 Bookmakers and the aircrew
 Nice
 I can get us back to pyjamas
 The other thing they did on the royal yacht was
 I think they wore soft sole shoes
 The crew so they weren't stamping around the decks
 And presumably infuriating Princess Margaret or something
 So they had a specific
 Well speaking of pyjamas
 They did used to be
 Outdoor things didn't they
 Well they originated in
 Like Persia
 Ottoman Empire
 And they were just basically
 Loose fit trousers which you would tie around the waist
 They were taken by the
 Colonial British
 And they realised that they were quite nice to sleep in
 So that's how they became pyjamas
 But Coco Chanel thought that we should wear them down the beach
 And they became really fashionable
 People wearing pyjamas down the beach
 In the 1920s and 30s
 Really? Yeah
 There was a place called
 I don't know how to pronounce it, it's in France
 So it's J-U-A-N
 I think it is
 I think it's Huan Le Pan
 I've seen it and not been able to pronounce it
 It feels like Huan Le Pan
 Feels like the nice way to say it
 But it was called 'Pajamaland'
 In English and 'Pajamapolis'
 In French because there were so many people in pyjamas
 On the beach in that town
 I think it does come and go as a fashion
 And there's pockets of it
 I remember being in Cardiff for quite a long time
 And there was one area of Cardiff
 Where everybody went out in their pyjamas all the time
 Is that right? Do they wear pyjamas
 Or the ones they slept in?
 I think sort of the ones they slept in
 But it's a fine line between leisure wear
 Shall I tell you about the various attempts
 To shut down a pyjama wearing in China?
 Oh yes, yeah
 So in the 1990s
 There was an education campaign
 And they put signs up in Shanghai
 Saying 'Please don't wear your pyjamas'
 2008, the Rixin neighbourhood
 In northeast Shanghai had a public campaign
 Saying 'Don't wear your pyjamas'
 But then, 2020
 In Xuzhan city
 Which is near to Shanghai
 There was a social media post
 Exposing uncivilised behaviour
 Increasing the quality of residents
 And the local government
 Put out various pictures of people
 Who were engaged in antisocial behaviour
 Including seven people in pyjamas
 And they used facial recognition technology
 To find out who they were
 And put their names up
 Which, what you need there
 Is you need pyjamas that have got some sort of balaclava
 A sleep mask
 A sleep mask exactly
 But yeah, it does seem extraordinary
 I think around the Shanghai World Expo
 In 2010 as well, there was quite a campaign
 To stop people wearing their pyjamas
 Yeah, that was a big one, wasn't it?
 The government at that one hired
 500 members of the public
 To volunteer to sort of stand at bus stops
 And just, just if someone in pyjamas came along
 Go 'Hey, that looks daggy
 You need a change out of that, mate?'
 Yeah, 500 alties
 Do you know what kind of pyjamas
 James Bond wears?
 Or what he wears to bed?
 Surely he doesn't wear anything
 I mean, because I don't think pyjamas are sexy
 Can they be sexy?
 Well, great point
 Because there are obviously fancy silk pyjamas
 Which might be sexy
 And the switch might not be
 The pyjamas aren't sexy because they cling
 Unless it's proper silk
 Yeah, silk
 That's a problem
 All the balloons in the house
 So Anthony Horowitz
 Is a thriller writer
 He writes lots and lots and lots of books
 And he, for a while, was the
 James Bond sequels
 He was the official state's choice
 And he wrote a couple of Bond books
 And one of them was called Trigger Mortis
 Great name
 And in the start of the book, in the opening chapter
 Anthony Horowitz wrote a description of Bond
 Jumping out of bed, naked
 And he sent this off to the flaming estate
 And they got back it up and they said, 'You can't have that'
 Because it's official Bond canon
 In one of the books, I can't remember which one it is
 I think it's 'You Only Live Twice' or something
 Bond wears a bed jacket
 Which is maybe the least sexy item
 Of clothing you could possibly imagine
 It kind of buttons up to the neck
 And it goes down to the knees
 The winky night shirt style
 So he just rewrote it not saying that Bond was naked
 He didn't describe the bed jacket
 Because he thought that would be a way of destroying the character
 Bond undid the top button of his night jacket
 Bond hung up his night cap
 On the side
 He just imagine a little packet of Renny's in the pocket
 Oh, there's a hand key in there
 How long has that been in there for?
 Interestingly, for a very long time
 The classic trouser pajama
 With the jacket button up kind of thing
 For a long time, worn by men
 And that changed during World War I
 This is where women started wearing it
 This is according to a professor
 At the University of Glasgow called Lucy Whitmore
 Who talked about the fact that zeppelin raids
 Meant that whenever you heard the alarm
 And you needed to run out of your house
 It got to a point where
 You became quite conscious of what you were wearing
 You would come out in your nightie
 You might look a bit dishevelled
 And also it's not the most practical thing
 To be running around in a nightie
 So to begin with, at the start of it
 It would be people would leave
 Very nice looking jackets in a very good spot
 So that as the raid was happening
 And they would grab it and go out
 And look fashionable
 There was an old lady who suggested leaving
 An emergency toupee by the door as well
 So you could grab that on the way out
 And then eventually people started wearing
 Women rather started wearing pajamas
 And the popular colour was dark blue
 Because if you're outside
 You obviously don't want any extras
 Come on
 You don't want to give away
 I guess if you're being bombed
 You want to do everything to stop yourself from being seen
 Is that also why you need the toupee
 To stop the bald head
 And light reflecting back up
 Dan Widley, I found the same zeppelin based
 First World War fact in it
 I went to the library and did a bit of research
 There are a couple of books about the history of underclothes
 And I sat there looking like a dirty old man
 Sitting in the library
 Or you did have your penis out
 You should never
 Believe me
 But almost
 Every page of the book had a
 Line drawing of some corset
 Or some girdle
 Or something and I just started quickly flipping
 Through the line, I'm just here for the pyjamas
 Actually, I want the least sexy stuff
 Do you know what though, anyone looking at that would go
 That is the most adorable thing
 If that's how you're getting your kicks
 I'm looking at line drawings of ladies petticoats
 It's not Andrew Tate
 Let's be honest
 And what did you find anything extra
 On the underclothes
 The onesie was sort of invented in that period
 Wasn't it? We know Winston Churchill
 He's still not wearing a onesie and that was
 A World War one
 He called his like a bilus
 Siren suit
 I think that was later
 He meant siren suit because of the air raid sirens
 I was thinking that he would sit on a rock and sing
 Imagine if he had a lovely singing voice
 We never really heard him sing
 So I wanted to meet them on the beaches
 We will seduce them on the beaches
 Most men
 Claim not to wear anything to bed
 But you're doubting them
 Okay, interesting
 I am doubting them, I think
 I think the dramas have a reputation of being a bit cosy
 I think there is a sense
 That men want to be thought of as being tough
 And rugged and like I don't wear anything to bed
 Even if it's minus four in the house or whatever
 Is there not and now listen
 I know nothing of the male anatomy
 I'll put that right out there but is there not
 Do things not get a bit twisted and I would
 Imagine discomfort if you slept completely
 Naked as a man, do things not
 Is it not nice at all? Is it alright?
 Is it alright? Good to know
 Good to know, thanks for that
 I've never been woken up by that
 I've never twisted anything
 It's got a trap under the bed again
 Finally you're going to have to fold in the fibre game again
 If you tried to leap out for an air raid
 I feel like that was one of the weirdest moments
 Ever on our podcast where you had
 Three guys sitting here picturing ourselves
 Naked in bed
 There are four listeners now
 The mental images
 Please send in your fan art
 Okay, it is time for fact number three
 And that is Andy
 My fact is the flow of the Amazon
 Is so big that even a hundred miles
 Into the Atlantic you could
 Drink over the side of your ship
 And the water would still be fresh
 That's incredible, I love it
 I should tell where I got this fact first
 It's called Thomas Pueyo on Twitter
 I couldn't believe it when I first read it
 So I did a bit more looking
 Some sources say the water is going to be a bit brackish
 It might not be totally
 Sparkling, Evian style fresh
 But it would definitely be noticeably less salty
 So you would not be able to see South America
 If you were a hundred miles out
 And you would still get water that was much less salty
 If you were, let's say
 You were sailing across the ocean
 Before you knew where you were
 You could keep tasting the water
 And as it got less and less salty
 You could almost find your way to the shore
 What an incredible idea, yeah
 To navigate your way there
 Sailors must have worked that out though
 Because they're very wise
 There will be some sort of sailor rhyme
 Like if the water tastes nice
 If the water tastes nice
 Brazil will be in a trice
 If the water tastes salty
 Then your
 Compass is faulty
 There you go
 So every single day
 The water that we're talking about
 That sort of pushes out
 Into the Atlantic
 It's 17 billion metric tonnes
 Of water that flows out
 It's hard to work out what that is
 What that equates to, if you were getting fresh water
 In New York City
 That's the daily amount for nine years
 That would be used
 Nine years worth of fresh water in New York City
 Is what goes out daily
 In the Atlantic
 They should move New York
 I don't know if that's practical
 But it's weird that we can't somehow
 Harvest it, it's just going
 It's just disappearing
 Becoming salty
 It goes into the water cycle
 And eventually rains down on us
 Yeah, but we could use the planet alive
 I think we've done enough mucking around
 Actually, maybe we should just meet the Amazon
 I actually disagree, I think a huge pike
 At the mouth of the Amazon
 That just takes it all the way to New York
 Brilliant, not New York, but somewhere that needs fresh water
 There's lots of places where they don't have water
 Somewhere closer
 Yeah, exactly
 New Orleans
 I can't see it not working
 I'm just saying, it's a bit of a waste
 That's 17 billion metric tonnes
 It's a waste, I really don't think it's a waste
 Donald Trump listening to this
 Is going to be diverted to his golf courses
 Anyway, the Amazon, it's big
 It's big, it blows my mind
 My mate's got a new Brazilian girlfriend
 And he was saying, you know, you go to Brazil
 It's just massive, mate
 It's just massive
 The thing I always find interesting
 About the Amazon is that you can't build bridges
 Yeah
 Because it's too
 Because the width of it
 Varies so much
 And it's so soft, crumbly at the edges
 So it would have to be such a massive bridge
 Because it would have to start
 And so what, they just go across on boats and stuff
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 I think they've built one now
 There is one, but it's right up at the north
 It's over a tributary
 It's the Rio Negro
 Which is a tributary of the Amazon
 But it's before it joins the river proper
 Basically, so there are no bridges across the Amazon-Amazon
 Like you say, Lucy
 During the wet season, the Amazon
 Is 190 kilometres wide
 But it's widest
 That's why this is really wide
 Imagine from here to Stoke
 Maybe Stafford
 That's further, in fact
 My electric car wouldn't be able to drive
 If there was a bridge that went over that net
 They would have to be a charging point
 On that bridge
 Otherwise they wouldn't be able to get across
 God, it's that wide, that is insane
 I like that the Amazon River is part of
 Effectively an Amazon River sandwich
 It's the meat
 Of a sandwich
 In that
 This is a tortured metaphor
 I know what you're talking about and even I'm struggling
 To come up with this
 There's a river below it
 And there's a river above it
 There's more water above the Amazon River
 In the clouds
 Above the actual Amazon itself
 The clouds follow the shape of the river
 I believe so
 It's water vapor stream, isn't it?
 It's amazing
 I think it's 20 billion tonnes of water
 Yeah, and that's more water
 Than it's actually in the river itself
 They say
 Isn't it something like a big tree
 In the Amazon, perspires
 Or transpires or whatever it is
 A thousand litres of water in a day
 One tree
 And then underneath
 You've got the Hamza
 So secret underground river
 You can only get to it
 If you defeat an Aztec boss
 On the final level
 On the final level
 So
 Under the Amazon there is a sort of aquifer
 That is even wider
 Even bigger
 Even bolder, even fresher
 It's Amazon 2, the revenge
 The River Hamza named after the
 Strictly winner this year obviously
 Oh, not Abu Hamza
 It's got a big hook in it
 Ranger Hamza
 It's quite recently discovered, isn't it?
 So Hamza was the name of the head of the team
 That discovered it, and it's
 Very low down
 4,000 metres below the river itself
 Super slow moving
 To the point where you can't really call it a river
 Like, it's not flowing
 It moves at one millimetre an hour
 I relate to this river very hard
 It's very slow, low down
 If you drop something in it
 You'll be reunited with it quite quickly
 It won't be swept away
 Suddenly
 You game of poostics would be quite low stakes, wouldn't it?
 Exactly
 The Giant Amazon Leech
 Which you find in the Amazon River
 Do you think it's longer or shorter
 Than the world's longest
 Cattail?
 No, I actually
 Know the length of the leech
 But I have no idea about the world's longest cattail
 That's the difficulty of this quiz question
 You actually need two quite arcade bits of knowledge
 To even make a guess
 I think the longest cattail is not that long
 Really?
 It's a domestic cat
 Here we go
 I think the leech is about a forearm
 I think it's about 18 inches
 The biggest giant leech
 The longest ever cattail is longer or shorter than 18 inches
 This gives it away a bit
 It's a Ferndale cat
 Well no, you've made it too easy
 I don't want to submit an answer anymore
 Is it exactly the same length?
 Andy is spot on with the 18 inches
 For the Amazon Leech
 And the longest cattail
 According to Guinness
 Is 17 inches
 Do you think
 That the giant Amazon Leech
 Is longer or shorter
 Than the height
 Of the world's tallest donut
 Right, so
 It's good now we know we've got 18 inches
 Put the donut down flat
 So not the diameter
 Not the roundness, it's how tall it goes
 I think the donut's taller
 No, I think it's still the leech
 Yeah, Andy knows his stuff
 Tallest donut, 16 inches tall
 It was quite wide and fairness
 Yeah, but actually what's that foot and heart
 I mean that's a tall donut
 I could eat that then
 I want the world's biggest donut
 To be a donut that I was like
 I couldn't eat that
 You could make lovely donuts that big
 Or like the ring road of a small town
 Exactly
 Oh this is a great quiz
 Well I loved it, I had a great time
 So this is the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory
 This is a cool thing
 And it's a really new thing as well actually
 So it's an observatory
 But not a space observatory
 It's to look down at the Amazon
 And so it's in the middle of the rainforest
 And the trees are
 What are tall trees, they're about 80 to 100 meters aren't they
 A good tall tree is up to
 You know it's a really tall tree 100 meters
 And the tower, I think the tallest ever tree
 Is about 120 meters, like the tallest ever measured
 But this tower is 325 meters
 Okay, it's about as tall as the Eiffel Tower
 Which actually is really tall when you look at it
 The Eiffel Tower
 Wow busting some myths today out me
 I never think of it as tall
 But actually I went there
 It's big, the Eiffel Tower
 You can see it from a long way away
 Exactly, and this is much thinner than the Eiffel Tower
 It's just one needle going up
 It looks mad this thing
 I was up the Eiffel Tower once
 In a restaurant
 And we had a table next to the window
 It was really nice, it was overlooking the bridge
 And what you would see is
 They had these guys playing
 You know we have three cups and you have to hide the ball
 And just taking loads of money
 And then about every 20 minutes the police would turn up
 And they would leg it
 And then you could watch them go all the way down the river
 Over the next bridge, back over again
 And then back on the bridge and then start playing again
 And then the police would turn up
 It was like a cat and mouse
 I really thought you were going to say that from your perspective
 You could see which carpet was under
 I just yelled
 "Bettle on"
 Your wife's down there looking up
 You've got special cup ball sign language
 You've developed
 How's they doing it?
 We have never been fucked before
 What's done in that restaurant too? We didn't get a window seat
 No, well you need to
 Are there tables where you don't have window seats?
 You're just looking at a big piece of iron
 [Laughter]
 They really saw you coming
 Was it on the ground floor?
 Did you get the basement table?
 [Laughter]
 Didn't know Peter Express was it
 France?
 Wow, oh that's funny
 Is the restaurant still going?
 I didn't even get into the restaurant
 We need it, we'll go together
 I'd love that
 Oh yeah, this observatory is
 325 metres
 It's one metre taller than the Eiffel Tower
 And it's got 1500 steps up
 And it takes about an hour
 to walk up to the top
 I don't know if there's a lift actually
 And basically it's just to sniff
 the breath of the forest
 They're measuring all the chemicals in the air
 Where there are forest fires
 They measure the concentrations and how dangerous that is
 Deforestation
 They can tell things about that
 I think it's amazing
 Imagine you go up and you've forgotten your glasses
 [Laughter]
 I can't even see the guy with the cup and the ball
 [Laughter]
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show
 And that is James
 OK, my fact this week
 is that while playing a psychiatric patient
 in one flew over the cuckoo's nest
 Danny DeVito ended up becoming
 a psychiatric patient himself
 [Groans]
 Was he going method?
 Some people did go method
 We might get to that
 But DeVito's problem
 really is quite sweet actually
 He had recently
 gotten together with Rhea Perlman
 The amazing Rhea Perlman
 And cheers right? Just to put
 her head in your
 Carla can cheers
 And obviously they were filming
 or not obviously but they were filming a long way away
 from where she was
 3000 miles in fact
 and so he was really missed her
 and in order to deal with that separation
 he invented an imaginary friend to talk to at night
 and he became a little bit
 concerned about his mental health
 perhaps because they were making this film
 and there was a lot of it in the air
 and so he decided to see the doctor
 on set who was called Dr. Brooks
 and asked for his advice and Dr. Brooks said
 yeah don't worry about it as long as you're aware that it's an imaginary friend
 imaginary friend is a perfectly normal
 thing to have it's no problem at all
 But also that doctor
 the on set doctor was actually
 in the movie of course
 Was he? It was the weirdest thing was there
 But an amazing man because he owned
 the clinic in which they filmed it
 so it's no wonder they were all a little bit
 stir crazy because they were in an actual mental institution
 filming this very intense
 movie
 He's the one who sort of checks in
 Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy at the start of the film
 and interviews him and I think
 I don't know if he was going to be in it
 but he was really insistent that everyone in the institution
 or the patients got involved with the film
 he was quite forward thinking, you know
 he took lots of the patients on expeditions
 he took them white water rafting
 and he taught them kind of to rappel down cliffs
 and things like, I mean really
 because this was in the 70s they were filming it
 it was pretty progressive at the time
 and I think about 90 inmates ended up involved in the film
 in some capacity or another
 I must say I haven't seen the film
 It's pretty amazing
 and I started reading the book this week
 and got about a third of the way through
 but I think the book's amazing
 and apparently the film's even better
 Tell you what was even better
 it was a stage production
 that was put on about 20 years ago
 2004
 I was in a stage production
 Who were you?
 Were you the giant
 Yes that's me, Chief Brompton
 that was me
 You know what though, so we did this basically
 it was Christian Slater
 from Heather's etc
 came over and was Mc Murphy
 and it was amazing
 because at that time there weren't that many
 Western shows with big Hollywood stars
 Mc Murphy being Jack Dawkins' role in the movie
 Exactly yes, the main guy
 and I played
 I played a nurse who had about two lines
 and some of my friends came to see it
 and they said, we just thought you were being modest
 because I said I'm playing a nurse
 he mumbled over the cookie's nest
 you were just being modest and you were playing nurse ratchet
 but you really were just
 a nurse who has two lines
 because Francis Barber was nurse ratchet
 and Mackenzie Crook was in it
 Mackenzie Crook?
 He played Billy, the little shine
 That's a good role for him
 Shall we super quickly just say what the basic premise is?
 Just for anyone who hasn't seen it
 it's a bit confused
 Jack Nicholson
 it's been so long
 Jack Nicholson plays Mc Murphy
 who is this sort of tear away
 who is sent to this
 secure psychiatric facility
 which nurse ratchet is this
 horrible nurse who
 rules with the reign of terror over everybody
 There is one nice nurse though
 who just has a couple of lines
 To star of
 the entire production
 is that nice nurse
 and then the Indian chief
 spoilers are we worried about that
 I think it came out quite a long time ago
 So anyway
 Jack Nicholson creates this air of chaos
 and rebellion in the place and rebels against
 nurse ratchet and then the chief
 Brompton, the Native American chief
 smothers him with a pillow
 We should maybe say that Jack Nicholson's character
 suffers a lobotomy
 not just the chief Brompton wants to restore
 order in the hospital
 It's a mercy killing
 and the whole sort of thing is
 hey we're not mad, society's
 mad and
 there's a bit of a book where
 Murphy finds out that all the patients
 are allowed to leave if they want to, they just don't
 He's incredibly freaked out by, he says
 why don't you just go home, you're allowed
 and he says I'm not ready to
 It's amazing anyway
 It was a very tense filming experience
 in lots of ways as well because you had a lot of big personalities
 You had Ken Casey
 who wrote the book and then ended up hating the film
 never watched it
 He once started watching it when it was just on TV
 and then he realised what filming he was watching and changed channel
 I love that
 He was channel flipping
 and he was like oh what's this
 This looks great, oh no
 And then so the director was
 Milos Forman and Jack Nicholson
 and Milos Forman had a big disagreement
 about Murphy's character
 and basically it's very ordered
 and then Jack Nicholson arrives
 and he turns the place upside down and
 Milos Forman wanted it to be more like it was already chaotic
 and then he arrives and he sort of draws
 the patients together and they become a team
 and there was a big falling out over there
 and they ended up talking to each other through the cinematographer
 so it would have to be kind of
 Can you tell
 Jack Nicholson to act this way
 I mean it just sounds so tense
 Danny DeVito as well
 I'm a huge fan of Danny DeVito
 and I remembered him as Lou
 in Taxi
 the sort of doer dispatcher
 but when he was in Matilda
 he actually played Matilda
 although he was playing a horrible dad
 but he actually became like a really lovely
 father figure to her
 and then you know in Mum Play with the Cuckoo's Nest
 you could argue that he actually
 was playing a sort of psychiatric patient
 but he was taking care of his mental health
 what I'm saying is he's always the opposite
 of how he appears and actually
 in Twins
 if you put him and Arnold Schwarzenegger together he's taller
 What a film
 he was inducted
 into the New Jersey Hall of Fame
 in 2010
 so I thought I'd look at some other people who are in
 New Jersey Hall of Fame
 so you've got Buzz Aldrin
 Frank Sinatra
 Do you have to be from New Jersey can I just ask
 Well Thomas Edison is there born in Ohio
 Yogi Berra born in Missouri
 Harriet Tubman born in Maryland
 and Albert Einstein
 not even born in America
 so we've all got a shot at the New Jersey Hall of Fame
 proud son of New Jersey
 I think you have to have lived there for a while
 because Einstein worked in Princeton of course
 that's great
 on one from over
 it was nearly defeated by the Cold War
 it didn't get turned into a film because of the Iron Curtain
 you know this
 this is cool
 so the book came out in the early 60s
 and Michael Douglas
 no sorry
 Kirk Douglas bought the rights
 he was in the play
 he was in the first play version
 based on the play not on the book
 which is maybe why Ken Casey hated the film
 so Kirk Douglas was the initial Mc Murphy
 which is mad it's so strange for him to imagine now
 because it's so Jack Nicholson's role
 and then he bought the rights
 and he wrote to Milos Forman in Czechoslovakia
 and said got this great play
 got the rights to where I think it should be a film
 I'll send you a copy of the book
 Milos Forman said great
 the book was then seized by Czech Customs
 in 1963
 and Forman was really annoyed
 because Milos Forman never said thank you for the book
 rude
 it took a decade to sort out
 this misunderstanding between them
 the film was made in something like 1975
 I think
 it took a long time
 and eventually Kirk Douglas gave the rights to his son Michael
 who then said
 shall we just try again with this book thing
 do we think that the Czech Customs
 didn't let the book go initially
 because they were worried
 that it was seditious
 maybe it's not clear
 maybe they just wanted to read it
 I was wondering if it was like the Rubik's Cube
 going in the opposite direction
 I have no idea
 I don't know what their reasoning was
 Kessie was quite notorious
 as a LSD proponent
 he was quite famous with the counterculture of America
 at that point
 he had a bus that he used to take everyone on
 what a radical free thinker
 it was a psychedelic bus
 oh my god a multicoloured bus
 we have those all the time
 London buses are bright red
 that's what it represented
 they were called the Merry Pranksters
 and Tom Warf wrote a whole book about this
 it was a non-fiction book about these guys
 who just would go around
 they used to do things like
 they would have people playing flutes on the top of the bus
 who would feel buses where people have been playing the flute
 were they on LSD?
 just a public safety warning
 do not take acid on a London bus
 it's not a friendly environment to do that
 but it is possible it was the counterculture thing
 and his name was very much associated with that
 it has a good point
 it's interesting because he was an author
 already at this point Kessie
 before he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
 and he was working on a book called Zoo
 and in order to fund it he needed a job
 so he worked at a psychiatric ward
 in order to fund it
 and the book idea came to him when one night he was in there
 I think he was cleaning
 and he was on peyote
 and he was tripping and he saw a full-blown
 Chief Broomden there
 as a sort of vision
 and a psychedelic part of his peyote
 is it like a cactus or something?
 yeah it's like a cactus which you
 it's a drug
 I know it is a word and I know it is a drug but I can't tell you the specifics
 come on and do the big ol' squass
 sorry not to hurt
 but he said he saw a full-blown
 Native American, he said Indian
 Chief Broom, the solution, the whole mothering key to the novel
 and that's how he wrote
 the novel in the novel
 and he's the main like the narrator
 sorry and in the movie not
 he's not and that's why Kessie
 immediately hated it, it wasn't told from the perspective of him
 he's a big character in it
 but he's not
 interestingly the guy who got the role of
 Chief Broomden got it because
 Michael Douglas was sitting next to a used car dealer
 on a plane
 and the used car dealer's dad was an acting agent
 who had a load of Native American actors on his books
 and the thing about Chief
 Broomden is he's about eight feet tall
 and Michael Douglas got a phone call saying
 I just met the tallest Native American guy
 you've ever seen
 and it was Will, something I can't remember his name
 anyway he got the role as Chief
 Will Sampson
 nice name for someone incredibly tall
 and he's got long hair
 so this movie was made
 in an actual as we've said
 hospital
 that was originally it was called
 the Oregon State Mental Hospital
 it's since been renamed as now
 Oregon State Hospital
 and it's an interesting place
 in its own right, it had
 a really controversial bit
 which was they found 5,000 canisters
 of unclaimed human remains in there
 and this was a lot of the patients
 who had been cremated but no one
 had come to collect them
 and they put out the list, they found all the names of the people
 and a lot of relatives, distant relatives
 came and reclaimed them
 and there was a documentary called
 "Lust" that was made about it
 it was pretty mad
 but also they had a railroad
 underneath the hospital
 specifically built one so that they could deliver
 items to different bits of the hospital
 but also to transport patients
 that they didn't want the members of the public
 to have to come across if they were visiting the hospital
 because they were worried something might go wrong
 dangerous, you know, all that sort of stuff
 and some of the tunnels possibly are still there
 but you just walk them now or use bicycles
 it's just Prince Andrew
 in there now
 and then they had a horrible thing
 I found just horrible things about it
 unfortunately, 1942
 there was a mass poisoning by accident
 they were serving scrambled eggs
 and 47 people died from this
 they used
 instead of powdered milk
 they used sodium fluoride
 which is a poison you would use to kill cockroaches
 and that was accidentally added to the scrambled eggs
 and 47 died from that
 in a kitchen
 we had a Christmas party
 and instead of putting white sauce
 on the Christmas pudding, they put garlic sauce on
 which is a very
 less problematic version
 of what you just said
 it's good to know you can relate
 I mean, just saying it's easily done
 yeah, it's easily done
 I want to use cube lube
 instead of
 instead of what?
 it twisted sideways, didn't it?
 should we just quickly mention Louise Fletcher
 she played Nurse Fletcher
 in the film and died last year sadly
 but she was
 amazing and she
 I think she kept herself separate from the rest of the cast
 didn't she, for a lot of the filming
 so that she could be an icy
 authority figure
 and did you do that when you were in the play of Lucy?
 she was an icy authority figure
 in every situation
 didn't she also take all the clothes off though
 at one point
 at the end of filming, wasn't it?
 yeah, she'd go hey guys
 look at this, all along I was fun
 it was her saying
 I'm fun, that's right
 I think she had her underwear on
 I don't think she was fully naked
 she wasn't that much fun
 I'm fun, but I'm not like fun
 there must be a better way
 to have cupcakes
 to ingratiate yourself with their colleagues
 just wait till the end of this podcast
 there were two others
 Anne Bancroft and Angela Lansbury
 were both offered the role but turned it down
 because they didn't want to appear so evil on screen
 wow
 this was in a no-bituary of Louise Fletcher that I read
 and also
 she was repeatedly turned down from roles
 because she was 5 foot 10
 and in those days a lot of the leading men
 were much shorter than that
 and she couldn't play roles opposite people
 who were shorter or about the same height
 and actually in the nurses' cap
 she'll be more than 6 foot
 and Jack Nilsson is quite a short guy
 but it really works for the authority
 for the sort of power struggle happening between them
 she's brilliant
 on Star Trek
 yeah, that's right
 she said that she found
 her role so disturbing
 that she also couldn't watch the film
 on Star Trek
 yeah
 aliens are scary
 did she, as Nurse Ratchet
 she found it really hard
 and she just found it too disturbing
 to watch as a role
 actually the last time I watched it
 which was a couple of years ago, the person I was watching it with
 sided with Nurse Ratchet
 which didn't make me think, no, hang on
 you've taken the wrong message there
 and she said, no, no, no, look, the point is
 someone's got to keep order
 just take a job from where he was running the place
 it would be an absolute mayhem
 one last thing just about Ken Cassie
 the author, because he was a pretty amazing author
 his method for a certain period when he was writing
 was to be completely
 off his head on drugs
 and he would write a crazy amount
 then in the morning, he'd sober up and become his own editor
 so he'd sort of say, okay
 let's see what the author's written
 and chop out all the junk
 and get down to the good meat of it
 wow, that's clever
 apart from presumably the first draft was absolute junk
 shit
 just didn't make any sense at all
 and then you'd think, hang on
 what if the editor was drunk as well
 but I'll do different drugs
 then I'll make the copy editor will be sober
 so that'll be fine
 okay, as long as the printer is sober
 it'll be fine
 okay, that's it
