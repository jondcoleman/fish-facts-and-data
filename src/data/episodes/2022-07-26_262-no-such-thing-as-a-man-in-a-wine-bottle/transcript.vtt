00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.440
 this week coming to you live from the Hammersmith event of my party!

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.920
 [Cheering]

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Annotasinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.680
 James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.480
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.080
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.940
 Okay, my fat this week is that in the 18th century London plays written by David Garrick

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.740
 and starring David Garrick would often be shown in theatres owned by David Garrick.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:09.500
 They would then be reviewed by David Garrick in newspapers owned by David Garrick.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.820
 Amazing guy, wasn't he?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.500
 He was a man of many talents, apparently according to the reviews I read.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.660
 So yeah, I mean, he ran the Dory Lane theatre, he was a great actor, a lot of you will have

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 heard of him.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.780
 He also had the St. James' Chronicle and the public advertiser, in the Chronicle it said Mr.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 Garrick was most extraordinarily accurate in every syllable which he uttered.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.060
 And his spelling is really good, too.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.140
 He was a really exciting character for theatre, he was someone who brought in the old, he championed

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.700
 Shakespeare, but he also was looking at new technologies to make plays more interesting.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.140
 So for example, when he played Hamlet, he designed a wig that when the ghost of his father

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.260
 walked in, stood up on edge, he did change the way people acted weirdly.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.580
 So before Garrick came along, then for instance, spectators would be on the stage, you guys

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.020
 would be up here with us, like during the performance into mingling and he said, "Let's not

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 do that."

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.020
 No, let's not do that.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.020
 Let's definitely not do that.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.020
 Let's do that.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.700
 He made actors come to rehearsals, which really pissed them off, he abolished the practice

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.100
 of people, audience members coming in at the interval for half price, so people were coming in the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.460
 middle of Hamlet and then spent the whole time going, "So who's that guy?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.260
 Why is she so upset?"

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.740
 But actually that was really, really controversial, wasn't it?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.620
 There were riots because of that.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.420
 So when he decided against the half price thing, he came on stage and all the people in the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.940
 pit, so it used to be that you had rich people in the top and you'd have really poor people

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.340
 in the pit, or poorer people in the pit.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.540
 Let's hear it from the rich people up there.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 They're all the same price.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.180
 So he came on stage and the people in the pit said that he had to stop this half price thing,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.620
 "Oh, bring it back," I should say, and he said he'd have to consult his business partner

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.020
 and he was booed off stage.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.580
 Was this business partner David Garrick?

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.260
 That's him in massage.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.460
 And then the actors came on and then they were also booed off stage and then finally, according

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.900
 to the article from the time that I read, "At eight o'clock the ladies were asked to leave

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 so the house might be burnt."

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.900
 Whoa.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.140
 Oh, that's so thoughtful.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.780
 It's really, like the theatre was a riser's place.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.620
 So the character, sitting on the stage thing, that was the result of a 15 year campaign.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.700
 It took 15 years to get people to stop sitting on the stage.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 And there was also Garrick, the way he changed acting as well was very cool because before Garrick,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.180
 and there was another guy called Maclin, who was a huge rival of Garricks, but before that,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.100
 actors were basically stand with their feet at 10 and to shouting, essentially shouting.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.580
 And Garrick was such a good actor because he paid attention to the other people he was on

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.900
 stage with, rather than just waiting for news.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.260
 So James Quinn told that.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.340
 But the reviews would say things like he even acts when he's not acting.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.580
 There's blue people's minds.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.580
 What does that mean?

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.380
 It means he pretended to listen to the other people on stage.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.380
 He was playing a part.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.820
 He stayed in character, rather than just going back to standing neutrally like a dummy waiting

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.820
 for his turn to shout.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820
 Oh, okay, right.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.420
 Well, wondering off stage, when it's not your line, you just go and get a coffee and come

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.420
 again.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.420
 Yeah.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.260
 So acting did used to be very different, as we said beforehand, the leading actor, the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.900
 greatest rival to Garrick was a guy called James Quinn, who was known as the bellower.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.300
 And he was London's best actor because he had a very loud voice.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.220
 And also, he was very good at gesticulating.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.220
 So there were three hallmarks of great acting, number one, very loud voice, number two, excessive

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.220
 gesticulating, and number three, incredibly long pauses.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.740
 So actors at the time were schooled in three different types of pauses.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.980
 You had moderate, longer, and grand.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.980
 Wow.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.980
 Wow.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980
 He sounds like very much like Brian Blessed, doesn't he?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.980
 He sounds so much.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.860
 But was he not famous for killing people?

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.860
 I think.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 He was in a lot of jewels, Quinn.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.860
 Yes.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.860
 Right.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.860
 Right.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.780
 I read that he killed a fellow actor who mispronounced the word Kato as Kato on stage.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.780
 What?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.780
 I think that's fair enough.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.460
 Dan, you would not have lasted five minutes if you've seen that.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.020
 But that was, like, that did happen.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.100
 So you mentioned Andy Charles McClend, who was Garek's rival, I think.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.460
 And McClend once killed a fellow actor for borrowing his wig.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460
 That's harsh.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.140
 Well, because he had that one that stood up, and not many people had.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.140
 Yes, true.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.340
 So we mentioned the riots briefly.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.340
 Oh, yes.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.580
 I just had a one theatrical riot I wanted to share with you guys.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.180
 So this was in Dury Lane.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.780
 It was in 1755, and a Swiss ballet master had brought a festival to Dury Lane, very exciting.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.500
 And the press were furious because he had brought Frenchmen and French women onto an English

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.900
 stage, and they would live it.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.300
 So someone in a gallery cried out that the dancers were disguised French soldiers, which

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.860
 obviously they were not.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.460
 It was a ballet festival.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.180
 And one of the actors shouted back, "I'm not French, I'm Swiss."

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.700
 And one of the protestors then shouted back, "Swiss, what the devil do we know of Swiss?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.980
 A Swiss is a foreigner."

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.220
 And all foreigners are Frenchmen.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.260
 So this went on for a few nights, and then on the fifth night, they just started the spectators

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.620
 to start ripping up the benches and destroying the chandeliers and destroying the scenery on

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620
 stage.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.940
 Constantly, we're doing it, tearing theaters apart.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.940
 I don't know how many theaters are still standing.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.580
 I think one of the most famous theatre riots was in 1809, and that was the Covent Garden

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 theatre riots.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.900
 Basically, the Covent Garden theatre had been burned down, and they thought we'll use this

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.940
 as an excuse to rebuild it and put up prices.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.020
 And they also rebuilt it so that if you were in the upper tiers, you could only see the

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.460
 legs of the people on stage.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.060
 And this really annoying people.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.580
 And they properly rioted.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.300
 So they had this chart, which was old prices, old prices.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.260
 The noise was so bad that soldiers were constantly having to be sent up to restore order.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.700
 The rioting lasted three months.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.060
 And the audiences did things like they would bring live pigs into the audience.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.500
 They brought rattles, they brought trumpets.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.660
 They brought pigeons very often and released them into the auditorium.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.340
 And they wore these badges with OPs, standing for old price.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.020
 It was quite nice, but of merch for the rioters.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.980
 In the same year as the Swiss riot, Garrix Theatre posted an advert in the press to try and

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.940
 find out who it was that flung a hard piece of cheese of near half a pound weight from one

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.500
 of the galleries last Tuesday night and greatly hurt a young lady in the pit.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.620
 Oh my god, was it spelt greatly, like, GR80?

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:02.380
 Do you know that he went to, when he was at school, he was taught by Samuel Johnson.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.380
 Yeah.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.380
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380
 And this was in Litchfield.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.620
 And Samuel Johnson had to start a school, basically, because he was not allowed to be

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.060
 a part of an already existing school.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.620
 And the reason that they said is, it was feared that the way that he was able to distort

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.500
 his face all the time would scare the children.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.260
 So they were like, your face is too scary.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.260
 You can't teach here.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.860
 So he set up, yeah, he set up his own school.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.340
 And there were only three pupils at it, one of which was David Garrix.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.620
 And then after school, they went to London together.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.620
 That's...

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.980
 The school shut down, didn't it, because it had three pupils.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.980
 Yeah.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.980
 So then they went to London.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.980
 Yeah.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.860
 Can I just one more thing about a very exciting event in the 18th century, Theatre World.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.980
 Another big thing was 1749 at the Haymarket Theatre.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.780
 They were adverted all over London, that the bottle conjurer was going to be performing.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.100
 And no one knew who this was.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.260
 It's a mystery to this very day.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.220
 But what was advertised was that, various things, it said that you could give him a walking

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.900
 cane on stage, and he would tap it and play the sound of any instrument you liked with

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.060
 his tapping.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.620
 You could wear a mask, and even if you wore a mask, he'd be able to tell you who you were.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.620
 And then the P.S. to resistance was, he'll have a common wine bottle on stage.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.780
 He will go into it, and sing in it.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.780
 And did you...

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.780
 So we would climb into the bottle?

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.580
 You would climb into the wine bottle, yes.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.060
 And sing in the wine bottle, and during his stay in the bottle, any person may handle it.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.060
 And so...

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.060
 This must...

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.900
 And I've seen some of your wine bottles, and they are pretty big.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.220
 Why do they make them next so tiny?

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.660
 Otherwise, I'd go in myself.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.780
 But this huge audience turned up, because it was a court, so which I think it was about

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.860
 a bit bigger than a normal wine bottle, a liter or whatever.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.060
 But a massive audience turned up, including the king's son, lots of nobility.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.020
 There was obviously a ruse, he wasn't going to climb inside a wine bottle.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.060
 And so people got really pissed off, and so they went, and he didn't turn up, no one came

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.060
 on stage.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.820
 And the benches were torn out, this was the Haymarket Theatre, Big Theatre, Scenery

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.580
 Totally Destroyed, Debris was dragged out of the theatre, and all of the stuff inside

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.540
 the theatre was set on fire.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.460
 And one newspaper explained this the next day, the fact that the guy hadn't turned up

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.140
 and climbed inside a wine bottle, explained it by saying he had given a private audience

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.620
 beforehand.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.140
 And we're upon receiving a demonstration of the trick, the viewer, as in that private audience

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.060
 had caulked up the bottle and whipped it in his pocket and made of.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:38.580
 Of, okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.940
 My fact this week is that the main source for Sigmund Freud's work on paranoid schizophrenia

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.220
 was the memoirs of a man who made unbelievable and ludicrous claims.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:56.100
 That man's name was Dan Schreber.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.660
 Daniel Paul Schreber was his name.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:08.020
 This is a guy he lived from 1842 to 1911, and he wrote a memoir, memoirs of my nervous illness,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.740
 and in it he was kind of trying to show what it was like from the inside of someone who

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.500
 was having all of these thoughts and so on, published the book, and Freud picked it up,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.500
 and never met him.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.260
 They lived at the same time, but didn't want to meet him because he didn't want to be influenced

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.260
 by it.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.260
 He just used the book.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.180
 And that was the basis for a lot of his Freud's work.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.700
 Daniel Schreber's book is still in publication, if you go into book shops, that memoir.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.100
 It's how important it is.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.020
 So Schreber thought that there were little men living inside his feet that were taking

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.700
 out his genitals and then putting female genitals in so he could have God's child.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.700
 Yes.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.620
 Putting female genitals into his feet or into the place where they're normally are.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.620
 Oh yeah.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.740
 But it was very hard to walk.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.740
 Yeah.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.420
 He was mad, wasn't he, Freud?

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.420
 Freud.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.420
 Freud was, yeah.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.940
 Not this guy with the vagina in his foot, I think he was fine.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.700
 There were just so many things that were wrong about what he thought.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.420
 So he had a lifelong fear of trains.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.500
 They went for it and that was based on an experience he had in his early childhood which he explained

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.780
 in a letter 40 years after the event.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.740
 And he explained to one of his friends that when he was three years old, he'd moved house,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.280
 his whole family had moved house, not just him.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.700
 And they'd moved, gone by train and he explained that he'd seen his mother naked on the overnight

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.300
 train and he thought, you know, from that experience, he'd been permanently traumatized

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.380
 by seeing his mother naked and obviously being sexually attracted to her.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.580
 So there is an idea that he had this theory of the eat-up as complex.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.940
 And now it's thought that maybe he had one, but it's not true that everyone has one.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.900
 You know, he was almost not a psychiatrist.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.260
 He first started the first paper that he ever published was on eels and it was his attempt

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.780
 to locate their testicles.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.140
 That was what he was doing.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.340
 He dissected 400 eels looking for their testicles, just was obsessed.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.100
 He was like, they've got to be somewhere.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.380
 And at what stage do you go, I've done 399?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.380
 Yeah.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.380
 400, 400 was the same.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.380
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.340
 Because he published the paper saying, didn't find them, but this was one of the great mysteries

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.340
 of the age.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.340
 It was.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.340
 We don't know who he was.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.340
 So what?

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.180
 No one knew where eels bred and male eels only have gonads when they need them basically.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.940
 So Aristotle said that eels came from nothing.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.620
 That was his great theory.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.380
 I don't like to do what a chance is.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.180
 He sometimes said they came from the guts of wet soil as well.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.180
 Yes.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.180
 Yeah.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.180
 And some people said they came out of thash roofs.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.620
 I mean, no one knew.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.740
 So, but the thing was Freud, when he wrote this paper, he said, well, they must have all

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.740
 been female.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.100
 That's the only explanation I can think of rather than that he got it wrong.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.340
 And I read a great essay online which asked, you know, what, this must have been very

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.740
 formative for Freud, it said, we know now that Freud viewed most people's problems through

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.900
 a sexual lens, but was that lens tinted by the set of testicles he couldn't find a lifetime

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.900
 ago?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:13.180
 Did his inability to locate the eels reproductive organs prove so prominent in his studies that

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.620
 he saw them everywhere he went in the manner that a rare car owner begins to see his car

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.220
 everywhere soon after driving it off the lot?

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.140
 So weird as similarly I've ever heard.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.940
 He hated women though, didn't he?

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.660
 Maybe that's all about the eels testicles as well.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.780
 He was the heinous sexist.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.860
 So he said that women should be basically avoided because they were too susceptible to

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.180
 being seduced.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.580
 He advised his friends against hanging out with them at all.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:47.140
 He said that they have an ineptitude for serious life tasks that they are unstable, incapable

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:52.500
 of grasping their own unimportance and their people.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.860
 He said nature's inclined them to be vain and he said the only thing that women contributed

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.780
 to society are a plating and weaving because women traditionally were, they did do a lot

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.660
 of weaving and plating and he attributed this to obviously their desire to have a penis.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:15.020
 And so what he said was women are so upset about not having a penis that their plotting

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.660
 is expressing their desire to plot their pubic hair in order to conceal the fact that they

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.180
 have no male genitals on their face.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.180
 It's a killer.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.100
 What's interesting is, you say he didn't like women but it was a woman who actually helped

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.260
 him get to his biggest breakthrough in psychiatry when sitting with them and she was appropriately

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.620
 called Fanny.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.980
 Fanny Moser was her name.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:44.300
 He was treating her and he used to do it through hypnosis but he was a terrible hypnotist.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:50.540
 You're unstable, you're weak, you wish you had a penis.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.380
 So he used to do that, you're getting sleepy thing and Fanny Moser said actually I don't

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.620
 think I am and he was like no you aren't, I really don't think I am.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.700
 So she just started talking and she was laying on the couch and kept talking and kept talking

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.780
 and he thought hang on a second, this is amazing.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.660
 I'm actually getting stuff here that's real and raw and that was the game changer for

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.660
 him.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.500
 In a way, the talking here was invented because a woman told him to shut the fuck up

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:22.140
 because she, honestly because he, because Fanny, he used to say his theories to her and

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.860
 at one point she just said honestly please shut up because without your comments I can properly

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.260
 let my mind wander and work out what's going on and he was like okay cool, I'll just

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.260
 step back.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.340
 Yeah, while he saw sex everywhere, didn't he?

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.780
 He thought anything elongated such as sticks or tree trunks or umbrellas represented the

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:44.380
 penis. He said that walking up and down steps symbolise a sexual act.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.340
 You guys in the circle?

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.340
 Sounds like it.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.460
 What was his day to day like but he just saw penises everywhere.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.980
 It must have been so distracting.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.060
 Do you guys know what the first Freudian slip was?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.060
 Oh no.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.060
 No.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:07.980
 So the first Freudian slip was a young man who said Xoriare, X nostris or Cibus Ulto, when

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:15.460
 as you all know, he should have said Xoriare, Alicuis, nostris, X, Cibus, Ulto, so I mean it's

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.460
 obvious isn't it?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.460
 I think it's like maybe a loving at that.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.980
 So basically it was the suppression of the word Alicuis meant that he must have had some

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.820
 association with that word.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.380
 So he did a word association and said what does that make you think of and eventually got

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:40.980
 to a word which was Saint Genuarius and Saint Genuarius kept his blood in a file which was supposed

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.860
 to have turned into liquid once a year and then was solid the rest of the time and then

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.580
 the man confessed that his girlfriend had missed her period and so Freud concluded that

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.940
 he had blocked out this word from ten minutes ago because he associated that with the fact

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.060
 that his girlfriend might be pregnant.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:07.060
 You shouldn't give your blood in a file, it makes the cardboard soggy.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.740
 Have we talked about the cocaine, I don't think we have, a huge fan of cocaine.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.440
 He experimented with it as a student believing it would alleviate his depression and anxiety

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.260
 and great news it did and he just started posting, it was this bizarre period where you were

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.740
 just posting cocaine around because it wasn't really illegal so he sent it to his fiancee

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:32.020
 to make us strong. She must have been plotting like mad after that.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.740
 He gave it to his great friend who was called Fleischel because Fleischel was addicted to

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.060
 morphine and he said I know something that will cure you morphine addiction, try cocaine.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:48.100
 Fleischel then became completely addicted to cocaine and he claimed it had been a success

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.740
 but it had not.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.700
 One of the things he justified it with when he was recommending it to this guy whose life

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.820
 was ruined by Freud forcing cocaine on him. Freud said the wonderful thing about cocaine,

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.940
 the best thing about it is there is absolutely no craving for the further use of cocaine

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:13.700
 after your first take it or even repeatedly.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:20.140
 Your seat number has been taken down but I was looking into with Freud just off the back

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.220
 of David Garrick I thought what did he do as hobbies did he go to the theater for example

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.420
 and I could only find one example and it was to see a guy who we've mentioned very briefly

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.220
 on this podcast before called Le Petalmaine.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.500
 Le Petalmaine, the fighter, his act was to just fart on stage.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.420
 What's interesting is it wasn't that he was eating generating gas and farting he was sucking

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.540
 air up into his bum and farting it back out so he discovered this when he was in the

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:53.540
 ocean and he was almost drowning he notices the ocean getting very slightly lower.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.780
 As he was drowning he went and it went both in and up at the same time and he was like

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.060
 that's weird he came back to the surface he went to the beach and it all flooded out

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.620
 of his butt and he thought what's happening here so highlights of his act they involved

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.460
 the effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms from his bum.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.540
 He could play Osolomio through a sort of rubber tube in his bum.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.700
 I don't know that would you mind performing it?

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.740
 We know it as just one conneto.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.020
 And that's who that's Sigmund Freud, the only example I could find of him going to the

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.660
 theater was to see the farting man.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.860
 Well he was very into defecation.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.020
 He thought that was extremely important.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.020
 Freud was, yeah.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:41.020
 Alright so was he going follow through, follow through?

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:48.140
 So he was convinced that obsession with defecation and obsession with money were related and

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.580
 he said that he was obsessed with money himself.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.780
 He said money is like laughing gas to me, he loved being rich and he thought that being

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:02.460
 into excrement was something that transferred and later life into being into money and he

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.780
 said that like there's a constant association with them in our minds and because it's the

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.500
 contrast he thought between the most precious thing which is money and the least precious thing

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.980
 which is shit.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.380
 And he also said it's because there's this perfect transition.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.060
 So when you're in your youth, you're he thought erotically interested in defecation but

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.420
 not money and then as soon as that starts to recede you become erotically interested in

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.420
 money.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.180
 And so he thought they were intrinsically related.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.180
 Whoing and money.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:39.460
 As we understand he was wrong about everything.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:48.460
 My fact this week is that swordfish can speed up and slow down time with their minds.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.980
 So this is this amazing thing that has been discovered about swordfish quite recently.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.060
 So if you say speed up and slow down time and the end time is about how you're perceiving

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.060
 stuff right.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.180
 The swordfish if hunting their time perception is about the same time as ours which means

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.540
 that they basically are processing all the images that are coming into their eyes and

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.700
 their brain is pressing that as fast as we do.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.940
 So the experience time in the same way as we do but if they're not hunting then time

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.620
 goes about five times more slowly for them it all slows down and they can do this deliberately.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.580
 So what they do is they heat up their brains and their eyes and that just makes them be

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.940
 able to absorb more information.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.300
 So the faster you can see light coming into your eyes and all these images then the slower

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.300
 time comes.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.340
 It's amazing and it means that they can hunt better right?

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.340
 Yeah exactly.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.940
 So it's like a good kind of an analogy is if you swap a fly or you try to swap a fly

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.460
 then you're usually unsuccessful and that is because they are seeing way more frames

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.980
 per second than you are.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.220
 So you think you've got really close but to them like it's like so easy.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.340
 Like to a fly if they watch a movie it's just like a drawing and then a bit of a weight

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.020
 and then another drawing and then a bit of a weight and that's why we say time flies.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.020
 No it isn't.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.020
 Yes it isn't.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.100
 I'm pretty sure it is.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.940
 So what happens because I've actually swatted flies.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.900
 Do I have access to faster time?

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.420
 No you're not a neo in this analogy.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.700
 No it means that they just didn't see you coming but if they were to see you coming it

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.700
 would be like neo isn't it?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.580
 It's like in the matrix you kind of see it slowing down and coming towards you really

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.300
 really slowly.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.300
 And the weird thing is that they knew that swordfish did this thing with a heat up their

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.620
 eyes and their brains.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:34.380
 They found that out a few years ago but they only just realized why and they did it by removing

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.860
 the retiners of freshly caught swordfish and they put them in a bath and they connected

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:45.700
 them to some electrodes to measure their response of those retiners to lots of flashes

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:51.220
 of light and they changed the temperature of the bath that the retinas were in and when

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.300
 it was in a hotter bath then their response to light was ten times faster so their response

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.420
 their ability to absorb lots of information and this is just a detached retina fully detached

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.180
 from the fish which is being eaten somewhere and that retina responded ten times faster

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.700
 to the light that was being given to it than if they were in a bath that was much colder.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.700
 It is amazing.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.220
 Do you know they don't stab their prey?

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.700
 I sort of vaguely assume that they would stab it.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.260
 Because they have like a really long swordfish and they're sort of up a jaw and I just assume

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.100
 that they would cabab as it were.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.100
 Yeah.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.940
 I think the problem would be if you're a fish and you cabab a fish you can't grab it with

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.740
 your hands can you because you don't have hands?

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.740
 Very true.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.300
 If you were feeding others if you went round as the cabab.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.300
 If you are the cabab.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.300
 Yes.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.300
 That would be very nice.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.300
 Yeah.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.300
 So for a coffee party.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300
 Your waiter comes over.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300
 Yeah.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.300
 What a party that would be where the waiter had all the food balanced on his nose for

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.300
 you.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.300
 Yeah.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.300
 I'd go.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300
 But the problem is their solitary fish so they can't do that.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.300
 They can't eat off each other's noses.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.940
 Oh, they're quite solitary.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940
 But they do.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.940
 Yeah, they're very solitary.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.620
 But what they do is, they did not know this.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.540
 So they do their sailfish do this as well, another fish with a very, very long up a jaw.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.540
 They slowly put their bill into a school of sardines or other smaller fish and then yeah,

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.540
 yeah, yeah, they thrash their head from side to side, sorrow, like sorrow.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.540
 Yeah.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.060
 And then they've, they've, they've injured enough fish in that.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, bit.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.980
 And that they can catch them.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.980
 They can then just eat them.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.180
 I mean, it's amazing how they do that with the noses.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.940
 Because they will slot their noses into a big school of fish that they've heard it into a big

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.940
 cluster.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.500
 And the fish don't notice.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.860
 So you can see the swordfish or the sailfish's nose sitting in amongst them, just wasting with

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.660
 all the fish coming around.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:39.180
 They sweat out of their noses, but instead of sweating sweat, they sweat lube.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.100
 Is there, what's the, what's the purpose of it?

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.100
 Well, it makes them really slippery and it means they can swim really, really quickly.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.100
 Oh, okay.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.100
 Yeah.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.380
 That's a sexy evening where you go, did you bring the swordfish?

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.380
 Insistently.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.300
 In the 18th century, it was believed that swordfish would dive out of the way if they heard

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.580
 anyone speaking Italian.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.860
 So all the local fishermen spoke Greek the whole time.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.860
 Wow.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.860
 Wow.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.500
 But we think what that actually was, it was basically an excuse for not catching them.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.740
 So you have a cartony swordfish, oh, it's because, you know, Leonardo has been speaking

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.460
 Italian, that's why we didn't catch them.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.020
 We're going to have to move on very shortly to our next act.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.460
 Just one last bodily control thing.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.460
 Yeah.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.660
 So this is about heating yourself up.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.100
 There are monks in Tibet who can decide how hot they are just through meditation.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.100
 I mean, really?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.980
 Yes, it's been tested and it's not like a huge difference.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.380
 It's not as though they'll be dangerous to touch.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.020
 But they can increase the temperature of their extremities just through meditation.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.300
 They train themselves a bit of years and they're quite good at it.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.820
 There is a report which says that if you put wet sheets on them, they could be dry within

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.820
 an hour.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.820
 But I think that is not true.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.420
 I think that's an exaggeration.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.380
 Also, I think it's quite offensive to do that.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.140
 I'm meditating.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:02.380
 OK, it is time for our final factor, the show, and that is Andy.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.660
 My fact is that in 1986, Waddington's invented a board game which was all about trading cattle

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.940
 semen.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.940
 This is a real game, it's called "Grade Up to Elite Cow".

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:20.540
 It sells itself as a game of skill and chance for dairy farmers.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:27.060
 And we have a copy here tonight.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.220
 That's good, it says from two to 3,000 players.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:38.100
 This was by the British Freezing Cattle Society and it's basically marketing for cattle farmers.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.380
 It's like monopoly, basically, but instead of property, you collect semen.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.340
 So there are various squares all the way round.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.820
 There are risks and rewards.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:53.100
 Here's one of the squares, "Accident to semen flask, all your semen is lost unless an insurance

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.740
 policy is held.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.540
 Return all your semen discs."

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.540
 It's incredible.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.540
 It's amazing.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.780
 Has anyone ever played this, do you know?

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.780
 Lots of people.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.940
 If you go online, I started googling, so many people have played it.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.940
 Really?

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.260
 There's a great website called "BoardGameGeek.com" and they have a lot of reviews.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.260
 Oh, nice.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.260
 Cool.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.460
 But the reviews are, I mean, no one really loves the game, but they love the idea of it.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:23.020
 So one of the reviews was monopoly with cows and semen.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.940
 The rules are quite complicated.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:30.740
 You start with little cows and you go around the board and there are various semen companies.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.260
 There's one thing, which is there's many pitfalls along the way as you're going around.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.220
 So you can pick up those market cards that you get, sort of like monopoly, which will

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:45.380
 state stuff like, "This cow has persistent mastitis, seller at the market price."

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.020
 It's a thoroughly realistic game, basically.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.020
 Is it?

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.020
 Well, yeah, I think so.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.020
 I think that's very deceitful.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.500
 You can't sell a cow at market price or a persistent mastitis.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.620
 I noticed you didn't do this in Devon where we were last week.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.100
 You've been picked out of town.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.100
 That's true.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.940
 So is it to help farmers?

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.780
 It doesn't help anything really.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.260
 It's not helping anyone.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.740
 But there are lots of more games where the point was to help.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.340
 So they used to have very moral purposes.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:18.860
 So the new game of human life was a 1790 classic and the aim of that was to be the first player

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.860
 to become an old man.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.860
 That's it.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.300
 Surely whoever's oldest at the start has that advantage.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.860
 You have to move through the seven periods of life and accumulate moral observations along

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.860
 the way.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.300
 Have you heard of Trump the game?

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.300
 No.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.980
 That was quite a big one, actually.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.740
 It was launched in 1989 with the tagline, "It's not whether you win or lose, it's whether

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.740
 you win."

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.740
 That's great.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.740
 That's great.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.740
 That's great.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.740
 That's great.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.740
 That's great.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.740
 I hope it's on his gravestone.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.740
 Yeah.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.740
 Yeah.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.780
 The head of Parker Brothers said, "It can leave you exhausted and feeling like you don't

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.780
 want to play again."

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.740
 Words later attributed to Stormy Daniels.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.740
 Yes.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.580
 Can I just, you mentioned the game of life, I think, the early version, and I used to play

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:11.100
 the game of life as a kid and it's amazing, but it actually started in 1860 and at that time

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.540
 it was called The Checkered Game of Life.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:20.460
 It was made by this lithographer, so like an image printer, an artist called Milton Bradley,

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.860
 and he was very successful at the game of life, but the reason he had to make it is because

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.700
 he'd been very unsuccessful in another way, so if you've ever played the game of life,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:35.100
 the reason it exists is because Milton Bradley made lithographs of Abraham Lincoln, and

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.380
 that was when he was a presidential nominee, he wasn't very well-known, and he didn't have

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.380
 a beard.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.380
 They were clean shaver.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.180
 Wasn't it like a little girl who told him to get a beard or something?

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.180
 It was.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180
 Yeah.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180
 So him and this little girl would have beef.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.300
 So he sold these lithographs really well, and they were extremely popular, and then Lincoln

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.140
 suddenly thought, "I'll grow my distinctive beard that everyone will associate with me

00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:00.780
 forevermore," and the prince became totally worthless, and this guy, Milton Bradley, went completely

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.740
 bankrupt, and then he grew to the game of life, and he was a very moralistic guy, so the game

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:11.260
 of life, if you've ever played it, has a spinning thing in the centre rather than a dice, and

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:16.540
 that is because dice were associated with gambling, and he was very Christian, and dice were evil,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:25.860
 so he had a spinning tea totem, then it's not funny actually, it's evil.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.860
 That's what it has, but it became super popular.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.940
 Oh, this is something that I think we may have mentioned before, so during the Second World

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:38.580
 War, MI9, which is like the cool version of MI5 and 6, they smuggled escape kits to prisoners

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.220
 of, you know, Allied prisoners of war who were being held in Germany, they smuggled the

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:47.540
 escape kits inside Monopoly, and the other thing they did, they got in touch with another

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.300
 firm, and they distributed snakes and ladders kits with genuine escape equipment hidden

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.300
 inside.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.980
 Not the actual ladders, you couldn't escape with others.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.980
 No, it wasn't the actual laddy you could put.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.900
 If I were a prison guard and someone had a snake and ladders kit delivered with an enormous

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.740
 spade within the box, I would notice.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.540
 Yeah, but they genuinely did it.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.540
 Amazing.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:16.580
 That was invented by one of Anne Frank's schoolmates.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.580
 Wow.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.580
 Yeah.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.660
 And it was two people who invented guess who.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.660
 They became a couple.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.140
 They actually knew each other at that time as well.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.060
 They used to walk to school together in the morning, but didn't go to the same school.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.900
 And they ultimately invented not only guess who, but over a hundred board games, many of

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.420
 which we know the names of, or might have played, for various different countries.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:42.140
 But they started, their very first thing was inventing a thing for the Borden dairy company.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.020
 So they started by working for cows as well.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.260
 But that couple, they, I think, got separated at one point.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:55.740
 And they had to, well, the guy had to find her and, you know, he went to the police station

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.660
 and they said, "Does she have glasses?"

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.660
 And he said, "No."

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.220
 And they said, "Well, is she wearing a hat and a mask?"

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:07.420
 It's God, that was a long one.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.140
 The Soviet Union had amazing games.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.140
 Yeah.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.140
 They were also very moralistic.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.140
 So there was the game, tuberculosis, a proletarian disease.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:21.260
 That was, look after your health, the new hygiene game, the abandoned where you had to round

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.580
 up homeless children and take them to an orphanage.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.340
 And my favourite, healthy living, where you had to become the healthiest worker possible.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.740
 So basically it was the Soviet Union trying to inculcate its values into people.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.020
 So you would be penalised for consulting folk healers or drinking a beer at lunch or

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.460
 consulting with a strange woman.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.460
 Wow.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.460
 There you are.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.460
 Crazy.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.460
 We're going to have to wrap up soon, guys.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.500
 There's a kickstarter where you can get involved at the moment.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:53.660
 It's a board game and it's called Brexit, the board game of second chances.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.660
 And third chances.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.300
 And they say, "We invite you to relive that historic

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.140
 referendum, but this time you're in control."

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.140
 God.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.060
 "On like no one being in control."

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.420
 It's like you've gone to hell.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.540
 Honestly, if someone, if the devil said to you, "I invite you to relive that historic

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.540
 referendum and this time you're in control."

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.980
 You'd be like, "Oh cool, this is hell then."

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.820
 They say, "This is the absolute must have game to make all this political mayhem fun

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.820
 again."

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:33.380
 I'll just go one last thing, which is sometimes there are mistakes on board games.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.580
 And in 2017, the makers of the Anton Dex Saturday Night Takeaway board game were forced

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.740
 to apologise after it was found to contain multiple errors.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:47.260
 One question claimed that the moon is 225 miles from the earth.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.700
 Okay, that is it.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.900
 That is all of our facts.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.900

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.900
