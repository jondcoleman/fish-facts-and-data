00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:22,320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,440
 this week coming to you live from the Hammersmith event of my party!

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,920
 [Cheering]

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Annotasinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,680
 James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,480
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,080
 Starting with you, James.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,940
 Okay, my fat this week is that in the 18th century London plays written by David Garrick

10
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,740
 and starring David Garrick would often be shown in theatres owned by David Garrick.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:09,500
 They would then be reviewed by David Garrick in newspapers owned by David Garrick.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,820
 Amazing guy, wasn't he?

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,500
 He was a man of many talents, apparently according to the reviews I read.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,660
 So yeah, I mean, he ran the Dory Lane theatre, he was a great actor, a lot of you will have

15
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,660
 heard of him.

16
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,780
 He also had the St. James' Chronicle and the public advertiser, in the Chronicle it said Mr.

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,740
 Garrick was most extraordinarily accurate in every syllable which he uttered.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,060
 And his spelling is really good, too.

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,140
 He was a really exciting character for theatre, he was someone who brought in the old, he championed

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,700
 Shakespeare, but he also was looking at new technologies to make plays more interesting.

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,140
 So for example, when he played Hamlet, he designed a wig that when the ghost of his father

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,260
 walked in, stood up on edge, he did change the way people acted weirdly.

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,580
 So before Garrick came along, then for instance, spectators would be on the stage, you guys

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,020
 would be up here with us, like during the performance into mingling and he said, "Let's not

25
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,020
 do that."

26
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
 No, let's not do that.

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
 Let's definitely not do that.

28
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
 Let's do that.

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:23,700
 He made actors come to rehearsals, which really pissed them off, he abolished the practice

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,100
 of people, audience members coming in at the interval for half price, so people were coming in the

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,460
 middle of Hamlet and then spent the whole time going, "So who's that guy?

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,260
 Why is she so upset?"

33
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,740
 But actually that was really, really controversial, wasn't it?

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,620
 There were riots because of that.

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,420
 So when he decided against the half price thing, he came on stage and all the people in the

36
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,940
 pit, so it used to be that you had rich people in the top and you'd have really poor people

37
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,340
 in the pit, or poorer people in the pit.

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,540
 Let's hear it from the rich people up there.

39
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,980
 They're all the same price.

40
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,180
 So he came on stage and the people in the pit said that he had to stop this half price thing,

41
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,620
 "Oh, bring it back," I should say, and he said he'd have to consult his business partner

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,020
 and he was booed off stage.

43
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,580
 Was this business partner David Garrick?

44
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,260
 That's him in massage.

45
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,460
 And then the actors came on and then they were also booed off stage and then finally, according

46
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,900
 to the article from the time that I read, "At eight o'clock the ladies were asked to leave

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
 so the house might be burnt."

48
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
 Whoa.

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,140
 Oh, that's so thoughtful.

50
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,780
 It's really, like the theatre was a riser's place.

51
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,620
 So the character, sitting on the stage thing, that was the result of a 15 year campaign.

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,700
 It took 15 years to get people to stop sitting on the stage.

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,420
 And there was also Garrick, the way he changed acting as well was very cool because before Garrick,

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,180
 and there was another guy called Maclin, who was a huge rival of Garricks, but before that,

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,100
 actors were basically stand with their feet at 10 and to shouting, essentially shouting.

56
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,580
 And Garrick was such a good actor because he paid attention to the other people he was on

57
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,900
 stage with, rather than just waiting for news.

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,260
 So James Quinn told that.

59
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,340
 But the reviews would say things like he even acts when he's not acting.

60
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,580
 There's blue people's minds.

61
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,580
 What does that mean?

62
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,380
 It means he pretended to listen to the other people on stage.

63
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,380
 He was playing a part.

64
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,820
 He stayed in character, rather than just going back to standing neutrally like a dummy waiting

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
 for his turn to shout.

66
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,820
 Oh, okay, right.

67
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,420
 Well, wondering off stage, when it's not your line, you just go and get a coffee and come

68
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
 again.

69
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,420
 Yeah.

70
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,260
 So acting did used to be very different, as we said beforehand, the leading actor, the

71
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,900
 greatest rival to Garrick was a guy called James Quinn, who was known as the bellower.

72
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,300
 And he was London's best actor because he had a very loud voice.

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,220
 And also, he was very good at gesticulating.

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,220
 So there were three hallmarks of great acting, number one, very loud voice, number two, excessive

75
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,220
 gesticulating, and number three, incredibly long pauses.

76
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,740
 So actors at the time were schooled in three different types of pauses.

77
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,980
 You had moderate, longer, and grand.

78
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
 Wow.

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
 Wow.

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,980
 He sounds like very much like Brian Blessed, doesn't he?

81
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
 He sounds so much.

82
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,860
 But was he not famous for killing people?

83
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
 I think.

84
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
 He was in a lot of jewels, Quinn.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
 Yes.

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
 Right.

87
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
 Right.

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,780
 I read that he killed a fellow actor who mispronounced the word Kato as Kato on stage.

89
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
 What?

90
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
 I think that's fair enough.

91
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,460
 Dan, you would not have lasted five minutes if you've seen that.

92
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,020
 But that was, like, that did happen.

93
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,100
 So you mentioned Andy Charles McClend, who was Garek's rival, I think.

94
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,460
 And McClend once killed a fellow actor for borrowing his wig.

95
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
 That's harsh.

96
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,140
 Well, because he had that one that stood up, and not many people had.

97
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
 Yes, true.

98
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,340
 So we mentioned the riots briefly.

99
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
 Oh, yes.

100
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,580
 I just had a one theatrical riot I wanted to share with you guys.

101
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,180
 So this was in Dury Lane.

102
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,780
 It was in 1755, and a Swiss ballet master had brought a festival to Dury Lane, very exciting.

103
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,500
 And the press were furious because he had brought Frenchmen and French women onto an English

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,900
 stage, and they would live it.

105
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,300
 So someone in a gallery cried out that the dancers were disguised French soldiers, which

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,860
 obviously they were not.

107
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,460
 It was a ballet festival.

108
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,180
 And one of the actors shouted back, "I'm not French, I'm Swiss."

109
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,700
 And one of the protestors then shouted back, "Swiss, what the devil do we know of Swiss?

110
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,980
 A Swiss is a foreigner."

111
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,220
 And all foreigners are Frenchmen.

112
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,260
 So this went on for a few nights, and then on the fifth night, they just started the spectators

113
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,620
 to start ripping up the benches and destroying the chandeliers and destroying the scenery on

114
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
 stage.

115
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,940
 Constantly, we're doing it, tearing theaters apart.

116
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
 I don't know how many theaters are still standing.

117
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,580
 I think one of the most famous theatre riots was in 1809, and that was the Covent Garden

118
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
 theatre riots.

119
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,900
 Basically, the Covent Garden theatre had been burned down, and they thought we'll use this

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,940
 as an excuse to rebuild it and put up prices.

121
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,020
 And they also rebuilt it so that if you were in the upper tiers, you could only see the

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,460
 legs of the people on stage.

123
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,060
 And this really annoying people.

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,580
 And they properly rioted.

125
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,300
 So they had this chart, which was old prices, old prices.

126
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,260
 The noise was so bad that soldiers were constantly having to be sent up to restore order.

127
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,700
 The rioting lasted three months.

128
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,060
 And the audiences did things like they would bring live pigs into the audience.

129
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,500
 They brought rattles, they brought trumpets.

130
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,660
 They brought pigeons very often and released them into the auditorium.

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,340
 And they wore these badges with OPs, standing for old price.

132
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,020
 It was quite nice, but of merch for the rioters.

133
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,980
 In the same year as the Swiss riot, Garrix Theatre posted an advert in the press to try and

134
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,940
 find out who it was that flung a hard piece of cheese of near half a pound weight from one

135
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,500
 of the galleries last Tuesday night and greatly hurt a young lady in the pit.

136
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,620
 Oh my god, was it spelt greatly, like, GR80?

137
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:02,380
 Do you know that he went to, when he was at school, he was taught by Samuel Johnson.

138
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
 Yeah.

139
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,380
 Yeah, yeah.

140
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
 And this was in Litchfield.

141
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,620
 And Samuel Johnson had to start a school, basically, because he was not allowed to be

142
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,060
 a part of an already existing school.

143
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,620
 And the reason that they said is, it was feared that the way that he was able to distort

144
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,500
 his face all the time would scare the children.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,260
 So they were like, your face is too scary.

146
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
 You can't teach here.

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,860
 So he set up, yeah, he set up his own school.

148
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,340
 And there were only three pupils at it, one of which was David Garrix.

149
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,620
 And then after school, they went to London together.

150
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
 That's...

151
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,980
 The school shut down, didn't it, because it had three pupils.

152
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
 Yeah.

153
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
 So then they went to London.

154
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
 Yeah.

155
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,860
 Can I just one more thing about a very exciting event in the 18th century, Theatre World.

156
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,980
 Another big thing was 1749 at the Haymarket Theatre.

157
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,780
 They were adverted all over London, that the bottle conjurer was going to be performing.

158
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,100
 And no one knew who this was.

159
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,260
 It's a mystery to this very day.

160
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,220
 But what was advertised was that, various things, it said that you could give him a walking

161
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,900
 cane on stage, and he would tap it and play the sound of any instrument you liked with

162
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,060
 his tapping.

163
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,620
 You could wear a mask, and even if you wore a mask, he'd be able to tell you who you were.

164
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,620
 And then the P.S. to resistance was, he'll have a common wine bottle on stage.

165
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,780
 He will go into it, and sing in it.

166
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
 And did you...

167
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
 So we would climb into the bottle?

168
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,580
 You would climb into the wine bottle, yes.

169
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,060
 And sing in the wine bottle, and during his stay in the bottle, any person may handle it.

170
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
 And so...

171
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
 This must...

172
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,900
 And I've seen some of your wine bottles, and they are pretty big.

173
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,220
 Why do they make them next so tiny?

174
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,660
 Otherwise, I'd go in myself.

175
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,780
 But this huge audience turned up, because it was a court, so which I think it was about

176
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,860
 a bit bigger than a normal wine bottle, a liter or whatever.

177
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,060
 But a massive audience turned up, including the king's son, lots of nobility.

178
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,020
 There was obviously a ruse, he wasn't going to climb inside a wine bottle.

179
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,060
 And so people got really pissed off, and so they went, and he didn't turn up, no one came

180
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,060
 on stage.

181
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,820
 And the benches were torn out, this was the Haymarket Theatre, Big Theatre, Scenery

182
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,580
 Totally Destroyed, Debris was dragged out of the theatre, and all of the stuff inside

183
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,540
 the theatre was set on fire.

184
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,460
 And one newspaper explained this the next day, the fact that the guy hadn't turned up

185
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,140
 and climbed inside a wine bottle, explained it by saying he had given a private audience

186
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,620
 beforehand.

187
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,140
 And we're upon receiving a demonstration of the trick, the viewer, as in that private audience

188
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,060
 had caulked up the bottle and whipped it in his pocket and made of.

189
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:38,580
 Of, okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

190
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,940
 My fact this week is that the main source for Sigmund Freud's work on paranoid schizophrenia

191
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,220
 was the memoirs of a man who made unbelievable and ludicrous claims.

192
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,100
 That man's name was Dan Schreber.

193
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,660
 Daniel Paul Schreber was his name.

194
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:08,020
 This is a guy he lived from 1842 to 1911, and he wrote a memoir, memoirs of my nervous illness,

195
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,740
 and in it he was kind of trying to show what it was like from the inside of someone who

196
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,500
 was having all of these thoughts and so on, published the book, and Freud picked it up,

197
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 and never met him.

198
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,260
 They lived at the same time, but didn't want to meet him because he didn't want to be influenced

199
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
 by it.

200
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
 He just used the book.

201
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,180
 And that was the basis for a lot of his Freud's work.

202
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,700
 Daniel Schreber's book is still in publication, if you go into book shops, that memoir.

203
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,100
 It's how important it is.

204
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,020
 So Schreber thought that there were little men living inside his feet that were taking

205
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,700
 out his genitals and then putting female genitals in so he could have God's child.

206
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
 Yes.

207
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,620
 Putting female genitals into his feet or into the place where they're normally are.

208
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
 Oh yeah.

209
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,740
 But it was very hard to walk.

210
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
 Yeah.

211
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,420
 He was mad, wasn't he, Freud?

212
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
 Freud.

213
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
 Freud was, yeah.

214
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,940
 Not this guy with the vagina in his foot, I think he was fine.

215
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,700
 There were just so many things that were wrong about what he thought.

216
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,420
 So he had a lifelong fear of trains.

217
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,500
 They went for it and that was based on an experience he had in his early childhood which he explained

218
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,780
 in a letter 40 years after the event.

219
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,740
 And he explained to one of his friends that when he was three years old, he'd moved house,

220
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,280
 his whole family had moved house, not just him.

221
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,700
 And they'd moved, gone by train and he explained that he'd seen his mother naked on the overnight

222
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,300
 train and he thought, you know, from that experience, he'd been permanently traumatized

223
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,380
 by seeing his mother naked and obviously being sexually attracted to her.

224
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,580
 So there is an idea that he had this theory of the eat-up as complex.

225
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,940
 And now it's thought that maybe he had one, but it's not true that everyone has one.

226
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,900
 You know, he was almost not a psychiatrist.

227
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,260
 He first started the first paper that he ever published was on eels and it was his attempt

228
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,780
 to locate their testicles.

229
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,140
 That was what he was doing.

230
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,340
 He dissected 400 eels looking for their testicles, just was obsessed.

231
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,100
 He was like, they've got to be somewhere.

232
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,380
 And at what stage do you go, I've done 399?

233
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
 Yeah.

234
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
 400, 400 was the same.

235
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,380
 Yeah, yeah.

236
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,340
 Because he published the paper saying, didn't find them, but this was one of the great mysteries

237
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,340
 of the age.

238
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
 It was.

239
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,340
 We don't know who he was.

240
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
 So what?

241
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,180
 No one knew where eels bred and male eels only have gonads when they need them basically.

242
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,940
 So Aristotle said that eels came from nothing.

243
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,620
 That was his great theory.

244
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,380
 I don't like to do what a chance is.

245
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,180
 He sometimes said they came from the guts of wet soil as well.

246
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,180
 Yes.

247
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
 Yeah.

248
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
 And some people said they came out of thash roofs.

249
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,620
 I mean, no one knew.

250
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,740
 So, but the thing was Freud, when he wrote this paper, he said, well, they must have all

251
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
 been female.

252
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,100
 That's the only explanation I can think of rather than that he got it wrong.

253
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,340
 And I read a great essay online which asked, you know, what, this must have been very

254
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,740
 formative for Freud, it said, we know now that Freud viewed most people's problems through

255
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,900
 a sexual lens, but was that lens tinted by the set of testicles he couldn't find a lifetime

256
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
 ago?

257
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,180
 Did his inability to locate the eels reproductive organs prove so prominent in his studies that

258
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,620
 he saw them everywhere he went in the manner that a rare car owner begins to see his car

259
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,220
 everywhere soon after driving it off the lot?

260
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,140
 So weird as similarly I've ever heard.

261
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
 He hated women though, didn't he?

262
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,660
 Maybe that's all about the eels testicles as well.

263
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,780
 He was the heinous sexist.

264
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,860
 So he said that women should be basically avoided because they were too susceptible to

265
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,180
 being seduced.

266
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,580
 He advised his friends against hanging out with them at all.

267
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,140
 He said that they have an ineptitude for serious life tasks that they are unstable, incapable

268
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,500
 of grasping their own unimportance and their people.

269
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,860
 He said nature's inclined them to be vain and he said the only thing that women contributed

270
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,780
 to society are a plating and weaving because women traditionally were, they did do a lot

271
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,660
 of weaving and plating and he attributed this to obviously their desire to have a penis.

272
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:15,020
 And so what he said was women are so upset about not having a penis that their plotting

273
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,660
 is expressing their desire to plot their pubic hair in order to conceal the fact that they

274
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,180
 have no male genitals on their face.

275
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,180
 It's a killer.

276
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,100
 What's interesting is, you say he didn't like women but it was a woman who actually helped

277
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,260
 him get to his biggest breakthrough in psychiatry when sitting with them and she was appropriately

278
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,620
 called Fanny.

279
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,980
 Fanny Moser was her name.

280
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,300
 He was treating her and he used to do it through hypnosis but he was a terrible hypnotist.

281
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,540
 You're unstable, you're weak, you wish you had a penis.

282
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,380
 So he used to do that, you're getting sleepy thing and Fanny Moser said actually I don't

283
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,620
 think I am and he was like no you aren't, I really don't think I am.

284
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,700
 So she just started talking and she was laying on the couch and kept talking and kept talking

285
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,780
 and he thought hang on a second, this is amazing.

286
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,660
 I'm actually getting stuff here that's real and raw and that was the game changer for

287
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
 him.

288
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,500
 In a way, the talking here was invented because a woman told him to shut the fuck up

289
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:22,140
 because she, honestly because he, because Fanny, he used to say his theories to her and

290
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,860
 at one point she just said honestly please shut up because without your comments I can properly

291
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,260
 let my mind wander and work out what's going on and he was like okay cool, I'll just

292
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
 step back.

293
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,340
 Yeah, while he saw sex everywhere, didn't he?

294
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,780
 He thought anything elongated such as sticks or tree trunks or umbrellas represented the

295
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,380
 penis. He said that walking up and down steps symbolise a sexual act.

296
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,340
 You guys in the circle?

297
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
 Sounds like it.

298
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,460
 What was his day to day like but he just saw penises everywhere.

299
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,980
 It must have been so distracting.

300
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,060
 Do you guys know what the first Freudian slip was?

301
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
 Oh no.

302
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
 No.

303
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,980
 So the first Freudian slip was a young man who said Xoriare, X nostris or Cibus Ulto, when

304
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:15,460
 as you all know, he should have said Xoriare, Alicuis, nostris, X, Cibus, Ulto, so I mean it's

305
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,460
 obvious isn't it?

306
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,460
 I think it's like maybe a loving at that.

307
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,980
 So basically it was the suppression of the word Alicuis meant that he must have had some

308
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,820
 association with that word.

309
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,380
 So he did a word association and said what does that make you think of and eventually got

310
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:40,980
 to a word which was Saint Genuarius and Saint Genuarius kept his blood in a file which was supposed

311
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,860
 to have turned into liquid once a year and then was solid the rest of the time and then

312
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,580
 the man confessed that his girlfriend had missed her period and so Freud concluded that

313
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,940
 he had blocked out this word from ten minutes ago because he associated that with the fact

314
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,060
 that his girlfriend might be pregnant.

315
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:07,060
 You shouldn't give your blood in a file, it makes the cardboard soggy.

316
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,740
 Have we talked about the cocaine, I don't think we have, a huge fan of cocaine.

317
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,440
 He experimented with it as a student believing it would alleviate his depression and anxiety

318
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,260
 and great news it did and he just started posting, it was this bizarre period where you were

319
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,740
 just posting cocaine around because it wasn't really illegal so he sent it to his fiancee

320
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:32,020
 to make us strong. She must have been plotting like mad after that.

321
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,740
 He gave it to his great friend who was called Fleischel because Fleischel was addicted to

322
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,060
 morphine and he said I know something that will cure you morphine addiction, try cocaine.

323
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:48,100
 Fleischel then became completely addicted to cocaine and he claimed it had been a success

324
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,740
 but it had not.

325
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,700
 One of the things he justified it with when he was recommending it to this guy whose life

326
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,820
 was ruined by Freud forcing cocaine on him. Freud said the wonderful thing about cocaine,

327
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,940
 the best thing about it is there is absolutely no craving for the further use of cocaine

328
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:13,700
 after your first take it or even repeatedly.

329
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:20,140
 Your seat number has been taken down but I was looking into with Freud just off the back

330
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,220
 of David Garrick I thought what did he do as hobbies did he go to the theater for example

331
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,420
 and I could only find one example and it was to see a guy who we've mentioned very briefly

332
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,220
 on this podcast before called Le Petalmaine.

333
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,500
 Le Petalmaine, the fighter, his act was to just fart on stage.

334
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,420
 What's interesting is it wasn't that he was eating generating gas and farting he was sucking

335
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,540
 air up into his bum and farting it back out so he discovered this when he was in the

336
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:53,540
 ocean and he was almost drowning he notices the ocean getting very slightly lower.

337
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,780
 As he was drowning he went and it went both in and up at the same time and he was like

338
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,060
 that's weird he came back to the surface he went to the beach and it all flooded out

339
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,620
 of his butt and he thought what's happening here so highlights of his act they involved

340
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,460
 the effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms from his bum.

341
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,540
 He could play Osolomio through a sort of rubber tube in his bum.

342
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,700
 I don't know that would you mind performing it?

343
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,740
 We know it as just one conneto.

344
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,020
 And that's who that's Sigmund Freud, the only example I could find of him going to the

345
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,660
 theater was to see the farting man.

346
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,860
 Well he was very into defecation.

347
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,020
 He thought that was extremely important.

348
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
 Freud was, yeah.

349
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,020
 Alright so was he going follow through, follow through?

350
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:48,140
 So he was convinced that obsession with defecation and obsession with money were related and

351
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,580
 he said that he was obsessed with money himself.

352
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,780
 He said money is like laughing gas to me, he loved being rich and he thought that being

353
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,460
 into excrement was something that transferred and later life into being into money and he

354
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,780
 said that like there's a constant association with them in our minds and because it's the

355
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,500
 contrast he thought between the most precious thing which is money and the least precious thing

356
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,980
 which is shit.

357
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,380
 And he also said it's because there's this perfect transition.

358
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,060
 So when you're in your youth, you're he thought erotically interested in defecation but

359
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,420
 not money and then as soon as that starts to recede you become erotically interested in

360
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
 money.

361
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,180
 And so he thought they were intrinsically related.

362
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
 Whoing and money.

363
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:39,460
 As we understand he was wrong about everything.

364
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:48,460
 My fact this week is that swordfish can speed up and slow down time with their minds.

365
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,980
 So this is this amazing thing that has been discovered about swordfish quite recently.

366
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,060
 So if you say speed up and slow down time and the end time is about how you're perceiving

367
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
 stuff right.

368
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,180
 The swordfish if hunting their time perception is about the same time as ours which means

369
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,540
 that they basically are processing all the images that are coming into their eyes and

370
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,700
 their brain is pressing that as fast as we do.

371
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,940
 So the experience time in the same way as we do but if they're not hunting then time

372
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,620
 goes about five times more slowly for them it all slows down and they can do this deliberately.

373
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,580
 So what they do is they heat up their brains and their eyes and that just makes them be

374
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,940
 able to absorb more information.

375
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,300
 So the faster you can see light coming into your eyes and all these images then the slower

376
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
 time comes.

377
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,340
 It's amazing and it means that they can hunt better right?

378
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
 Yeah exactly.

379
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,940
 So it's like a good kind of an analogy is if you swap a fly or you try to swap a fly

380
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,460
 then you're usually unsuccessful and that is because they are seeing way more frames

381
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,980
 per second than you are.

382
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,220
 So you think you've got really close but to them like it's like so easy.

383
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,340
 Like to a fly if they watch a movie it's just like a drawing and then a bit of a weight

384
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,020
 and then another drawing and then a bit of a weight and that's why we say time flies.

385
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
 No it isn't.

386
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
 Yes it isn't.

387
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,100
 I'm pretty sure it is.

388
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,940
 So what happens because I've actually swatted flies.

389
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,900
 Do I have access to faster time?

390
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,420
 No you're not a neo in this analogy.

391
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,700
 No it means that they just didn't see you coming but if they were to see you coming it

392
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
 would be like neo isn't it?

393
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,580
 It's like in the matrix you kind of see it slowing down and coming towards you really

394
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,300
 really slowly.

395
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
 And the weird thing is that they knew that swordfish did this thing with a heat up their

396
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,620
 eyes and their brains.

397
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,380
 They found that out a few years ago but they only just realized why and they did it by removing

398
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,860
 the retiners of freshly caught swordfish and they put them in a bath and they connected

399
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,700
 them to some electrodes to measure their response of those retiners to lots of flashes

400
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,220
 of light and they changed the temperature of the bath that the retinas were in and when

401
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,300
 it was in a hotter bath then their response to light was ten times faster so their response

402
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,420
 their ability to absorb lots of information and this is just a detached retina fully detached

403
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,180
 from the fish which is being eaten somewhere and that retina responded ten times faster

404
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,700
 to the light that was being given to it than if they were in a bath that was much colder.

405
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
 It is amazing.

406
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,220
 Do you know they don't stab their prey?

407
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,700
 I sort of vaguely assume that they would stab it.

408
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,260
 Because they have like a really long swordfish and they're sort of up a jaw and I just assume

409
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,100
 that they would cabab as it were.

410
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
 Yeah.

411
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,940
 I think the problem would be if you're a fish and you cabab a fish you can't grab it with

412
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,740
 your hands can you because you don't have hands?

413
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
 Very true.

414
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,300
 If you were feeding others if you went round as the cabab.

415
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
 If you are the cabab.

416
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
 Yes.

417
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 That would be very nice.

418
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
 Yeah.

419
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
 So for a coffee party.

420
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 Your waiter comes over.

421
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
 Yeah.

422
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300
 What a party that would be where the waiter had all the food balanced on his nose for

423
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
 you.

424
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
 Yeah.

425
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
 I'd go.

426
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
 But the problem is their solitary fish so they can't do that.

427
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
 They can't eat off each other's noses.

428
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,940
 Oh, they're quite solitary.

429
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
 But they do.

430
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
 Yeah, they're very solitary.

431
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,620
 But what they do is, they did not know this.

432
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,540
 So they do their sailfish do this as well, another fish with a very, very long up a jaw.

433
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,540
 They slowly put their bill into a school of sardines or other smaller fish and then yeah,

434
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,540
 yeah, yeah, they thrash their head from side to side, sorrow, like sorrow.

435
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
 Yeah.

436
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,060
 And then they've, they've, they've injured enough fish in that.

437
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, bit.

438
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,980
 And that they can catch them.

439
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
 They can then just eat them.

440
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,180
 I mean, it's amazing how they do that with the noses.

441
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,940
 Because they will slot their noses into a big school of fish that they've heard it into a big

442
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
 cluster.

443
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,500
 And the fish don't notice.

444
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,860
 So you can see the swordfish or the sailfish's nose sitting in amongst them, just wasting with

445
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,660
 all the fish coming around.

446
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,180
 They sweat out of their noses, but instead of sweating sweat, they sweat lube.

447
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,100
 Is there, what's the, what's the purpose of it?

448
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,100
 Well, it makes them really slippery and it means they can swim really, really quickly.

449
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
 Oh, okay.

450
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
 Yeah.

451
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,380
 That's a sexy evening where you go, did you bring the swordfish?

452
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
 Insistently.

453
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,300
 In the 18th century, it was believed that swordfish would dive out of the way if they heard

454
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,580
 anyone speaking Italian.

455
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,860
 So all the local fishermen spoke Greek the whole time.

456
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
 Wow.

457
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
 Wow.

458
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,500
 But we think what that actually was, it was basically an excuse for not catching them.

459
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,740
 So you have a cartony swordfish, oh, it's because, you know, Leonardo has been speaking

460
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,460
 Italian, that's why we didn't catch them.

461
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,020
 We're going to have to move on very shortly to our next act.

462
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,460
 Just one last bodily control thing.

463
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,460
 Yeah.

464
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,660
 So this is about heating yourself up.

465
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,100
 There are monks in Tibet who can decide how hot they are just through meditation.

466
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
 I mean, really?

467
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,980
 Yes, it's been tested and it's not like a huge difference.

468
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,380
 It's not as though they'll be dangerous to touch.

469
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,020
 But they can increase the temperature of their extremities just through meditation.

470
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,300
 They train themselves a bit of years and they're quite good at it.

471
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,820
 There is a report which says that if you put wet sheets on them, they could be dry within

472
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,820
 an hour.

473
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
 But I think that is not true.

474
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,420
 I think that's an exaggeration.

475
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,380
 Also, I think it's quite offensive to do that.

476
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,140
 I'm meditating.

477
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,380
 OK, it is time for our final factor, the show, and that is Andy.

478
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,660
 My fact is that in 1986, Waddington's invented a board game which was all about trading cattle

479
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,940
 semen.

480
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,940
 This is a real game, it's called "Grade Up to Elite Cow".

481
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,540
 It sells itself as a game of skill and chance for dairy farmers.

482
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:27,060
 And we have a copy here tonight.

483
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,220
 That's good, it says from two to 3,000 players.

484
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:38,100
 This was by the British Freezing Cattle Society and it's basically marketing for cattle farmers.

485
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,380
 It's like monopoly, basically, but instead of property, you collect semen.

486
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,340
 So there are various squares all the way round.

487
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,820
 There are risks and rewards.

488
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,100
 Here's one of the squares, "Accident to semen flask, all your semen is lost unless an insurance

489
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,740
 policy is held.

490
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,540
 Return all your semen discs."

491
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
 It's incredible.

492
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
 It's amazing.

493
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,780
 Has anyone ever played this, do you know?

494
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
 Lots of people.

495
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,940
 If you go online, I started googling, so many people have played it.

496
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
 Really?

497
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,260
 There's a great website called "BoardGameGeek.com" and they have a lot of reviews.

498
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
 Oh, nice.

499
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
 Cool.

500
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,460
 But the reviews are, I mean, no one really loves the game, but they love the idea of it.

501
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,020
 So one of the reviews was monopoly with cows and semen.

502
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,940
 The rules are quite complicated.

503
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,740
 You start with little cows and you go around the board and there are various semen companies.

504
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,260
 There's one thing, which is there's many pitfalls along the way as you're going around.

505
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,220
 So you can pick up those market cards that you get, sort of like monopoly, which will

506
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,380
 state stuff like, "This cow has persistent mastitis, seller at the market price."

507
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,020
 It's a thoroughly realistic game, basically.

508
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
 Is it?

509
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
 Well, yeah, I think so.

510
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
 I think that's very deceitful.

511
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,500
 You can't sell a cow at market price or a persistent mastitis.

512
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,620
 I noticed you didn't do this in Devon where we were last week.

513
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,100
 You've been picked out of town.

514
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
 That's true.

515
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,940
 So is it to help farmers?

516
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,780
 It doesn't help anything really.

517
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,260
 It's not helping anyone.

518
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,740
 But there are lots of more games where the point was to help.

519
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,340
 So they used to have very moral purposes.

520
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,860
 So the new game of human life was a 1790 classic and the aim of that was to be the first player

521
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
 to become an old man.

522
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
 That's it.

523
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,300
 Surely whoever's oldest at the start has that advantage.

524
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,860
 You have to move through the seven periods of life and accumulate moral observations along

525
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
 the way.

526
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,300
 Have you heard of Trump the game?

527
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,300
 No.

528
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,980
 That was quite a big one, actually.

529
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,740
 It was launched in 1989 with the tagline, "It's not whether you win or lose, it's whether

530
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
 you win."

531
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
 That's great.

532
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
 That's great.

533
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
 That's great.

534
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
 That's great.

535
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
 That's great.

536
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
 I hope it's on his gravestone.

537
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
 Yeah.

538
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
 Yeah.

539
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,780
 The head of Parker Brothers said, "It can leave you exhausted and feeling like you don't

540
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
 want to play again."

541
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,740
 Words later attributed to Stormy Daniels.

542
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
 Yes.

543
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,580
 Can I just, you mentioned the game of life, I think, the early version, and I used to play

544
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,100
 the game of life as a kid and it's amazing, but it actually started in 1860 and at that time

545
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,540
 it was called The Checkered Game of Life.

546
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,460
 It was made by this lithographer, so like an image printer, an artist called Milton Bradley,

547
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,860
 and he was very successful at the game of life, but the reason he had to make it is because

548
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,700
 he'd been very unsuccessful in another way, so if you've ever played the game of life,

549
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:35,100
 the reason it exists is because Milton Bradley made lithographs of Abraham Lincoln, and

550
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,380
 that was when he was a presidential nominee, he wasn't very well-known, and he didn't have

551
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
 a beard.

552
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
 They were clean shaver.

553
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,180
 Wasn't it like a little girl who told him to get a beard or something?

554
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
 It was.

555
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
 Yeah.

556
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
 So him and this little girl would have beef.

557
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,300
 So he sold these lithographs really well, and they were extremely popular, and then Lincoln

558
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,140
 suddenly thought, "I'll grow my distinctive beard that everyone will associate with me

559
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,780
 forevermore," and the prince became totally worthless, and this guy, Milton Bradley, went completely

560
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,740
 bankrupt, and then he grew to the game of life, and he was a very moralistic guy, so the game

561
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,260
 of life, if you've ever played it, has a spinning thing in the centre rather than a dice, and

562
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,540
 that is because dice were associated with gambling, and he was very Christian, and dice were evil,

563
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:25,860
 so he had a spinning tea totem, then it's not funny actually, it's evil.

564
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,860
 That's what it has, but it became super popular.

565
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,940
 Oh, this is something that I think we may have mentioned before, so during the Second World

566
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:38,580
 War, MI9, which is like the cool version of MI5 and 6, they smuggled escape kits to prisoners

567
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,220
 of, you know, Allied prisoners of war who were being held in Germany, they smuggled the

568
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,540
 escape kits inside Monopoly, and the other thing they did, they got in touch with another

569
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,300
 firm, and they distributed snakes and ladders kits with genuine escape equipment hidden

570
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
 inside.

571
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,980
 Not the actual ladders, you couldn't escape with others.

572
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,980
 No, it wasn't the actual laddy you could put.

573
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,900
 If I were a prison guard and someone had a snake and ladders kit delivered with an enormous

574
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,740
 spade within the box, I would notice.

575
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,540
 Yeah, but they genuinely did it.

576
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
 Amazing.

577
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:16,580
 That was invented by one of Anne Frank's schoolmates.

578
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
 Wow.

579
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
 Yeah.

580
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,660
 And it was two people who invented guess who.

581
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
 They became a couple.

582
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,140
 They actually knew each other at that time as well.

583
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,060
 They used to walk to school together in the morning, but didn't go to the same school.

584
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,900
 And they ultimately invented not only guess who, but over a hundred board games, many of

585
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,420
 which we know the names of, or might have played, for various different countries.

586
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:42,140
 But they started, their very first thing was inventing a thing for the Borden dairy company.

587
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,020
 So they started by working for cows as well.

588
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,260
 But that couple, they, I think, got separated at one point.

589
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,740
 And they had to, well, the guy had to find her and, you know, he went to the police station

590
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,660
 and they said, "Does she have glasses?"

591
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
 And he said, "No."

592
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,220
 And they said, "Well, is she wearing a hat and a mask?"

593
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,420
 It's God, that was a long one.

594
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,140
 The Soviet Union had amazing games.

595
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
 Yeah.

596
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
 They were also very moralistic.

597
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,140
 So there was the game, tuberculosis, a proletarian disease.

598
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,260
 That was, look after your health, the new hygiene game, the abandoned where you had to round

599
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,580
 up homeless children and take them to an orphanage.

600
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,340
 And my favourite, healthy living, where you had to become the healthiest worker possible.

601
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,740
 So basically it was the Soviet Union trying to inculcate its values into people.

602
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,020
 So you would be penalised for consulting folk healers or drinking a beer at lunch or

603
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,460
 consulting with a strange woman.

604
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
 Wow.

605
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
 There you are.

606
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
 Crazy.

607
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
 We're going to have to wrap up soon, guys.

608
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,500
 There's a kickstarter where you can get involved at the moment.

609
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:53,660
 It's a board game and it's called Brexit, the board game of second chances.

610
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
 And third chances.

611
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,300
 And they say, "We invite you to relive that historic

612
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,140
 referendum, but this time you're in control."

613
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,140
 God.

614
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,060
 "On like no one being in control."

615
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,420
 It's like you've gone to hell.

616
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,540
 Honestly, if someone, if the devil said to you, "I invite you to relive that historic

617
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
 referendum and this time you're in control."

618
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,980
 You'd be like, "Oh cool, this is hell then."

619
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,820
 They say, "This is the absolute must have game to make all this political mayhem fun

620
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,820
 again."

621
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:33,380
 I'll just go one last thing, which is sometimes there are mistakes on board games.

622
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,580
 And in 2017, the makers of the Anton Dex Saturday Night Takeaway board game were forced

623
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,740
 to apologise after it was found to contain multiple errors.

624
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:47,260
 One question claimed that the moon is 225 miles from the earth.

625
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,700
 Okay, that is it.

626
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,900
 That is all of our facts.
