00:00:14,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:22,00:00:26,this week coming to you live from the Hammersmith event of my party!
00:00:26,00:00:31,[Cheering]
00:00:31,00:00:37,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Annotasinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:00:37,00:00:41,"James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:41,00:00:46,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:46,00:00:48,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:48,00:00:54,"Okay, my fat this week is that in the 18th century London plays written by David Garrick"
00:00:54,00:01:01,and starring David Garrick would often be shown in theatres owned by David Garrick.
00:01:01,00:01:09,They would then be reviewed by David Garrick in newspapers owned by David Garrick.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Amazing guy, wasn't he?"
00:01:11,00:01:19,"He was a man of many talents, apparently according to the reviews I read."
00:01:19,00:01:23,"So yeah, I mean, he ran the Dory Lane theatre, he was a great actor, a lot of you will have"
00:01:23,00:01:24,heard of him.
00:01:24,00:01:30,"He also had the St. James' Chronicle and the public advertiser, in the Chronicle it said Mr."
00:01:30,00:01:37,Garrick was most extraordinarily accurate in every syllable which he uttered.
00:01:37,00:01:41,"And his spelling is really good, too."
00:01:41,00:01:45,"He was a really exciting character for theatre, he was someone who brought in the old, he championed"
00:01:45,00:01:49,"Shakespeare, but he also was looking at new technologies to make plays more interesting."
00:01:49,00:01:54,"So for example, when he played Hamlet, he designed a wig that when the ghost of his father"
00:01:54,00:02:01,"walked in, stood up on edge, he did change the way people acted weirdly."
00:02:01,00:02:07,"So before Garrick came along, then for instance, spectators would be on the stage, you guys"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"would be up here with us, like during the performance into mingling and he said, ""Let's not"
00:02:12,00:02:13,"do that."""
00:02:13,00:02:14,"No, let's not do that."
00:02:14,00:02:15,Let's definitely not do that.
00:02:15,00:02:16,Let's do that.
00:02:16,00:02:23,"He made actors come to rehearsals, which really pissed them off, he abolished the practice"
00:02:23,00:02:29,"of people, audience members coming in at the interval for half price, so people were coming in the"
00:02:29,00:02:34,"middle of Hamlet and then spent the whole time going, ""So who's that guy?"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"Why is she so upset?"""
00:02:37,00:02:39,"But actually that was really, really controversial, wasn't it?"
00:02:39,00:02:41,There were riots because of that.
00:02:41,00:02:47,"So when he decided against the half price thing, he came on stage and all the people in the"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"pit, so it used to be that you had rich people in the top and you'd have really poor people"
00:02:50,00:02:55,"in the pit, or poorer people in the pit."
00:02:55,00:02:58,Let's hear it from the rich people up there.
00:02:58,00:03:03,They're all the same price.
00:03:03,00:03:09,"So he came on stage and the people in the pit said that he had to stop this half price thing,"
00:03:09,00:03:13,"""Oh, bring it back,"" I should say, and he said he'd have to consult his business partner"
00:03:13,00:03:15,and he was booed off stage.
00:03:15,00:03:17,Was this business partner David Garrick?
00:03:17,00:03:21,That's him in massage.
00:03:21,00:03:26,"And then the actors came on and then they were also booed off stage and then finally, according"
00:03:26,00:03:30,"to the article from the time that I read, ""At eight o'clock the ladies were asked to leave"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"so the house might be burnt."""
00:03:32,00:03:33,Whoa.
00:03:33,00:03:38,"Oh, that's so thoughtful."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"It's really, like the theatre was a riser's place."
00:03:40,00:03:45,"So the character, sitting on the stage thing, that was the result of a 15 year campaign."
00:03:45,00:03:48,It took 15 years to get people to stop sitting on the stage.
00:03:48,00:03:54,"And there was also Garrick, the way he changed acting as well was very cool because before Garrick,"
00:03:54,00:03:59,"and there was another guy called Maclin, who was a huge rival of Garricks, but before that,"
00:03:59,00:04:04,"actors were basically stand with their feet at 10 and to shouting, essentially shouting."
00:04:04,00:04:08,And Garrick was such a good actor because he paid attention to the other people he was on
00:04:08,00:04:10,"stage with, rather than just waiting for news."
00:04:10,00:04:15,So James Quinn told that.
00:04:15,00:04:20,But the reviews would say things like he even acts when he's not acting.
00:04:20,00:04:21,There's blue people's minds.
00:04:21,00:04:22,What does that mean?
00:04:22,00:04:26,It means he pretended to listen to the other people on stage.
00:04:26,00:04:27,He was playing a part.
00:04:27,00:04:30,"He stayed in character, rather than just going back to standing neutrally like a dummy waiting"
00:04:30,00:04:31,for his turn to shout.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"Oh, okay, right."
00:04:32,00:04:36,"Well, wondering off stage, when it's not your line, you just go and get a coffee and come"
00:04:36,00:04:37,again.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Yeah.
00:04:38,00:04:43,"So acting did used to be very different, as we said beforehand, the leading actor, the"
00:04:43,00:04:47,"greatest rival to Garrick was a guy called James Quinn, who was known as the bellower."
00:04:47,00:04:51,And he was London's best actor because he had a very loud voice.
00:04:51,00:04:53,"And also, he was very good at gesticulating."
00:04:53,00:04:58,"So there were three hallmarks of great acting, number one, very loud voice, number two, excessive"
00:04:58,00:05:02,"gesticulating, and number three, incredibly long pauses."
00:05:02,00:05:07,So actors at the time were schooled in three different types of pauses.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"You had moderate, longer, and grand."
00:05:11,00:05:12,Wow.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Wow.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"He sounds like very much like Brian Blessed, doesn't he?"
00:05:15,00:05:16,He sounds so much.
00:05:16,00:05:20,But was he not famous for killing people?
00:05:20,00:05:21,I think.
00:05:21,00:05:22,"He was in a lot of jewels, Quinn."
00:05:22,00:05:23,Yes.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Right.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Right.
00:05:25,00:05:30,I read that he killed a fellow actor who mispronounced the word Kato as Kato on stage.
00:05:30,00:05:31,What?
00:05:31,00:05:32,I think that's fair enough.
00:05:32,00:05:36,"Dan, you would not have lasted five minutes if you've seen that."
00:05:36,00:05:38,"But that was, like, that did happen."
00:05:38,00:05:43,"So you mentioned Andy Charles McClend, who was Garek's rival, I think."
00:05:43,00:05:46,And McClend once killed a fellow actor for borrowing his wig.
00:05:46,00:05:47,That's harsh.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"Well, because he had that one that stood up, and not many people had."
00:05:50,00:05:51,"Yes, true."
00:05:51,00:05:53,So we mentioned the riots briefly.
00:05:53,00:05:54,"Oh, yes."
00:05:54,00:05:56,I just had a one theatrical riot I wanted to share with you guys.
00:05:56,00:05:58,So this was in Dury Lane.
00:05:58,00:06:04,"It was in 1755, and a Swiss ballet master had brought a festival to Dury Lane, very exciting."
00:06:04,00:06:08,And the press were furious because he had brought Frenchmen and French women onto an English
00:06:08,00:06:10,"stage, and they would live it."
00:06:10,00:06:15,"So someone in a gallery cried out that the dancers were disguised French soldiers, which"
00:06:15,00:06:16,obviously they were not.
00:06:16,00:06:18,It was a ballet festival.
00:06:18,00:06:22,"And one of the actors shouted back, ""I'm not French, I'm Swiss."""
00:06:22,00:06:26,"And one of the protestors then shouted back, ""Swiss, what the devil do we know of Swiss?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,"A Swiss is a foreigner."""
00:06:27,00:06:32,And all foreigners are Frenchmen.
00:06:32,00:06:37,"So this went on for a few nights, and then on the fifth night, they just started the spectators"
00:06:37,00:06:41,to start ripping up the benches and destroying the chandeliers and destroying the scenery on
00:06:41,00:06:42,stage.
00:06:42,00:06:44,"Constantly, we're doing it, tearing theaters apart."
00:06:44,00:06:46,I don't know how many theaters are still standing.
00:06:46,00:06:51,"I think one of the most famous theatre riots was in 1809, and that was the Covent Garden"
00:06:51,00:06:52,theatre riots.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"Basically, the Covent Garden theatre had been burned down, and they thought we'll use this"
00:06:55,00:06:58,as an excuse to rebuild it and put up prices.
00:06:58,00:07:02,"And they also rebuilt it so that if you were in the upper tiers, you could only see the"
00:07:02,00:07:04,legs of the people on stage.
00:07:04,00:07:06,And this really annoying people.
00:07:06,00:07:07,And they properly rioted.
00:07:07,00:07:11,"So they had this chart, which was old prices, old prices."
00:07:11,00:07:16,The noise was so bad that soldiers were constantly having to be sent up to restore order.
00:07:16,00:07:17,The rioting lasted three months.
00:07:17,00:07:22,And the audiences did things like they would bring live pigs into the audience.
00:07:22,00:07:24,"They brought rattles, they brought trumpets."
00:07:24,00:07:28,They brought pigeons very often and released them into the auditorium.
00:07:28,00:07:32,"And they wore these badges with OPs, standing for old price."
00:07:32,00:07:37,"It was quite nice, but of merch for the rioters."
00:07:37,00:07:40,"In the same year as the Swiss riot, Garrix Theatre posted an advert in the press to try and"
00:07:40,00:07:45,find out who it was that flung a hard piece of cheese of near half a pound weight from one
00:07:45,00:07:49,of the galleries last Tuesday night and greatly hurt a young lady in the pit.
00:07:49,00:07:54,"Oh my god, was it spelt greatly, like, GR80?"
00:07:54,00:08:02,"Do you know that he went to, when he was at school, he was taught by Samuel Johnson."
00:08:02,00:08:03,Yeah.
00:08:03,00:08:04,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:04,00:08:05,And this was in Litchfield.
00:08:05,00:08:09,"And Samuel Johnson had to start a school, basically, because he was not allowed to be"
00:08:09,00:08:12,a part of an already existing school.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"And the reason that they said is, it was feared that the way that he was able to distort"
00:08:15,00:08:18,his face all the time would scare the children.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"So they were like, your face is too scary."
00:08:20,00:08:21,You can't teach here.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"So he set up, yeah, he set up his own school."
00:08:23,00:08:27,"And there were only three pupils at it, one of which was David Garrix."
00:08:27,00:08:30,"And then after school, they went to London together."
00:08:30,00:08:31,That's...
00:08:31,00:08:33,"The school shut down, didn't it, because it had three pupils."
00:08:33,00:08:34,Yeah.
00:08:34,00:08:35,So then they went to London.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Yeah.
00:08:36,00:08:40,"Can I just one more thing about a very exciting event in the 18th century, Theatre World."
00:08:40,00:08:44,Another big thing was 1749 at the Haymarket Theatre.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"They were adverted all over London, that the bottle conjurer was going to be performing."
00:08:48,00:08:50,And no one knew who this was.
00:08:50,00:08:52,It's a mystery to this very day.
00:08:52,00:08:57,"But what was advertised was that, various things, it said that you could give him a walking"
00:08:57,00:09:01,"cane on stage, and he would tap it and play the sound of any instrument you liked with"
00:09:01,00:09:03,his tapping.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"You could wear a mask, and even if you wore a mask, he'd be able to tell you who you were."
00:09:07,00:09:13,"And then the P.S. to resistance was, he'll have a common wine bottle on stage."
00:09:13,00:09:17,"He will go into it, and sing in it."
00:09:17,00:09:18,And did you...
00:09:18,00:09:19,So we would climb into the bottle?
00:09:19,00:09:21,"You would climb into the wine bottle, yes."
00:09:21,00:09:26,"And sing in the wine bottle, and during his stay in the bottle, any person may handle it."
00:09:26,00:09:27,And so...
00:09:27,00:09:28,This must...
00:09:28,00:09:31,"And I've seen some of your wine bottles, and they are pretty big."
00:09:31,00:09:34,Why do they make them next so tiny?
00:09:34,00:09:36,"Otherwise, I'd go in myself."
00:09:36,00:09:41,"But this huge audience turned up, because it was a court, so which I think it was about"
00:09:41,00:09:44,"a bit bigger than a normal wine bottle, a liter or whatever."
00:09:44,00:09:49,"But a massive audience turned up, including the king's son, lots of nobility."
00:09:49,00:09:53,"There was obviously a ruse, he wasn't going to climb inside a wine bottle."
00:09:53,00:09:57,"And so people got really pissed off, and so they went, and he didn't turn up, no one came"
00:09:57,00:09:58,on stage.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"And the benches were torn out, this was the Haymarket Theatre, Big Theatre, Scenery"
00:10:01,00:10:06,"Totally Destroyed, Debris was dragged out of the theatre, and all of the stuff inside"
00:10:06,00:10:08,the theatre was set on fire.
00:10:08,00:10:12,"And one newspaper explained this the next day, the fact that the guy hadn't turned up"
00:10:12,00:10:17,"and climbed inside a wine bottle, explained it by saying he had given a private audience"
00:10:17,00:10:18,beforehand.
00:10:18,00:10:23,"And we're upon receiving a demonstration of the trick, the viewer, as in that private audience"
00:10:23,00:10:28,had caulked up the bottle and whipped it in his pocket and made of.
00:10:28,00:10:38,"Of, okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:10:38,00:10:44,My fact this week is that the main source for Sigmund Freud's work on paranoid schizophrenia
00:10:44,00:10:50,was the memoirs of a man who made unbelievable and ludicrous claims.
00:10:50,00:10:56,That man's name was Dan Schreber.
00:10:56,00:10:59,Daniel Paul Schreber was his name.
00:10:59,00:11:08,"This is a guy he lived from 1842 to 1911, and he wrote a memoir, memoirs of my nervous illness,"
00:11:08,00:11:11,and in it he was kind of trying to show what it was like from the inside of someone who
00:11:11,00:11:17,"was having all of these thoughts and so on, published the book, and Freud picked it up,"
00:11:17,00:11:18,and never met him.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"They lived at the same time, but didn't want to meet him because he didn't want to be influenced"
00:11:21,00:11:22,by it.
00:11:22,00:11:23,He just used the book.
00:11:23,00:11:26,And that was the basis for a lot of his Freud's work.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"Daniel Schreber's book is still in publication, if you go into book shops, that memoir."
00:11:30,00:11:32,It's how important it is.
00:11:32,00:11:37,So Schreber thought that there were little men living inside his feet that were taking
00:11:37,00:11:41,out his genitals and then putting female genitals in so he could have God's child.
00:11:41,00:11:42,Yes.
00:11:42,00:11:47,Putting female genitals into his feet or into the place where they're normally are.
00:11:47,00:11:48,Oh yeah.
00:11:48,00:11:51,But it was very hard to walk.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Yeah.
00:11:52,00:11:55,"He was mad, wasn't he, Freud?"
00:11:55,00:11:56,Freud.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"Freud was, yeah."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"Not this guy with the vagina in his foot, I think he was fine."
00:12:01,00:12:04,There were just so many things that were wrong about what he thought.
00:12:04,00:12:07,So he had a lifelong fear of trains.
00:12:07,00:12:13,They went for it and that was based on an experience he had in his early childhood which he explained
00:12:13,00:12:16,in a letter 40 years after the event.
00:12:16,00:12:21,"And he explained to one of his friends that when he was three years old, he'd moved house,"
00:12:21,00:12:24,"his whole family had moved house, not just him."
00:12:24,00:12:29,"And they'd moved, gone by train and he explained that he'd seen his mother naked on the overnight"
00:12:29,00:12:34,"train and he thought, you know, from that experience, he'd been permanently traumatized"
00:12:34,00:12:38,by seeing his mother naked and obviously being sexually attracted to her.
00:12:38,00:12:42,So there is an idea that he had this theory of the eat-up as complex.
00:12:42,00:12:47,"And now it's thought that maybe he had one, but it's not true that everyone has one."
00:12:47,00:12:50,"You know, he was almost not a psychiatrist."
00:12:50,00:12:55,He first started the first paper that he ever published was on eels and it was his attempt
00:12:55,00:12:57,to locate their testicles.
00:12:57,00:12:59,That was what he was doing.
00:12:59,00:13:04,"He dissected 400 eels looking for their testicles, just was obsessed."
00:13:04,00:13:06,"He was like, they've got to be somewhere."
00:13:06,00:13:10,"And at what stage do you go, I've done 399?"
00:13:10,00:13:11,Yeah.
00:13:11,00:13:13,"400, 400 was the same."
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:14,00:13:19,"Because he published the paper saying, didn't find them, but this was one of the great mysteries"
00:13:19,00:13:20,of the age.
00:13:20,00:13:21,It was.
00:13:21,00:13:22,We don't know who he was.
00:13:22,00:13:23,So what?
00:13:23,00:13:28,No one knew where eels bred and male eels only have gonads when they need them basically.
00:13:28,00:13:31,So Aristotle said that eels came from nothing.
00:13:31,00:13:34,That was his great theory.
00:13:34,00:13:37,I don't like to do what a chance is.
00:13:37,00:13:40,He sometimes said they came from the guts of wet soil as well.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Yes.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:43,And some people said they came out of thash roofs.
00:13:43,00:13:44,"I mean, no one knew."
00:13:44,00:13:48,"So, but the thing was Freud, when he wrote this paper, he said, well, they must have all"
00:13:48,00:13:49,been female.
00:13:49,00:13:52,That's the only explanation I can think of rather than that he got it wrong.
00:13:52,00:13:55,"And I read a great essay online which asked, you know, what, this must have been very"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"formative for Freud, it said, we know now that Freud viewed most people's problems through"
00:14:00,00:14:05,"a sexual lens, but was that lens tinted by the set of testicles he couldn't find a lifetime"
00:14:05,00:14:06,ago?
00:14:06,00:14:13,Did his inability to locate the eels reproductive organs prove so prominent in his studies that
00:14:13,00:14:18,he saw them everywhere he went in the manner that a rare car owner begins to see his car
00:14:18,00:14:22,everywhere soon after driving it off the lot?
00:14:22,00:14:26,So weird as similarly I've ever heard.
00:14:26,00:14:27,"He hated women though, didn't he?"
00:14:27,00:14:29,Maybe that's all about the eels testicles as well.
00:14:29,00:14:31,He was the heinous sexist.
00:14:31,00:14:35,So he said that women should be basically avoided because they were too susceptible to
00:14:35,00:14:37,being seduced.
00:14:37,00:14:40,He advised his friends against hanging out with them at all.
00:14:40,00:14:47,"He said that they have an ineptitude for serious life tasks that they are unstable, incapable"
00:14:47,00:14:52,of grasping their own unimportance and their people.
00:14:52,00:14:56,He said nature's inclined them to be vain and he said the only thing that women contributed
00:14:56,00:15:02,"to society are a plating and weaving because women traditionally were, they did do a lot"
00:15:02,00:15:08,of weaving and plating and he attributed this to obviously their desire to have a penis.
00:15:08,00:15:15,And so what he said was women are so upset about not having a penis that their plotting
00:15:15,00:15:19,is expressing their desire to plot their pubic hair in order to conceal the fact that they
00:15:19,00:15:22,have no male genitals on their face.
00:15:22,00:15:23,It's a killer.
00:15:23,00:15:28,"What's interesting is, you say he didn't like women but it was a woman who actually helped"
00:15:28,00:15:33,him get to his biggest breakthrough in psychiatry when sitting with them and she was appropriately
00:15:33,00:15:36,called Fanny.
00:15:36,00:15:37,Fanny Moser was her name.
00:15:37,00:15:44,He was treating her and he used to do it through hypnosis but he was a terrible hypnotist.
00:15:44,00:15:50,"You're unstable, you're weak, you wish you had a penis."
00:15:50,00:15:54,"So he used to do that, you're getting sleepy thing and Fanny Moser said actually I don't"
00:15:54,00:15:58,"think I am and he was like no you aren't, I really don't think I am."
00:15:58,00:16:02,So she just started talking and she was laying on the couch and kept talking and kept talking
00:16:02,00:16:04,"and he thought hang on a second, this is amazing."
00:16:04,00:16:08,I'm actually getting stuff here that's real and raw and that was the game changer for
00:16:08,00:16:09,him.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"In a way, the talking here was invented because a woman told him to shut the fuck up"
00:16:13,00:16:22,"because she, honestly because he, because Fanny, he used to say his theories to her and"
00:16:22,00:16:26,at one point she just said honestly please shut up because without your comments I can properly
00:16:26,00:16:31,"let my mind wander and work out what's going on and he was like okay cool, I'll just"
00:16:31,00:16:32,step back.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"Yeah, while he saw sex everywhere, didn't he?"
00:16:34,00:16:38,He thought anything elongated such as sticks or tree trunks or umbrellas represented the
00:16:38,00:16:44,penis. He said that walking up and down steps symbolise a sexual act.
00:16:44,00:16:48,You guys in the circle?
00:16:48,00:16:49,Sounds like it.
00:16:49,00:16:53,What was his day to day like but he just saw penises everywhere.
00:16:53,00:16:56,It must have been so distracting.
00:16:56,00:16:59,Do you guys know what the first Freudian slip was?
00:16:59,00:17:00,Oh no.
00:17:00,00:17:01,No.
00:17:01,00:17:07,"So the first Freudian slip was a young man who said Xoriare, X nostris or Cibus Ulto, when"
00:17:07,00:17:15,"as you all know, he should have said Xoriare, Alicuis, nostris, X, Cibus, Ulto, so I mean it's"
00:17:15,00:17:16,obvious isn't it?
00:17:16,00:17:21,I think it's like maybe a loving at that.
00:17:21,00:17:25,So basically it was the suppression of the word Alicuis meant that he must have had some
00:17:25,00:17:27,association with that word.
00:17:27,00:17:32,So he did a word association and said what does that make you think of and eventually got
00:17:32,00:17:40,to a word which was Saint Genuarius and Saint Genuarius kept his blood in a file which was supposed
00:17:40,00:17:44,to have turned into liquid once a year and then was solid the rest of the time and then
00:17:44,00:17:49,the man confessed that his girlfriend had missed her period and so Freud concluded that
00:17:49,00:17:54,he had blocked out this word from ten minutes ago because he associated that with the fact
00:17:54,00:18:00,that his girlfriend might be pregnant.
00:18:00,00:18:07,"You shouldn't give your blood in a file, it makes the cardboard soggy."
00:18:07,00:18:12,"Have we talked about the cocaine, I don't think we have, a huge fan of cocaine."
00:18:12,00:18:16,He experimented with it as a student believing it would alleviate his depression and anxiety
00:18:16,00:18:21,"and great news it did and he just started posting, it was this bizarre period where you were"
00:18:21,00:18:24,just posting cocaine around because it wasn't really illegal so he sent it to his fiancee
00:18:24,00:18:32,to make us strong. She must have been plotting like mad after that.
00:18:32,00:18:36,He gave it to his great friend who was called Fleischel because Fleischel was addicted to
00:18:36,00:18:42,"morphine and he said I know something that will cure you morphine addiction, try cocaine."
00:18:42,00:18:48,Fleischel then became completely addicted to cocaine and he claimed it had been a success
00:18:48,00:18:49,but it had not.
00:18:49,00:18:53,One of the things he justified it with when he was recommending it to this guy whose life
00:18:53,00:18:58,"was ruined by Freud forcing cocaine on him. Freud said the wonderful thing about cocaine,"
00:18:58,00:19:03,the best thing about it is there is absolutely no craving for the further use of cocaine
00:19:03,00:19:13,after your first take it or even repeatedly.
00:19:13,00:19:20,Your seat number has been taken down but I was looking into with Freud just off the back
00:19:20,00:19:25,of David Garrick I thought what did he do as hobbies did he go to the theater for example
00:19:25,00:19:29,and I could only find one example and it was to see a guy who we've mentioned very briefly
00:19:29,00:19:34,on this podcast before called Le Petalmaine.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"Le Petalmaine, the fighter, his act was to just fart on stage."
00:19:37,00:19:42,What's interesting is it wasn't that he was eating generating gas and farting he was sucking
00:19:42,00:19:47,air up into his bum and farting it back out so he discovered this when he was in the
00:19:47,00:19:53,ocean and he was almost drowning he notices the ocean getting very slightly lower.
00:19:53,00:19:57,As he was drowning he went and it went both in and up at the same time and he was like
00:19:57,00:20:02,that's weird he came back to the surface he went to the beach and it all flooded out
00:20:02,00:20:06,of his butt and he thought what's happening here so highlights of his act they involved
00:20:06,00:20:10,the effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms from his bum.
00:20:10,00:20:15,He could play Osolomio through a sort of rubber tube in his bum.
00:20:15,00:20:18,I don't know that would you mind performing it?
00:20:18,00:20:22,We know it as just one conneto.
00:20:22,00:20:26,"And that's who that's Sigmund Freud, the only example I could find of him going to the"
00:20:26,00:20:28,theater was to see the farting man.
00:20:28,00:20:31,Well he was very into defecation.
00:20:31,00:20:34,He thought that was extremely important.
00:20:34,00:20:35,"Freud was, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:41,"Alright so was he going follow through, follow through?"
00:20:41,00:20:48,So he was convinced that obsession with defecation and obsession with money were related and
00:20:48,00:20:50,he said that he was obsessed with money himself.
00:20:50,00:20:56,"He said money is like laughing gas to me, he loved being rich and he thought that being"
00:20:56,00:21:02,into excrement was something that transferred and later life into being into money and he
00:21:02,00:21:07,said that like there's a constant association with them in our minds and because it's the
00:21:07,00:21:12,contrast he thought between the most precious thing which is money and the least precious thing
00:21:12,00:21:13,which is shit.
00:21:13,00:21:17,And he also said it's because there's this perfect transition.
00:21:17,00:21:22,"So when you're in your youth, you're he thought erotically interested in defecation but"
00:21:22,00:21:27,not money and then as soon as that starts to recede you become erotically interested in
00:21:27,00:21:28,money.
00:21:28,00:21:31,And so he thought they were intrinsically related.
00:21:31,00:21:32,Whoing and money.
00:21:32,00:21:39,As we understand he was wrong about everything.
00:21:39,00:21:48,My fact this week is that swordfish can speed up and slow down time with their minds.
00:21:48,00:21:51,So this is this amazing thing that has been discovered about swordfish quite recently.
00:21:51,00:21:56,So if you say speed up and slow down time and the end time is about how you're perceiving
00:21:56,00:21:57,stuff right.
00:21:57,00:22:03,The swordfish if hunting their time perception is about the same time as ours which means
00:22:03,00:22:07,that they basically are processing all the images that are coming into their eyes and
00:22:07,00:22:09,their brain is pressing that as fast as we do.
00:22:09,00:22:13,So the experience time in the same way as we do but if they're not hunting then time
00:22:13,00:22:18,goes about five times more slowly for them it all slows down and they can do this deliberately.
00:22:18,00:22:23,So what they do is they heat up their brains and their eyes and that just makes them be
00:22:23,00:22:25,able to absorb more information.
00:22:25,00:22:30,So the faster you can see light coming into your eyes and all these images then the slower
00:22:30,00:22:31,time comes.
00:22:31,00:22:33,It's amazing and it means that they can hunt better right?
00:22:33,00:22:34,Yeah exactly.
00:22:34,00:22:40,So it's like a good kind of an analogy is if you swap a fly or you try to swap a fly
00:22:40,00:22:45,then you're usually unsuccessful and that is because they are seeing way more frames
00:22:45,00:22:46,per second than you are.
00:22:46,00:22:51,So you think you've got really close but to them like it's like so easy.
00:22:51,00:22:55,Like to a fly if they watch a movie it's just like a drawing and then a bit of a weight
00:22:55,00:23:00,and then another drawing and then a bit of a weight and that's why we say time flies.
00:23:00,00:23:01,No it isn't.
00:23:01,00:23:02,Yes it isn't.
00:23:02,00:23:04,I'm pretty sure it is.
00:23:04,00:23:06,So what happens because I've actually swatted flies.
00:23:06,00:23:08,Do I have access to faster time?
00:23:08,00:23:13,No you're not a neo in this analogy.
00:23:13,00:23:16,No it means that they just didn't see you coming but if they were to see you coming it
00:23:16,00:23:17,would be like neo isn't it?
00:23:17,00:23:21,It's like in the matrix you kind of see it slowing down and coming towards you really
00:23:21,00:23:25,really slowly.
00:23:25,00:23:27,And the weird thing is that they knew that swordfish did this thing with a heat up their
00:23:27,00:23:28,eyes and their brains.
00:23:28,00:23:34,They found that out a few years ago but they only just realized why and they did it by removing
00:23:34,00:23:39,the retiners of freshly caught swordfish and they put them in a bath and they connected
00:23:39,00:23:45,them to some electrodes to measure their response of those retiners to lots of flashes
00:23:45,00:23:51,of light and they changed the temperature of the bath that the retinas were in and when
00:23:51,00:23:56,it was in a hotter bath then their response to light was ten times faster so their response
00:23:56,00:24:01,their ability to absorb lots of information and this is just a detached retina fully detached
00:24:01,00:24:07,from the fish which is being eaten somewhere and that retina responded ten times faster
00:24:07,00:24:10,to the light that was being given to it than if they were in a bath that was much colder.
00:24:10,00:24:11,It is amazing.
00:24:11,00:24:14,Do you know they don't stab their prey?
00:24:14,00:24:15,I sort of vaguely assume that they would stab it.
00:24:15,00:24:20,Because they have like a really long swordfish and they're sort of up a jaw and I just assume
00:24:20,00:24:23,that they would cabab as it were.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:27,I think the problem would be if you're a fish and you cabab a fish you can't grab it with
00:24:27,00:24:29,your hands can you because you don't have hands?
00:24:29,00:24:30,Very true.
00:24:30,00:24:33,If you were feeding others if you went round as the cabab.
00:24:33,00:24:34,If you are the cabab.
00:24:34,00:24:35,Yes.
00:24:35,00:24:36,That would be very nice.
00:24:36,00:24:37,Yeah.
00:24:37,00:24:38,So for a coffee party.
00:24:38,00:24:39,Your waiter comes over.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yeah.
00:24:40,00:24:44,What a party that would be where the waiter had all the food balanced on his nose for
00:24:44,00:24:45,you.
00:24:45,00:24:46,Yeah.
00:24:46,00:24:47,I'd go.
00:24:47,00:24:48,But the problem is their solitary fish so they can't do that.
00:24:48,00:24:49,They can't eat off each other's noses.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"Oh, they're quite solitary."
00:24:50,00:24:51,But they do.
00:24:51,00:24:52,"Yeah, they're very solitary."
00:24:52,00:24:54,"But what they do is, they did not know this."
00:24:54,00:24:59,"So they do their sailfish do this as well, another fish with a very, very long up a jaw."
00:24:59,00:25:04,"They slowly put their bill into a school of sardines or other smaller fish and then yeah,"
00:25:04,00:25:08,"yeah, yeah, they thrash their head from side to side, sorrow, like sorrow."
00:25:08,00:25:09,Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"And then they've, they've, they've injured enough fish in that."
00:25:12,00:25:13,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, bit."
00:25:13,00:25:15,And that they can catch them.
00:25:15,00:25:16,They can then just eat them.
00:25:16,00:25:19,"I mean, it's amazing how they do that with the noses."
00:25:19,00:25:23,Because they will slot their noses into a big school of fish that they've heard it into a big
00:25:23,00:25:24,cluster.
00:25:24,00:25:26,And the fish don't notice.
00:25:26,00:25:31,"So you can see the swordfish or the sailfish's nose sitting in amongst them, just wasting with"
00:25:31,00:25:33,all the fish coming around.
00:25:33,00:25:39,"They sweat out of their noses, but instead of sweating sweat, they sweat lube."
00:25:39,00:25:41,"Is there, what's the, what's the purpose of it?"
00:25:41,00:25:45,"Well, it makes them really slippery and it means they can swim really, really quickly."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Oh, okay."
00:25:46,00:25:47,Yeah.
00:25:47,00:25:51,"That's a sexy evening where you go, did you bring the swordfish?"
00:25:51,00:25:52,Insistently.
00:25:52,00:25:56,"In the 18th century, it was believed that swordfish would dive out of the way if they heard"
00:25:56,00:26:00,anyone speaking Italian.
00:26:00,00:26:03,So all the local fishermen spoke Greek the whole time.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Wow.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Wow.
00:26:05,00:26:09,"But we think what that actually was, it was basically an excuse for not catching them."
00:26:09,00:26:14,"So you have a cartony swordfish, oh, it's because, you know, Leonardo has been speaking"
00:26:14,00:26:18,"Italian, that's why we didn't catch them."
00:26:18,00:26:21,We're going to have to move on very shortly to our next act.
00:26:21,00:26:22,Just one last bodily control thing.
00:26:22,00:26:23,Yeah.
00:26:23,00:26:24,So this is about heating yourself up.
00:26:24,00:26:29,There are monks in Tibet who can decide how hot they are just through meditation.
00:26:29,00:26:30,"I mean, really?"
00:26:30,00:26:33,"Yes, it's been tested and it's not like a huge difference."
00:26:33,00:26:37,It's not as though they'll be dangerous to touch.
00:26:37,00:26:41,But they can increase the temperature of their extremities just through meditation.
00:26:41,00:26:43,They train themselves a bit of years and they're quite good at it.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"There is a report which says that if you put wet sheets on them, they could be dry within"
00:26:47,00:26:48,an hour.
00:26:48,00:26:49,But I think that is not true.
00:26:49,00:26:52,I think that's an exaggeration.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"Also, I think it's quite offensive to do that."
00:26:55,00:26:57,I'm meditating.
00:26:57,00:27:02,"OK, it is time for our final factor, the show, and that is Andy."
00:27:02,00:27:07,"My fact is that in 1986, Waddington's invented a board game which was all about trading cattle"
00:27:07,00:27:09,semen.
00:27:09,00:27:14,"This is a real game, it's called ""Grade Up to Elite Cow""."
00:27:14,00:27:20,It sells itself as a game of skill and chance for dairy farmers.
00:27:20,00:27:27,And we have a copy here tonight.
00:27:27,00:27:31,"That's good, it says from two to 3,000 players."
00:27:31,00:27:38,This was by the British Freezing Cattle Society and it's basically marketing for cattle farmers.
00:27:38,00:27:43,"It's like monopoly, basically, but instead of property, you collect semen."
00:27:43,00:27:45,So there are various squares all the way round.
00:27:45,00:27:46,There are risks and rewards.
00:27:46,00:27:53,"Here's one of the squares, ""Accident to semen flask, all your semen is lost unless an insurance"
00:27:53,00:27:54,policy is held.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"Return all your semen discs."""
00:27:56,00:27:57,It's incredible.
00:27:57,00:27:58,It's amazing.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"Has anyone ever played this, do you know?"
00:28:00,00:28:01,Lots of people.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"If you go online, I started googling, so many people have played it."
00:28:04,00:28:05,Really?
00:28:05,00:28:10,"There's a great website called ""BoardGameGeek.com"" and they have a lot of reviews."
00:28:10,00:28:11,"Oh, nice."
00:28:11,00:28:12,Cool.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"But the reviews are, I mean, no one really loves the game, but they love the idea of it."
00:28:16,00:28:23,So one of the reviews was monopoly with cows and semen.
00:28:23,00:28:24,The rules are quite complicated.
00:28:24,00:28:30,You start with little cows and you go around the board and there are various semen companies.
00:28:30,00:28:35,"There's one thing, which is there's many pitfalls along the way as you're going around."
00:28:35,00:28:40,"So you can pick up those market cards that you get, sort of like monopoly, which will"
00:28:40,00:28:45,"state stuff like, ""This cow has persistent mastitis, seller at the market price."""
00:28:45,00:28:48,"It's a thoroughly realistic game, basically."
00:28:48,00:28:49,Is it?
00:28:49,00:28:50,"Well, yeah, I think so."
00:28:50,00:28:51,I think that's very deceitful.
00:28:51,00:28:54,You can't sell a cow at market price or a persistent mastitis.
00:28:54,00:28:57,I noticed you didn't do this in Devon where we were last week.
00:28:57,00:29:00,You've been picked out of town.
00:29:00,00:29:01,That's true.
00:29:01,00:29:03,So is it to help farmers?
00:29:03,00:29:06,It doesn't help anything really.
00:29:06,00:29:08,It's not helping anyone.
00:29:08,00:29:10,But there are lots of more games where the point was to help.
00:29:10,00:29:13,So they used to have very moral purposes.
00:29:13,00:29:18,So the new game of human life was a 1790 classic and the aim of that was to be the first player
00:29:18,00:29:20,to become an old man.
00:29:20,00:29:21,That's it.
00:29:21,00:29:25,Surely whoever's oldest at the start has that advantage.
00:29:25,00:29:29,You have to move through the seven periods of life and accumulate moral observations along
00:29:29,00:29:30,the way.
00:29:30,00:29:33,Have you heard of Trump the game?
00:29:33,00:29:34,No.
00:29:34,00:29:35,"That was quite a big one, actually."
00:29:35,00:29:40,"It was launched in 1989 with the tagline, ""It's not whether you win or lose, it's whether"
00:29:40,00:29:41,"you win."""
00:29:41,00:29:42,That's great.
00:29:42,00:29:43,That's great.
00:29:43,00:29:44,That's great.
00:29:44,00:29:45,That's great.
00:29:45,00:29:46,That's great.
00:29:46,00:29:47,I hope it's on his gravestone.
00:29:47,00:29:48,Yeah.
00:29:48,00:29:49,Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:53,"The head of Parker Brothers said, ""It can leave you exhausted and feeling like you don't"
00:29:53,00:29:54,"want to play again."""
00:29:54,00:29:58,Words later attributed to Stormy Daniels.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Yes.
00:29:59,00:30:05,"Can I just, you mentioned the game of life, I think, the early version, and I used to play"
00:30:05,00:30:11,"the game of life as a kid and it's amazing, but it actually started in 1860 and at that time"
00:30:11,00:30:13,it was called The Checkered Game of Life.
00:30:13,00:30:20,"It was made by this lithographer, so like an image printer, an artist called Milton Bradley,"
00:30:20,00:30:24,"and he was very successful at the game of life, but the reason he had to make it is because"
00:30:24,00:30:28,"he'd been very unsuccessful in another way, so if you've ever played the game of life,"
00:30:28,00:30:35,"the reason it exists is because Milton Bradley made lithographs of Abraham Lincoln, and"
00:30:35,00:30:39,"that was when he was a presidential nominee, he wasn't very well-known, and he didn't have"
00:30:39,00:30:40,a beard.
00:30:40,00:30:41,They were clean shaver.
00:30:41,00:30:44,Wasn't it like a little girl who told him to get a beard or something?
00:30:44,00:30:45,It was.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yeah.
00:30:46,00:30:47,So him and this little girl would have beef.
00:30:47,00:30:51,"So he sold these lithographs really well, and they were extremely popular, and then Lincoln"
00:30:51,00:30:55,"suddenly thought, ""I'll grow my distinctive beard that everyone will associate with me"
00:30:55,00:31:00,"forevermore,"" and the prince became totally worthless, and this guy, Milton Bradley, went completely"
00:31:00,00:31:05,"bankrupt, and then he grew to the game of life, and he was a very moralistic guy, so the game"
00:31:05,00:31:11,"of life, if you've ever played it, has a spinning thing in the centre rather than a dice, and"
00:31:11,00:31:16,"that is because dice were associated with gambling, and he was very Christian, and dice were evil,"
00:31:16,00:31:25,"so he had a spinning tea totem, then it's not funny actually, it's evil."
00:31:25,00:31:28,"That's what it has, but it became super popular."
00:31:28,00:31:31,"Oh, this is something that I think we may have mentioned before, so during the Second World"
00:31:31,00:31:38,"War, MI9, which is like the cool version of MI5 and 6, they smuggled escape kits to prisoners"
00:31:38,00:31:42,"of, you know, Allied prisoners of war who were being held in Germany, they smuggled the"
00:31:42,00:31:47,"escape kits inside Monopoly, and the other thing they did, they got in touch with another"
00:31:47,00:31:52,"firm, and they distributed snakes and ladders kits with genuine escape equipment hidden"
00:31:52,00:31:53,inside.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Not the actual ladders, you couldn't escape with others."
00:31:55,00:31:58,"No, it wasn't the actual laddy you could put."
00:31:58,00:32:03,If I were a prison guard and someone had a snake and ladders kit delivered with an enormous
00:32:03,00:32:07,"spade within the box, I would notice."
00:32:07,00:32:09,"Yeah, but they genuinely did it."
00:32:09,00:32:10,Amazing.
00:32:10,00:32:16,That was invented by one of Anne Frank's schoolmates.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Wow.
00:32:17,00:32:18,Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:21,And it was two people who invented guess who.
00:32:21,00:32:22,They became a couple.
00:32:22,00:32:24,They actually knew each other at that time as well.
00:32:24,00:32:28,"They used to walk to school together in the morning, but didn't go to the same school."
00:32:28,00:32:32,"And they ultimately invented not only guess who, but over a hundred board games, many of"
00:32:32,00:32:36,"which we know the names of, or might have played, for various different countries."
00:32:36,00:32:42,"But they started, their very first thing was inventing a thing for the Borden dairy company."
00:32:42,00:32:46,So they started by working for cows as well.
00:32:46,00:32:49,"But that couple, they, I think, got separated at one point."
00:32:49,00:32:55,"And they had to, well, the guy had to find her and, you know, he went to the police station"
00:32:55,00:32:57,"and they said, ""Does she have glasses?"""
00:32:57,00:32:58,"And he said, ""No."""
00:32:58,00:33:02,"And they said, ""Well, is she wearing a hat and a mask?"""
00:33:02,00:33:07,"It's God, that was a long one."
00:33:07,00:33:09,The Soviet Union had amazing games.
00:33:09,00:33:10,Yeah.
00:33:10,00:33:11,They were also very moralistic.
00:33:11,00:33:15,"So there was the game, tuberculosis, a proletarian disease."
00:33:15,00:33:21,"That was, look after your health, the new hygiene game, the abandoned where you had to round"
00:33:21,00:33:24,up homeless children and take them to an orphanage.
00:33:24,00:33:29,"And my favourite, healthy living, where you had to become the healthiest worker possible."
00:33:29,00:33:32,So basically it was the Soviet Union trying to inculcate its values into people.
00:33:32,00:33:37,So you would be penalised for consulting folk healers or drinking a beer at lunch or
00:33:37,00:33:39,consulting with a strange woman.
00:33:39,00:33:40,Wow.
00:33:40,00:33:41,There you are.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Crazy.
00:33:42,00:33:43,"We're going to have to wrap up soon, guys."
00:33:43,00:33:46,There's a kickstarter where you can get involved at the moment.
00:33:46,00:33:53,"It's a board game and it's called Brexit, the board game of second chances."
00:33:53,00:33:54,And third chances.
00:33:54,00:33:59,"And they say, ""We invite you to relive that historic"
00:33:59,00:34:03,"referendum, but this time you're in control."""
00:34:03,00:34:04,God.
00:34:04,00:34:07,"""On like no one being in control."""
00:34:07,00:34:09,It's like you've gone to hell.
00:34:09,00:34:13,"Honestly, if someone, if the devil said to you, ""I invite you to relive that historic"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"referendum and this time you're in control."""
00:34:15,00:34:19,"You'd be like, ""Oh cool, this is hell then."""
00:34:19,00:34:24,"They say, ""This is the absolute must have game to make all this political mayhem fun"
00:34:24,00:34:25,"again."""
00:34:25,00:34:33,"I'll just go one last thing, which is sometimes there are mistakes on board games."
00:34:33,00:34:38,"And in 2017, the makers of the Anton Dex Saturday Night Takeaway board game were forced"
00:34:38,00:34:41,to apologise after it was found to contain multiple errors.
00:34:41,00:34:47,One question claimed that the moon is 225 miles from the earth.
00:34:47,00:34:50,"Okay, that is it."
00:34:50,00:34:51,That is all of our facts.
00:34:51,00:34:53,Thank you so much for listening.
