00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.260
 this week coming to you live from Manchester!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.000
 (crowd cheering)

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.980
 (crowd cheering)

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:39.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.360
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.400
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 - Okay, my fact this week is that theories

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.720
 for the origin of life on earth include,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.180
 primordial soup, primordial sandwich,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020
 primordial soup and sandwich,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.000
 primordial pizza, and primordial mayonnaise.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.760
 (crowd cheering)

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.900
 - Is there a primordial salad option, please?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.760
 (crowd laughing)

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.020
 - For a primordial vegan, yeah.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.480
 Now, so this is, I was reading about the origin of life,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.600
 and I think a few people might know about primordial soup,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800
 that is the idea where you might get a puddle or something

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.720
 and there's loads of molecules in there,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.800
 and somehow they self-arrange,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.600
 and then those self-arranged molecules

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.240
 manage to replicate and they make life.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 Now, there's a lot of problems with primordial soup,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.700
 so people have come up with other theories,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.920
 so how do these molecules get in the right place?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.560
 Primordial sandwiches, you've got two rocks,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.440
 and they kind of squish the molecules together.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.000
 Primordial soup and sandwich,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 you've got the soup and you've got the rocks,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.160
 and that's all kind of all together.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 Primordial pizza, you just have a rock

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.660
 and the molecules are on top.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.960
 - Okay, nice.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.560
 - Primordial mayonnaise is like a load of fat bubbles

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.240
 and they're kind of the molecules grow in the fat bubbles.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.080
 - Right.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 - And for all light, no, none of them is true.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.080
 - Yeah, because we all know God made us, so thank you.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.320
 - You're welcome.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.440
 - Is this one person just kind of just tossing all this shit out?

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.320
 - Yes, it's me.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.040
 Lots of scientists have talked about all these different things,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 but I'm the one who's kind of put them together

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.840
 in a jovial little sentence.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.440
 - A menu, a nice menu.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.200
 - Have they called them those things?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're real names.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.000
 - Right, okay.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.960
 - Yeah, yeah, they're real names.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.160
 - I didn't think you had the imagination

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.920
 to come up with primordial pizza.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 - Okay.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.160
 - Is there one that's most likely, you know,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.480
 what are we getting?

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.080
 - I think at the moment, yeah,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.440
 kind of the soup and sandwich is quite liked by people,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.280
 and--

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.200
 - So it's not soup and sandwich per se,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.760
 it's a soup sandwich.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.400
 - It is a bit, isn't it?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.960
 - That doesn't sound quite as appetizing as soup sandwich.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.800
 - No, very sorry.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.320
 - So it sounds like it's a sandwich floating on some soup.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.080
 - Primordial crouton, if you will.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.320
 - Yes, very nice.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.880
 - I thought it was a soup in between two bits of bread.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.160
 - That's what it is, unfortunately.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.600
 - Oh, what? - A soup sandwich.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.240
 - Oh, that is, that's fucking out there for a theory.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.880
 - So the idea of primordial soup,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 which was the first one of these theories,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.280
 it was thought of, first of all,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.920
 by two people actually independently,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.040
 a British guy called JBS Haldane,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.120
 and the Russian scientist called Alexander Operin.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.720
 And the interesting thing about him,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.760
 he came up with primordial soup,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.680
 but then later in life, he edited a book

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.000
 that contains at least 113 different recipes

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.240
 for actual soup.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.520
 (laughing)

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.960
 - It makes you suspicious about the primordial soup theory,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.480
 'cause it sounds like he's just really into soup.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.840
 - Yeah, he's just pushing his next career.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.400
 It's such a weird switcheroo

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.680
 to go from proper organic chemistry stuff

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.240
 to editing a cookbook.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.000
 - Yes, it would be weird,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.880
 apart from it was in the Soviet Union,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.480
 and all sorts of weird stuff was happening.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.480
 Basically, they had this kind of propaganda cookbook

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.560
 that they would give to all,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.880
 well, all married couples would get one, basically.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.040
 You know, it was the right kind of Soviet food

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.480
 that you should be eating.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.560
 And at the time, they'd just done Sputnik,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.080
 and they were kind of pushing themselves

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.680
 as scientists in the Soviet Union,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.320
 as best scientists in the world,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.720
 and they thought, well, our cookbook

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.680
 should also be really scientific,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.440
 so we're gonna get our best scientist

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 who's this guy operating,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.760
 and we're gonna say you're gonna edit it.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.840
 - That makes sense. - That's interesting, yeah.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.560
 - That's like that Michelin bloke who makes foam shit.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.240
 He's been just, yeah, exactly, Blumenthal.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.560
 - Hester Blumenthal, yeah.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560
 - Is it like him?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.280
 - Yeah, he basically does chemistry, doesn't he?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.120
 - It's like him.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.960
 - It's like him.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.200
 - Professor Stephen Hawkins did a cookbook.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.800
 - Right. - Okay.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.080
 - I thought you meant the actual Michelin man

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.640
 when you said that, and really threw me for a second.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.360
 - Yeah, a lot of marshmallow-based stuff.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.600
 That cookbook, by the way,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.840
 it was called The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.240
 that was its name, and it was published in 1939,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.160
 and as you said, changed.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.760
 It's all kind of like 400 different recipes,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.240
 all good Soviet fare,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.760
 but unfortunately, 'cause it was the Soviet Union,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.640
 the book kept on being perched,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.960
 and so there were all these

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.280
 like strongly radical changes in direction,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.360
 so it used to be a very internationalist book,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.160
 and then that went out of fashion,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.640
 and so they just cut all the international stuff.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.440
 - It's borscht, every page borscht.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.000
 - It was kind of, yeah.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.920
 - Yeah, and then there were lots of quotes

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.280
 from Stalin all the way through the book,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.880
 and then Stalin died in 1953.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.480
 Cut, all Stalin quotes gone through the book, really.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.320
 - Yeah, I must say, I know that there's at least

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.280
 113 different recipes for soup,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.320
 because I read through the book,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.840
 and just searched for the word soup, or borscht,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.160
 or we all know whatever, and that's as many as I found.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.840
 There might be more for all I know, but yeah.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.880
 - Wow.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.760
 - And yeah, this was a really important book,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.640
 like you say, it was the book of tasty and healthy food,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.560
 but sometimes just known as Kniga, just the book.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.200
 That's how famous it was, this book,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.480
 it just called the book,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.880
 and everyone knew what you were talking about.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880
 - Oh, that's awesome.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.720
 - Oh, wow.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.960
 - Hey, does that old thing,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.840
 it's a sort of a thing that Einstein said,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.880
 which was, he said that his second best idea

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.680
 that he ever had was to boil his eggs in soup,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.280
 because then you're saving up on some washing up,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.760
 you're using one less thing.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.000
 - And you know, that's a thing that I think--

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.200
 - Is that good though?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400
 It feels like you get like an egg's come out

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.600
 of a chicken's bum, right?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.440
 - Yeah.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.360
 - Well, not technically, actually, interestingly.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.200
 - Okay.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.360
 - But close.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.840
 I'll tell you later.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.320
 - It's come out of the same place

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.080
 as the feces come, right?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.920
 - That's a good point.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.200
 - And so do you really want that in your soup?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 - That's a very good point.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.080
 - When you boil stuff, it gets rid of all the stuff in it.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.200
 - Yeah, but you're not gonna do a shit in your hinds,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.040
 are you?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.120
 (audience laughing)

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.160
 - Good, that could take off as a saying though.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.240
 - He's really shot the hinds today.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.640
 - Actually, there is a thing called yellow soup,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.600
 which is basically-- - Yes, yellow soup.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.240
 - Poin soup, which was a delicacy in China,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.680
 back a long time ago.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.360
 So I think it was in the fourth century,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.680
 there was a Chinese recipe for yellow soup,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.240
 very popular, it was put forward by a doctor,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.640
 and he said, this guy called Guihong,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.920
 gave this recipe for broth that involved drying

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.160
 and fermenting a healthy person's poo,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.040
 and stirring it into a broth,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.680
 and then you give it to a sick person,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.920
 and it makes them better.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.520
 And of course, the good thing about that is--

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.360
 - Oh, that could work.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.200
 - It bloody works.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.040
 - Yeah, really.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.200
 - We've discovered now with fecal transplants these days.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.280
 - I mean, sorry.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.240
 Could we just row back on the whole "it works" thing?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240
 (audience laughing)

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.200
 This doesn't sound like that would have worked.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.480
 - It probably didn't work.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.720
 He had the right idea though,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.360
 I think he was on the right track.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.960
 Yeah, yellow soup, worth a try, I would say.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.800
 - There are enough.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.640
 - Don't boil it too much,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.480
 otherwise you might lose the microorganisms

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480
 for the transplant.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.320
 - Yeah.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.640
 - Well, you should have called it brown Windsor.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.840
 (audience laughing)

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.520
 But that was already a soup.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.360
 - Is it?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.200
 - 1,500 years later.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.040
 (audience laughing)

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040
 Brown soup was a really weird soup.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.840
 It was this sort of mythical soup.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.080
 It wasn't mythical, it was real,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080
 but it wasn't in many places.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.200
 It was just sort of a horrible, cheap soup

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.120
 that was in lots of restaurants

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.040
 around the turn of the 20th century.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.560
 And it kind of had a posh name,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.360
 so it sounded classy,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.960
 but it was basically leftover meat,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.600
 and the ingredients were--

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.440
 - Sorry, was it called brown soup?

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.280
 - Brown Windsor.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.800
 - Brown Windsor, sorry, posh name.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.280
 'Cause brown is not a posh thing,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.680
 but once you put it next to Windsor.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.520
 - Isn't that gruel?

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.320
 That sounds like gruel.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.680
 It's not gruel, it's definitely soup.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.520
 - Hmm.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.360
 - Yeah.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.200
 - What do you think it sounds like?

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.240
 - What a spectrum we're on now

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.680
 between gruel, soup, broths, stew, you know.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.520
 Well, I had gruel.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.920
 Have you had gruel?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920
 - It's just like porridge, isn't it?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.840
 Just like porridge.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.680
 - That's why I thought it was.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.520
 - What do you mean by having gruel?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.360
 - What are you talking about?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.200
 It's not what I think.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.680
 - Oh, you were living with Mr. Bumble.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.200
 (audience laughing)

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.840
 Oh, God, that sounded so rough.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.640
 - I can't believe how badly you bullied Oliver.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.480
 That was harsh.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.320
 - Yeah.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.320
 Did you ever get that second helping that you wanted?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.800
 (audience laughing)

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.760
 - I had gruel, and I'm not sure that many people have gruel.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.360
 - When did you have it, and what was it?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.320
 - Oh, I went to this party where the table,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.280
 you had to play a game,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.440
 and on one side of the table was really good food,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.520
 and on the other side was gruel.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.440
 And so it was like the worst kind of food.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.400
 And if you lost the game, you moved down a seat,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.840
 and you went all the way down.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.560
 And I had a partner who desperately wanted to go

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.200
 to the good food, as everyone else did.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.080
 But I'd never had gruel before, so I was like,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.720
 surely we gotta head that way,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.640
 and I kept making us go that way,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.280
 and she threw an entire glass of red wine

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280
 all over my shirt.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.120
 - Whoa.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.120
 - Yeah, you know, like in the movies.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.720
 - That's an overreaction.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.880
 - Did you get to eat, taste it, though?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.040
 - I did, and you enjoyed it.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.960
 It was horrific.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.400
 It was the worst thing I've ever tasted.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.640
 It sounds like Brown Windsor.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.520
 - I thought you were gonna say

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.720
 that you kissed a gruel and you liked it.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.800
 (audience laughing)

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.080
 The room's been divided.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.880
 (audience laughing)

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.880
 I'm just soup, or could, maybe, cure malaria.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.160
 Which is a big deal, 'cause it's a big old killer.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.440
 And this was discovered by some school children.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.000
 So, and this was in a study that was authored

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.960
 by school children.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.200
 It's the only study I've ever found authored

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.280
 by school children.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.680
 And it was a really short time ago.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.080
 There's a parent at a local school in London

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.280
 called Jake Baum, and he also happened to be

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.000
 a professor of cell biology.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.640
 And he decided it would be fun

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.920
 to suggest a class project where all the kids

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.880
 brought in a vial of the soup that their mom made them

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.800
 or their dad made them whenever they were sick,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.760
 whenever they were ill.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.600
 And then he'd suggested that in their science class,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.360
 the science teacher must have hated this parent,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.560
 he suggested they spin out all the soups

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.600
 in the centrifuge, which I guess the school

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.960
 then had to invest in,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.360
 and then test them on a malaria parasite.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.160
 And see, because soup, traditionally chicken soup,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.200
 is supposed to make you feel better,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.920
 there must be something in it, it's this old wives thing.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.040
 And they did indeed find that five of the soups

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.400
 reduced the growth or the sexual development

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.240
 of the parasites by over 50%,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.680
 which is exactly the same as malaria drugs.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.000
 - Wow. - Isn't that incredible?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.120
 - So what, do we have to inject ourselves with this soup?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.800
 - We would, but the problem is,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.880
 so this was published in the Archives of Disease and Childhood

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.360
 in 2019, but none of the parents had written down

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.720
 the ingredients of any of the soups they sent in.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.800
 - Oh no.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.560
 - So we have no idea.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.200
 - Just inject any soup into yourself, just in case.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.320
 - My soup has got paracetamol in it.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.680
 - Yeah. - It's got, yeah.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.760
 - Yeah.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.600
 - That's hilarious.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.200
 - Do you know in 1782, if you were in Haymarket in London,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.400
 that you could pay your very own money

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.280
 to go and have a bath in some soup?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.640
 - Oh, wow. - Yeah.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.960
 This was a thing in the 17th and 18th century

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.480
 in the whole of Europe, not just in the UK,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.080
 that people just seemed to bathe in soups.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.960
 - Wow. - Really?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.240
 - And it was supposed to be good for you,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.400
 it was supposed to like, you know, there's very healthy,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.640
 instead of just normal water,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.640
 you were getting some of the vitamins into your body.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.000
 - What flavor, any particular?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.400
 - Veal or other broths.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.480
 So that could be literally anything.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.320
 - Yeah, would you rather a bowl of soup

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.160
 that had a chicken's pooey egg sitting inside it,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.920
 yep, or a bowl of soup with Andy sitting inside it.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.120
 (laughing)

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.840
 - What flavor is the soup?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.520
 - Wow, tomato, let's say.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.560
 - Oh, no, I don't really like tomato soup.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.080
 - Okay, goes great with Andy though, so.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.920
 (laughing)

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.680
 - I get your point, yeah, definitely.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.560
 - That's weird, 'cause I've never, you know,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.800
 you read novels written in the 19th century, 18th century,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.960
 and never once have any of the characters

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.360
 been described as bathing in a tomato soup.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.280
 - That's 'cause it's so cotidious,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.040
 it's like everyone was doing it all the time,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.880
 it's like, why even write it in the novels?

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.640
 - Got it, it's like, front of cleaning your teeth.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.760
 - But the other thing is that at the moment,

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.120
 in the UNESEN spa resort in Hakone in Japan,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.400
 you can go into a ramen bath.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.720
 So it's still happening in Japan, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.200
 Apparently the collagen in the pork broth

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.840
 is supposed to give you healthier skin.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.400
 - You would not eat in that spa restaurant afterwards though,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.240
 would you?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.560
 - You piece is vicious.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.640
 - 'Cause if we didn't need to move on though

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.680
 to our second fact, it is time for fact number two,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.040
 and that is my fact, my fact this week,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.800
 is that the world's oldest postcard

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.760
 was sent by a writer called Theodore Hook.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.880
 He sent it to himself.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.280
 - Wow. - Yeah, Theodore.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.040
 - What did he say, wish I was here?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.560
 (laughing)

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.440
 - So it was sent in 1840,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.520
 and it was sent in London, in Fulham,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.960
 and it was a postcard where you could see people

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.400
 who were working at the post office around a big inkwell,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.840
 and the idea was that that was satirizing the post system.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.240
 So he sent it to himself,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.160
 so that means the only other person who's seen it

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.520
 would have been the postman, right?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.360
 - Yes, exactly.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.200
 - And you'll see there's something you bastard.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.240
 - Yeah. - Is that the idea?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.080
 - Yeah, exactly, and it was, you know,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.000
 there wasn't a big laugh here,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.800
 but back in the day, that was huge satire.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.360
 (laughing)

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.720
 I would have had people on the floor.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.040
 So yeah, and so there was other postcards

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.400
 thought to be the oldest, and then this came up

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.080
 in an auction, and it sold for including commission

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.640
 and VAT, 31,000 pounds, 750.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.000
 - Wow. - So it's, yeah,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.240
 a really expensive item, and I think partially as well

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.640
 because Theodore Hook was quite an amazing prankster

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.960
 of the 1800s.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.760
 He achieved what is known as the Burner Street hoax,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.680
 which was one of the greatest hoaxes that London ever had.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.480
 It was a hoax where he said to his friend,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.880
 "I bet you I can make one single house,

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.960
 "the most famous house in London,"

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.080
 and they bet some money on it, and he said, "Go for it,"

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.240
 and he managed to do it.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.720
 So what he did was he sent out thousands of letters

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.960
 to people, workmen, all over the country,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.240
 and said, "Can you arrive on the morning of this day,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.240
 "August 27th, in order to do something to the house?"

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.800
 So this one woman opened up her door

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.720
 on the morning of August 27th to a chimney sweep,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.520
 and she said, "I didn't order a chimney sweep,"

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.800
 when she turned in away.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.520
 Then another chimney sweep came, and she turned him away.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.760
 10 more chimney sweeps came, turned away.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.920
 Then carts carrying large deliveries of cold came,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.800
 turned them away.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.840
 Then cake makers delivering large wedding cakes.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.880
 Then doctors and lawyers came.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.240
 There were vickers, there were fishmongers.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.760
 It was just getting bigger and bigger,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.240
 and eventually the Duke of York came along.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.520
 There was the Governor of the Bank of England,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.920
 the Archbishop of Canterbury came along.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.320
 - No! - Yes!

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.440
 And you know, this is, there's a lot of like,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.840
 what's real and not real in this story

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.680
 through the passage of time.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.360
 Imagine opening your door and seeing

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.080
 the Duke of York outside.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.360
 I think we can all agree.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.400
 (audience laughing)

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.560
 - That is, this was 1889.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.920
 - Maybe he was just delivering some pizza expressed.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.240
 (audience laughing)

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.880
 - This just sounds like when you're at home

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.800
 in the middle of a Wednesday,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.320
 and all of your neighbours are out,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.440
 and then your host one knocks on the door,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.040
 and he goes, "Can you take number 10s?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.160
 "Can you take number 12s?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.920
 "Can you, you know, 79 packages?"

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.760
 - No, he was a crazy guy.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.440
 - And the thing was that he just,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.400
 they randomly chose that house, didn't they?

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.360
 It was literally, they just went through a phone book

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.280
 if there was one in the day,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.240
 or whatever the equivalent was,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.680
 and went, "Oh, let's just choose that house."

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.920
 So she had nothing to do with it, and--

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.760
 - Oh, she had no idea.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.520
 Yeah, she was absolutely befuddled.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.200
 And so this was 1809.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.840
 So this was a number of years before the postcard was sent.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.320
 And so by this time, when the postcard went out,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.800
 and it saw that it had Theodore Hook's name on it,

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.640
 it was assumed he must have been sending it to himself

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.480
 as part of a prank.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.680
 We don't actually know that he sent it to himself.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.720
 That's the assumption.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.600
 - But it is correct, 'cause it will be weird

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.920
 to receive the first ever postcard,

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.760
 'cause you wouldn't know what it was, really.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.080
 It would be a baffling thing to experience.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.920
 - You're right, yeah.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.920
 - But you'd figure it out.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.760
 It's not like--

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.840
 - No, this is 1840.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.760
 You'd go insane.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.600
 - But wait a minute.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.880
 - He likes your wits permanently.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880
 - I know what you're saying,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.080
 but this is just the one-off he sent it to himself.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.440
 So someone else must have been the first person

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.080
 to get a postcard, right?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.960
 - They all ended up in as islands back in the day.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.600
 They were populated by postcard recipients.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.480
 - History of the postcard is amazing,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.520
 because they were invented in the late 19th century,

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.480
 and they sort of, you know,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.200
 there were various stages of innovation.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.840
 The biggest innovation came in the divided back period.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.840
 Sorry, it was known as the divided back period,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.120
 which is where, finally, for the first time ever,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.560
 you get a picture on one side,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.680
 and then the back of the card is divided

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.920
 into address and message, right?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.800
 Before that, one whole side had to be

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.920
 for the address and the stamp, it was serious,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.680
 and then the message had to go on the other side

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.280
 next to the picture, nightmare.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.720
 Once you got nice picture postcards,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.200
 it took off like nothing had ever done before.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.040
 It was incredible.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.800
 In 2010, in the UK, 800 million postcards were sent.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.360
 And the population's all lower than it is now.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.760
 That is a lot of people postcards per person being sent.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.320
 - I think it was 25 postcards per person per year,

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.160
 around about that time.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.560
 - I think a lot of people were doing

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.800
 a lot of postcarding as well.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.440
 It wasn't everyone was doing that, was it?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.240
 It was like some people were sending three a day,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.600
 four a day, stuff like that.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.280
 - It makes sense, right?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.320
 - You had like four or five posts every day, didn't you?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.480
 So you could send, I could send you a postcard,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.680
 and you're saying, "What the fuck are you doing in my soup?"

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.840
 And then the same day, you could send one back.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.400
 Like saying, "I'm just having a nice time, thank you."

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.240
 Or whatever.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.320
 - I'm here for my health.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.680
 - So it was, we know the exact date.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.920
 March 1st, 1907, was the official birth of the modern postcard

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.280
 when they put that singular line down the middle

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.560
 that separated message from it anywhere in time.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.400
 - Yeah.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.240
 - I would go there.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.280
 - The reason that they did that, of course,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.600
 is because what they thought was if you put the message

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.880
 and the address on the same side, then in the post office,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.760
 they would just get distracted by reading all of the messages.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.600
 - Yeah, right.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.040
 - Or there might be some sexy messages in there

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.200
 and they'd get embarrassed.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.840
 - Yeah, they were a bit scandalous.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.680
 People objected to postcards back in the day

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.800
 because of this idea that the postman or woman

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.200
 could read all of your dirty secrets.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.880
 And in fact, aside from that,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.200
 there was lots of other controversies.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.160
 So they were thought of as killing the art of writing

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.520
 because, you know, they're short form.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.080
 They were basically the text messages of their day.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.800
 There was an article written in 1884,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.040
 so quite soon after postcards had taken off,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.320
 saying, "Who nowadays writes letters?

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.000
 "We all dash off hasty notes or horribly scribbler postcard.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 "The epistolary art so dear to our grandmothers

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.800
 "is becoming extinct."

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.760
 And that's 150 years ago, they were whinging about that

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.760
 and they haven't shut up.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.960
 - Well, yeah, it was true.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.800
 - Winky face.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.040
 - You know, you could get postcards made of moss

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.880
 back in the day.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.960
 - Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.600
 - Sorry, just a little moss fact here.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.200
 Someone made of wood, but Birchbark,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.840
 Canada had leather ones,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.120
 and Ireland had cards made of peat moss.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.880
 - Wow. - How do you write on that?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.280
 - They processed the peat moss in some way

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.760
 to make it that you could write on it.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.600
 - That makes sense. - How?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.800
 I don't know, but nonetheless.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.520
 - They banned those in America, I think.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.600
 I'm not sure about the moss ones,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.560
 but definitely the wood ones they banned in America.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.080
 You could only send paper or cardboard ones.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.840
 That's 'cause they jammed the post machines.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.000
 So they had leather ones, they had wood ones,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.840
 like you said.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.120
 And the thing is about the wood ones,

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.520
 they tended to have really terrible jokes on them.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.960
 So like, you might go to an exposition about wood

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.360
 or something and get a wooden postcard,

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.160
 and it would say, "The exposition is more than oak A."

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.360
 - Right.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.360
 - "It's ash tonishing.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.000
 (audience laughs)

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.400
 "I would spruce up and come.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.640
 "You will not regret it."

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.720
 - Is that you will not regret it?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.560
 - You know what it wasn't, they missed that one.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.600
 - Lazy, a trick missed.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.080
 (audience laughs)

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.400
 - Well, that's what you get for going to a wood symposium,

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.240
 I'm gonna say.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.400
 (audience laughs)

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.480
 - We do need to talk about the saucy seaside postcard.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.480
 I'm sorry, we have to.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.320
 - What is it?

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.240
 - The saucy seaside postcard is a great institution

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.200
 of the 20th century, which is just a slightly rude postcard

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.880
 with a slightly funny or saucy, saucy, I don't think, yeah.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.720
 - You'd recognise them.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.080
 They're always like, box and women bursting out

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.720
 of red swimming costumes, a very '50s style

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.920
 with a raunchy, rude comment underneath.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.760
 - Okay, cool.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.680
 - Thank you, yeah, exactly.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.840
 So kind of-- - Saucy.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.560
 - Saucy, I've never said the word saucy

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.920
 so many times in my life, but I love it.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.640
 And basically, one artist in particular,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.600
 Donald McGill, was one of the great artists of this.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.640
 He did about nine a week until he died, it was incredible.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.200
 But there was trouble because there were seaside censorship

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.720
 boards which assessed the sauciness of the postcards

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.560
 and banned them if they were too rude.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.600
 So there was a blackpool board that you had to submit

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.440
 all your postcards to before they could go on sale.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.880
 There was another on the Isle of Wight.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.280
 And the members were things like there was a solicitor,

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.120
 a vicar, a bank manager, and Mrs. Gloria Swanson

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.600
 of the Blackpool Hotel and Boarding House Association.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.800
 And they would sit in judgment over the postcards.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.520
 And if you had one, for example,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.360
 there's one of a girl talking to a bookie at a race course

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.080
 and she's saying, I want to back the favourite, please.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.480
 My sweetheart gave me a pound to do it both ways, okay?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.920
 That's, I think that's a good joke.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.360
 But Mrs. Gloria Swanson, absolutely not, banned.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.360
 And these kept going until the Isle of Man Committee

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.760
 lasted until 1989. Wow.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.840
 1989. But then he got cancelled, basically, didn't he?

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.040
 Yeah, he did. In the '50s, really, wasn't it?

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.080
 When they properly just clamped down,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.440
 he was found guilty of breaking the Obscene Publications Act

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.720
 and, you know, fined and...

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.680
 Incredible.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.120
 Reputation destroyed, very sad.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.400
 And then went bankrupt.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.400
 And also the other weird thing that we should mention about him

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.120
 is that he only had one foot.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.000
 OK. And he lost his foot, his other foot, in a rugby accident.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.800
 Ah! Which I didn't know was even possible.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800
 But, yeah.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.920
 Just on the sort of censorship thing,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.880
 that was a thing not just for postcards.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.280
 I'm sure I must have mentioned it on the podcast a long time ago,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.240
 but the lead singer of Pet Shop Boys, Neil Tennant,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.920
 I think his name is, he used to work for Marvel

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.200
 and his job was whenever comic books came in,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.760
 he would have to cover up the cleavage line

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.720
 on women that were acceptable in America,

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.080
 but not here. I mean, that was, you know, in the '70s and '80s.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.280
 Yeah. It was good work, if you could get it.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.800
 He wouldn't say no to that job, it was a 15-year-old intern.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.440
 He'd be loving that.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.520
 You know, the other amazing thing about postcards

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.320
 is that back in the day, it was the source of, sometimes,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:59.520
 allowing you to see an image that you would otherwise have never seen.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.440
 So newspapers, back in the day, let's say in American newspapers,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.240
 largely completely text-based.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.600
 So if it said something like, "An accident, train crashes,"

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.680
 or something where you might rubber-neck it, you know,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.360
 it's like, "I'm curious to see a disaster,"

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.680
 a photo would be taken and it would be printed onto these postcards

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.600
 and people would send each other these postcards

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.920
 just to show them a news event as opposed to having anything to say.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.720
 So it became a huge source of being able to just-- source--

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.600
 being able to see everything that was happening in the world

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.560
 prior to newspapers allowing us to do that.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.280
 It was basically Twitter, wasn't it?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.280
 Or text message, that kind of thing WhatsApp, that kind of thing.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.000
 It was just like people sharing information.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.800
 It was quite weird, though, when people used to send postcards

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.640
 of burning buildings and screaming car crash victims

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.960
 and then they wrote on the back, "Wish you were here."

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.400
 It was an odd time.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.920
 But there was, like, political stuff as well, wasn't there?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.800
 Like, the suffrage movement, there was a big battle of postcards of that.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.760
 So there were a lot of anti-suffrage postcards

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.560
 where they would, like, mock the suffragettes and say, you know,

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.600
 "If you're a suffragette, you'll never get married," all that kind of thing.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.920
 And then there were pro-suffragette postcards

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.320
 where you would have, like, really iconic women on them

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.680
 and try and push people in that direction.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.200
 And often both types were made by the same company.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.200
 -Right. -Ah, Claire.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.240
 -No ways. -We're gonna have to move on.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.640
 -Say it, guys. -I don't think the suffragettes

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.920
 would have approved of that, Joe, Captain.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.960
 Not sure I've approved of it.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.520
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.160
 My fact is that the first man to kill people by guillotine

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.880
 was briefly so fashionable that French people would dress up as him.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.880
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.720
 It's called Charles-Henry Sanson,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.760
 and he was the chief executioner to Louis XVI,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.200
 and then he was the executioner of Louis XVI

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.120
 in a very weird job switcheroo.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.120
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.520
 It was like, "Undercover boss," it's like.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.840
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.360
 Well, that went wrong.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.560
 (LAUGHTER)

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.400
 Yeah, and the French Revolution, obviously,

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.000
 that was a time of great social change, to put it mildly.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.360
 And he was very famous during the period known as "The Terror,"

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.760
 and he had this uniform, it was stripy trousers,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.840
 a tricorne hat, green coat, quite dashing,

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.960
 and he was just so fashionable in Paris at the time

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.840
 that he became someone people dressed up as him.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.400
 And fashionable because of his awesome stripy trousers

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.520
 and tricorne hat, or because of what he was doing.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.240
 I think 'cause the guillotine was a thing.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.440
 I actually am. I'm not so sure, actually,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.000
 because he was really, really fashionable, like you say.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.080
 He wore blue trousers to set off with,

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.800
 but they were so worried about him being so fashionable

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.280
 that they banned him from wearing blue trousers.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.160
 And from then on, he was only allowed to wear green trousers.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.440
 And they said, "The blue is the colour of the nobility,

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.800
 "you're not allowed to wear them."

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.400
 Right. Yeah.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.200
 You'd think if the French Revolutionary Committee

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.600
 were telling you off for dressing as the nobility.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.640
 Pre-pre-revolutionary, you're kidding me.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.320
 Oh, OK, that's fair enough. Right, let's see.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.360
 But it seems like... It was not fair enough, it's bad.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.960
 I don't approve of the Louis XVI, all the French Revolution.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.640
 We know what side you're on now.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.600
 No, it's fine. Come on.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.880
 But the early days of it,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.560
 there did seem to be a bit of colour coordination going on,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.920
 and the colour being red.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.680
 So the account that I read was you had the person

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.560
 who was about to be killed had a red T-shirt on.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.680
 T-shirt. Yeah. Cool.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.680
 They had some converse, didn't they?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.120
 It's like fashion.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.720
 Is it in Star Trek where all the red people die, or am I...?

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.160
 Ah, yes, I'm so far out of my comfort zone here.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.400
 Yeah, so he had a red T-shirt on.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.160
 He had Nike cap.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.720
 Can we just give it some time-appropriate names?

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.400
 So what did they wear back then?

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.240
 Just no T, I think.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.520
 Ah. OK, so...

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.480
 Wow, that's very panicky to pick that up.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.360
 The T-shirt was invented in the 20th century.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.520
 It's a very anachronistic thing to hear T-shirts in the French Revolution.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.960
 People are going to think that happens in Australia.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.680
 Or did I just bust a time-traveler?

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.840
 OK, that's...

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.320
 What colour were his jeans?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.520
 LAUGHTER

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.440
 So he had a red shirt on, and the...

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.320
 And Charles... Is that his name? Charles?

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.320
 He had a cape on, which was red, and the guillotine itself was red.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.800
 So red was very much the dominant theme.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 Well, I guess it doesn't show the stains.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.640
 Was the guillotine definitely red pre-execution?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.080
 It wasn't just...

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.520
 I think this was for the very first, yeah, execution.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.800
 I guess maybe they were just trying to hide the gore.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.280
 And unfortunately, when they did it, it was because this was new,

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.320
 and they had huge crowds that came to see it,

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.480
 because everyone was so fascinated by all of these public deaths,

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.400
 the crowds were really disappointed,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.000
 because it was really efficient and quick and over like that.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.480
 And they were like, "Ah, we brought sandwiches."

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.360
 We were going to be here a while, and it was just like,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.160
 "Ah, it was too efficient, you've got two stars."

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.360
 People rioted. Three people died in the riots

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.360
 about how efficient the new guillotine was.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360
 Really? Yeah.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.800
 The worst thing about that one,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.240
 so that guy who was killed in the first guillotine,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.400
 he was called Pelletier,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.840
 they decided, OK, we're going to stop hanging people,

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.280
 because we think everyone should be killed exactly the same way,

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.320
 because, you know, where the French Revolution,

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.720
 it shouldn't be that the nobility get a good way of dying

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.040
 and the other people don't.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.200
 Everyone's going to be killed with a sword, with an axe.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.640
 And then this guy, Sanson, decided,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.560
 "Well, actually, my axe isn't good enough for that.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.960
 "I won't be able to get through enough people,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.760
 "so we need a new way of doing it."

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.280
 And so they came up with this idea of the guillotine,

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.200
 but this guy had already been found guilty

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.040
 and was already sentenced to death,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.400
 and he had to sit there and watch it be built,

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.600
 because he couldn't be executed until it was built.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.240
 Did he have to go through the kind of, like,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.600
 brainstorming meetings with them, saying, "What about this?"

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.400
 I feel like you'd, like, steal a screw or something, wouldn't you?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.600
 Yeah.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.720
 But Sanson, the executioner, he was part of this extraordinary

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.840
 dynasty of executioners.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.520
 So six generations of his family performed this role.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.040
 Great-grandfather, grandfather, father, all six of his brothers.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.520
 All six of his brothers were also executioners

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.840
 in different bits of France.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.600
 Wow. Yeah.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.760
 Mad. It's really bizarre.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.760
 And they called them just by the name of the town

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.960
 they were the executioner,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.760
 so they didn't even call them by their first name.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.880
 They would call them Reem or Leon or Atom.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.880
 Yeah. It's just, it's bizarre.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.600
 And when you read it about his life,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.400
 he mostly had a series of protracted workplace disputes

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.320
 with his bosses, who were either the royalty

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.640
 or the revolutionary committee.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.160
 So he was saying, "Look, I'm broke.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.280
 "I've got, there are so many people to be executed.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.000
 "My working conditions are bad.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.400
 "I need a budget increase."

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.960
 He was asking for a budget increase from the Minister of Justice,

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.920
 which was days after he had executed

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.000
 the previous Minister of Justice.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.600
 LAUGHTER

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.200
 I think that's when you've got leverage in any time.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.440
 Absolutely.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.960
 Yeah, he just had all of these disputes

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.560
 with, like, running, irritating disputes.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.480
 He once sued someone for libel

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.320
 for saying that he was boorish or brutish.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.840
 Wow. He was an executioner.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.000
 There's also a weird thing, which is,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.440
 I don't know if this is the original moment

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.960
 where this idea came about,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.240
 but there's a lot of question about at what point,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.160
 once the head is removed from the body,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.320
 does the person actually pass away?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.600
 And there were all these experiments of, like,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.400
 trying to get people to blink posts,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.400
 you know, to talking to the dismembered head.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.640
 There was a theory, I think, like, I remember reading

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.640
 when I was a kid, even, that they stay alive

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.440
 for, like, seven or eight seconds or something.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.960
 Yeah, so there was this thing with Charles Henri,

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.240
 which is when he had executed a woman

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.680
 who was called Charlotte Corday.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.680
 Someone, a carpenter, jumped up and grabbed her head,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.800
 and he picked it up, and he slapped her on the face.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.400
 So, a horrible thing to do, a poster beheading.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.280
 You don't mind, I don't think, at that stage.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.760
 Well, this is the thing. Apparently, she did.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.560
 Because, apparently, witnesses reported an expression

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.000
 of unequivocal indignation on her face

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.520
 after she was slapped, and everyone thought,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.880
 "Oh, maybe you actually last a bit longer."

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.200
 You last long enough to be annoyed by something.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.640
 (LAUGHTER)

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.640
 But, yeah, for a while afterwards, there were a lot of studies

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.880
 into if that's the case, because of Charlotte's anger.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.680
 Original guillotine invented in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.320
 Yeah. So, good.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.000
 Well done.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.960
 Are we saying that that's good?

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.320
 Because, I would say, because it's in Yorkshire, it's bad.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.000
 Debate. Debate.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.080
 Oh. Off with his head. Oh, no.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.400
 It was solely to chop off the heads of people from Lancashire,

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.840
 wasn't it?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.840
 It was called the Halifax Chibbit, but it was a mechanism

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.440
 for doing the same kind of thing.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.160
 And Daniel Defoe wrote about it, and he said there was this rule,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.080
 right, that if you could pull your head...

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.920
 So, there was a pin that got pulled, and that dropped the chopper.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.160
 But if the order was given to pull the pin,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.320
 and you managed to pull your head out of the block in time,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.520
 you were then free to run, as far as you could.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.920
 The executioner was entitled to chase you under the rules of this system.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.920
 Wow. But if you got across the river,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.680
 you were home, not home dry, home very wet, but you weren't free.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.440
 You were not going to be executed anymore.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.520
 And so that apparently was a rule they had in place.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.040
 It seems like a bad rule.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040
 You could spot people who've done it because they'd always have

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.000
 a bald patch on the top of their head, wouldn't they?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.240
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.320
 My fact this week is that in Sicily, the pistachios are guarded

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.840
 by the military police.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.640
 Not a very stressful occupation, I would guess.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.600
 Well, they're a very dangerous industry, turns out, sort of.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.480
 They are very valuable pistachios in Sicily.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.000
 They're called green gold there.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.920
 They're different to all pistachios in the rest of the world.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.080
 They're farmed in a place called Bronte.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:47.880
 And their thought was much better and richer and deeper flavour

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.240
 than any other pistachios.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.640
 They only constitute about 1% of the world's supply.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.800
 Less, but they're the best.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.520
 And so people keep stealing them.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.760
 And loads of pistachio farmers were complaining,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.720
 saying literally people are rocking out with guns and, you know,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.360
 holdings at gunpoint and stealing all our pistachios.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.680
 There was one person who said they'd had a story of someone

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.120
 like rappelling down from the air and scooping pistachios off trees.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.200
 From like a helicopter.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.000
 It had to be, yeah, like a big blimp above or something.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.360
 I think from the helicopter.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.840
 And I don't know if, like, you've had to pay for the helicopter.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.400
 You're going to have to pick a lot of pistachios from your outskirts.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.680
 I find it incredible that there is a version of pistachios

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.920
 which apparently is even nicer than pistachios,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.920
 one of the nicest things in the world.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.760
 Like, it's, I can't imagine how good,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.400
 because I'm sure I've never had one of these Bronte pistachios.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.880
 Yeah.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.880
 I'm sure that I'm one of the 99% in the pistachio world.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.400
 I think that's the 1%.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.400
 And that's why we rioted all those years ago,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.800
 as the people who tasted those pistachios.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.680
 How good must they be?

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.560
 They must be incredible.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.640
 I actually don't, I don't think pistachios are that great,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.760
 so I'm not as excited as you,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.200
 but I still wouldn't mind tasting them.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.680
 Wow.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.880
 But they're worth a lot, aren't they?

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.800
 Like, one single bag could be worth up to 33,000 American dollars,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.600
 and that is big.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.480
 What bag?

00:33:59.480 --> 00:33:59.960
 Yeah.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.920
 Not a supermarket bag.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.080
 Start like 100 grams.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.760
 Like a Santa sac kind of cake.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.400
 Right, okay, yeah.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.640
 I don't normally buy them in Santa sac, but yeah.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.200
 Okay, a big old bag, yeah.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.000
 That's a lot.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.960
 How much did you sell?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.000
 33,000 American dollars, I believe.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.560
 That's incredible.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:15.720
 Yeah.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.280
 Yeah.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.440
 There's Bronte, so this place.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.760
 Admiral Nelson, Lord Nelson, was the Duke of Bronte.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.080
 Yes.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.040
 And he was granted the title by the King of Naples and Sicily,

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.720
 because he helped to put down a revolution

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.800
 against the King, Ferdinand I.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.360
 So he never visited, but he was the Duke of Bronte.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.240
 He was very proud of that.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.480
 He always signed his name, once he was given that,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.760
 Nelson and Bronte, which is all just Bronte.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.200
 And Bronte, did you say?

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.160
 Not and Bronte, but there's a connection.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:43.560
 Is there?

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.640
 Because 10 years after Nelson died,

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.200
 there was a clergyman called Patrick Bronte,

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.200
 who thought, "I want to posh out my name a bit,"

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.400
 and he changed his name to Bronte,

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.160
 and then fathered the Bronte girls.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:53.640
 Yeah.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.600
 Did he get it from the pistachio place, then, though?

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.720
 Via Nelson, yeah.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.440
 Oh, really?

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.040
 He wanted to make his name posh and cool.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.000
 That's amazing.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.840
 Did not know that.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.040
 If it weren't for the pistachios,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.960
 we wouldn't have Wuthering Heights.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.840
 Yeah.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.240
 Yeah.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.040
 Yes.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.520
 Yeah.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.000
 Very good.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.400
 That's what it looks like.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.920
 And if we didn't have Manchester,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.120
 we wouldn't have Jane Eyre,

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.400
 because that's where Charlotte Bronte started writing Jane Eyre

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.200
 in Manchester.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.840
 So thank you all here.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.320
 I thought I'd win more of you over with that one.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.720
 But that's cool.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.800
 We're all from Yorkshire in this room in times like that.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:31.480
 Actually, pistachio theft is a problem all over the world

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.480
 where they make pistachios, anyway.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.000
 So in America, they have a nut theft task force,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.400
 which stops nut theft in the California area.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.640
 In Turkey, apparently, they have nut vigilantes

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.600
 who try to stop people from stealing their pistachios.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.320
 And in Turkey, they don't repel from blimps

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.840
 or anything or from helicopters.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.160
 You just ram a tree with your car

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.920
 and knock all of the pistachios out

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.080
 and then just gather them all up and shove them in your car.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.720
 Oh, clever.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.080
 That's really clever.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.640
 Yeah.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.320
 And in Sicily, it's the carabinieri police force

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.840
 who guard them.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.160
 And they do helicopter patrols as well.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.800
 Do they ever have to fire shells at the thieves?

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.440
 But I find the carabinieri so weird that,

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.400
 so, you know, if you go to Italy, there are two police forces

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.920
 and they just accept this.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.280
 So there's like the normal police.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.720
 Oh, we've got about 40, haven't we?

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.160
 Okay, sure.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.320
 Sorry, there are two types of police.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.400
 So if you want to call, if you've got an emergency,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.920
 you can either call the polizia

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.760
 or you can call the carabinieri.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.040
 And I can't really work.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.000
 And one's 112 and one's 113, I think.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.200
 And this journalist was asking Italian, the Sicilians,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.800
 and they didn't really know which was which.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.160
 They were like, "You just pick one."

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.320
 It's just, and it's just a hangover.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.480
 It's from pre-unification even.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.800
 And the carabinieri were like the royal guards.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.800
 And now they're just a hangover.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.480
 But they've got these really weird rules.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.200
 So they didn't used to be allowed to have facial hair

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.400
 for quite a long time, I think.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.600
 And now you can have quite strict facial hair.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.080
 They had to ask permission to marry

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.840
 if you're in the military police force.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.760
 And then once you ask permission to marry from your boss,

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.600
 then they do a full-on background check

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.320
 of your potential spouse to make sure they're appropriate.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.280
 Okay, I think that's the best one to ring, isn't it?

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.680
 If they're that strict, no?

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.040
 Yeah, you don't have to ask.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.560
 I want you to send a police officer,

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.560
 but can you tell me about your spouse a bit first?

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.480
 Yeah, that's very good.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.840
 I don't think people are calling them the day

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.360
 before their wedding, just to say,

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.560
 "I think you're really good at it,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.160
 and I've got some doubts, actually."

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.920
 So... Wow.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.160
 Yeah, pistachio theft is a big, a huge deal.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.640
 So this year in June, I think this was in California,

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.720
 there was a guy, a trucker who was arrested

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.120
 for allegedly stealing £42,000 of pistachios.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.520
 Wait, nice. Like, one and a half bags.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:53.240
 Yeah, and it's a problem because you turn up dressed

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.680
 as a truck driver, looking like a truck driver.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.960
 Dressed as a truck driver.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.640
 What if you haven't bought that Halloween costume yet?

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.760
 You sort of look plausibly like...

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.720
 Wearing a t-shirt, for instance.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.760
 Wearing a t-shirt, yeah.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:09.400
 And so now drivers have to have thumb prints, photo ID,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.360
 the whole deal.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.560
 And some people have hacked into

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.400
 trucking companies' computer systems

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.440
 to place fake orders for pistachios,

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.040
 and then someone turns upon the day and says,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.960
 "I'm here for the pistachios that have been ordered."

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.360
 Right.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.280
 And then drive off with all the nuts.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.360
 And that's a perfect crime.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.720
 And the idea is basically that there's no kind of

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.080
 barcodes on these things, right?

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.280
 There's just tons of nuts,

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.520
 and people eat the pistachios,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.920
 and so that's kind of destroying all the evidence.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.720
 It's the perfect crime.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.880
 It's the perfect crime, because you get to eat pistachio nuts

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.320
 throughout. It's... Yeah.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.320
 Just back to Bronte for a second.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.400
 Not the sisters, the area with the pistachios.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.640
 There's an amazing thing when you're looking at photos of it

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.760
 that you suddenly notice this giant mountain

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.160
 that is sitting in the background of the pistachio area,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.280
 and it's Mount Etna.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.600
 And Mount Etna is given a lot of credit

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.600
 for the reason that the pistachios are so good,

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.240
 because basically the trees are growing out

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.280
 of the kind of volcanic slabs that have been laid down

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.480
 over the passage of time.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.160
 Which is genuinely really good for soil.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.840
 Like lava has all these minerals in it,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.680
 which over time make it much more fertile.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.480
 So it's true.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.280
 Yeah, but it's still an active volcano,

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.040
 and up until very recently,

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.080
 I think it was in...

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.440
 It was either this year or last year,

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.800
 it had these huge explosions, lava explosions.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.800
 It grew in height by 100 feet.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.920
 What?

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.520
 Yeah, because of all of...

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.000
 It was literally like when you put a Mentos in a Diet Coke.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.760
 It was shooting a column.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.360
 You know what a volcano is?

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.840
 Right.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.440
 Hang on, James.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.160
 I need to hear a bit more about this Mentos Coke situation

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.280
 before I can visualize it.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.160
 Sorry, do you mean it grew 100 feet just temporarily

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.040
 while it was shooting it out?

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.520
 No, no, that column, like a Mentos in a Diet Coke,

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.000
 shoots like meters upright, and this is what this did.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.920
 This was like hundreds of meters into the air,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.280
 this column of stuff.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.840
 So it grew in all the ash kind of sat on top of lava

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.200
 and dried up, and it grew.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.120
 But it does an amazing thing, Mount Etna,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.440
 which I didn't realize volcanoes do.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.600
 It blows smoke rings occasionally,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.040
 like a really skilled smoker doing those...

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.600
 You can see these beautiful plumes of perfect rings

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.880
 coming out the top of Mount Etna.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.440
 That's great.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.240
 So it's not just the pistachios that are cool about the area.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.040
 I'm still not going until I can do that Gandalf ship.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.920
 Then I'll visit Sicily.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.840
 Okay, I've got an economics quiz for you all.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.560
 Oh, great.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.280
 Yay!

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.800
 Which is better value, shelled or unshelled pistachios?

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.960
 Well, I would say probably...

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.280
 It's more fun to open the shells,

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.840
 and it actually means you don't shove millions of them

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.320
 in your face, so you kind of eat a bit less.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.400
 But presumably the shells aren't worth as much,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.400
 so it would be better to get unshelled.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.760
 Okay, good theory.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.680
 I'm going to say shelled as well, purely because I think it's...

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.440
 Yeah, it's the pure form, right?

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.240
 And all sorts.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.400
 Pure form, yeah, I guess.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.680
 Okay, I'm going to say it's impossible to answer that,

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.800
 because you haven't told us what they cost, respectively.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.320
 I can't tell you what's better value,

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.680
 unless you tell me how much it is.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.720
 Sorry, I just want to allow you myself to that theory.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.280
 Well, okay, let's say shelled on pistachios.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.120
 With the shell, half the price per ounce, right?

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.040
 But you only get half as many,

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.280
 because half the space in the bag is shells in empty space.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.120
 So this is by a website called Wonkblog,

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.560
 which is very good, by the way,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.320
 on these sort of nut-related questions.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:40.600
 The problem is, the price is roughly equivalent per weight,

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.360
 but it's labor.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.560
 It's how much work you're doing

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.480
 to take the shells off the pistachios.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.240
 And so it depends what you earn.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.880
 So if you're on, you know, 10 pounds an hour,

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.160
 the cost of shell on pistachios is about four pounds in labor

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.120
 to remove the shells,

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.640
 if you're doing it for a certain time.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.040
 But if you earn, you know, 40 quid an hour,

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.080
 that's way more per bag of shell pistachios,

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.280
 because you are having to do the work.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.840
 So there's that thing about, is it Cristiano Ronaldo?

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.400
 It's not, if he drops a tenner on the floor,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.840
 it's not worth him picking it up,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.360
 because it would take him longer

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.960
 than he's earned that amount of money.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.520
 Exactly.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.360
 Also, someone else might kick the ball away from you

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.800
 in the time that you went down to...

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.400
 It's not a good strategy on the pitch.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.720
 I mean, what's he doing on the pitch anyway,

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.080
 Cristiano Ronaldo these days?

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.960
 Ronaldo would be the worst person in the world

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.840
 to buy shell on pistachios,

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.320
 because it's just not worth his time taking the shell off.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.720
 It's a stupid thing that shell removal is labor,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.640
 and some people will call that a hobby.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.080
 So...

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.360
 And there's a place in America called Pistachio Land.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.360
 Sounds really cool.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.400
 According to their website,

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.960
 they offer a motorised farm tour around the orchards,

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.800
 a candy kitchen where they produce their own pistachio treats,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.240
 a geocache location,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.320
 and a poker stop for playing Pokemon Go.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.720
 There's the four things.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.840
 The website's really good.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.720
 It tells you why pistachios are so good for you.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.560
 Some maybe slightly dubious claims.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.160
 They say that they're cholesterol-free,

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.680
 which I think they are, so that's good.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.640
 They have antioxidants, so that's good for you,

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.240
 you know, very fashionable.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.280
 It also says that the colour green is associated

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.880
 with health, hope, renewal, and alleviates anxiety,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.880
 which feels like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it?

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.360
 It does, unless you're seeing it on the executioner's trousers

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.080
 heading towards you.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.320
 It will cool stress.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.960
 Did you know that pistachios are good for penises?

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.480
 In what sense?

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.240
 Well, they were originally called the penistachio, weren't they?

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.480
 Yeah, yeah, in what way, in what way?

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.640
 Okay, so there was a study where they gave a bunch of men

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.120
 100 grams of pistachio nuts as a diet,

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.760
 so you would eat them in one go for three weeks,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.880
 and they found that their penises got better.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.640
 Now, here's the interesting thing about this.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:51.960
 Yes.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.600
 I've not written down what that means, so...

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:03.720
 Presumably, the scientific paper didn't say the penises got better,

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.920
 so you've already...

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.040
 So, I've written that.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.880
 I've written "Good for your penis",

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.560
 and then I've kind of just not written anything else,

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.200
 so it's going to remain a bit of a mystery.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.480
 I have a lot of acronyms.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.720
 Apparently, your IIEF score is better,

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.080
 and your PCDU parameters are better as well.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.440
 But there are side effects in patients with ED,

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.640
 so watch out for that.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.200
 That's a retell dysfunction, I suppose, the last one.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.000
 Oh, yes.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.680
 So, it's "Good for your penis", "Good for your nuts"?

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.080
 No?

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.040
 Yeah.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.480
 So, you know, it's a mystery what that means,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.320
 but it's good news.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.120
 It's good news.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.480
 If you want a good penis...

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.120
 I don't know if it means morally.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.360
 I don't know if it means in action.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.120
 I don't know if it's like at quizzes.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.760
 I don't know what...

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.360
 Well-behaved penises.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.600
 Did you say "Good at quizzes"?

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.480
 "Good at quizzes".

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.400
 I remember when we took you to the pub

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.600
 and you were playing the quiz machine.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.520
 Never again.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.160
 Extraordinary.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.080
 They had to clean the buttons so much after this.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.840
 Anyway, look, we need to wrap up in a second.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.280
 Do we have anything else before we do?

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.000
 Well, they're dangerous, aren't they, pistachios?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.800
 They can explode.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.120
 And they can suffocate you.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:21.240
 But not like as a sort of mercy killing, that kind of thing.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.800
 They don't grab a cushion and they don't do that.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.400
 How can they do either of these things?

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.800
 Not under their own steam, either of these things, surely?

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.720
 Well, kind of, I suppose.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.320
 So, yeah, basically they're taking out oxygen from an area

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.760
 and releasing carbon dioxide.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.840
 So if you are in like a big truck full of pistachios

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.800
 and it's hermetically sealed and you're there long enough,

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.920
 then you'll suffocate.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.840
 So that's kind of them by themselves, isn't it?

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.040
 Definitely, I think so.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.080
 Yeah, and they have this kind of fat in there

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.080
 and they have this chemical reaction.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.440
 And that chemical reaction gives out heat.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.440
 And if it gives out enough heat, if they're enough there,

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.640
 they can explode.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.040
 Yeah.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.240
 So they're dangerous.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.080
 It's not, it would be an elaborate plot.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.160
 It would be an amazing sort of mystery.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.120
 You need a lot of them.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.680
 If you have them in your pocket, they're not going to explode.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.760
 Although you might end up with a bad penis if they do.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.800
 It's not just like saying that flower,

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.440
 is it like every time your wife receives some flowers,

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.200
 you say, you know, they can suffocate you

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.360
 if you're shot in a room with a million of them.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.880
 To be honest, the problem is the florist never

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.720
 have enough space on the little cart today.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.960
 I've got to do one more thing.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.840
 Yeah, go for it.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.160
 So this is, pistachios used to be red in America,

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.280
 which I didn't know, they were dyed

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.120
 because they were bought from Iran.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.880
 And then there was the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.880
 Big deal, there were trade embargoes.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.480
 So no more imports from Iran.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.360
 And America started its own pistachio industry.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.800
 And this was all in the time of President Jimmy Carter,

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.960
 who set up this pistachio embargo.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.680
 Very exciting.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.160
 But he, of course, is a peanut farmer.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.120
 If anyone remembers that.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.360
 Jimmy Carter is a peanut farmer and was and is.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.560
 And there is a statue of Jimmy Carter in Georgia,

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.120
 which is of a four meter tall peanut,

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.200
 but it has the teeth of Jimmy Carter.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.440
 It's the second tallest peanut statue in the world.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.840
 And second tallest.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.560
 Second tallest.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.680
 Yeah, it's not the best, but it's nearly there.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.920
 And this is my favorite detail about this.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.880
 It's just a tall peanut with Jimmy Carter's teeth.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.160
 It's really weird.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.520
 But it has a large hole in its rear end.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.960
 And that allegedly was cut by the Secret Service

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.880
 to ensure that there were no explosives or assassins inside it.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.560
 But why would you cut the hole to work out

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.640
 if there were no explosives or assassins inside it?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.880
 If there's no hole, there are probably no assassins inside.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.120
 The peanut's bum.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.520
 Also, if you were going to put a feature of Jimmy Carter

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.240
 on a peanut to make sure people knew it was him,

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.680
 is the teeth the...

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.200
 If you see it, you're like, oh, Jimmy Carter.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.080
 Jimmy Carter, where are we?

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.680
 Oh, hang on. No, it's a big peanut.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.840
 I don't know which body part you'd put.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.880
 I don't know any specific body part of Jimmy Carter very well.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.000
 I just know him as a whole.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.560
 The largest pistachio in the world is advertised

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.080
 as being a pistachio land in America.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:25.480
 But I found that there is a pistachio-shaped museum in Turkey

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.560
 which has a larger pistachio.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.560
 And so I wrote to pistachio land to tell them

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.520
 that their pistachio isn't the biggest pistachio in the world.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.080
 No reply.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.800
 Jesus Christ.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.040
 And I was so hoping to go on a trip there.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.240
 I'll never have this now.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.800
 Yeah, your face is just there with a cross.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.920
 So everywhere.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.880
 No, you out.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.280
 No, it's just a big knot with James' teeth.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.720
 Okay, listen, we need to wrap up.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.360
 That is it.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.480
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.920
