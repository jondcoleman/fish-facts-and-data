00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,260
 this week coming to you live from Manchester!

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,000
 (crowd cheering)

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,980
 (crowd cheering)

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:39,680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,360
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,600
 and James Harkin, and once again,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
 we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,320
 - Okay, my fact this week is that theories

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,720
 for the origin of life on earth include,

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,180
 primordial soup, primordial sandwich,

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,020
 primordial soup and sandwich,

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,000
 primordial pizza, and primordial mayonnaise.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,760
 (crowd cheering)

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,900
 - Is there a primordial salad option, please?

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,760
 (crowd laughing)

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,020
 - For a primordial vegan, yeah.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,480
 Now, so this is, I was reading about the origin of life,

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,600
 and I think a few people might know about primordial soup,

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,800
 that is the idea where you might get a puddle or something

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,720
 and there's loads of molecules in there,

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,800
 and somehow they self-arrange,

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
 and then those self-arranged molecules

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
 manage to replicate and they make life.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,800
 Now, there's a lot of problems with primordial soup,

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,700
 so people have come up with other theories,

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,920
 so how do these molecules get in the right place?

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,560
 Primordial sandwiches, you've got two rocks,

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,440
 and they kind of squish the molecules together.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,000
 Primordial soup and sandwich,

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 you've got the soup and you've got the rocks,

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,160
 and that's all kind of all together.

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
 Primordial pizza, you just have a rock

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,660
 and the molecules are on top.

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,960
 - Okay, nice.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
 - Primordial mayonnaise is like a load of fat bubbles

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,240
 and they're kind of the molecules grow in the fat bubbles.

43
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
 - Right.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
 - And for all light, no, none of them is true.

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
 - Yeah, because we all know God made us, so thank you.

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,320
 - You're welcome.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,440
 - Is this one person just kind of just tossing all this shit out?

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
 - Yes, it's me.

49
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,040
 Lots of scientists have talked about all these different things,

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,880
 but I'm the one who's kind of put them together

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,840
 in a jovial little sentence.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
 - A menu, a nice menu.

53
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,200
 - Have they called them those things?

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're real names.

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
 - Right, okay.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
 - Yeah, yeah, they're real names.

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,160
 - I didn't think you had the imagination

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,920
 to come up with primordial pizza.

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,480
 - Okay.

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,160
 - Is there one that's most likely, you know,

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,480
 what are we getting?

62
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
 - I think at the moment, yeah,

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,440
 kind of the soup and sandwich is quite liked by people,

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,280
 and--

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,200
 - So it's not soup and sandwich per se,

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,760
 it's a soup sandwich.

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
 - It is a bit, isn't it?

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,960
 - That doesn't sound quite as appetizing as soup sandwich.

69
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
 - No, very sorry.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,320
 - So it sounds like it's a sandwich floating on some soup.

71
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,080
 - Primordial crouton, if you will.

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,320
 - Yes, very nice.

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,880
 - I thought it was a soup in between two bits of bread.

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,160
 - That's what it is, unfortunately.

75
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,600
 - Oh, what? - A soup sandwich.

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,240
 - Oh, that is, that's fucking out there for a theory.

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,880
 - So the idea of primordial soup,

78
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
 which was the first one of these theories,

79
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
 it was thought of, first of all,

80
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,920
 by two people actually independently,

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,040
 a British guy called JBS Haldane,

82
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,120
 and the Russian scientist called Alexander Operin.

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
 And the interesting thing about him,

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,760
 he came up with primordial soup,

85
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,680
 but then later in life, he edited a book

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,000
 that contains at least 113 different recipes

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
 for actual soup.

88
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,520
 (laughing)

89
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,960
 - It makes you suspicious about the primordial soup theory,

90
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,480
 'cause it sounds like he's just really into soup.

91
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,840
 - Yeah, he's just pushing his next career.

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
 It's such a weird switcheroo

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,680
 to go from proper organic chemistry stuff

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
 to editing a cookbook.

95
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,000
 - Yes, it would be weird,

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,880
 apart from it was in the Soviet Union,

97
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
 and all sorts of weird stuff was happening.

98
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
 Basically, they had this kind of propaganda cookbook

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
 that they would give to all,

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,880
 well, all married couples would get one, basically.

101
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,040
 You know, it was the right kind of Soviet food

102
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,480
 that you should be eating.

103
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,560
 And at the time, they'd just done Sputnik,

104
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,080
 and they were kind of pushing themselves

105
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,680
 as scientists in the Soviet Union,

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
 as best scientists in the world,

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,720
 and they thought, well, our cookbook

108
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,680
 should also be really scientific,

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
 so we're gonna get our best scientist

110
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,520
 who's this guy operating,

111
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,760
 and we're gonna say you're gonna edit it.

112
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
 - That makes sense. - That's interesting, yeah.

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
 - That's like that Michelin bloke who makes foam shit.

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
 He's been just, yeah, exactly, Blumenthal.

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,560
 - Hester Blumenthal, yeah.

116
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
 - Is it like him?

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,280
 - Yeah, he basically does chemistry, doesn't he?

118
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,120
 - It's like him.

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
 - It's like him.

120
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,200
 - Professor Stephen Hawkins did a cookbook.

121
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
 - Right. - Okay.

122
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,080
 - I thought you meant the actual Michelin man

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,640
 when you said that, and really threw me for a second.

124
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,360
 - Yeah, a lot of marshmallow-based stuff.

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,600
 That cookbook, by the way,

126
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,840
 it was called The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food,

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,240
 that was its name, and it was published in 1939,

128
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,160
 and as you said, changed.

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,760
 It's all kind of like 400 different recipes,

130
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,240
 all good Soviet fare,

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,760
 but unfortunately, 'cause it was the Soviet Union,

132
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,640
 the book kept on being perched,

133
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,960
 and so there were all these

134
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,280
 like strongly radical changes in direction,

135
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
 so it used to be a very internationalist book,

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
 and then that went out of fashion,

137
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,640
 and so they just cut all the international stuff.

138
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,440
 - It's borscht, every page borscht.

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,000
 - It was kind of, yeah.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
 - Yeah, and then there were lots of quotes

141
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,280
 from Stalin all the way through the book,

142
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
 and then Stalin died in 1953.

143
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,480
 Cut, all Stalin quotes gone through the book, really.

144
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,320
 - Yeah, I must say, I know that there's at least

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,280
 113 different recipes for soup,

146
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,320
 because I read through the book,

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,840
 and just searched for the word soup, or borscht,

148
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,160
 or we all know whatever, and that's as many as I found.

149
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,840
 There might be more for all I know, but yeah.

150
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
 - Wow.

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,760
 - And yeah, this was a really important book,

152
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,640
 like you say, it was the book of tasty and healthy food,

153
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,560
 but sometimes just known as Kniga, just the book.

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,200
 That's how famous it was, this book,

155
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
 it just called the book,

156
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
 and everyone knew what you were talking about.

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
 - Oh, that's awesome.

158
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,720
 - Oh, wow.

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
 - Hey, does that old thing,

160
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
 it's a sort of a thing that Einstein said,

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
 which was, he said that his second best idea

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,680
 that he ever had was to boil his eggs in soup,

163
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,280
 because then you're saving up on some washing up,

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
 you're using one less thing.

165
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,000
 - And you know, that's a thing that I think--

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
 - Is that good though?

167
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
 It feels like you get like an egg's come out

168
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,600
 of a chicken's bum, right?

169
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
 - Yeah.

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
 - Well, not technically, actually, interestingly.

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,200
 - Okay.

172
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,360
 - But close.

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
 I'll tell you later.

174
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,320
 - It's come out of the same place

175
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,080
 as the feces come, right?

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,920
 - That's a good point.

177
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,200
 - And so do you really want that in your soup?

178
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 - That's a very good point.

179
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,080
 - When you boil stuff, it gets rid of all the stuff in it.

180
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
 - Yeah, but you're not gonna do a shit in your hinds,

181
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
 are you?

182
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,120
 (audience laughing)

183
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,160
 - Good, that could take off as a saying though.

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
 - He's really shot the hinds today.

185
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
 (audience laughing)

186
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,640
 - Actually, there is a thing called yellow soup,

187
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,600
 which is basically-- - Yes, yellow soup.

188
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,240
 - Poin soup, which was a delicacy in China,

189
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
 back a long time ago.

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
 So I think it was in the fourth century,

191
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
 there was a Chinese recipe for yellow soup,

192
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,240
 very popular, it was put forward by a doctor,

193
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,640
 and he said, this guy called Guihong,

194
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,920
 gave this recipe for broth that involved drying

195
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,160
 and fermenting a healthy person's poo,

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,040
 and stirring it into a broth,

197
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
 and then you give it to a sick person,

198
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,920
 and it makes them better.

199
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
 And of course, the good thing about that is--

200
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
 - Oh, that could work.

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
 - It bloody works.

202
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,040
 - Yeah, really.

203
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,200
 - We've discovered now with fecal transplants these days.

204
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,280
 - I mean, sorry.

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
 Could we just row back on the whole "it works" thing?

206
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
 (audience laughing)

207
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,200
 This doesn't sound like that would have worked.

208
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,480
 - It probably didn't work.

209
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
 He had the right idea though,

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,360
 I think he was on the right track.

211
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,960
 Yeah, yellow soup, worth a try, I would say.

212
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,800
 - There are enough.

213
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,640
 - Don't boil it too much,

214
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,480
 otherwise you might lose the microorganisms

215
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
 for the transplant.

216
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
 - Yeah.

217
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,640
 - Well, you should have called it brown Windsor.

218
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
 (audience laughing)

219
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,520
 But that was already a soup.

220
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,360
 - Is it?

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
 - 1,500 years later.

222
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,040
 (audience laughing)

223
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
 Brown soup was a really weird soup.

224
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
 It was this sort of mythical soup.

225
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,080
 It wasn't mythical, it was real,

226
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
 but it wasn't in many places.

227
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,200
 It was just sort of a horrible, cheap soup

228
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,120
 that was in lots of restaurants

229
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,040
 around the turn of the 20th century.

230
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,560
 And it kind of had a posh name,

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,360
 so it sounded classy,

232
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,960
 but it was basically leftover meat,

233
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,600
 and the ingredients were--

234
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
 - Sorry, was it called brown soup?

235
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,280
 - Brown Windsor.

236
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,800
 - Brown Windsor, sorry, posh name.

237
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,280
 'Cause brown is not a posh thing,

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,680
 but once you put it next to Windsor.

239
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
 - Isn't that gruel?

240
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,320
 That sounds like gruel.

241
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,680
 It's not gruel, it's definitely soup.

242
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
 - Hmm.

243
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,360
 - Yeah.

244
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
 - What do you think it sounds like?

245
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
 - What a spectrum we're on now

246
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
 between gruel, soup, broths, stew, you know.

247
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,520
 Well, I had gruel.

248
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,920
 Have you had gruel?

249
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 - It's just like porridge, isn't it?

250
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,840
 Just like porridge.

251
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
 - That's why I thought it was.

252
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,520
 - What do you mean by having gruel?

253
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,360
 - What are you talking about?

254
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,200
 It's not what I think.

255
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,680
 - Oh, you were living with Mr. Bumble.

256
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,200
 (audience laughing)

257
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,840
 Oh, God, that sounded so rough.

258
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,640
 - I can't believe how badly you bullied Oliver.

259
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,480
 That was harsh.

260
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
 - Yeah.

261
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
 Did you ever get that second helping that you wanted?

262
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,800
 (audience laughing)

263
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
 - I had gruel, and I'm not sure that many people have gruel.

264
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
 - When did you have it, and what was it?

265
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,320
 - Oh, I went to this party where the table,

266
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,280
 you had to play a game,

267
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,440
 and on one side of the table was really good food,

268
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,520
 and on the other side was gruel.

269
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,440
 And so it was like the worst kind of food.

270
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,400
 And if you lost the game, you moved down a seat,

271
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,840
 and you went all the way down.

272
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,560
 And I had a partner who desperately wanted to go

273
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,200
 to the good food, as everyone else did.

274
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,080
 But I'd never had gruel before, so I was like,

275
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,720
 surely we gotta head that way,

276
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
 and I kept making us go that way,

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,280
 and she threw an entire glass of red wine

278
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
 all over my shirt.

279
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
 - Whoa.

280
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
 - Yeah, you know, like in the movies.

281
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
 - That's an overreaction.

282
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,880
 - Did you get to eat, taste it, though?

283
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,040
 - I did, and you enjoyed it.

284
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
 It was horrific.

285
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,400
 It was the worst thing I've ever tasted.

286
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,640
 It sounds like Brown Windsor.

287
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,520
 - I thought you were gonna say

288
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,720
 that you kissed a gruel and you liked it.

289
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,800
 (audience laughing)

290
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
 The room's been divided.

291
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
 (audience laughing)

292
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 I'm just soup, or could, maybe, cure malaria.

293
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,160
 Which is a big deal, 'cause it's a big old killer.

294
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,440
 And this was discovered by some school children.

295
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,000
 So, and this was in a study that was authored

296
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,960
 by school children.

297
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,200
 It's the only study I've ever found authored

298
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,280
 by school children.

299
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,680
 And it was a really short time ago.

300
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
 There's a parent at a local school in London

301
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,280
 called Jake Baum, and he also happened to be

302
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,000
 a professor of cell biology.

303
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,640
 And he decided it would be fun

304
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,920
 to suggest a class project where all the kids

305
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,880
 brought in a vial of the soup that their mom made them

306
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
 or their dad made them whenever they were sick,

307
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
 whenever they were ill.

308
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,600
 And then he'd suggested that in their science class,

309
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
 the science teacher must have hated this parent,

310
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
 he suggested they spin out all the soups

311
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,600
 in the centrifuge, which I guess the school

312
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,960
 then had to invest in,

313
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,360
 and then test them on a malaria parasite.

314
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
 And see, because soup, traditionally chicken soup,

315
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
 is supposed to make you feel better,

316
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
 there must be something in it, it's this old wives thing.

317
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
 And they did indeed find that five of the soups

318
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,400
 reduced the growth or the sexual development

319
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,240
 of the parasites by over 50%,

320
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,680
 which is exactly the same as malaria drugs.

321
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,000
 - Wow. - Isn't that incredible?

322
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,120
 - So what, do we have to inject ourselves with this soup?

323
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,800
 - We would, but the problem is,

324
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,880
 so this was published in the Archives of Disease and Childhood

325
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,360
 in 2019, but none of the parents had written down

326
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,720
 the ingredients of any of the soups they sent in.

327
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,800
 - Oh no.

328
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
 - So we have no idea.

329
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,200
 - Just inject any soup into yourself, just in case.

330
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,320
 - My soup has got paracetamol in it.

331
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
 - Yeah. - It's got, yeah.

332
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,760
 - Yeah.

333
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,600
 - That's hilarious.

334
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,200
 - Do you know in 1782, if you were in Haymarket in London,

335
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
 that you could pay your very own money

336
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,280
 to go and have a bath in some soup?

337
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,640
 - Oh, wow. - Yeah.

338
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,960
 This was a thing in the 17th and 18th century

339
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,480
 in the whole of Europe, not just in the UK,

340
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,080
 that people just seemed to bathe in soups.

341
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
 - Wow. - Really?

342
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,240
 - And it was supposed to be good for you,

343
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,400
 it was supposed to like, you know, there's very healthy,

344
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
 instead of just normal water,

345
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
 you were getting some of the vitamins into your body.

346
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,000
 - What flavor, any particular?

347
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,400
 - Veal or other broths.

348
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,480
 So that could be literally anything.

349
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,320
 - Yeah, would you rather a bowl of soup

350
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
 that had a chicken's pooey egg sitting inside it,

351
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,920
 yep, or a bowl of soup with Andy sitting inside it.

352
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,120
 (laughing)

353
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,840
 - What flavor is the soup?

354
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,520
 - Wow, tomato, let's say.

355
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,560
 - Oh, no, I don't really like tomato soup.

356
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,080
 - Okay, goes great with Andy though, so.

357
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,920
 (laughing)

358
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,680
 - I get your point, yeah, definitely.

359
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,560
 - That's weird, 'cause I've never, you know,

360
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,800
 you read novels written in the 19th century, 18th century,

361
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,960
 and never once have any of the characters

362
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,360
 been described as bathing in a tomato soup.

363
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,280
 - That's 'cause it's so cotidious,

364
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,040
 it's like everyone was doing it all the time,

365
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
 it's like, why even write it in the novels?

366
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,640
 - Got it, it's like, front of cleaning your teeth.

367
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,760
 - But the other thing is that at the moment,

368
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,120
 in the UNESEN spa resort in Hakone in Japan,

369
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,400
 you can go into a ramen bath.

370
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,720
 So it's still happening in Japan, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,200
 Apparently the collagen in the pork broth

372
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,840
 is supposed to give you healthier skin.

373
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,400
 - You would not eat in that spa restaurant afterwards though,

374
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
 would you?

375
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,560
 - You piece is vicious.

376
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,640
 - 'Cause if we didn't need to move on though

377
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,680
 to our second fact, it is time for fact number two,

378
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,040
 and that is my fact, my fact this week,

379
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,800
 is that the world's oldest postcard

380
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
 was sent by a writer called Theodore Hook.

381
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,880
 He sent it to himself.

382
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,280
 - Wow. - Yeah, Theodore.

383
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,040
 - What did he say, wish I was here?

384
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,560
 (laughing)

385
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,440
 - So it was sent in 1840,

386
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,520
 and it was sent in London, in Fulham,

387
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,960
 and it was a postcard where you could see people

388
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,400
 who were working at the post office around a big inkwell,

389
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,840
 and the idea was that that was satirizing the post system.

390
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,240
 So he sent it to himself,

391
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,160
 so that means the only other person who's seen it

392
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,520
 would have been the postman, right?

393
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,360
 - Yes, exactly.

394
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
 - And you'll see there's something you bastard.

395
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,240
 - Yeah. - Is that the idea?

396
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,080
 - Yeah, exactly, and it was, you know,

397
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,000
 there wasn't a big laugh here,

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
 but back in the day, that was huge satire.

399
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,360
 (laughing)

400
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,720
 I would have had people on the floor.

401
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,040
 So yeah, and so there was other postcards

402
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
 thought to be the oldest, and then this came up

403
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,080
 in an auction, and it sold for including commission

404
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,640
 and VAT, 31,000 pounds, 750.

405
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,000
 - Wow. - So it's, yeah,

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
 a really expensive item, and I think partially as well

407
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,640
 because Theodore Hook was quite an amazing prankster

408
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
 of the 1800s.

409
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,760
 He achieved what is known as the Burner Street hoax,

410
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,680
 which was one of the greatest hoaxes that London ever had.

411
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,480
 It was a hoax where he said to his friend,

412
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
 "I bet you I can make one single house,

413
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
 "the most famous house in London,"

414
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,080
 and they bet some money on it, and he said, "Go for it,"

415
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,240
 and he managed to do it.

416
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,720
 So what he did was he sent out thousands of letters

417
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,960
 to people, workmen, all over the country,

418
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,240
 and said, "Can you arrive on the morning of this day,

419
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,240
 "August 27th, in order to do something to the house?"

420
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,800
 So this one woman opened up her door

421
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,720
 on the morning of August 27th to a chimney sweep,

422
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
 and she said, "I didn't order a chimney sweep,"

423
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,800
 when she turned in away.

424
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,520
 Then another chimney sweep came, and she turned him away.

425
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,760
 10 more chimney sweeps came, turned away.

426
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,920
 Then carts carrying large deliveries of cold came,

427
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
 turned them away.

428
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,840
 Then cake makers delivering large wedding cakes.

429
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,880
 Then doctors and lawyers came.

430
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,240
 There were vickers, there were fishmongers.

431
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
 It was just getting bigger and bigger,

432
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
 and eventually the Duke of York came along.

433
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,520
 There was the Governor of the Bank of England,

434
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,920
 the Archbishop of Canterbury came along.

435
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,320
 - No! - Yes!

436
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,440
 And you know, this is, there's a lot of like,

437
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,840
 what's real and not real in this story

438
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
 through the passage of time.

439
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,360
 Imagine opening your door and seeing

440
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
 the Duke of York outside.

441
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
 I think we can all agree.

442
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,400
 (audience laughing)

443
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,560
 - That is, this was 1889.

444
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,920
 - Maybe he was just delivering some pizza expressed.

445
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,240
 (audience laughing)

446
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,880
 - This just sounds like when you're at home

447
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,800
 in the middle of a Wednesday,

448
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,320
 and all of your neighbours are out,

449
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,440
 and then your host one knocks on the door,

450
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
 and he goes, "Can you take number 10s?

451
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
 "Can you take number 12s?

452
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
 "Can you, you know, 79 packages?"

453
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,760
 - No, he was a crazy guy.

454
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,440
 - And the thing was that he just,

455
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,400
 they randomly chose that house, didn't they?

456
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,360
 It was literally, they just went through a phone book

457
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,280
 if there was one in the day,

458
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
 or whatever the equivalent was,

459
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
 and went, "Oh, let's just choose that house."

460
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
 So she had nothing to do with it, and--

461
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,760
 - Oh, she had no idea.

462
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,520
 Yeah, she was absolutely befuddled.

463
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,200
 And so this was 1809.

464
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,840
 So this was a number of years before the postcard was sent.

465
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,320
 And so by this time, when the postcard went out,

466
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,800
 and it saw that it had Theodore Hook's name on it,

467
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,640
 it was assumed he must have been sending it to himself

468
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,480
 as part of a prank.

469
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,680
 We don't actually know that he sent it to himself.

470
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,720
 That's the assumption.

471
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,600
 - But it is correct, 'cause it will be weird

472
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,920
 to receive the first ever postcard,

473
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,760
 'cause you wouldn't know what it was, really.

474
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,080
 It would be a baffling thing to experience.

475
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,920
 - You're right, yeah.

476
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
 - But you'd figure it out.

477
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,760
 It's not like--

478
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,840
 - No, this is 1840.

479
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,760
 You'd go insane.

480
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,600
 - But wait a minute.

481
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
 - He likes your wits permanently.

482
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 - I know what you're saying,

483
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,080
 but this is just the one-off he sent it to himself.

484
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,440
 So someone else must have been the first person

485
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,080
 to get a postcard, right?

486
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,920
 - Oh, yeah.

487
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,960
 - They all ended up in as islands back in the day.

488
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,600
 They were populated by postcard recipients.

489
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,480
 - History of the postcard is amazing,

490
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,520
 because they were invented in the late 19th century,

491
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,480
 and they sort of, you know,

492
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,200
 there were various stages of innovation.

493
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,840
 The biggest innovation came in the divided back period.

494
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
 Sorry, it was known as the divided back period,

495
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,120
 which is where, finally, for the first time ever,

496
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,560
 you get a picture on one side,

497
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,680
 and then the back of the card is divided

498
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
 into address and message, right?

499
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,800
 Before that, one whole side had to be

500
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,920
 for the address and the stamp, it was serious,

501
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,680
 and then the message had to go on the other side

502
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,280
 next to the picture, nightmare.

503
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
 Once you got nice picture postcards,

504
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,200
 it took off like nothing had ever done before.

505
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,040
 It was incredible.

506
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,800
 In 2010, in the UK, 800 million postcards were sent.

507
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,360
 And the population's all lower than it is now.

508
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,760
 That is a lot of people postcards per person being sent.

509
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,320
 - I think it was 25 postcards per person per year,

510
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,160
 around about that time.

511
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,560
 - I think a lot of people were doing

512
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
 a lot of postcarding as well.

513
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,440
 It wasn't everyone was doing that, was it?

514
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,240
 It was like some people were sending three a day,

515
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
 four a day, stuff like that.

516
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
 - It makes sense, right?

517
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
 - You had like four or five posts every day, didn't you?

518
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,480
 So you could send, I could send you a postcard,

519
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,680
 and you're saying, "What the fuck are you doing in my soup?"

520
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,840
 And then the same day, you could send one back.

521
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,400
 Like saying, "I'm just having a nice time, thank you."

522
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,240
 Or whatever.

523
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
 - I'm here for my health.

524
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

525
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,680
 - So it was, we know the exact date.

526
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,920
 March 1st, 1907, was the official birth of the modern postcard

527
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,280
 when they put that singular line down the middle

528
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,560
 that separated message from it anywhere in time.

529
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,400
 - Yeah.

530
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,240
 - I would go there.

531
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,280
 - The reason that they did that, of course,

532
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,600
 is because what they thought was if you put the message

533
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,880
 and the address on the same side, then in the post office,

534
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,760
 they would just get distracted by reading all of the messages.

535
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,600
 - Yeah, right.

536
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,040
 - Or there might be some sexy messages in there

537
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,200
 and they'd get embarrassed.

538
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,840
 - Yeah, they were a bit scandalous.

539
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,680
 People objected to postcards back in the day

540
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,800
 because of this idea that the postman or woman

541
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
 could read all of your dirty secrets.

542
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
 And in fact, aside from that,

543
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,200
 there was lots of other controversies.

544
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,160
 So they were thought of as killing the art of writing

545
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
 because, you know, they're short form.

546
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,080
 They were basically the text messages of their day.

547
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,800
 There was an article written in 1884,

548
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,040
 so quite soon after postcards had taken off,

549
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,320
 saying, "Who nowadays writes letters?

550
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,000
 "We all dash off hasty notes or horribly scribbler postcard.

551
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 "The epistolary art so dear to our grandmothers

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
 "is becoming extinct."

553
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,760
 And that's 150 years ago, they were whinging about that

554
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
 and they haven't shut up.

555
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,960
 - Well, yeah, it was true.

556
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,800
 - Winky face.

557
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,040
 - You know, you could get postcards made of moss

558
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,880
 back in the day.

559
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,960
 - Oh, for fuck's sake.

560
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,600
 - Sorry, just a little moss fact here.

561
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
 Someone made of wood, but Birchbark,

562
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,840
 Canada had leather ones,

563
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,120
 and Ireland had cards made of peat moss.

564
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,880
 - Wow. - How do you write on that?

565
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,280
 - They processed the peat moss in some way

566
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,760
 to make it that you could write on it.

567
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,600
 - That makes sense. - How?

568
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
 I don't know, but nonetheless.

569
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,520
 - They banned those in America, I think.

570
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,600
 I'm not sure about the moss ones,

571
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,560
 but definitely the wood ones they banned in America.

572
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,080
 You could only send paper or cardboard ones.

573
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,840
 That's 'cause they jammed the post machines.

574
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,000
 So they had leather ones, they had wood ones,

575
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,840
 like you said.

576
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,120
 And the thing is about the wood ones,

577
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,520
 they tended to have really terrible jokes on them.

578
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,960
 So like, you might go to an exposition about wood

579
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
 or something and get a wooden postcard,

580
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,160
 and it would say, "The exposition is more than oak A."

581
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,360
 - Right.

582
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 - "It's ash tonishing.

583
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,000
 (audience laughs)

584
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,400
 "I would spruce up and come.

585
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,640
 "You will not regret it."

586
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,720
 - Is that you will not regret it?

587
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,560
 - You know what it wasn't, they missed that one.

588
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,600
 - Lazy, a trick missed.

589
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,080
 (audience laughs)

590
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,400
 - Well, that's what you get for going to a wood symposium,

591
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,240
 I'm gonna say.

592
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,400
 (audience laughs)

593
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
 - We do need to talk about the saucy seaside postcard.

594
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
 I'm sorry, we have to.

595
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
 - What is it?

596
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,240
 - The saucy seaside postcard is a great institution

597
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,200
 of the 20th century, which is just a slightly rude postcard

598
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,880
 with a slightly funny or saucy, saucy, I don't think, yeah.

599
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,720
 - You'd recognise them.

600
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,080
 They're always like, box and women bursting out

601
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,720
 of red swimming costumes, a very '50s style

602
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,920
 with a raunchy, rude comment underneath.

603
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
 - Okay, cool.

604
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,680
 - Thank you, yeah, exactly.

605
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,840
 So kind of-- - Saucy.

606
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,560
 - Saucy, I've never said the word saucy

607
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,920
 so many times in my life, but I love it.

608
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,640
 And basically, one artist in particular,

609
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,600
 Donald McGill, was one of the great artists of this.

610
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
 He did about nine a week until he died, it was incredible.

611
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,200
 But there was trouble because there were seaside censorship

612
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,720
 boards which assessed the sauciness of the postcards

613
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,560
 and banned them if they were too rude.

614
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,600
 So there was a blackpool board that you had to submit

615
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,440
 all your postcards to before they could go on sale.

616
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
 There was another on the Isle of Wight.

617
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
 And the members were things like there was a solicitor,

618
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,120
 a vicar, a bank manager, and Mrs. Gloria Swanson

619
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,600
 of the Blackpool Hotel and Boarding House Association.

620
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,800
 And they would sit in judgment over the postcards.

621
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,520
 And if you had one, for example,

622
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,360
 there's one of a girl talking to a bookie at a race course

623
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,080
 and she's saying, I want to back the favourite, please.

624
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,480
 My sweetheart gave me a pound to do it both ways, okay?

625
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,920
 That's, I think that's a good joke.

626
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,360
 But Mrs. Gloria Swanson, absolutely not, banned.

627
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,360
 And these kept going until the Isle of Man Committee

628
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
 lasted until 1989. Wow.

629
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,840
 1989. But then he got cancelled, basically, didn't he?

630
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,040
 Yeah, he did. In the '50s, really, wasn't it?

631
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,320
 Yeah, yeah.

632
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,080
 When they properly just clamped down,

633
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,440
 he was found guilty of breaking the Obscene Publications Act

634
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,720
 and, you know, fined and...

635
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,680
 Incredible.

636
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,120
 Reputation destroyed, very sad.

637
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
 And then went bankrupt.

638
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
 And also the other weird thing that we should mention about him

639
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,120
 is that he only had one foot.

640
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,000
 OK. And he lost his foot, his other foot, in a rugby accident.

641
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,800
 Ah! Which I didn't know was even possible.

642
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 But, yeah.

643
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,920
 Just on the sort of censorship thing,

644
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,880
 that was a thing not just for postcards.

645
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
 I'm sure I must have mentioned it on the podcast a long time ago,

646
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,240
 but the lead singer of Pet Shop Boys, Neil Tennant,

647
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,920
 I think his name is, he used to work for Marvel

648
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,200
 and his job was whenever comic books came in,

649
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,760
 he would have to cover up the cleavage line

650
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,720
 on women that were acceptable in America,

651
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,080
 but not here. I mean, that was, you know, in the '70s and '80s.

652
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,280
 Yeah. It was good work, if you could get it.

653
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,800
 He wouldn't say no to that job, it was a 15-year-old intern.

654
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,440
 He'd be loving that.

655
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,520
 You know, the other amazing thing about postcards

656
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,320
 is that back in the day, it was the source of, sometimes,

657
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,520
 allowing you to see an image that you would otherwise have never seen.

658
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,440
 So newspapers, back in the day, let's say in American newspapers,

659
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,240
 largely completely text-based.

660
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,600
 So if it said something like, "An accident, train crashes,"

661
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,680
 or something where you might rubber-neck it, you know,

662
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,360
 it's like, "I'm curious to see a disaster,"

663
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,680
 a photo would be taken and it would be printed onto these postcards

664
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
 and people would send each other these postcards

665
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,920
 just to show them a news event as opposed to having anything to say.

666
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,720
 So it became a huge source of being able to just-- source--

667
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,600
 being able to see everything that was happening in the world

668
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,560
 prior to newspapers allowing us to do that.

669
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
 It was basically Twitter, wasn't it?

670
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,280
 Or text message, that kind of thing WhatsApp, that kind of thing.

671
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,000
 It was just like people sharing information.

672
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,800
 It was quite weird, though, when people used to send postcards

673
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,640
 of burning buildings and screaming car crash victims

674
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,960
 and then they wrote on the back, "Wish you were here."

675
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,400
 It was an odd time.

676
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,920
 But there was, like, political stuff as well, wasn't there?

677
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,800
 Like, the suffrage movement, there was a big battle of postcards of that.

678
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,760
 So there were a lot of anti-suffrage postcards

679
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,560
 where they would, like, mock the suffragettes and say, you know,

680
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,600
 "If you're a suffragette, you'll never get married," all that kind of thing.

681
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,920
 And then there were pro-suffragette postcards

682
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,320
 where you would have, like, really iconic women on them

683
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,680
 and try and push people in that direction.

684
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,200
 And often both types were made by the same company.

685
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
 -Right. -Ah, Claire.

686
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,240
 -No ways. -We're gonna have to move on.

687
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
 -Say it, guys. -I don't think the suffragettes

688
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,920
 would have approved of that, Joe, Captain.

689
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
 Not sure I've approved of it.

690
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,520
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

691
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,160
 My fact is that the first man to kill people by guillotine

692
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,880
 was briefly so fashionable that French people would dress up as him.

693
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
 Mm-hmm.

694
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
 It's called Charles-Henry Sanson,

695
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,760
 and he was the chief executioner to Louis XVI,

696
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,200
 and then he was the executioner of Louis XVI

697
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,120
 in a very weird job switcheroo.

698
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
 (LAUGHTER)

699
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,520
 It was like, "Undercover boss," it's like.

700
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,840
 (LAUGHTER)

701
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
 Well, that went wrong.

702
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,560
 (LAUGHTER)

703
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,400
 Yeah, and the French Revolution, obviously,

704
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
 that was a time of great social change, to put it mildly.

705
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,360
 And he was very famous during the period known as "The Terror,"

706
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,760
 and he had this uniform, it was stripy trousers,

707
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,840
 a tricorne hat, green coat, quite dashing,

708
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,960
 and he was just so fashionable in Paris at the time

709
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,840
 that he became someone people dressed up as him.

710
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,400
 And fashionable because of his awesome stripy trousers

711
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,520
 and tricorne hat, or because of what he was doing.

712
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,240
 I think 'cause the guillotine was a thing.

713
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,440
 I actually am. I'm not so sure, actually,

714
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,000
 because he was really, really fashionable, like you say.

715
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,080
 He wore blue trousers to set off with,

716
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,800
 but they were so worried about him being so fashionable

717
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,280
 that they banned him from wearing blue trousers.

718
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,160
 And from then on, he was only allowed to wear green trousers.

719
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,440
 And they said, "The blue is the colour of the nobility,

720
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,800
 "you're not allowed to wear them."

721
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
 Right. Yeah.

722
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,200
 You'd think if the French Revolutionary Committee

723
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,600
 were telling you off for dressing as the nobility.

724
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,640
 Pre-pre-revolutionary, you're kidding me.

725
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
 Oh, OK, that's fair enough. Right, let's see.

726
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,360
 But it seems like... It was not fair enough, it's bad.

727
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,960
 I don't approve of the Louis XVI, all the French Revolution.

728
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
 We know what side you're on now.

729
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,600
 No, it's fine. Come on.

730
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,880
 But the early days of it,

731
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,560
 there did seem to be a bit of colour coordination going on,

732
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,920
 and the colour being red.

733
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,680
 So the account that I read was you had the person

734
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,560
 who was about to be killed had a red T-shirt on.

735
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,680
 T-shirt. Yeah. Cool.

736
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
 They had some converse, didn't they?

737
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,120
 It's like fashion.

738
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,720
 Is it in Star Trek where all the red people die, or am I...?

739
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,160
 Ah, yes, I'm so far out of my comfort zone here.

740
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
 Yeah, so he had a red T-shirt on.

741
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,160
 He had Nike cap.

742
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,720
 Can we just give it some time-appropriate names?

743
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,400
 So what did they wear back then?

744
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,240
 Just no T, I think.

745
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,520
 Ah. OK, so...

746
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,480
 Wow, that's very panicky to pick that up.

747
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
 The T-shirt was invented in the 20th century.

748
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,520
 It's a very anachronistic thing to hear T-shirts in the French Revolution.

749
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,960
 People are going to think that happens in Australia.

750
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,680
 Or did I just bust a time-traveler?

751
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,840
 OK, that's...

752
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,320
 What colour were his jeans?

753
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,520
 LAUGHTER

754
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,440
 So he had a red shirt on, and the...

755
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
 And Charles... Is that his name? Charles?

756
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,320
 He had a cape on, which was red, and the guillotine itself was red.

757
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,800
 So red was very much the dominant theme.

758
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
 Well, I guess it doesn't show the stains.

759
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,640
 Was the guillotine definitely red pre-execution?

760
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,080
 It wasn't just...

761
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,520
 I think this was for the very first, yeah, execution.

762
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,800
 I guess maybe they were just trying to hide the gore.

763
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,280
 And unfortunately, when they did it, it was because this was new,

764
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,320
 and they had huge crowds that came to see it,

765
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,480
 because everyone was so fascinated by all of these public deaths,

766
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,400
 the crowds were really disappointed,

767
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,000
 because it was really efficient and quick and over like that.

768
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,480
 And they were like, "Ah, we brought sandwiches."

769
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,360
 We were going to be here a while, and it was just like,

770
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,160
 "Ah, it was too efficient, you've got two stars."

771
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
 People rioted. Three people died in the riots

772
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
 about how efficient the new guillotine was.

773
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
 Really? Yeah.

774
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,800
 The worst thing about that one,

775
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,240
 so that guy who was killed in the first guillotine,

776
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,400
 he was called Pelletier,

777
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,840
 they decided, OK, we're going to stop hanging people,

778
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,280
 because we think everyone should be killed exactly the same way,

779
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,320
 because, you know, where the French Revolution,

780
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,720
 it shouldn't be that the nobility get a good way of dying

781
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,040
 and the other people don't.

782
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,200
 Everyone's going to be killed with a sword, with an axe.

783
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,640
 And then this guy, Sanson, decided,

784
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,560
 "Well, actually, my axe isn't good enough for that.

785
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,960
 "I won't be able to get through enough people,

786
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
 "so we need a new way of doing it."

787
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,280
 And so they came up with this idea of the guillotine,

788
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,200
 but this guy had already been found guilty

789
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
 and was already sentenced to death,

790
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,400
 and he had to sit there and watch it be built,

791
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,600
 because he couldn't be executed until it was built.

792
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,240
 Did he have to go through the kind of, like,

793
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,600
 brainstorming meetings with them, saying, "What about this?"

794
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,400
 I feel like you'd, like, steal a screw or something, wouldn't you?

795
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,600
 Yeah.

796
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,720
 But Sanson, the executioner, he was part of this extraordinary

797
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,840
 dynasty of executioners.

798
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,520
 So six generations of his family performed this role.

799
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,040
 Great-grandfather, grandfather, father, all six of his brothers.

800
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,520
 All six of his brothers were also executioners

801
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,840
 in different bits of France.

802
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,600
 Wow. Yeah.

803
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,760
 Mad. It's really bizarre.

804
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
 And they called them just by the name of the town

805
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,960
 they were the executioner,

806
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,760
 so they didn't even call them by their first name.

807
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,880
 They would call them Reem or Leon or Atom.

808
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
 Yeah. It's just, it's bizarre.

809
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,600
 And when you read it about his life,

810
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,400
 he mostly had a series of protracted workplace disputes

811
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,320
 with his bosses, who were either the royalty

812
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,640
 or the revolutionary committee.

813
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,160
 So he was saying, "Look, I'm broke.

814
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,280
 "I've got, there are so many people to be executed.

815
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,000
 "My working conditions are bad.

816
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
 "I need a budget increase."

817
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,960
 He was asking for a budget increase from the Minister of Justice,

818
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,920
 which was days after he had executed

819
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,000
 the previous Minister of Justice.

820
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
 LAUGHTER

821
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,200
 I think that's when you've got leverage in any time.

822
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,440
 Absolutely.

823
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,960
 Yeah, he just had all of these disputes

824
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,560
 with, like, running, irritating disputes.

825
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,480
 He once sued someone for libel

826
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,320
 for saying that he was boorish or brutish.

827
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,840
 Wow. He was an executioner.

828
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
 There's also a weird thing, which is,

829
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,440
 I don't know if this is the original moment

830
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,960
 where this idea came about,

831
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,240
 but there's a lot of question about at what point,

832
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,160
 once the head is removed from the body,

833
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,320
 does the person actually pass away?

834
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,600
 And there were all these experiments of, like,

835
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,400
 trying to get people to blink posts,

836
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
 you know, to talking to the dismembered head.

837
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,640
 There was a theory, I think, like, I remember reading

838
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
 when I was a kid, even, that they stay alive

839
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,440
 for, like, seven or eight seconds or something.

840
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,960
 Yeah, so there was this thing with Charles Henri,

841
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,240
 which is when he had executed a woman

842
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,680
 who was called Charlotte Corday.

843
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,680
 Someone, a carpenter, jumped up and grabbed her head,

844
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,800
 and he picked it up, and he slapped her on the face.

845
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,400
 So, a horrible thing to do, a poster beheading.

846
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,280
 You don't mind, I don't think, at that stage.

847
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,760
 Well, this is the thing. Apparently, she did.

848
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,560
 Because, apparently, witnesses reported an expression

849
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,000
 of unequivocal indignation on her face

850
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,520
 after she was slapped, and everyone thought,

851
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,880
 "Oh, maybe you actually last a bit longer."

852
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,200
 You last long enough to be annoyed by something.

853
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,640
 (LAUGHTER)

854
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
 But, yeah, for a while afterwards, there were a lot of studies

855
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,880
 into if that's the case, because of Charlotte's anger.

856
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,680
 Original guillotine invented in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

857
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,320
 Yeah. So, good.

858
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,000
 Well done.

859
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,960
 Are we saying that that's good?

860
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,320
 Because, I would say, because it's in Yorkshire, it's bad.

861
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,000
 Debate. Debate.

862
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,080
 Oh. Off with his head. Oh, no.

863
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,400
 It was solely to chop off the heads of people from Lancashire,

864
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,840
 wasn't it?

865
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
 It was called the Halifax Chibbit, but it was a mechanism

866
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,440
 for doing the same kind of thing.

867
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,160
 And Daniel Defoe wrote about it, and he said there was this rule,

868
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
 right, that if you could pull your head...

869
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,920
 So, there was a pin that got pulled, and that dropped the chopper.

870
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,160
 But if the order was given to pull the pin,

871
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,320
 and you managed to pull your head out of the block in time,

872
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,520
 you were then free to run, as far as you could.

873
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,920
 The executioner was entitled to chase you under the rules of this system.

874
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
 Wow. But if you got across the river,

875
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,680
 you were home, not home dry, home very wet, but you weren't free.

876
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,440
 You were not going to be executed anymore.

877
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,520
 And so that apparently was a rule they had in place.

878
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,040
 It seems like a bad rule.

879
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 You could spot people who've done it because they'd always have

880
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,000
 a bald patch on the top of their head, wouldn't they?

881
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,240
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

882
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,320
 My fact this week is that in Sicily, the pistachios are guarded

883
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,840
 by the military police.

884
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,640
 Not a very stressful occupation, I would guess.

885
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,600
 Well, they're a very dangerous industry, turns out, sort of.

886
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,480
 They are very valuable pistachios in Sicily.

887
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
 They're called green gold there.

888
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,920
 They're different to all pistachios in the rest of the world.

889
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,080
 They're farmed in a place called Bronte.

890
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,880
 And their thought was much better and richer and deeper flavour

891
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,240
 than any other pistachios.

892
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,640
 They only constitute about 1% of the world's supply.

893
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,800
 Less, but they're the best.

894
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,520
 And so people keep stealing them.

895
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,760
 And loads of pistachio farmers were complaining,

896
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,720
 saying literally people are rocking out with guns and, you know,

897
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,360
 holdings at gunpoint and stealing all our pistachios.

898
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,680
 There was one person who said they'd had a story of someone

899
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,120
 like rappelling down from the air and scooping pistachios off trees.

900
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,840
 [LAUGHTER]

901
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
 From like a helicopter.

902
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,000
 It had to be, yeah, like a big blimp above or something.

903
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,360
 I think from the helicopter.

904
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,840
 And I don't know if, like, you've had to pay for the helicopter.

905
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,400
 You're going to have to pick a lot of pistachios from your outskirts.

906
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,680
 I find it incredible that there is a version of pistachios

907
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,920
 which apparently is even nicer than pistachios,

908
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
 one of the nicest things in the world.

909
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,760
 Like, it's, I can't imagine how good,

910
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,400
 because I'm sure I've never had one of these Bronte pistachios.

911
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:35,880
 Yeah.

912
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,880
 I'm sure that I'm one of the 99% in the pistachio world.

913
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,400
 I think that's the 1%.

914
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
 And that's why we rioted all those years ago,

915
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,800
 as the people who tasted those pistachios.

916
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,680
 How good must they be?

917
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,560
 They must be incredible.

918
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,640
 I actually don't, I don't think pistachios are that great,

919
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
 so I'm not as excited as you,

920
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,200
 but I still wouldn't mind tasting them.

921
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,680
 Wow.

922
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,880
 But they're worth a lot, aren't they?

923
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,800
 Like, one single bag could be worth up to 33,000 American dollars,

924
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,600
 and that is big.

925
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,480
 What bag?

926
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,960
 Yeah.

927
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,920
 Not a supermarket bag.

928
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,080
 Start like 100 grams.

929
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,760
 Like a Santa sac kind of cake.

930
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,400
 Right, okay, yeah.

931
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,640
 I don't normally buy them in Santa sac, but yeah.

932
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,200
 Okay, a big old bag, yeah.

933
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,000
 That's a lot.

934
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,960
 How much did you sell?

935
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,000
 33,000 American dollars, I believe.

936
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,560
 That's incredible.

937
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:15,720
 Yeah.

938
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,280
 Yeah.

939
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,440
 There's Bronte, so this place.

940
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,760
 Admiral Nelson, Lord Nelson, was the Duke of Bronte.

941
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,080
 Yes.

942
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,040
 And he was granted the title by the King of Naples and Sicily,

943
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,720
 because he helped to put down a revolution

944
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,800
 against the King, Ferdinand I.

945
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,360
 So he never visited, but he was the Duke of Bronte.

946
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,240
 He was very proud of that.

947
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,480
 He always signed his name, once he was given that,

948
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,760
 Nelson and Bronte, which is all just Bronte.

949
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,200
 And Bronte, did you say?

950
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,160
 Not and Bronte, but there's a connection.

951
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,560
 Is there?

952
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,640
 Because 10 years after Nelson died,

953
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,200
 there was a clergyman called Patrick Bronte,

954
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
 who thought, "I want to posh out my name a bit,"

955
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,400
 and he changed his name to Bronte,

956
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,160
 and then fathered the Bronte girls.

957
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,640
 Yeah.

958
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,600
 Did he get it from the pistachio place, then, though?

959
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,720
 Via Nelson, yeah.

960
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,440
 Oh, really?

961
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,040
 He wanted to make his name posh and cool.

962
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
 That's amazing.

963
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,840
 Did not know that.

964
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,040
 If it weren't for the pistachios,

965
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,960
 we wouldn't have Wuthering Heights.

966
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,840
 Yeah.

967
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,240
 Yeah.

968
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,040
 Yes.

969
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,520
 Yeah.

970
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,000
 Very good.

971
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,400
 That's what it looks like.

972
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,920
 And if we didn't have Manchester,

973
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,120
 we wouldn't have Jane Eyre,

974
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,400
 because that's where Charlotte Bronte started writing Jane Eyre

975
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,200
 in Manchester.

976
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,840
 So thank you all here.

977
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,320
 I thought I'd win more of you over with that one.

978
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,720
 But that's cool.

979
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,800
 We're all from Yorkshire in this room in times like that.

980
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,480
 Actually, pistachio theft is a problem all over the world

981
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
 where they make pistachios, anyway.

982
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,000
 So in America, they have a nut theft task force,

983
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,400
 which stops nut theft in the California area.

984
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,640
 In Turkey, apparently, they have nut vigilantes

985
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,600
 who try to stop people from stealing their pistachios.

986
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,320
 And in Turkey, they don't repel from blimps

987
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,840
 or anything or from helicopters.

988
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,160
 You just ram a tree with your car

989
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,920
 and knock all of the pistachios out

990
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,080
 and then just gather them all up and shove them in your car.

991
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,720
 Oh, clever.

992
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,080
 That's really clever.

993
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,640
 Yeah.

994
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,320
 And in Sicily, it's the carabinieri police force

995
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,840
 who guard them.

996
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,160
 And they do helicopter patrols as well.

997
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,800
 Do they ever have to fire shells at the thieves?

998
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,440
 But I find the carabinieri so weird that,

999
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,400
 so, you know, if you go to Italy, there are two police forces

1000
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,920
 and they just accept this.

1001
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,280
 So there's like the normal police.

1002
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,720
 Oh, we've got about 40, haven't we?

1003
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,160
 Okay, sure.

1004
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,320
 Sorry, there are two types of police.

1005
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,400
 So if you want to call, if you've got an emergency,

1006
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,920
 you can either call the polizia

1007
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,760
 or you can call the carabinieri.

1008
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,040
 And I can't really work.

1009
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,000
 And one's 112 and one's 113, I think.

1010
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,200
 And this journalist was asking Italian, the Sicilians,

1011
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,800
 and they didn't really know which was which.

1012
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,160
 They were like, "You just pick one."

1013
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,320
 It's just, and it's just a hangover.

1014
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,480
 It's from pre-unification even.

1015
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,800
 And the carabinieri were like the royal guards.

1016
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
 And now they're just a hangover.

1017
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,480
 But they've got these really weird rules.

1018
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,200
 So they didn't used to be allowed to have facial hair

1019
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,400
 for quite a long time, I think.

1020
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,600
 And now you can have quite strict facial hair.

1021
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,080
 They had to ask permission to marry

1022
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,840
 if you're in the military police force.

1023
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,760
 And then once you ask permission to marry from your boss,

1024
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,600
 then they do a full-on background check

1025
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,320
 of your potential spouse to make sure they're appropriate.

1026
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,280
 Okay, I think that's the best one to ring, isn't it?

1027
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,680
 If they're that strict, no?

1028
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,040
 Yeah, you don't have to ask.

1029
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,560
 I want you to send a police officer,

1030
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
 but can you tell me about your spouse a bit first?

1031
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,480
 Yeah, that's very good.

1032
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,840
 I don't think people are calling them the day

1033
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,360
 before their wedding, just to say,

1034
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,560
 "I think you're really good at it,

1035
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,160
 and I've got some doubts, actually."

1036
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,920
 So... Wow.

1037
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,160
 Yeah, pistachio theft is a big, a huge deal.

1038
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,640
 So this year in June, I think this was in California,

1039
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,720
 there was a guy, a trucker who was arrested

1040
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,120
 for allegedly stealing £42,000 of pistachios.

1041
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,520
 Wait, nice. Like, one and a half bags.

1042
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:53,240
 Yeah, and it's a problem because you turn up dressed

1043
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,680
 as a truck driver, looking like a truck driver.

1044
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,960
 Dressed as a truck driver.

1045
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,640
 What if you haven't bought that Halloween costume yet?

1046
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,760
 You sort of look plausibly like...

1047
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,720
 Wearing a t-shirt, for instance.

1048
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
 Wearing a t-shirt, yeah.

1049
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,400
 And so now drivers have to have thumb prints, photo ID,

1050
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
 the whole deal.

1051
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,560
 And some people have hacked into

1052
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,400
 trucking companies' computer systems

1053
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,440
 to place fake orders for pistachios,

1054
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,040
 and then someone turns upon the day and says,

1055
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,960
 "I'm here for the pistachios that have been ordered."

1056
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,360
 Right.

1057
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,280
 And then drive off with all the nuts.

1058
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,360
 And that's a perfect crime.

1059
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,720
 And the idea is basically that there's no kind of

1060
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,080
 barcodes on these things, right?

1061
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,280
 There's just tons of nuts,

1062
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,520
 and people eat the pistachios,

1063
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,920
 and so that's kind of destroying all the evidence.

1064
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,720
 It's the perfect crime.

1065
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,880
 It's the perfect crime, because you get to eat pistachio nuts

1066
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,320
 throughout. It's... Yeah.

1067
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,320
 Just back to Bronte for a second.

1068
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,120
 Oh, yeah.

1069
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,400
 Not the sisters, the area with the pistachios.

1070
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,640
 There's an amazing thing when you're looking at photos of it

1071
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,760
 that you suddenly notice this giant mountain

1072
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,160
 that is sitting in the background of the pistachio area,

1073
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,280
 and it's Mount Etna.

1074
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,600
 And Mount Etna is given a lot of credit

1075
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
 for the reason that the pistachios are so good,

1076
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,240
 because basically the trees are growing out

1077
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,280
 of the kind of volcanic slabs that have been laid down

1078
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,480
 over the passage of time.

1079
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,160
 Which is genuinely really good for soil.

1080
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,840
 Like lava has all these minerals in it,

1081
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,680
 which over time make it much more fertile.

1082
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,480
 So it's true.

1083
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,280
 Yeah, but it's still an active volcano,

1084
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,040
 and up until very recently,

1085
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,080
 I think it was in...

1086
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,440
 It was either this year or last year,

1087
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,800
 it had these huge explosions, lava explosions.

1088
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
 It grew in height by 100 feet.

1089
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
 What?

1090
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,520
 Yeah, because of all of...

1091
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,000
 It was literally like when you put a Mentos in a Diet Coke.

1092
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,760
 It was shooting a column.

1093
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
 You know what a volcano is?

1094
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,840
 Right.

1095
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,440
 Hang on, James.

1096
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,160
 I need to hear a bit more about this Mentos Coke situation

1097
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,280
 before I can visualize it.

1098
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,160
 Sorry, do you mean it grew 100 feet just temporarily

1099
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,040
 while it was shooting it out?

1100
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,520
 No, no, that column, like a Mentos in a Diet Coke,

1101
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,000
 shoots like meters upright, and this is what this did.

1102
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,920
 This was like hundreds of meters into the air,

1103
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,280
 this column of stuff.

1104
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,840
 So it grew in all the ash kind of sat on top of lava

1105
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,200
 and dried up, and it grew.

1106
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,120
 But it does an amazing thing, Mount Etna,

1107
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,440
 which I didn't realize volcanoes do.

1108
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,600
 It blows smoke rings occasionally,

1109
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,040
 like a really skilled smoker doing those...

1110
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,600
 You can see these beautiful plumes of perfect rings

1111
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,880
 coming out the top of Mount Etna.

1112
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,440
 That's great.

1113
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,240
 So it's not just the pistachios that are cool about the area.

1114
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,040
 I'm still not going until I can do that Gandalf ship.

1115
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,920
 Then I'll visit Sicily.

1116
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,840
 Okay, I've got an economics quiz for you all.

1117
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,560
 Oh, great.

1118
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,280
 Yay!

1119
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,800
 Which is better value, shelled or unshelled pistachios?

1120
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,960
 Well, I would say probably...

1121
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,280
 It's more fun to open the shells,

1122
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,840
 and it actually means you don't shove millions of them

1123
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,320
 in your face, so you kind of eat a bit less.

1124
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,400
 But presumably the shells aren't worth as much,

1125
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
 so it would be better to get unshelled.

1126
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,760
 Okay, good theory.

1127
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,680
 I'm going to say shelled as well, purely because I think it's...

1128
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,440
 Yeah, it's the pure form, right?

1129
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,240
 And all sorts.

1130
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,400
 Pure form, yeah, I guess.

1131
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,680
 Okay, I'm going to say it's impossible to answer that,

1132
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,800
 because you haven't told us what they cost, respectively.

1133
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,320
 I can't tell you what's better value,

1134
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,680
 unless you tell me how much it is.

1135
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,720
 Sorry, I just want to allow you myself to that theory.

1136
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,280
 Well, okay, let's say shelled on pistachios.

1137
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,120
 With the shell, half the price per ounce, right?

1138
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,040
 But you only get half as many,

1139
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,280
 because half the space in the bag is shells in empty space.

1140
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,120
 So this is by a website called Wonkblog,

1141
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,560
 which is very good, by the way,

1142
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,320
 on these sort of nut-related questions.

1143
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,600
 The problem is, the price is roughly equivalent per weight,

1144
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,360
 but it's labor.

1145
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,560
 It's how much work you're doing

1146
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,480
 to take the shells off the pistachios.

1147
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,240
 And so it depends what you earn.

1148
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,880
 So if you're on, you know, 10 pounds an hour,

1149
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,160
 the cost of shell on pistachios is about four pounds in labor

1150
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,120
 to remove the shells,

1151
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,640
 if you're doing it for a certain time.

1152
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,040
 But if you earn, you know, 40 quid an hour,

1153
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,080
 that's way more per bag of shell pistachios,

1154
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,280
 because you are having to do the work.

1155
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,840
 So there's that thing about, is it Cristiano Ronaldo?

1156
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,400
 It's not, if he drops a tenner on the floor,

1157
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,840
 it's not worth him picking it up,

1158
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,360
 because it would take him longer

1159
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,960
 than he's earned that amount of money.

1160
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,520
 Exactly.

1161
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,360
 Also, someone else might kick the ball away from you

1162
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,800
 in the time that you went down to...

1163
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,400
 It's not a good strategy on the pitch.

1164
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,720
 I mean, what's he doing on the pitch anyway,

1165
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,080
 Cristiano Ronaldo these days?

1166
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,960
 Ronaldo would be the worst person in the world

1167
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,840
 to buy shell on pistachios,

1168
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,320
 because it's just not worth his time taking the shell off.

1169
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,720
 It's a stupid thing that shell removal is labor,

1170
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,640
 and some people will call that a hobby.

1171
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,080
 So...

1172
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,360
 And there's a place in America called Pistachio Land.

1173
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
 Sounds really cool.

1174
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,400
 According to their website,

1175
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,960
 they offer a motorised farm tour around the orchards,

1176
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,800
 a candy kitchen where they produce their own pistachio treats,

1177
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,240
 a geocache location,

1178
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,320
 and a poker stop for playing Pokemon Go.

1179
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,720
 There's the four things.

1180
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,840
 The website's really good.

1181
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,720
 It tells you why pistachios are so good for you.

1182
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,560
 Some maybe slightly dubious claims.

1183
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,160
 They say that they're cholesterol-free,

1184
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,680
 which I think they are, so that's good.

1185
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,640
 They have antioxidants, so that's good for you,

1186
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,240
 you know, very fashionable.

1187
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,280
 It also says that the colour green is associated

1188
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,880
 with health, hope, renewal, and alleviates anxiety,

1189
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
 which feels like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it?

1190
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,360
 It does, unless you're seeing it on the executioner's trousers

1191
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,080
 heading towards you.

1192
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,320
 It will cool stress.

1193
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,960
 Did you know that pistachios are good for penises?

1194
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,480
 In what sense?

1195
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,240
 Well, they were originally called the penistachio, weren't they?

1196
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,480
 Yeah, yeah, in what way, in what way?

1197
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,640
 Okay, so there was a study where they gave a bunch of men

1198
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,120
 100 grams of pistachio nuts as a diet,

1199
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,760
 so you would eat them in one go for three weeks,

1200
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,880
 and they found that their penises got better.

1201
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,640
 Now, here's the interesting thing about this.

1202
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:51,960
 Yes.

1203
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,600
 I've not written down what that means, so...

1204
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:03,720
 Presumably, the scientific paper didn't say the penises got better,

1205
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,920
 so you've already...

1206
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,040
 So, I've written that.

1207
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,880
 I've written "Good for your penis",

1208
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,560
 and then I've kind of just not written anything else,

1209
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,200
 so it's going to remain a bit of a mystery.

1210
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,480
 I have a lot of acronyms.

1211
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,720
 Apparently, your IIEF score is better,

1212
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,080
 and your PCDU parameters are better as well.

1213
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,440
 But there are side effects in patients with ED,

1214
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,640
 so watch out for that.

1215
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,200
 That's a retell dysfunction, I suppose, the last one.

1216
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,000
 Oh, yes.

1217
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,680
 So, it's "Good for your penis", "Good for your nuts"?

1218
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,080
 No?

1219
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,040
 Yeah.

1220
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,480
 So, you know, it's a mystery what that means,

1221
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,320
 but it's good news.

1222
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,120
 It's good news.

1223
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,480
 If you want a good penis...

1224
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,120
 I don't know if it means morally.

1225
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,360
 I don't know if it means in action.

1226
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,120
 I don't know if it's like at quizzes.

1227
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,760
 I don't know what...

1228
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,360
 Well-behaved penises.

1229
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,600
 Did you say "Good at quizzes"?

1230
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,480
 "Good at quizzes".

1231
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,400
 I remember when we took you to the pub

1232
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,600
 and you were playing the quiz machine.

1233
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,520
 Never again.

1234
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,160
 Extraordinary.

1235
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,080
 They had to clean the buttons so much after this.

1236
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,840
 Anyway, look, we need to wrap up in a second.

1237
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,280
 Do we have anything else before we do?

1238
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,000
 Well, they're dangerous, aren't they, pistachios?

1239
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,800
 They can explode.

1240
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,120
 And they can suffocate you.

1241
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,240
 But not like as a sort of mercy killing, that kind of thing.

1242
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
 They don't grab a cushion and they don't do that.

1243
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,400
 How can they do either of these things?

1244
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,800
 Not under their own steam, either of these things, surely?

1245
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,720
 Well, kind of, I suppose.

1246
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,320
 So, yeah, basically they're taking out oxygen from an area

1247
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,760
 and releasing carbon dioxide.

1248
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,840
 So if you are in like a big truck full of pistachios

1249
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,800
 and it's hermetically sealed and you're there long enough,

1250
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,920
 then you'll suffocate.

1251
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,840
 So that's kind of them by themselves, isn't it?

1252
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,040
 Definitely, I think so.

1253
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,080
 Yeah, and they have this kind of fat in there

1254
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,080
 and they have this chemical reaction.

1255
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,440
 And that chemical reaction gives out heat.

1256
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,440
 And if it gives out enough heat, if they're enough there,

1257
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,640
 they can explode.

1258
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,040
 Yeah.

1259
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,240
 So they're dangerous.

1260
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,080
 It's not, it would be an elaborate plot.

1261
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,160
 It would be an amazing sort of mystery.

1262
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,120
 You need a lot of them.

1263
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,680
 If you have them in your pocket, they're not going to explode.

1264
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,760
 Although you might end up with a bad penis if they do.

1265
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,800
 It's not just like saying that flower,

1266
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,440
 is it like every time your wife receives some flowers,

1267
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,200
 you say, you know, they can suffocate you

1268
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,360
 if you're shot in a room with a million of them.

1269
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,880
 To be honest, the problem is the florist never

1270
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,720
 have enough space on the little cart today.

1271
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,960
 I've got to do one more thing.

1272
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,840
 Yeah, go for it.

1273
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,160
 So this is, pistachios used to be red in America,

1274
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,280
 which I didn't know, they were dyed

1275
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,120
 because they were bought from Iran.

1276
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,880
 And then there was the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.

1277
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,880
 Big deal, there were trade embargoes.

1278
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,480
 So no more imports from Iran.

1279
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,360
 And America started its own pistachio industry.

1280
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,800
 And this was all in the time of President Jimmy Carter,

1281
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,960
 who set up this pistachio embargo.

1282
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,680
 Very exciting.

1283
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,160
 But he, of course, is a peanut farmer.

1284
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,120
 If anyone remembers that.

1285
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,360
 Jimmy Carter is a peanut farmer and was and is.

1286
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,560
 And there is a statue of Jimmy Carter in Georgia,

1287
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,120
 which is of a four meter tall peanut,

1288
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,200
 but it has the teeth of Jimmy Carter.

1289
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,440
 It's the second tallest peanut statue in the world.

1290
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,840
 And second tallest.

1291
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,560
 Second tallest.

1292
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,680
 Yeah, it's not the best, but it's nearly there.

1293
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,920
 And this is my favorite detail about this.

1294
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,880
 It's just a tall peanut with Jimmy Carter's teeth.

1295
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,160
 It's really weird.

1296
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,520
 But it has a large hole in its rear end.

1297
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,960
 And that allegedly was cut by the Secret Service

1298
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,880
 to ensure that there were no explosives or assassins inside it.

1299
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,560
 But why would you cut the hole to work out

1300
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,640
 if there were no explosives or assassins inside it?

1301
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,880
 If there's no hole, there are probably no assassins inside.

1302
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,120
 The peanut's bum.

1303
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,520
 Also, if you were going to put a feature of Jimmy Carter

1304
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,240
 on a peanut to make sure people knew it was him,

1305
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,680
 is the teeth the...

1306
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,200
 If you see it, you're like, oh, Jimmy Carter.

1307
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,080
 Jimmy Carter, where are we?

1308
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,680
 Oh, hang on. No, it's a big peanut.

1309
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,840
 I don't know which body part you'd put.

1310
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,880
 I don't know any specific body part of Jimmy Carter very well.

1311
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,000
 I just know him as a whole.

1312
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,560
 The largest pistachio in the world is advertised

1313
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,080
 as being a pistachio land in America.

1314
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,480
 But I found that there is a pistachio-shaped museum in Turkey

1315
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,560
 which has a larger pistachio.

1316
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,560
 And so I wrote to pistachio land to tell them

1317
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,520
 that their pistachio isn't the biggest pistachio in the world.

1318
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,080
 No reply.

1319
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,800
 Jesus Christ.

1320
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,040
 And I was so hoping to go on a trip there.

1321
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,240
 I'll never have this now.

1322
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,800
 Yeah, your face is just there with a cross.

1323
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,920
 So everywhere.

1324
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,880
 No, you out.

1325
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,280
 No, it's just a big knot with James' teeth.

1326
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,720
 Okay, listen, we need to wrap up.

1327
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,360
 That is it.

1328
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,480
 That is all of our facts.

1329
