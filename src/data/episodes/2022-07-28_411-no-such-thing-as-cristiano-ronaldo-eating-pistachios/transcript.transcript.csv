00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:22,this week coming to you live from Manchester!
00:00:22,00:00:25,(crowd cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:27,(crowd cheering)
00:00:27,00:00:39,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:39,00:00:42,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:42,00:00:44,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:44,00:00:46,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:46,00:00:49,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:49,00:00:53,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:53,00:00:56,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:56,00:00:59,"- Okay, my fact this week is that theories"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"for the origin of life on earth include,"
00:01:02,00:01:06,"primordial soup, primordial sandwich,"
00:01:06,00:01:09,"primordial soup and sandwich,"
00:01:09,00:01:14,"primordial pizza, and primordial mayonnaise."
00:01:14,00:01:16,(crowd cheering)
00:01:16,00:01:19,"- Is there a primordial salad option, please?"
00:01:19,00:01:21,(crowd laughing)
00:01:21,00:01:24,"- For a primordial vegan, yeah."
00:01:24,00:01:27,"Now, so this is, I was reading about the origin of life,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,"and I think a few people might know about primordial soup,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,that is the idea where you might get a puddle or something
00:01:33,00:01:35,"and there's loads of molecules in there,"
00:01:35,00:01:37,"and somehow they self-arrange,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,and then those self-arranged molecules
00:01:39,00:01:42,manage to replicate and they make life.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"Now, there's a lot of problems with primordial soup,"
00:01:44,00:01:46,"so people have come up with other theories,"
00:01:46,00:01:48,so how do these molecules get in the right place?
00:01:48,00:01:51,"Primordial sandwiches, you've got two rocks,"
00:01:51,00:01:54,and they kind of squish the molecules together.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"Primordial soup and sandwich,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,"you've got the soup and you've got the rocks,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,and that's all kind of all together.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"Primordial pizza, you just have a rock"
00:02:02,00:02:03,and the molecules are on top.
00:02:03,00:02:06,"- Okay, nice."
00:02:06,00:02:10,- Primordial mayonnaise is like a load of fat bubbles
00:02:10,00:02:13,and they're kind of the molecules grow in the fat bubbles.
00:02:13,00:02:14,- Right.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"- And for all light, no, none of them is true."
00:02:16,00:02:20,"- Yeah, because we all know God made us, so thank you."
00:02:20,00:02:22,- You're welcome.
00:02:22,00:02:25,- Is this one person just kind of just tossing all this shit out?
00:02:25,00:02:26,"- Yes, it's me."
00:02:26,00:02:31,"Lots of scientists have talked about all these different things,"
00:02:31,00:02:32,but I'm the one who's kind of put them together
00:02:32,00:02:34,in a jovial little sentence.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"- A menu, a nice menu."
00:02:36,00:02:38,- Have they called them those things?
00:02:38,00:02:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're real names."
00:02:40,00:02:41,"- Right, okay."
00:02:41,00:02:41,"- Yeah, yeah, they're real names."
00:02:41,00:02:43,- I didn't think you had the imagination
00:02:43,00:02:44,to come up with primordial pizza.
00:02:44,00:02:46,- Okay.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"- Is there one that's most likely, you know,"
00:02:48,00:02:49,what are we getting?
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- I think at the moment, yeah,"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"kind of the soup and sandwich is quite liked by people,"
00:02:54,00:02:55,and--
00:02:55,00:02:56,"- So it's not soup and sandwich per se,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,it's a soup sandwich.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"- It is a bit, isn't it?"
00:02:59,00:03:01,- That doesn't sound quite as appetizing as soup sandwich.
00:03:01,00:03:02,"- No, very sorry."
00:03:02,00:03:06,- So it sounds like it's a sandwich floating on some soup.
00:03:06,00:03:08,"- Primordial crouton, if you will."
00:03:08,00:03:10,"- Yes, very nice."
00:03:10,00:03:12,- I thought it was a soup in between two bits of bread.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- That's what it is, unfortunately."
00:03:14,00:03:15,"- Oh, what? - A soup sandwich."
00:03:15,00:03:19,"- Oh, that is, that's fucking out there for a theory."
00:03:19,00:03:20,"- So the idea of primordial soup,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"which was the first one of these theories,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"it was thought of, first of all,"
00:03:24,00:03:25,"by two people actually independently,"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"a British guy called JBS Haldane,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,and the Russian scientist called Alexander Operin.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"And the interesting thing about him,"
00:03:32,00:03:34,"he came up with primordial soup,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"but then later in life, he edited a book"
00:03:37,00:03:41,that contains at least 113 different recipes
00:03:41,00:03:42,for actual soup.
00:03:42,00:03:44,(laughing)
00:03:44,00:03:46,"- It makes you suspicious about the primordial soup theory,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,'cause it sounds like he's just really into soup.
00:03:48,00:03:52,"- Yeah, he's just pushing his next career."
00:03:52,00:03:54,It's such a weird switcheroo
00:03:54,00:03:56,to go from proper organic chemistry stuff
00:03:56,00:03:58,to editing a cookbook.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"- Yes, it would be weird,"
00:04:00,00:04:01,"apart from it was in the Soviet Union,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,and all sorts of weird stuff was happening.
00:04:03,00:04:06,"Basically, they had this kind of propaganda cookbook"
00:04:06,00:04:07,"that they would give to all,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"well, all married couples would get one, basically."
00:04:09,00:04:12,"You know, it was the right kind of Soviet food"
00:04:12,00:04:13,that you should be eating.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"And at the time, they'd just done Sputnik,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,and they were kind of pushing themselves
00:04:17,00:04:18,"as scientists in the Soviet Union,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"as best scientists in the world,"
00:04:20,00:04:21,"and they thought, well, our cookbook"
00:04:21,00:04:23,"should also be really scientific,"
00:04:23,00:04:25,so we're gonna get our best scientist
00:04:25,00:04:26,"who's this guy operating,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,and we're gonna say you're gonna edit it.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"- That makes sense. - That's interesting, yeah."
00:04:29,00:04:32,- That's like that Michelin bloke who makes foam shit.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"He's been just, yeah, exactly, Blumenthal."
00:04:34,00:04:35,"- Hester Blumenthal, yeah."
00:04:35,00:04:36,- Is it like him?
00:04:36,00:04:38,"- Yeah, he basically does chemistry, doesn't he?"
00:04:38,00:04:39,- It's like him.
00:04:39,00:04:39,- It's like him.
00:04:39,00:04:42,- Professor Stephen Hawkins did a cookbook.
00:04:42,00:04:43,- Right. - Okay.
00:04:43,00:04:46,- I thought you meant the actual Michelin man
00:04:46,00:04:49,"when you said that, and really threw me for a second."
00:04:49,00:04:51,"- Yeah, a lot of marshmallow-based stuff."
00:04:51,00:04:52,"That cookbook, by the way,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"it was called The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"that was its name, and it was published in 1939,"
00:04:57,00:04:58,"and as you said, changed."
00:04:58,00:05:00,"It's all kind of like 400 different recipes,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"all good Soviet fare,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,"but unfortunately, 'cause it was the Soviet Union,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"the book kept on being perched,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,and so there were all these
00:05:07,00:05:11,"like strongly radical changes in direction,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,"so it used to be a very internationalist book,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"and then that went out of fashion,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,and so they just cut all the international stuff.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"- It's borscht, every page borscht."
00:05:19,00:05:21,"- It was kind of, yeah."
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- Yeah, and then there were lots of quotes"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"from Stalin all the way through the book,"
00:05:24,00:05:25,and then Stalin died in 1953.
00:05:25,00:05:28,"Cut, all Stalin quotes gone through the book, really."
00:05:28,00:05:30,"- Yeah, I must say, I know that there's at least"
00:05:30,00:05:32,"113 different recipes for soup,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"because I read through the book,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"and just searched for the word soup, or borscht,"
00:05:36,00:05:39,"or we all know whatever, and that's as many as I found."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"There might be more for all I know, but yeah."
00:05:41,00:05:42,- Wow.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- And yeah, this was a really important book,"
00:05:44,00:05:47,"like you say, it was the book of tasty and healthy food,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,"but sometimes just known as Kniga, just the book."
00:05:50,00:05:52,"That's how famous it was, this book,"
00:05:52,00:05:53,"it just called the book,"
00:05:53,00:05:54,and everyone knew what you were talking about.
00:05:54,00:05:55,"- Oh, that's awesome."
00:05:55,00:05:56,"- Oh, wow."
00:05:56,00:05:58,"- Hey, does that old thing,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"it's a sort of a thing that Einstein said,"
00:06:01,00:06:04,"which was, he said that his second best idea"
00:06:04,00:06:08,"that he ever had was to boil his eggs in soup,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,"because then you're saving up on some washing up,"
00:06:11,00:06:12,you're using one less thing.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"- And you know, that's a thing that I think--"
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Is that good though?
00:06:15,00:06:17,It feels like you get like an egg's come out
00:06:17,00:06:18,"of a chicken's bum, right?"
00:06:18,00:06:19,- Yeah.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- Well, not technically, actually, interestingly."
00:06:21,00:06:22,- Okay.
00:06:22,00:06:23,- But close.
00:06:23,00:06:24,I'll tell you later.
00:06:24,00:06:26,- It's come out of the same place
00:06:26,00:06:28,"as the feces come, right?"
00:06:28,00:06:28,- That's a good point.
00:06:28,00:06:30,- And so do you really want that in your soup?
00:06:30,00:06:31,- That's a very good point.
00:06:31,00:06:34,"- When you boil stuff, it gets rid of all the stuff in it."
00:06:34,00:06:36,"- Yeah, but you're not gonna do a shit in your hinds,"
00:06:36,00:06:37,are you?
00:06:37,00:06:39,(audience laughing)
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- Good, that could take off as a saying though."
00:06:42,00:06:44,- He's really shot the hinds today.
00:06:44,00:06:45,(audience laughing)
00:06:45,00:06:48,"- Actually, there is a thing called yellow soup,"
00:06:48,00:06:50,"which is basically-- - Yes, yellow soup."
00:06:50,00:06:54,"- Poin soup, which was a delicacy in China,"
00:06:54,00:06:55,back a long time ago.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"So I think it was in the fourth century,"
00:06:57,00:06:58,"there was a Chinese recipe for yellow soup,"
00:06:58,00:07:01,"very popular, it was put forward by a doctor,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,"and he said, this guy called Guihong,"
00:07:04,00:07:06,gave this recipe for broth that involved drying
00:07:06,00:07:10,"and fermenting a healthy person's poo,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"and stirring it into a broth,"
00:07:12,00:07:13,"and then you give it to a sick person,"
00:07:13,00:07:14,and it makes them better.
00:07:14,00:07:16,"And of course, the good thing about that is--"
00:07:16,00:07:17,"- Oh, that could work."
00:07:17,00:07:18,- It bloody works.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"- Yeah, really."
00:07:19,00:07:22,- We've discovered now with fecal transplants these days.
00:07:22,00:07:23,"- I mean, sorry."
00:07:23,00:07:25,"Could we just row back on the whole ""it works"" thing?"
00:07:25,00:07:26,(audience laughing)
00:07:26,00:07:28,This doesn't sound like that would have worked.
00:07:28,00:07:29,- It probably didn't work.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"He had the right idea though,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,I think he was on the right track.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Yeah, yellow soup, worth a try, I would say."
00:07:35,00:07:36,- There are enough.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"- Don't boil it too much,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,otherwise you might lose the microorganisms
00:07:39,00:07:40,for the transplant.
00:07:40,00:07:41,- Yeah.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"- Well, you should have called it brown Windsor."
00:07:43,00:07:44,(audience laughing)
00:07:44,00:07:46,But that was already a soup.
00:07:46,00:07:47,- Is it?
00:07:47,00:07:48,"- 1,500 years later."
00:07:48,00:07:49,(audience laughing)
00:07:49,00:07:50,Brown soup was a really weird soup.
00:07:50,00:07:51,It was this sort of mythical soup.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"It wasn't mythical, it was real,"
00:07:53,00:07:54,but it wasn't in many places.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"It was just sort of a horrible, cheap soup"
00:07:56,00:07:57,that was in lots of restaurants
00:07:57,00:07:59,around the turn of the 20th century.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"And it kind of had a posh name,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"so it sounded classy,"
00:08:02,00:08:03,"but it was basically leftover meat,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,and the ingredients were--
00:08:05,00:08:07,"- Sorry, was it called brown soup?"
00:08:07,00:08:08,- Brown Windsor.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"- Brown Windsor, sorry, posh name."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"'Cause brown is not a posh thing,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,but once you put it next to Windsor.
00:08:12,00:08:13,- Isn't that gruel?
00:08:13,00:08:15,That sounds like gruel.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"It's not gruel, it's definitely soup."
00:08:17,00:08:18,- Hmm.
00:08:18,00:08:19,- Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:20,- What do you think it sounds like?
00:08:20,00:08:21,- What a spectrum we're on now
00:08:21,00:08:23,"between gruel, soup, broths, stew, you know."
00:08:23,00:08:24,"Well, I had gruel."
00:08:24,00:08:25,Have you had gruel?
00:08:25,00:08:26,"- It's just like porridge, isn't it?"
00:08:26,00:08:27,Just like porridge.
00:08:27,00:08:28,- That's why I thought it was.
00:08:28,00:08:29,- What do you mean by having gruel?
00:08:29,00:08:30,- What are you talking about?
00:08:30,00:08:31,It's not what I think.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"- Oh, you were living with Mr. Bumble."
00:08:33,00:08:36,(audience laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:37,"Oh, God, that sounded so rough."
00:08:37,00:08:39,- I can't believe how badly you bullied Oliver.
00:08:39,00:08:40,That was harsh.
00:08:40,00:08:41,- Yeah.
00:08:41,00:08:43,Did you ever get that second helping that you wanted?
00:08:43,00:08:44,(audience laughing)
00:08:44,00:08:47,"- I had gruel, and I'm not sure that many people have gruel."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- When did you have it, and what was it?"
00:08:49,00:08:51,"- Oh, I went to this party where the table,"
00:08:51,00:08:53,"you had to play a game,"
00:08:53,00:08:55,"and on one side of the table was really good food,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,and on the other side was gruel.
00:08:57,00:08:59,And so it was like the worst kind of food.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"And if you lost the game, you moved down a seat,"
00:09:01,00:09:02,and you went all the way down.
00:09:02,00:09:05,And I had a partner who desperately wanted to go
00:09:05,00:09:08,"to the good food, as everyone else did."
00:09:08,00:09:11,"But I'd never had gruel before, so I was like,"
00:09:11,00:09:12,"surely we gotta head that way,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"and I kept making us go that way,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,and she threw an entire glass of red wine
00:09:17,00:09:18,all over my shirt.
00:09:18,00:09:19,- Whoa.
00:09:19,00:09:20,"- Yeah, you know, like in the movies."
00:09:20,00:09:21,- That's an overreaction.
00:09:21,00:09:22,"- Did you get to eat, taste it, though?"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"- I did, and you enjoyed it."
00:09:24,00:09:24,It was horrific.
00:09:24,00:09:27,It was the worst thing I've ever tasted.
00:09:27,00:09:28,It sounds like Brown Windsor.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- I thought you were gonna say
00:09:29,00:09:31,that you kissed a gruel and you liked it.
00:09:31,00:09:34,(audience laughing)
00:09:34,00:09:36,The room's been divided.
00:09:36,00:09:38,(audience laughing)
00:09:38,00:09:41,"I'm just soup, or could, maybe, cure malaria."
00:09:41,00:09:45,"Which is a big deal, 'cause it's a big old killer."
00:09:45,00:09:49,And this was discovered by some school children.
00:09:49,00:09:52,"So, and this was in a study that was authored"
00:09:52,00:09:52,by school children.
00:09:52,00:09:54,It's the only study I've ever found authored
00:09:54,00:09:55,by school children.
00:09:55,00:09:57,And it was a really short time ago.
00:09:57,00:10:00,There's a parent at a local school in London
00:10:00,00:10:02,"called Jake Baum, and he also happened to be"
00:10:02,00:10:04,a professor of cell biology.
00:10:04,00:10:05,And he decided it would be fun
00:10:05,00:10:07,to suggest a class project where all the kids
00:10:07,00:10:10,brought in a vial of the soup that their mom made them
00:10:10,00:10:12,"or their dad made them whenever they were sick,"
00:10:12,00:10:13,whenever they were ill.
00:10:13,00:10:16,"And then he'd suggested that in their science class,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,"the science teacher must have hated this parent,"
00:10:18,00:10:20,he suggested they spin out all the soups
00:10:20,00:10:22,"in the centrifuge, which I guess the school"
00:10:22,00:10:23,"then had to invest in,"
00:10:23,00:10:27,and then test them on a malaria parasite.
00:10:27,00:10:30,"And see, because soup, traditionally chicken soup,"
00:10:30,00:10:31,"is supposed to make you feel better,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,"there must be something in it, it's this old wives thing."
00:10:33,00:10:37,And they did indeed find that five of the soups
00:10:37,00:10:39,reduced the growth or the sexual development
00:10:39,00:10:41,"of the parasites by over 50%,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,which is exactly the same as malaria drugs.
00:10:43,00:10:45,- Wow. - Isn't that incredible?
00:10:45,00:10:48,"- So what, do we have to inject ourselves with this soup?"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"- We would, but the problem is,"
00:10:50,00:10:53,so this was published in the Archives of Disease and Childhood
00:10:53,00:10:57,"in 2019, but none of the parents had written down"
00:10:57,00:10:59,the ingredients of any of the soups they sent in.
00:10:59,00:11:00,- Oh no.
00:11:00,00:11:02,- So we have no idea.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"- Just inject any soup into yourself, just in case."
00:11:05,00:11:07,- My soup has got paracetamol in it.
00:11:07,00:11:08,"- Yeah. - It's got, yeah."
00:11:08,00:11:09,- Yeah.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- That's hilarious.
00:11:10,00:11:14,"- Do you know in 1782, if you were in Haymarket in London,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,that you could pay your very own money
00:11:16,00:11:19,to go and have a bath in some soup?
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- Oh, wow. - Yeah."
00:11:20,00:11:23,This was a thing in the 17th and 18th century
00:11:23,00:11:26,"in the whole of Europe, not just in the UK,"
00:11:26,00:11:29,that people just seemed to bathe in soups.
00:11:29,00:11:29,- Wow. - Really?
00:11:29,00:11:31,"- And it was supposed to be good for you,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,"it was supposed to like, you know, there's very healthy,"
00:11:33,00:11:34,"instead of just normal water,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,you were getting some of the vitamins into your body.
00:11:36,00:11:39,"- What flavor, any particular?"
00:11:39,00:11:41,- Veal or other broths.
00:11:41,00:11:43,So that could be literally anything.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"- Yeah, would you rather a bowl of soup"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"that had a chicken's pooey egg sitting inside it,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,"yep, or a bowl of soup with Andy sitting inside it."
00:11:53,00:11:56,(laughing)
00:11:56,00:11:57,- What flavor is the soup?
00:11:59,00:12:02,"- Wow, tomato, let's say."
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- Oh, no, I don't really like tomato soup."
00:12:04,00:12:07,"- Okay, goes great with Andy though, so."
00:12:07,00:12:08,(laughing)
00:12:08,00:12:11,"- I get your point, yeah, definitely."
00:12:11,00:12:13,"- That's weird, 'cause I've never, you know,"
00:12:13,00:12:16,"you read novels written in the 19th century, 18th century,"
00:12:16,00:12:18,and never once have any of the characters
00:12:18,00:12:21,been described as bathing in a tomato soup.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"- That's 'cause it's so cotidious,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"it's like everyone was doing it all the time,"
00:12:25,00:12:26,"it's like, why even write it in the novels?"
00:12:26,00:12:28,"- Got it, it's like, front of cleaning your teeth."
00:12:28,00:12:30,"- But the other thing is that at the moment,"
00:12:30,00:12:34,"in the UNESEN spa resort in Hakone in Japan,"
00:12:34,00:12:36,you can go into a ramen bath.
00:12:36,00:12:39,"So it's still happening in Japan, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:39,00:12:42,Apparently the collagen in the pork broth
00:12:42,00:12:44,is supposed to give you healthier skin.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"- You would not eat in that spa restaurant afterwards though,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,would you?
00:12:48,00:12:49,- You piece is vicious.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- 'Cause if we didn't need to move on though
00:12:50,00:12:53,"to our second fact, it is time for fact number two,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"and that is my fact, my fact this week,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,is that the world's oldest postcard
00:12:58,00:13:01,was sent by a writer called Theodore Hook.
00:13:01,00:13:04,He sent it to himself.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"- Wow. - Yeah, Theodore."
00:13:06,00:13:08,"- What did he say, wish I was here?"
00:13:08,00:13:09,(laughing)
00:13:09,00:13:12,"- So it was sent in 1840,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"and it was sent in London, in Fulham,"
00:13:14,00:13:17,and it was a postcard where you could see people
00:13:17,00:13:21,"who were working at the post office around a big inkwell,"
00:13:21,00:13:25,and the idea was that that was satirizing the post system.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"So he sent it to himself,"
00:13:27,00:13:29,so that means the only other person who's seen it
00:13:29,00:13:30,"would have been the postman, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:31,"- Yes, exactly."
00:13:31,00:13:33,- And you'll see there's something you bastard.
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Yeah. - Is that the idea?
00:13:34,00:13:37,"- Yeah, exactly, and it was, you know,"
00:13:37,00:13:38,"there wasn't a big laugh here,"
00:13:38,00:13:39,"but back in the day, that was huge satire."
00:13:39,00:13:42,(laughing)
00:13:42,00:13:44,I would have had people on the floor.
00:13:44,00:13:49,"So yeah, and so there was other postcards"
00:13:49,00:13:50,"thought to be the oldest, and then this came up"
00:13:50,00:13:54,"in an auction, and it sold for including commission"
00:13:54,00:13:56,"and VAT, 31,000 pounds, 750."
00:13:56,00:13:58,"- Wow. - So it's, yeah,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,"a really expensive item, and I think partially as well"
00:14:00,00:14:03,because Theodore Hook was quite an amazing prankster
00:14:03,00:14:04,of the 1800s.
00:14:04,00:14:08,"He achieved what is known as the Burner Street hoax,"
00:14:08,00:14:11,which was one of the greatest hoaxes that London ever had.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"It was a hoax where he said to his friend,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,"""I bet you I can make one single house,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,"""the most famous house in London,"""
00:14:18,00:14:22,"and they bet some money on it, and he said, ""Go for it,"""
00:14:22,00:14:23,and he managed to do it.
00:14:23,00:14:25,So what he did was he sent out thousands of letters
00:14:25,00:14:28,"to people, workmen, all over the country,"
00:14:28,00:14:32,"and said, ""Can you arrive on the morning of this day,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,"""August 27th, in order to do something to the house?"""
00:14:35,00:14:37,So this one woman opened up her door
00:14:37,00:14:40,"on the morning of August 27th to a chimney sweep,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"and she said, ""I didn't order a chimney sweep,"""
00:14:42,00:14:43,when she turned in away.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"Then another chimney sweep came, and she turned him away."
00:14:46,00:14:48,"10 more chimney sweeps came, turned away."
00:14:48,00:14:51,"Then carts carrying large deliveries of cold came,"
00:14:51,00:14:52,turned them away.
00:14:52,00:14:55,Then cake makers delivering large wedding cakes.
00:14:55,00:14:57,Then doctors and lawyers came.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"There were vickers, there were fishmongers."
00:15:00,00:15:01,"It was just getting bigger and bigger,"
00:15:01,00:15:04,and eventually the Duke of York came along.
00:15:04,00:15:06,"There was the Governor of the Bank of England,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,the Archbishop of Canterbury came along.
00:15:08,00:15:10,- No! - Yes!
00:15:10,00:15:12,"And you know, this is, there's a lot of like,"
00:15:12,00:15:13,what's real and not real in this story
00:15:13,00:15:14,through the passage of time.
00:15:14,00:15:16,Imagine opening your door and seeing
00:15:16,00:15:18,the Duke of York outside.
00:15:18,00:15:19,I think we can all agree.
00:15:19,00:15:21,(audience laughing)
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- That is, this was 1889."
00:15:23,00:15:25,- Maybe he was just delivering some pizza expressed.
00:15:25,00:15:29,(audience laughing)
00:15:29,00:15:30,- This just sounds like when you're at home
00:15:30,00:15:31,"in the middle of a Wednesday,"
00:15:31,00:15:33,"and all of your neighbours are out,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,"and then your host one knocks on the door,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,"and he goes, ""Can you take number 10s?"
00:15:37,00:15:38,"""Can you take number 12s?"
00:15:38,00:15:39,"""Can you, you know, 79 packages?"""
00:15:39,00:15:40,"- No, he was a crazy guy."
00:15:40,00:15:42,"- And the thing was that he just,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"they randomly chose that house, didn't they?"
00:15:44,00:15:46,"It was literally, they just went through a phone book"
00:15:46,00:15:47,"if there was one in the day,"
00:15:47,00:15:48,"or whatever the equivalent was,"
00:15:48,00:15:49,"and went, ""Oh, let's just choose that house."""
00:15:49,00:15:51,"So she had nothing to do with it, and--"
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Oh, she had no idea."
00:15:52,00:15:54,"Yeah, she was absolutely befuddled."
00:15:54,00:15:56,And so this was 1809.
00:15:56,00:15:58,So this was a number of years before the postcard was sent.
00:15:58,00:16:01,"And so by this time, when the postcard went out,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"and it saw that it had Theodore Hook's name on it,"
00:16:03,00:16:06,it was assumed he must have been sending it to himself
00:16:06,00:16:07,as part of a prank.
00:16:07,00:16:09,We don't actually know that he sent it to himself.
00:16:09,00:16:10,That's the assumption.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"- But it is correct, 'cause it will be weird"
00:16:12,00:16:13,"to receive the first ever postcard,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"'cause you wouldn't know what it was, really."
00:16:15,00:16:17,It would be a baffling thing to experience.
00:16:17,00:16:17,"- You're right, yeah."
00:16:17,00:16:18,- But you'd figure it out.
00:16:18,00:16:19,It's not like--
00:16:19,00:16:21,"- No, this is 1840."
00:16:21,00:16:22,You'd go insane.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- But wait a minute.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- He likes your wits permanently.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"- I know what you're saying,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,but this is just the one-off he sent it to himself.
00:16:28,00:16:30,So someone else must have been the first person
00:16:30,00:16:32,"to get a postcard, right?"
00:16:32,00:16:32,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:32,00:16:35,- They all ended up in as islands back in the day.
00:16:35,00:16:38,They were populated by postcard recipients.
00:16:38,00:16:42,"- History of the postcard is amazing,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"because they were invented in the late 19th century,"
00:16:44,00:16:45,"and they sort of, you know,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,there were various stages of innovation.
00:16:47,00:16:51,The biggest innovation came in the divided back period.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"Sorry, it was known as the divided back period,"
00:16:53,00:16:56,"which is where, finally, for the first time ever,"
00:16:56,00:16:57,"you get a picture on one side,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,and then the back of the card is divided
00:16:59,00:17:01,"into address and message, right?"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"Before that, one whole side had to be"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"for the address and the stamp, it was serious,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,and then the message had to go on the other side
00:17:07,00:17:09,"next to the picture, nightmare."
00:17:09,00:17:12,"Once you got nice picture postcards,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,it took off like nothing had ever done before.
00:17:15,00:17:16,It was incredible.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"In 2010, in the UK, 800 million postcards were sent."
00:17:19,00:17:21,And the population's all lower than it is now.
00:17:21,00:17:23,That is a lot of people postcards per person being sent.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"- I think it was 25 postcards per person per year,"
00:17:26,00:17:28,around about that time.
00:17:28,00:17:29,- I think a lot of people were doing
00:17:29,00:17:30,a lot of postcarding as well.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"It wasn't everyone was doing that, was it?"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"It was like some people were sending three a day,"
00:17:34,00:17:35,"four a day, stuff like that."
00:17:35,00:17:37,"- It makes sense, right?"
00:17:37,00:17:40,"- You had like four or five posts every day, didn't you?"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"So you could send, I could send you a postcard,"
00:17:43,00:17:45,"and you're saying, ""What the fuck are you doing in my soup?"""
00:17:45,00:17:48,"And then the same day, you could send one back."
00:17:48,00:17:51,"Like saying, ""I'm just having a nice time, thank you."""
00:17:51,00:17:52,Or whatever.
00:17:52,00:17:53,- I'm here for my health.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:54,00:17:56,"- So it was, we know the exact date."
00:17:56,00:18:00,"March 1st, 1907, was the official birth of the modern postcard"
00:18:00,00:18:03,when they put that singular line down the middle
00:18:03,00:18:06,that separated message from it anywhere in time.
00:18:06,00:18:07,- Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:09,- I would go there.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- The reason that they did that, of course,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,is because what they thought was if you put the message
00:18:14,00:18:17,"and the address on the same side, then in the post office,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,they would just get distracted by reading all of the messages.
00:18:20,00:18:21,"- Yeah, right."
00:18:21,00:18:23,- Or there might be some sexy messages in there
00:18:23,00:18:24,and they'd get embarrassed.
00:18:24,00:18:25,"- Yeah, they were a bit scandalous."
00:18:25,00:18:27,People objected to postcards back in the day
00:18:27,00:18:30,because of this idea that the postman or woman
00:18:30,00:18:33,could read all of your dirty secrets.
00:18:33,00:18:34,"And in fact, aside from that,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,there was lots of other controversies.
00:18:36,00:18:40,So they were thought of as killing the art of writing
00:18:40,00:18:41,"because, you know, they're short form."
00:18:41,00:18:43,They were basically the text messages of their day.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"There was an article written in 1884,"
00:18:44,00:18:47,"so quite soon after postcards had taken off,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"saying, ""Who nowadays writes letters?"
00:18:49,00:18:53,"""We all dash off hasty notes or horribly scribbler postcard."
00:18:53,00:18:56,"""The epistolary art so dear to our grandmothers"
00:18:56,00:18:57,"""is becoming extinct."""
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And that's 150 years ago, they were whinging about that"
00:19:00,00:19:01,and they haven't shut up.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"- Well, yeah, it was true."
00:19:04,00:19:05,- Winky face.
00:19:05,00:19:10,"- You know, you could get postcards made of moss"
00:19:10,00:19:10,back in the day.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"- Oh, for fuck's sake."
00:19:11,00:19:14,"- Sorry, just a little moss fact here."
00:19:14,00:19:16,"Someone made of wood, but Birchbark,"
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Canada had leather ones,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,and Ireland had cards made of peat moss.
00:19:20,00:19:21,- Wow. - How do you write on that?
00:19:21,00:19:23,- They processed the peat moss in some way
00:19:23,00:19:24,to make it that you could write on it.
00:19:24,00:19:25,- That makes sense. - How?
00:19:25,00:19:26,"I don't know, but nonetheless."
00:19:26,00:19:28,"- They banned those in America, I think."
00:19:28,00:19:29,"I'm not sure about the moss ones,"
00:19:29,00:19:31,but definitely the wood ones they banned in America.
00:19:31,00:19:34,You could only send paper or cardboard ones.
00:19:34,00:19:36,That's 'cause they jammed the post machines.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"So they had leather ones, they had wood ones,"
00:19:39,00:19:39,like you said.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"And the thing is about the wood ones,"
00:19:41,00:19:44,they tended to have really terrible jokes on them.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"So like, you might go to an exposition about wood"
00:19:46,00:19:49,"or something and get a wooden postcard,"
00:19:49,00:19:53,"and it would say, ""The exposition is more than oak A."""
00:19:53,00:19:55,- Right.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"- ""It's ash tonishing."
00:19:57,00:19:59,(audience laughs)
00:19:59,00:20:02,"""I would spruce up and come."
00:20:02,00:20:04,"""You will not regret it."""
00:20:04,00:20:06,- Is that you will not regret it?
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- You know what it wasn't, they missed that one."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"- Lazy, a trick missed."
00:20:10,00:20:12,(audience laughs)
00:20:12,00:20:14,"- Well, that's what you get for going to a wood symposium,"
00:20:14,00:20:15,I'm gonna say.
00:20:15,00:20:16,(audience laughs)
00:20:16,00:20:18,- We do need to talk about the saucy seaside postcard.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"I'm sorry, we have to."
00:20:19,00:20:20,- What is it?
00:20:20,00:20:23,- The saucy seaside postcard is a great institution
00:20:23,00:20:26,"of the 20th century, which is just a slightly rude postcard"
00:20:26,00:20:29,"with a slightly funny or saucy, saucy, I don't think, yeah."
00:20:29,00:20:30,- You'd recognise them.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"They're always like, box and women bursting out"
00:20:33,00:20:35,"of red swimming costumes, a very '50s style"
00:20:35,00:20:37,"with a raunchy, rude comment underneath."
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- Okay, cool."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"- Thank you, yeah, exactly."
00:20:39,00:20:40,So kind of-- - Saucy.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"- Saucy, I've never said the word saucy"
00:20:42,00:20:44,"so many times in my life, but I love it."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And basically, one artist in particular,"
00:20:47,00:20:51,"Donald McGill, was one of the great artists of this."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"He did about nine a week until he died, it was incredible."
00:20:54,00:20:58,But there was trouble because there were seaside censorship
00:20:58,00:21:01,boards which assessed the sauciness of the postcards
00:21:01,00:21:04,and banned them if they were too rude.
00:21:04,00:21:06,So there was a blackpool board that you had to submit
00:21:06,00:21:09,all your postcards to before they could go on sale.
00:21:09,00:21:10,There was another on the Isle of Wight.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"And the members were things like there was a solicitor,"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"a vicar, a bank manager, and Mrs. Gloria Swanson"
00:21:16,00:21:18,of the Blackpool Hotel and Boarding House Association.
00:21:18,00:21:20,And they would sit in judgment over the postcards.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"And if you had one, for example,"
00:21:22,00:21:25,there's one of a girl talking to a bookie at a race course
00:21:25,00:21:28,"and she's saying, I want to back the favourite, please."
00:21:28,00:21:31,"My sweetheart gave me a pound to do it both ways, okay?"
00:21:31,00:21:34,"That's, I think that's a good joke."
00:21:34,00:21:38,"But Mrs. Gloria Swanson, absolutely not, banned."
00:21:38,00:21:41,And these kept going until the Isle of Man Committee
00:21:41,00:21:43,lasted until 1989. Wow.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"1989. But then he got cancelled, basically, didn't he?"
00:21:46,00:21:49,"Yeah, he did. In the '50s, really, wasn't it?"
00:21:49,00:21:50,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:50,00:21:52,"When they properly just clamped down,"
00:21:52,00:21:55,he was found guilty of breaking the Obscene Publications Act
00:21:55,00:21:57,"and, you know, fined and..."
00:21:57,00:21:58,Incredible.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Reputation destroyed, very sad."
00:22:01,00:22:02,And then went bankrupt.
00:22:02,00:22:04,And also the other weird thing that we should mention about him
00:22:04,00:22:06,is that he only had one foot.
00:22:06,00:22:11,"OK. And he lost his foot, his other foot, in a rugby accident."
00:22:11,00:22:13,Ah! Which I didn't know was even possible.
00:22:13,00:22:14,"But, yeah."
00:22:14,00:22:16,"Just on the sort of censorship thing,"
00:22:16,00:22:18,that was a thing not just for postcards.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"I'm sure I must have mentioned it on the podcast a long time ago,"
00:22:21,00:22:25,"but the lead singer of Pet Shop Boys, Neil Tennant,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"I think his name is, he used to work for Marvel"
00:22:27,00:22:31,"and his job was whenever comic books came in,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,he would have to cover up the cleavage line
00:22:33,00:22:35,"on women that were acceptable in America,"
00:22:35,00:22:39,"but not here. I mean, that was, you know, in the '70s and '80s."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Yeah. It was good work, if you could get it."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"He wouldn't say no to that job, it was a 15-year-old intern."
00:22:44,00:22:46,He'd be loving that.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"You know, the other amazing thing about postcards"
00:22:48,00:22:52,"is that back in the day, it was the source of, sometimes,"
00:22:52,00:22:59,allowing you to see an image that you would otherwise have never seen.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"So newspapers, back in the day, let's say in American newspapers,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,largely completely text-based.
00:23:04,00:23:07,"So if it said something like, ""An accident, train crashes,"""
00:23:07,00:23:09,"or something where you might rubber-neck it, you know,"
00:23:09,00:23:12,"it's like, ""I'm curious to see a disaster,"""
00:23:12,00:23:15,a photo would be taken and it would be printed onto these postcards
00:23:15,00:23:17,and people would send each other these postcards
00:23:17,00:23:21,just to show them a news event as opposed to having anything to say.
00:23:21,00:23:24,So it became a huge source of being able to just-- source--
00:23:24,00:23:28,being able to see everything that was happening in the world
00:23:28,00:23:30,prior to newspapers allowing us to do that.
00:23:30,00:23:32,"It was basically Twitter, wasn't it?"
00:23:32,00:23:35,"Or text message, that kind of thing WhatsApp, that kind of thing."
00:23:35,00:23:38,It was just like people sharing information.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"It was quite weird, though, when people used to send postcards"
00:23:40,00:23:43,of burning buildings and screaming car crash victims
00:23:43,00:23:46,"and then they wrote on the back, ""Wish you were here."""
00:23:46,00:23:48,It was an odd time.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"But there was, like, political stuff as well, wasn't there?"
00:23:50,00:23:54,"Like, the suffrage movement, there was a big battle of postcards of that."
00:23:54,00:23:57,So there were a lot of anti-suffrage postcards
00:23:57,00:24:01,"where they would, like, mock the suffragettes and say, you know,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"""If you're a suffragette, you'll never get married,"" all that kind of thing."
00:24:04,00:24:06,And then there were pro-suffragette postcards
00:24:06,00:24:09,"where you would have, like, really iconic women on them"
00:24:09,00:24:11,and try and push people in that direction.
00:24:11,00:24:14,And often both types were made by the same company.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"-Right. -Ah, Claire."
00:24:16,00:24:18,-No ways. -We're gonna have to move on.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"-Say it, guys. -I don't think the suffragettes"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"would have approved of that, Joe, Captain."
00:24:22,00:24:23,Not sure I've approved of it.
00:24:23,00:24:28,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:24:28,00:24:31,My fact is that the first man to kill people by guillotine
00:24:31,00:24:35,was briefly so fashionable that French people would dress up as him.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Mm-hmm.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"It's called Charles-Henry Sanson,"
00:24:38,00:24:41,"and he was the chief executioner to Louis XVI,"
00:24:41,00:24:45,and then he was the executioner of Louis XVI
00:24:45,00:24:48,in a very weird job switcheroo.
00:24:48,00:24:50,(LAUGHTER)
00:24:50,00:24:52,"It was like, ""Undercover boss,"" it's like."
00:24:52,00:24:55,(LAUGHTER)
00:24:55,00:24:57,"Well, that went wrong."
00:24:57,00:25:00,(LAUGHTER)
00:25:00,00:25:02,"Yeah, and the French Revolution, obviously,"
00:25:02,00:25:06,"that was a time of great social change, to put it mildly."
00:25:06,00:25:10,"And he was very famous during the period known as ""The Terror,"""
00:25:10,00:25:12,"and he had this uniform, it was stripy trousers,"
00:25:12,00:25:14,"a tricorne hat, green coat, quite dashing,"
00:25:14,00:25:17,and he was just so fashionable in Paris at the time
00:25:17,00:25:19,that he became someone people dressed up as him.
00:25:19,00:25:22,And fashionable because of his awesome stripy trousers
00:25:22,00:25:24,"and tricorne hat, or because of what he was doing."
00:25:24,00:25:26,I think 'cause the guillotine was a thing.
00:25:26,00:25:28,"I actually am. I'm not so sure, actually,"
00:25:28,00:25:31,"because he was really, really fashionable, like you say."
00:25:31,00:25:34,"He wore blue trousers to set off with,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,but they were so worried about him being so fashionable
00:25:37,00:25:40,that they banned him from wearing blue trousers.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"And from then on, he was only allowed to wear green trousers."
00:25:43,00:25:45,"And they said, ""The blue is the colour of the nobility,"
00:25:45,00:25:46,"""you're not allowed to wear them."""
00:25:46,00:25:48,Right. Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:50,You'd think if the French Revolutionary Committee
00:25:50,00:25:52,were telling you off for dressing as the nobility.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Pre-pre-revolutionary, you're kidding me."
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Oh, OK, that's fair enough. Right, let's see."
00:25:56,00:25:58,"But it seems like... It was not fair enough, it's bad."
00:25:58,00:26:00,"I don't approve of the Louis XVI, all the French Revolution."
00:26:00,00:26:02,We know what side you're on now.
00:26:02,00:26:04,"No, it's fine. Come on."
00:26:04,00:26:05,"But the early days of it,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"there did seem to be a bit of colour coordination going on,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,and the colour being red.
00:26:09,00:26:13,So the account that I read was you had the person
00:26:13,00:26:16,who was about to be killed had a red T-shirt on.
00:26:16,00:26:19,T-shirt. Yeah. Cool.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"They had some converse, didn't they?"
00:26:21,00:26:23,It's like fashion.
00:26:23,00:26:27,"Is it in Star Trek where all the red people die, or am I...?"
00:26:27,00:26:31,"Ah, yes, I'm so far out of my comfort zone here."
00:26:31,00:26:33,"Yeah, so he had a red T-shirt on."
00:26:33,00:26:35,He had Nike cap.
00:26:35,00:26:37,Can we just give it some time-appropriate names?
00:26:37,00:26:39,So what did they wear back then?
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Just no T, I think."
00:26:41,00:26:43,"Ah. OK, so..."
00:26:43,00:26:46,"Wow, that's very panicky to pick that up."
00:26:46,00:26:49,The T-shirt was invented in the 20th century.
00:26:49,00:26:53,It's a very anachronistic thing to hear T-shirts in the French Revolution.
00:26:53,00:26:55,People are going to think that happens in Australia.
00:26:55,00:26:57,Or did I just bust a time-traveler?
00:26:57,00:26:58,"OK, that's..."
00:26:58,00:27:00,What colour were his jeans?
00:27:00,00:27:03,LAUGHTER
00:27:03,00:27:07,"So he had a red shirt on, and the..."
00:27:07,00:27:10,And Charles... Is that his name? Charles?
00:27:10,00:27:14,"He had a cape on, which was red, and the guillotine itself was red."
00:27:14,00:27:16,So red was very much the dominant theme.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"Well, I guess it doesn't show the stains."
00:27:19,00:27:23,Was the guillotine definitely red pre-execution?
00:27:23,00:27:25,It wasn't just...
00:27:25,00:27:27,"I think this was for the very first, yeah, execution."
00:27:27,00:27:29,I guess maybe they were just trying to hide the gore.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"And unfortunately, when they did it, it was because this was new,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,"and they had huge crowds that came to see it,"
00:27:35,00:27:38,"because everyone was so fascinated by all of these public deaths,"
00:27:38,00:27:40,"the crowds were really disappointed,"
00:27:40,00:27:43,because it was really efficient and quick and over like that.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"And they were like, ""Ah, we brought sandwiches."""
00:27:45,00:27:49,"We were going to be here a while, and it was just like,"
00:27:49,00:27:52,"""Ah, it was too efficient, you've got two stars."""
00:27:52,00:27:54,People rioted. Three people died in the riots
00:27:54,00:27:56,about how efficient the new guillotine was.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Really? Yeah.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"The worst thing about that one,"
00:27:58,00:28:01,"so that guy who was killed in the first guillotine,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"he was called Pelletier,"
00:28:03,00:28:06,"they decided, OK, we're going to stop hanging people,"
00:28:06,00:28:09,"because we think everyone should be killed exactly the same way,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"because, you know, where the French Revolution,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,it shouldn't be that the nobility get a good way of dying
00:28:13,00:28:15,and the other people don't.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"Everyone's going to be killed with a sword, with an axe."
00:28:18,00:28:20,"And then this guy, Sanson, decided,"
00:28:20,00:28:23,"""Well, actually, my axe isn't good enough for that."
00:28:23,00:28:24,"""I won't be able to get through enough people,"
00:28:24,00:28:26,"""so we need a new way of doing it."""
00:28:26,00:28:29,"And so they came up with this idea of the guillotine,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,but this guy had already been found guilty
00:28:31,00:28:33,"and was already sentenced to death,"
00:28:33,00:28:36,"and he had to sit there and watch it be built,"
00:28:36,00:28:38,because he couldn't be executed until it was built.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"Did he have to go through the kind of, like,"
00:28:40,00:28:43,"brainstorming meetings with them, saying, ""What about this?"""
00:28:43,00:28:46,"I feel like you'd, like, steal a screw or something, wouldn't you?"
00:28:46,00:28:47,Yeah.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"But Sanson, the executioner, he was part of this extraordinary"
00:28:50,00:28:52,dynasty of executioners.
00:28:52,00:28:56,So six generations of his family performed this role.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"Great-grandfather, grandfather, father, all six of his brothers."
00:29:00,00:29:02,All six of his brothers were also executioners
00:29:02,00:29:03,in different bits of France.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Wow. Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:05,Mad. It's really bizarre.
00:29:05,00:29:07,And they called them just by the name of the town
00:29:07,00:29:08,"they were the executioner,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,so they didn't even call them by their first name.
00:29:10,00:29:13,They would call them Reem or Leon or Atom.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"Yeah. It's just, it's bizarre."
00:29:15,00:29:17,"And when you read it about his life,"
00:29:17,00:29:20,he mostly had a series of protracted workplace disputes
00:29:20,00:29:23,"with his bosses, who were either the royalty"
00:29:23,00:29:25,or the revolutionary committee.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"So he was saying, ""Look, I'm broke."
00:29:28,00:29:30,"""I've got, there are so many people to be executed."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"""My working conditions are bad."
00:29:32,00:29:33,"""I need a budget increase."""
00:29:33,00:29:35,"He was asking for a budget increase from the Minister of Justice,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,which was days after he had executed
00:29:37,00:29:40,the previous Minister of Justice.
00:29:40,00:29:41,LAUGHTER
00:29:41,00:29:44,I think that's when you've got leverage in any time.
00:29:44,00:29:45,Absolutely.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"Yeah, he just had all of these disputes"
00:29:47,00:29:49,"with, like, running, irritating disputes."
00:29:49,00:29:51,He once sued someone for libel
00:29:51,00:29:54,for saying that he was boorish or brutish.
00:29:54,00:29:55,Wow. He was an executioner.
00:29:55,00:29:58,"There's also a weird thing, which is,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,I don't know if this is the original moment
00:30:00,00:30:01,"where this idea came about,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"but there's a lot of question about at what point,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"once the head is removed from the body,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,does the person actually pass away?
00:30:08,00:30:10,"And there were all these experiments of, like,"
00:30:10,00:30:12,"trying to get people to blink posts,"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"you know, to talking to the dismembered head."
00:30:14,00:30:16,"There was a theory, I think, like, I remember reading"
00:30:16,00:30:18,"when I was a kid, even, that they stay alive"
00:30:18,00:30:20,"for, like, seven or eight seconds or something."
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah, so there was this thing with Charles Henri,"
00:30:21,00:30:25,which is when he had executed a woman
00:30:25,00:30:27,who was called Charlotte Corday.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"Someone, a carpenter, jumped up and grabbed her head,"
00:30:31,00:30:34,"and he picked it up, and he slapped her on the face."
00:30:34,00:30:38,"So, a horrible thing to do, a poster beheading."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"You don't mind, I don't think, at that stage."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"Well, this is the thing. Apparently, she did."
00:30:43,00:30:46,"Because, apparently, witnesses reported an expression"
00:30:46,00:30:50,of unequivocal indignation on her face
00:30:50,00:30:54,"after she was slapped, and everyone thought,"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"""Oh, maybe you actually last a bit longer."""
00:30:56,00:30:59,You last long enough to be annoyed by something.
00:30:59,00:31:01,(LAUGHTER)
00:31:01,00:31:03,"But, yeah, for a while afterwards, there were a lot of studies"
00:31:03,00:31:07,"into if that's the case, because of Charlotte's anger."
00:31:07,00:31:13,"Original guillotine invented in Halifax, West Yorkshire."
00:31:13,00:31:16,"Yeah. So, good."
00:31:16,00:31:18,Well done.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Are we saying that that's good?
00:31:19,00:31:23,"Because, I would say, because it's in Yorkshire, it's bad."
00:31:23,00:31:25,Debate. Debate.
00:31:25,00:31:29,"Oh. Off with his head. Oh, no."
00:31:29,00:31:31,"It was solely to chop off the heads of people from Lancashire,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,wasn't it?
00:31:32,00:31:34,"It was called the Halifax Chibbit, but it was a mechanism"
00:31:34,00:31:36,for doing the same kind of thing.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"And Daniel Defoe wrote about it, and he said there was this rule,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"right, that if you could pull your head..."
00:31:41,00:31:44,"So, there was a pin that got pulled, and that dropped the chopper."
00:31:44,00:31:48,"But if the order was given to pull the pin,"
00:31:48,00:31:51,"and you managed to pull your head out of the block in time,"
00:31:51,00:31:55,"you were then free to run, as far as you could."
00:31:55,00:31:58,The executioner was entitled to chase you under the rules of this system.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"Wow. But if you got across the river,"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"you were home, not home dry, home very wet, but you weren't free."
00:32:04,00:32:06,You were not going to be executed anymore.
00:32:06,00:32:08,And so that apparently was a rule they had in place.
00:32:08,00:32:10,It seems like a bad rule.
00:32:10,00:32:12,You could spot people who've done it because they'd always have
00:32:12,00:32:15,"a bald patch on the top of their head, wouldn't they?"
00:32:15,00:32:19,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna."
00:32:19,00:32:23,"My fact this week is that in Sicily, the pistachios are guarded"
00:32:23,00:32:24,by the military police.
00:32:24,00:32:29,"Not a very stressful occupation, I would guess."
00:32:29,00:32:34,"Well, they're a very dangerous industry, turns out, sort of."
00:32:34,00:32:37,They are very valuable pistachios in Sicily.
00:32:37,00:32:39,They're called green gold there.
00:32:39,00:32:40,They're different to all pistachios in the rest of the world.
00:32:40,00:32:43,They're farmed in a place called Bronte.
00:32:43,00:32:47,And their thought was much better and richer and deeper flavour
00:32:47,00:32:49,than any other pistachios.
00:32:49,00:32:51,They only constitute about 1% of the world's supply.
00:32:51,00:32:53,"Less, but they're the best."
00:32:53,00:32:56,And so people keep stealing them.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"And loads of pistachio farmers were complaining,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,"saying literally people are rocking out with guns and, you know,"
00:33:01,00:33:04,holdings at gunpoint and stealing all our pistachios.
00:33:04,00:33:06,There was one person who said they'd had a story of someone
00:33:06,00:33:10,like rappelling down from the air and scooping pistachios off trees.
00:33:10,00:33:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:12,00:33:14,From like a helicopter.
00:33:14,00:33:17,"It had to be, yeah, like a big blimp above or something."
00:33:17,00:33:18,I think from the helicopter.
00:33:18,00:33:20,"And I don't know if, like, you've had to pay for the helicopter."
00:33:20,00:33:23,You're going to have to pick a lot of pistachios from your outskirts.
00:33:23,00:33:26,I find it incredible that there is a version of pistachios
00:33:26,00:33:28,"which apparently is even nicer than pistachios,"
00:33:28,00:33:30,one of the nicest things in the world.
00:33:30,00:33:32,"Like, it's, I can't imagine how good,"
00:33:32,00:33:35,because I'm sure I've never had one of these Bronte pistachios.
00:33:35,00:33:35,Yeah.
00:33:35,00:33:39,I'm sure that I'm one of the 99% in the pistachio world.
00:33:39,00:33:41,I think that's the 1%.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"And that's why we rioted all those years ago,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,as the people who tasted those pistachios.
00:33:45,00:33:46,How good must they be?
00:33:46,00:33:47,They must be incredible.
00:33:47,00:33:49,"I actually don't, I don't think pistachios are that great,"
00:33:49,00:33:50,"so I'm not as excited as you,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,but I still wouldn't mind tasting them.
00:33:52,00:33:52,Wow.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"But they're worth a lot, aren't they?"
00:33:53,00:33:57,"Like, one single bag could be worth up to 33,000 American dollars,"
00:33:57,00:33:58,and that is big.
00:33:58,00:33:59,What bag?
00:33:59,00:33:59,Yeah.
00:33:59,00:34:00,Not a supermarket bag.
00:34:00,00:34:03,Start like 100 grams.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Like a Santa sac kind of cake.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"Right, okay, yeah."
00:34:05,00:34:07,"I don't normally buy them in Santa sac, but yeah."
00:34:07,00:34:10,"Okay, a big old bag, yeah."
00:34:10,00:34:11,That's a lot.
00:34:11,00:34:11,How much did you sell?
00:34:11,00:34:15,"33,000 American dollars, I believe."
00:34:15,00:34:15,That's incredible.
00:34:15,00:34:15,Yeah.
00:34:15,00:34:16,Yeah.
00:34:16,00:34:18,"There's Bronte, so this place."
00:34:18,00:34:22,"Admiral Nelson, Lord Nelson, was the Duke of Bronte."
00:34:22,00:34:23,Yes.
00:34:23,00:34:26,"And he was granted the title by the King of Naples and Sicily,"
00:34:26,00:34:27,because he helped to put down a revolution
00:34:27,00:34:29,"against the King, Ferdinand I."
00:34:29,00:34:32,"So he never visited, but he was the Duke of Bronte."
00:34:32,00:34:33,He was very proud of that.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"He always signed his name, once he was given that,"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"Nelson and Bronte, which is all just Bronte."
00:34:38,00:34:40,"And Bronte, did you say?"
00:34:40,00:34:43,"Not and Bronte, but there's a connection."
00:34:43,00:34:43,Is there?
00:34:43,00:34:45,"Because 10 years after Nelson died,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"there was a clergyman called Patrick Bronte,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,"who thought, ""I want to posh out my name a bit,"""
00:34:50,00:34:51,"and he changed his name to Bronte,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,and then fathered the Bronte girls.
00:34:53,00:34:53,Yeah.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"Did he get it from the pistachio place, then, though?"
00:34:56,00:34:57,"Via Nelson, yeah."
00:34:57,00:34:58,"Oh, really?"
00:34:58,00:35:00,He wanted to make his name posh and cool.
00:35:00,00:35:01,That's amazing.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Did not know that.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"If it weren't for the pistachios,"
00:35:04,00:35:05,we wouldn't have Wuthering Heights.
00:35:05,00:35:06,Yeah.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Yeah.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Yes.
00:35:08,00:35:08,Yeah.
00:35:08,00:35:09,Very good.
00:35:09,00:35:09,That's what it looks like.
00:35:09,00:35:10,"And if we didn't have Manchester,"
00:35:10,00:35:12,"we wouldn't have Jane Eyre,"
00:35:12,00:35:15,because that's where Charlotte Bronte started writing Jane Eyre
00:35:15,00:35:16,in Manchester.
00:35:16,00:35:18,So thank you all here.
00:35:18,00:35:21,I thought I'd win more of you over with that one.
00:35:21,00:35:23,But that's cool.
00:35:23,00:35:25,We're all from Yorkshire in this room in times like that.
00:35:25,00:35:31,"Actually, pistachio theft is a problem all over the world"
00:35:31,00:35:33,"where they make pistachios, anyway."
00:35:33,00:35:37,"So in America, they have a nut theft task force,"
00:35:37,00:35:41,which stops nut theft in the California area.
00:35:41,00:35:45,"In Turkey, apparently, they have nut vigilantes"
00:35:45,00:35:48,who try to stop people from stealing their pistachios.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"And in Turkey, they don't repel from blimps"
00:35:51,00:35:52,or anything or from helicopters.
00:35:52,00:35:55,You just ram a tree with your car
00:35:55,00:35:56,and knock all of the pistachios out
00:35:56,00:35:59,and then just gather them all up and shove them in your car.
00:35:59,00:35:59,"Oh, clever."
00:35:59,00:36:01,That's really clever.
00:36:01,00:36:01,Yeah.
00:36:01,00:36:05,"And in Sicily, it's the carabinieri police force"
00:36:05,00:36:06,who guard them.
00:36:06,00:36:09,And they do helicopter patrols as well.
00:36:09,00:36:11,Do they ever have to fire shells at the thieves?
00:36:11,00:36:16,"But I find the carabinieri so weird that,"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"so, you know, if you go to Italy, there are two police forces"
00:36:19,00:36:20,and they just accept this.
00:36:20,00:36:22,So there's like the normal police.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"Oh, we've got about 40, haven't we?"
00:36:23,00:36:25,"Okay, sure."
00:36:25,00:36:27,"Sorry, there are two types of police."
00:36:27,00:36:29,"So if you want to call, if you've got an emergency,"
00:36:29,00:36:30,you can either call the polizia
00:36:30,00:36:32,or you can call the carabinieri.
00:36:32,00:36:34,And I can't really work.
00:36:34,00:36:37,"And one's 112 and one's 113, I think."
00:36:37,00:36:40,"And this journalist was asking Italian, the Sicilians,"
00:36:40,00:36:41,and they didn't really know which was which.
00:36:41,00:36:43,"They were like, ""You just pick one."""
00:36:43,00:36:45,"It's just, and it's just a hangover."
00:36:45,00:36:47,It's from pre-unification even.
00:36:47,00:36:49,And the carabinieri were like the royal guards.
00:36:49,00:36:51,And now they're just a hangover.
00:36:51,00:36:53,But they've got these really weird rules.
00:36:53,00:36:56,So they didn't used to be allowed to have facial hair
00:36:56,00:36:57,"for quite a long time, I think."
00:36:57,00:37:00,And now you can have quite strict facial hair.
00:37:00,00:37:03,They had to ask permission to marry
00:37:03,00:37:04,if you're in the military police force.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"And then once you ask permission to marry from your boss,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,then they do a full-on background check
00:37:08,00:37:11,of your potential spouse to make sure they're appropriate.
00:37:11,00:37:14,"Okay, I think that's the best one to ring, isn't it?"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"If they're that strict, no?"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"Yeah, you don't have to ask."
00:37:18,00:37:19,"I want you to send a police officer,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,but can you tell me about your spouse a bit first?
00:37:21,00:37:23,"Yeah, that's very good."
00:37:23,00:37:24,I don't think people are calling them the day
00:37:24,00:37:26,"before their wedding, just to say,"
00:37:26,00:37:27,"""I think you're really good at it,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,"and I've got some doubts, actually."""
00:37:29,00:37:30,So... Wow.
00:37:30,00:37:33,"Yeah, pistachio theft is a big, a huge deal."
00:37:33,00:37:35,"So this year in June, I think this was in California,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"there was a guy, a trucker who was arrested"
00:37:37,00:37:42,"for allegedly stealing £42,000 of pistachios."
00:37:42,00:37:44,"Wait, nice. Like, one and a half bags."
00:37:44,00:37:53,"Yeah, and it's a problem because you turn up dressed"
00:37:53,00:37:54,"as a truck driver, looking like a truck driver."
00:37:54,00:37:55,Dressed as a truck driver.
00:37:55,00:37:59,What if you haven't bought that Halloween costume yet?
00:37:59,00:38:02,You sort of look plausibly like...
00:38:02,00:38:03,"Wearing a t-shirt, for instance."
00:38:03,00:38:04,"Wearing a t-shirt, yeah."
00:38:04,00:38:09,"And so now drivers have to have thumb prints, photo ID,"
00:38:09,00:38:10,the whole deal.
00:38:10,00:38:11,And some people have hacked into
00:38:11,00:38:13,trucking companies' computer systems
00:38:13,00:38:16,"to place fake orders for pistachios,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,"and then someone turns upon the day and says,"
00:38:18,00:38:19,"""I'm here for the pistachios that have been ordered."""
00:38:19,00:38:20,Right.
00:38:20,00:38:22,And then drive off with all the nuts.
00:38:22,00:38:24,And that's a perfect crime.
00:38:24,00:38:27,And the idea is basically that there's no kind of
00:38:27,00:38:29,"barcodes on these things, right?"
00:38:29,00:38:30,"There's just tons of nuts,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,"and people eat the pistachios,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,and so that's kind of destroying all the evidence.
00:38:34,00:38:35,It's the perfect crime.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"It's the perfect crime, because you get to eat pistachio nuts"
00:38:37,00:38:39,throughout. It's... Yeah.
00:38:41,00:38:43,Just back to Bronte for a second.
00:38:43,00:38:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:44,00:38:47,"Not the sisters, the area with the pistachios."
00:38:47,00:38:49,There's an amazing thing when you're looking at photos of it
00:38:49,00:38:52,that you suddenly notice this giant mountain
00:38:52,00:38:57,"that is sitting in the background of the pistachio area,"
00:38:57,00:38:58,and it's Mount Etna.
00:38:58,00:39:02,And Mount Etna is given a lot of credit
00:39:02,00:39:04,"for the reason that the pistachios are so good,"
00:39:04,00:39:07,because basically the trees are growing out
00:39:07,00:39:10,of the kind of volcanic slabs that have been laid down
00:39:10,00:39:11,over the passage of time.
00:39:11,00:39:13,Which is genuinely really good for soil.
00:39:13,00:39:14,"Like lava has all these minerals in it,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,which over time make it much more fertile.
00:39:16,00:39:17,So it's true.
00:39:17,00:39:20,"Yeah, but it's still an active volcano,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,"and up until very recently,"
00:39:22,00:39:23,I think it was in...
00:39:23,00:39:24,"It was either this year or last year,"
00:39:24,00:39:27,"it had these huge explosions, lava explosions."
00:39:27,00:39:29,It grew in height by 100 feet.
00:39:29,00:39:30,What?
00:39:30,00:39:32,"Yeah, because of all of..."
00:39:32,00:39:37,It was literally like when you put a Mentos in a Diet Coke.
00:39:37,00:39:38,It was shooting a column.
00:39:38,00:39:40,You know what a volcano is?
00:39:40,00:39:40,Right.
00:39:40,00:39:44,"Hang on, James."
00:39:44,00:39:47,I need to hear a bit more about this Mentos Coke situation
00:39:47,00:39:48,before I can visualize it.
00:39:48,00:39:53,"Sorry, do you mean it grew 100 feet just temporarily"
00:39:53,00:39:54,while it was shooting it out?
00:39:54,00:39:58,"No, no, that column, like a Mentos in a Diet Coke,"
00:39:58,00:40:01,"shoots like meters upright, and this is what this did."
00:40:01,00:40:02,"This was like hundreds of meters into the air,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,this column of stuff.
00:40:04,00:40:06,So it grew in all the ash kind of sat on top of lava
00:40:06,00:40:08,"and dried up, and it grew."
00:40:08,00:40:10,"But it does an amazing thing, Mount Etna,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,which I didn't realize volcanoes do.
00:40:12,00:40:14,"It blows smoke rings occasionally,"
00:40:14,00:40:18,like a really skilled smoker doing those...
00:40:18,00:40:22,You can see these beautiful plumes of perfect rings
00:40:22,00:40:23,coming out the top of Mount Etna.
00:40:23,00:40:24,That's great.
00:40:24,00:40:27,So it's not just the pistachios that are cool about the area.
00:40:27,00:40:30,I'm still not going until I can do that Gandalf ship.
00:40:30,00:40:32,Then I'll visit Sicily.
00:40:32,00:40:36,"Okay, I've got an economics quiz for you all."
00:40:36,00:40:37,"Oh, great."
00:40:37,00:40:38,Yay!
00:40:38,00:40:43,"Which is better value, shelled or unshelled pistachios?"
00:40:43,00:40:45,"Well, I would say probably..."
00:40:45,00:40:48,"It's more fun to open the shells,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,and it actually means you don't shove millions of them
00:40:50,00:40:53,"in your face, so you kind of eat a bit less."
00:40:53,00:40:55,"But presumably the shells aren't worth as much,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,so it would be better to get unshelled.
00:40:57,00:40:58,"Okay, good theory."
00:40:58,00:41:02,"I'm going to say shelled as well, purely because I think it's..."
00:41:02,00:41:04,"Yeah, it's the pure form, right?"
00:41:04,00:41:05,And all sorts.
00:41:05,00:41:07,"Pure form, yeah, I guess."
00:41:07,00:41:10,"Okay, I'm going to say it's impossible to answer that,"
00:41:10,00:41:13,"because you haven't told us what they cost, respectively."
00:41:13,00:41:15,"I can't tell you what's better value,"
00:41:15,00:41:16,unless you tell me how much it is.
00:41:16,00:41:21,"Sorry, I just want to allow you myself to that theory."
00:41:21,00:41:24,"Well, okay, let's say shelled on pistachios."
00:41:24,00:41:26,"With the shell, half the price per ounce, right?"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"But you only get half as many,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,because half the space in the bag is shells in empty space.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"So this is by a website called Wonkblog,"
00:41:32,00:41:33,"which is very good, by the way,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,on these sort of nut-related questions.
00:41:35,00:41:40,"The problem is, the price is roughly equivalent per weight,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,but it's labor.
00:41:42,00:41:43,It's how much work you're doing
00:41:43,00:41:45,to take the shells off the pistachios.
00:41:45,00:41:47,And so it depends what you earn.
00:41:47,00:41:49,"So if you're on, you know, 10 pounds an hour,"
00:41:49,00:41:53,the cost of shell on pistachios is about four pounds in labor
00:41:53,00:41:54,"to remove the shells,"
00:41:54,00:41:55,if you're doing it for a certain time.
00:41:55,00:41:58,"But if you earn, you know, 40 quid an hour,"
00:41:58,00:42:01,"that's way more per bag of shell pistachios,"
00:42:01,00:42:02,because you are having to do the work.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"So there's that thing about, is it Cristiano Ronaldo?"
00:42:04,00:42:07,"It's not, if he drops a tenner on the floor,"
00:42:07,00:42:08,"it's not worth him picking it up,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,because it would take him longer
00:42:10,00:42:11,than he's earned that amount of money.
00:42:11,00:42:12,Exactly.
00:42:12,00:42:14,"Also, someone else might kick the ball away from you"
00:42:14,00:42:15,in the time that you went down to...
00:42:15,00:42:19,It's not a good strategy on the pitch.
00:42:19,00:42:21,"I mean, what's he doing on the pitch anyway,"
00:42:21,00:42:23,Cristiano Ronaldo these days?
00:42:23,00:42:25,Ronaldo would be the worst person in the world
00:42:25,00:42:28,"to buy shell on pistachios,"
00:42:28,00:42:31,because it's just not worth his time taking the shell off.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"It's a stupid thing that shell removal is labor,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,and some people will call that a hobby.
00:42:35,00:42:37,So...
00:42:37,00:42:40,And there's a place in America called Pistachio Land.
00:42:40,00:42:42,Sounds really cool.
00:42:42,00:42:43,"According to their website,"
00:42:43,00:42:47,"they offer a motorised farm tour around the orchards,"
00:42:47,00:42:51,"a candy kitchen where they produce their own pistachio treats,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,"a geocache location,"
00:42:53,00:42:55,and a poker stop for playing Pokemon Go.
00:42:55,00:42:57,There's the four things.
00:42:57,00:42:58,The website's really good.
00:42:58,00:43:01,It tells you why pistachios are so good for you.
00:43:01,00:43:05,Some maybe slightly dubious claims.
00:43:05,00:43:07,"They say that they're cholesterol-free,"
00:43:07,00:43:08,"which I think they are, so that's good."
00:43:08,00:43:11,"They have antioxidants, so that's good for you,"
00:43:11,00:43:13,"you know, very fashionable."
00:43:13,00:43:16,It also says that the colour green is associated
00:43:16,00:43:19,"with health, hope, renewal, and alleviates anxiety,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,"which feels like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it?"
00:43:21,00:43:24,"It does, unless you're seeing it on the executioner's trousers"
00:43:24,00:43:25,heading towards you.
00:43:25,00:43:27,It will cool stress.
00:43:28,00:43:31,Did you know that pistachios are good for penises?
00:43:31,00:43:33,In what sense?
00:43:33,00:43:35,"Well, they were originally called the penistachio, weren't they?"
00:43:35,00:43:37,"Yeah, yeah, in what way, in what way?"
00:43:37,00:43:41,"Okay, so there was a study where they gave a bunch of men"
00:43:41,00:43:44,"100 grams of pistachio nuts as a diet,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"so you would eat them in one go for three weeks,"
00:43:46,00:43:49,and they found that their penises got better.
00:43:49,00:43:51,"Now, here's the interesting thing about this."
00:43:51,00:43:51,Yes.
00:43:51,00:43:56,"I've not written down what that means, so..."
00:43:57,00:44:03,"Presumably, the scientific paper didn't say the penises got better,"
00:44:03,00:44:04,so you've already...
00:44:04,00:44:06,"So, I've written that."
00:44:06,00:44:07,"I've written ""Good for your penis"","
00:44:07,00:44:11,"and then I've kind of just not written anything else,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,so it's going to remain a bit of a mystery.
00:44:14,00:44:15,I have a lot of acronyms.
00:44:15,00:44:17,"Apparently, your IIEF score is better,"
00:44:17,00:44:21,and your PCDU parameters are better as well.
00:44:21,00:44:24,"But there are side effects in patients with ED,"
00:44:24,00:44:25,so watch out for that.
00:44:25,00:44:28,"That's a retell dysfunction, I suppose, the last one."
00:44:28,00:44:29,"Oh, yes."
00:44:29,00:44:30,"So, it's ""Good for your penis"", ""Good for your nuts""?"
00:44:30,00:44:35,No?
00:44:35,00:44:36,Yeah.
00:44:36,00:44:39,"So, you know, it's a mystery what that means,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,but it's good news.
00:44:41,00:44:42,It's good news.
00:44:42,00:44:43,If you want a good penis...
00:44:43,00:44:46,I don't know if it means morally.
00:44:46,00:44:48,I don't know if it means in action.
00:44:48,00:44:50,I don't know if it's like at quizzes.
00:44:50,00:44:50,I don't know what...
00:44:50,00:44:54,Well-behaved penises.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"Did you say ""Good at quizzes""?"
00:44:56,00:44:57,"""Good at quizzes""."
00:44:57,00:44:59,I remember when we took you to the pub
00:44:59,00:45:00,and you were playing the quiz machine.
00:45:00,00:45:02,Never again.
00:45:02,00:45:03,Extraordinary.
00:45:03,00:45:05,They had to clean the buttons so much after this.
00:45:05,00:45:08,"Anyway, look, we need to wrap up in a second."
00:45:08,00:45:10,Do we have anything else before we do?
00:45:10,00:45:13,"Well, they're dangerous, aren't they, pistachios?"
00:45:13,00:45:13,They can explode.
00:45:13,00:45:16,And they can suffocate you.
00:45:16,00:45:21,"But not like as a sort of mercy killing, that kind of thing."
00:45:22,00:45:25,They don't grab a cushion and they don't do that.
00:45:25,00:45:27,How can they do either of these things?
00:45:27,00:45:29,"Not under their own steam, either of these things, surely?"
00:45:29,00:45:31,"Well, kind of, I suppose."
00:45:31,00:45:35,"So, yeah, basically they're taking out oxygen from an area"
00:45:35,00:45:36,and releasing carbon dioxide.
00:45:36,00:45:40,So if you are in like a big truck full of pistachios
00:45:40,00:45:43,"and it's hermetically sealed and you're there long enough,"
00:45:43,00:45:44,then you'll suffocate.
00:45:44,00:45:46,"So that's kind of them by themselves, isn't it?"
00:45:46,00:45:48,"Definitely, I think so."
00:45:48,00:45:51,"Yeah, and they have this kind of fat in there"
00:45:51,00:45:53,and they have this chemical reaction.
00:45:53,00:45:56,And that chemical reaction gives out heat.
00:45:56,00:45:58,"And if it gives out enough heat, if they're enough there,"
00:45:58,00:45:59,they can explode.
00:45:59,00:46:00,Yeah.
00:46:00,00:46:01,So they're dangerous.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"It's not, it would be an elaborate plot."
00:46:03,00:46:05,It would be an amazing sort of mystery.
00:46:05,00:46:06,You need a lot of them.
00:46:06,00:46:08,"If you have them in your pocket, they're not going to explode."
00:46:08,00:46:10,Although you might end up with a bad penis if they do.
00:46:10,00:46:15,"It's not just like saying that flower,"
00:46:15,00:46:18,"is it like every time your wife receives some flowers,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"you say, you know, they can suffocate you"
00:46:20,00:46:22,if you're shot in a room with a million of them.
00:46:22,00:46:25,"To be honest, the problem is the florist never"
00:46:25,00:46:27,have enough space on the little cart today.
00:46:27,00:46:31,I've got to do one more thing.
00:46:31,00:46:32,"Yeah, go for it."
00:46:32,00:46:35,"So this is, pistachios used to be red in America,"
00:46:35,00:46:36,"which I didn't know, they were dyed"
00:46:36,00:46:38,because they were bought from Iran.
00:46:38,00:46:41,And then there was the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.
00:46:41,00:46:43,"Big deal, there were trade embargoes."
00:46:43,00:46:45,So no more imports from Iran.
00:46:45,00:46:48,And America started its own pistachio industry.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"And this was all in the time of President Jimmy Carter,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,who set up this pistachio embargo.
00:46:53,00:46:54,Very exciting.
00:46:54,00:46:57,"But he, of course, is a peanut farmer."
00:46:57,00:46:58,If anyone remembers that.
00:46:58,00:47:02,Jimmy Carter is a peanut farmer and was and is.
00:47:02,00:47:05,"And there is a statue of Jimmy Carter in Georgia,"
00:47:05,00:47:08,"which is of a four meter tall peanut,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,but it has the teeth of Jimmy Carter.
00:47:10,00:47:14,It's the second tallest peanut statue in the world.
00:47:14,00:47:16,And second tallest.
00:47:16,00:47:17,Second tallest.
00:47:18,00:47:20,"Yeah, it's not the best, but it's nearly there."
00:47:20,00:47:22,And this is my favorite detail about this.
00:47:22,00:47:25,It's just a tall peanut with Jimmy Carter's teeth.
00:47:25,00:47:27,It's really weird.
00:47:27,00:47:30,But it has a large hole in its rear end.
00:47:30,00:47:33,And that allegedly was cut by the Secret Service
00:47:33,00:47:37,to ensure that there were no explosives or assassins inside it.
00:47:37,00:47:41,But why would you cut the hole to work out
00:47:41,00:47:43,if there were no explosives or assassins inside it?
00:47:43,00:47:45,"If there's no hole, there are probably no assassins inside."
00:47:47,00:47:48,The peanut's bum.
00:47:48,00:47:52,"Also, if you were going to put a feature of Jimmy Carter"
00:47:52,00:47:55,"on a peanut to make sure people knew it was him,"
00:47:55,00:47:56,is the teeth the...
00:47:56,00:48:00,"If you see it, you're like, oh, Jimmy Carter."
00:48:00,00:48:01,"Jimmy Carter, where are we?"
00:48:01,00:48:02,"Oh, hang on. No, it's a big peanut."
00:48:02,00:48:06,I don't know which body part you'd put.
00:48:06,00:48:09,I don't know any specific body part of Jimmy Carter very well.
00:48:09,00:48:11,I just know him as a whole.
00:48:14,00:48:17,The largest pistachio in the world is advertised
00:48:17,00:48:21,as being a pistachio land in America.
00:48:21,00:48:25,But I found that there is a pistachio-shaped museum in Turkey
00:48:25,00:48:27,which has a larger pistachio.
00:48:27,00:48:29,And so I wrote to pistachio land to tell them
00:48:29,00:48:32,that their pistachio isn't the biggest pistachio in the world.
00:48:32,00:48:33,No reply.
00:48:33,00:48:35,Jesus Christ.
00:48:35,00:48:40,And I was so hoping to go on a trip there.
00:48:40,00:48:41,I'll never have this now.
00:48:41,00:48:43,"Yeah, your face is just there with a cross."
00:48:43,00:48:44,So everywhere.
00:48:44,00:48:45,"No, you out."
00:48:45,00:48:48,"No, it's just a big knot with James' teeth."
