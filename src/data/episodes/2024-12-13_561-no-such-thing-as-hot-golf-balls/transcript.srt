00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,360
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,140
 This one comes to you from the State Theater in Sydney.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,540
 It's part of our massive Aussie and New Zealand tour

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,740
 that we just finished.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
 We had an absolutely incredible time

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,280
 while we were down there, as we did in the UK.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,260
 But the tour down under had one extra special element

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,980
 that we didn't quite manage for the UK,

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,700
 which was we had merch.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,100
 We had awesome Thundernerd t-shirts to go

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,060
 with the title of our show.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,020
 We had Thundernerd beanies.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,620
 We were selling our ultimate guide

15
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,940
 and no such thing as a fish tour book.

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,420
 Which by the way, if you haven't got,

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,900
 you really need to get your hands on.

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,940
 It's got everything from a spread on Moss by Andy

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,580
 and his only day on Twitter.

20
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,740
 There's timelines of everything that we've done.

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,260
 We've got bios on every guest who's been on there.

22
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,740
 There's a lot of behind the scenes.

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,500
 In fact, there's a bunch of QR codes

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,620
 all throughout the book as well

25
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,820
 that has secret videos that we've never published anywhere.

26
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,420
 And audio commentary from us.

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,300
 So it's sort of a mini episode

28
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,860
 within the pages of the book.

29
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,820
 Anyway, along with some pin badges,

30
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,860
 all of that is available on our website.

31
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,020
 Go to nosuchthingasafish.com/store.

32
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,900
 And if you get in there quick enough,

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,260
 you're gonna be able to buy some of that swag

34
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,220
 just in time for Christmas.

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,980
 Now, if you're an Aussie in New Zealand

36
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,580
 are listening to this right now and thinking,

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,620
 damn it, I didn't pick up anything at the gigs

38
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,020
 and now we've gotta buy it back from over in the UK.

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,940
 Don't worry, we've got you covered.

40
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,660
 Just head to the website and you will find a link there

41
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,940
 that is specifically for you Antipodians

42
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,860
 so that you can deal with it more locally.

43
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,540
 Now, if you're looking for a good book

44
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,300
 to read over the Christmas period,

45
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,740
 I highly recommend our books.

46
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,620
 We're all authors.

47
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,860
 We released books this year

48
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,300
 and he has a new comic novel called

49
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,860
 A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering.

50
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,020
 Brilliantly funny.

51
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,900
 James Inanna wrote a fact-packed book

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,540
 which is the QI history of sports

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,860
 called A Load of Old Balls.

54
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,900
 And I've written a non-fiction book for kids

55
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,220
 ages seven and above,

56
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,020
 all about the mysteries of our universe

57
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,300
 called Impossible Things.

58
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,660
 Okay, that's it for plugging.

59
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,540
 A lot of plugging there.

60
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,940
 But hey, you're a popular person.

61
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,180
 You've got a lot of presents to buy.

62
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,420
 So there you go, problem solved.

63
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,620
 Anyway, enjoy the show now,

64
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,060
 coming to you from down under on with the podcast.

65
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:25,460
 Hello and welcome!

66
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,140
 To another episode of None Such Thing as a Fish,

67
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,260
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

68
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,460
 from the State Theater in Sydney!

69
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:43,180
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

70
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,340
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

71
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,820
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

72
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,140
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

73
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,300
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

74
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,900
 and in no particular order, here we go.

75
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,580
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,580
 My fact this week is that in 1944,

77
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,140
 the filming of the Oscar-winning movie National Velvet

78
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,340
 was delayed to give its lead actress

79
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,420
 time to grow a bit taller.

80
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,300
 (audience laughing)

81
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,660
 Ah!

82
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,580
 And who was that?

83
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,780
 She's, no one's heard of her now,

84
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,700
 so it's not worth mentioning,

85
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,340
 but she was called Elizabeth Taylor.

86
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,620
 (audience laughing)

87
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,140
 Yeah, this is one of her first films.

88
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,060
 Did she fluctuate in height a lot, Elizabeth Taylor?

89
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,820
 Yeah, she was 35 at the time,

90
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,300
 but sometimes she'd wake up six foot tall, sometimes five.

91
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,060
 No, she was obviously, she was still a child,

92
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,340
 she was about 12 at the time,

93
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,020
 and this was a, so every child actress

94
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
 was trying out for this part.

95
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,340
 And I think they've been preparing for years,

96
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,380
 so a few of the tryouts were adults

97
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,260
 by the time they finally cast it.

98
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,100
 And the--

99
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,700
 How much did she need to make it into the movie?

100
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,580
 Well, she needed, it's a Pando Berman,

101
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,260
 who was the producer, met her,

102
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,140
 and thought she's absolutely perfect,

103
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,420
 need her, but she needs three inches.

104
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,900
 Right. Which is a hefty whack, really.

105
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,740
 That is.

106
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
 It's a decent amount.

107
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,540
 They also, they asked her to wear braces.

108
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,660
 I think tooth braces, not up and down ones.

109
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,180
 And they pulled out two of her baby teeth.

110
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,020
 What?

111
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,820
 Yep, they also wanted to dye her hair,

112
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,140
 seems like a minor imposition

113
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,020
 after they've pulled out two of your teeth.

114
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,820
 And they wanted to change her name to Virginia,

115
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,420
 but her parents refused.

116
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,980
 And because they were really struggling

117
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,340
 to get the right actress for this role,

118
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,220
 what they needed was a child

119
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,460
 who could speak with an English accent and ride a horse.

120
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,700
 That was the whole brief.

121
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,220
 But what's incredibly confusing,

122
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,500
 'cause this is always the claim,

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 is that the basis for it was she was very good at riding,

124
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,580
 and we'll probably go into her relationship with horses,

125
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,780
 which wasn't weird, like I've just made it sound.

126
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,820
 And she was very good at riding,

127
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,860
 and she had been born,

128
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,820
 and a bit of her life brought up in England,

129
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,980
 so she needed a British accent.

130
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,620
 Now, if anyone's seen "National Velvet",

131
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,180
 she does not talk with a British accent

132
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,420
 at any point during that film.

133
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,060
 So I'm not sure why it was a thing

134
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,380
 she needed to have in her backpack, just in case.

135
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,220
 - Yeah, who knows?

136
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,100
 - Yeah, she got a very bad back

137
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,300
 when she was riding King Charles,

138
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,660
 which was the name of the horse, King Charles.

139
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,500
 - It sure was.

140
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,260
 - And she loved it so much that the head of MGM,

141
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,700
 Louis B. Mayer, gave it to her as a 13th birthday gift.

142
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,500
 - Oh wow, that's amazing.

143
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
 - Did you read about how they met?

144
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,140
 - No.

145
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,780
 - Her and King Charles, it's so sweet.

146
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
 It's like something in a film itself.

147
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,140
 So she had been taken to go riding at this country club

148
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,300
 by her parents to try and teach her to ride,

149
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,540
 and she'd seen this beautiful horse from afar,

150
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,940
 fallen in love with him, said, "I must ride that horse."

151
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,540
 This is an 11-year-old girl.

152
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,180
 The owner had said, "This horse is mad, it's my horse.

153
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,940
 "Literally won't let anyone near it."

154
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,020
 She waited until everyone had left,

155
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,980
 and then she climbed onto the hay bales

156
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,740
 and jumped through the hole where they fed the horse hay,

157
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,260
 landing on his back, and she just lay on his back.

158
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,660
 Just lay there in the stable,

159
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,420
 and she did this day after day after day

160
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,580
 until eventually the owner one day went in to ride him

161
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,900
 and was like, "There's an 11-year-old on my horse.

162
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,100
 "What's going on?"

163
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,380
 And said, "Okay, well, she's obviously tamed him

164
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,940
 "and handed him over."

165
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
 It was a beautiful tale, true love.

166
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,460
 - She, her looks, we've mentioned a few things

167
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,540
 about what they wanted her to do,

168
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,420
 moving the baby teeth, she needed more height.

169
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,380
 When she was born, the doctor said to her mom,

170
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,140
 "You've given birth to a mutant."

171
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,660
 - They didn't say those words, Dan.

172
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,180
 - They did. - I refuse to believe.

173
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,020
 - They did.

174
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,260
 - But it's what she has in common with you.

175
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,100
 - What?

176
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,700
 - Elizabeth, so I think I know what you're gonna say.

177
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,900
 - So do I, but I don't think Dan has this.

178
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,820
 - Dan, okay, it feels like all four of us

179
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,900
 are holding a hand of cards about what mutation,

180
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,260
 Elizabeth and Dan, what I'm saying is excess hair,

181
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,980
 but it's distributed differently on the two of them.

182
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,500
 So, Dan, a suit man.

183
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,340
 - Yeah. - I mean, big, big time.

184
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
 - Yeah.

185
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,460
 - 'Cause we're looking at a picture

186
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,780
 of Elizabeth Taylor on here,

187
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,340
 and she doesn't quite have Dan's hairiness.

188
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,180
 - No, but interestingly, that's me next to her naked.

189
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,580
 (laughing)

190
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,220
 - We should save the listeners at home

191
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,980
 that that is Lassie, you know, don't we?

192
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,260
 - But okay, so what she did have is,

193
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,140
 she had a double set of eyelashes.

194
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,980
 So her mom was like, "Oh, that's okay, that's fine."

195
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
 But it can be dangerous,

196
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,860
 because it can be a condition

197
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,500
 where if the second layer of eyelash grows inward,

198
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,340
 it can go into your eyeballs,

199
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,940
 and a very low percentage of people who have had it

200
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,340
 have died of heart disease later in life,

201
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,140
 which is how she died,

202
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,060
 but I don't know if the connection has been made.

203
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,860
 - Because it's a genetic thing, isn't it?

204
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,200
 That makes it happen. - Yeah, exactly.

205
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,460
 - Yeah, it's a gene called Foxy2.

206
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,500
 - Yeah, it's so cool! - Yeah, F-O-X-C2.

207
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,860
 - Do you know one other thing about her face

208
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,700
 that she also had?

209
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,420
 She once, supposedly, I've read this in a few places,

210
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,140
 won the title Most Memorable Eyebrows in a magazine poll,

211
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,300
 and Lassie came second.

212
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,420
 - No! - Yeah!

213
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,420
 - The dogs, sorry.

214
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,540
 Just, the dogs have eyebrows?

215
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,140
 Well, let's look. - Yeah, of course they do.

216
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,580
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,740
 - I would say if the two people on screen,

218
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,100
 Elizabeth Taylor's are more pronounced.

219
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,140
 - Yeah. - But yeah,

220
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,820
 certainly they have the rich, don't they, the dogs?

221
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,660
 - Yeah, they do.

222
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,420
 - So, I mean, Lassie was one of her first big hits,

223
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,260
 wasn't it, Elizabeth Taylor?

224
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,420
 - Yeah, it was basically Lassie first,

225
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
 then National Velvet.

226
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,180
 She did a very strong line in animal-based films, yeah.

227
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,820
 - Yeah, and the dog was played by a dog called Pal,

228
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,780
 and Pal earned a salary of $250 per week,

229
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,980
 while Elizabeth Taylor was only paid $100 per week.

230
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,220
 But the dog actually was male,

231
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,180
 so it was kinda standard for the time.

232
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,700
 (audience laughing)

233
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,340
 - So, obviously, for anyone under the age of 70,

234
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,820
 we should just say that she's, you know,

235
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,460
 in case you're not familiar with her stuff,

236
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,180
 she's unbelievably famous throughout the 20th century.

237
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,620
 Not only for her films, things like "Clear Patra,"

238
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,020
 which was the extremely famous one,

239
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,580
 but lots and lots more,

240
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,980
 but for having seven husbands and eight marriages.

241
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,940
 - Yes. - 'Cause he's married

242
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,060
 to Richard Burton, twice.

243
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,380
 - Was that his accent, or did he just have a weird throw?

244
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,220
 - It wasn't his accent.

245
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,420
 (audience laughing)

246
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,020
 Just stuffed out, sorry.

247
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,700
 (audience laughing)

248
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,740
 And Richard Burton, as well, she was Welsh.

249
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,820
 He was Welsh, that was not Welsh.

250
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
 Anyway, the list of her husbands is so extraordinary,

251
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,260
 because it goes through all of these, you know,

252
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
 her first marriage was to this horrible guy

253
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,740
 called Conrad Hilton, who was the hotel chain,

254
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,180
 she was 18 years old.

255
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,380
 MGM picked the bridesmaids and invited the guests for her.

256
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,660
 - So, she would have been step-mom,

257
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,460
 eventually, or step-grandmother, to Paris Hilton, right?

258
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,700
 'Cause she married Eddie Fisher, as well, right?

259
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,260
 Eddie Fisher, who was mother of Carrie Fisher,

260
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,740
 so she was step-mother to Princess Leia.

261
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,220
 - Yeah, you find it, it's weird when you research people

262
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,420
 like this, because you find yourself getting

263
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,020
 into very heat magazine territory with celebrity gossip,

264
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,900
 but it feels okay, 'cause it was 50 years ago,

265
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
 but I found myself finding it so juicy

266
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,500
 that when she married Conrad Hilton,

267
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,300
 Conrad himself was actually having an affair at the time

268
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,020
 with his own stepmother, Jean-Jacques Gabor.

269
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,660
 - What? - Whoa!

270
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,980
 - Chajar's in the story, mate.

271
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,340
 - Chajar. - Chajar Gabor.

272
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,180
 - Yeah. - The woman

273
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,780
 who introduced the Rubik's Cube to America.

274
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,900
 - Exactly, she's not just famous for that, James.

275
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
 - She's famous for something else.

276
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,060
 - Is that why you were fired from Heat Magazine, James?

277
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,820
 (all laughing)

278
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,540
 - Chajar Gabor can fit into over 4 trillion positions.

279
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,820
 (all laughing)

280
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,660
 - I wonder he liked her.

281
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,900
 - Chajar, all their marriages,

282
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,220
 they're obviously quite high-profile,

283
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,300
 but the double marriage, the most famous one,

284
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,300
 Richard Burton, like that one,

285
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,740
 that one was the most interesting,

286
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,540
 because those two ran Hollywood

287
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,020
 as if they were the king and queen of America.

288
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,700
 They would go into parties,

289
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
 they would spend ludicrous amounts of money on it,

290
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,740
 they would have weird reasons for leaving parties,

291
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,900
 and they would tear up rooms, they would have tantrums,

292
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,740
 and no one seemed to do anything about it.

293
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,100
 And so her life, Elizabeth Taylor's life,

294
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,660
 really when you read the juicy stuff,

295
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,020
 it's all about the divaism, all about the amazing demands.

296
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,380
 Like for example, in Cleopatra,

297
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,660
 when they were filming that,

298
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,540
 she had twice a week delivered to her on set

299
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,220
 her local favorite meal from Dave Chasen's "Chili",

300
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,460
 because she just loved it so much.

301
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,100
 And what made that really difficult is

302
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,500
 that restaurant was in LA, and she was filming in Rome.

303
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,820
 So they got it on airplanes twice to three times a week,

304
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
 just her meal to be delivered to her for lunch.

305
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,180
 - It was so bad that the Vatican stepped in,

306
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,260
 didn't they, and the Pope accused her

307
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,460
 of erotic vagrancy, her and Richard Burton actually.

308
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,340
 And there's an amazing scene in Cleopatra

309
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,060
 where she's coming into, spoiler alert,

310
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,340
 coming into the city on a big chair,

311
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,940
 and there's huge crowds, and apparently there was a moment

312
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,340
 where all of these extras who were all Italian Catholics

313
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,180
 are starting to come towards her,

314
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,620
 and she thinks they're gonna lynch her

315
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,340
 because it's been in all the newspapers

316
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,980
 that the Pope hates her.

317
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,380
 And then just in the last second,

318
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,180
 they all turn round and go, "Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!"

319
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,620
 And they just loved her so much.

320
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,980
 - Wow.

321
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,540
 - The filming of that is absolutely insane,

322
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,500
 because they tried filming in London, it didn't work.

323
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,020
 It started Jackie Chan, a woman called Jackie Chan.

324
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,180
 - That's so funny.

326
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,740
 - There are so many stories of the filming

327
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,060
 because they could only film if Burton and Taylor

328
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,460
 both showed up, and if they had had a row the night before,

329
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,500
 they just wouldn't.

330
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,740
 So the production overran like crazy.

331
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,820
 This is a story from Jackie Chan.

332
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,700
 There was a scene where Cleopatra has a bath on set,

333
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
 and the set was cleared of all superfluous people,

334
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,900
 she reported, but a Scottish actor

335
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,140
 who played a blind poet gleefully told me

336
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,540
 he was allowed to stay because people had forgotten

337
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,980
 he wasn't really blind.

338
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,980
 (audience laughing)

339
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,340
 - That's very funny.

340
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,180
 On their mad demands, they both loved animals,

341
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,980
 Richard Burton loved dogs, she loved dogs.

342
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,060
 There was a story going around that the dogs

343
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,580
 that they had liked her more than they liked him,

344
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,740
 so he bought a dog and it suddenly liked him

345
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,540
 more than it liked her, and everyone was like,

346
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,380
 what's going on?

347
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,300
 And then his diaries later reported

348
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,740
 that the dog had come and it only spoke Welsh,

349
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,340
 and Richard Burton spoke Welsh to it secretly,

350
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,500
 but I couldn't verify that firsthand,

351
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,980
 but I wouldn't put it past them,

352
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
 but they did both love dogs, and they were staying

353
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,660
 in the UK and they weren't allowed to bring

354
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,860
 their dogs to London because of quarantine rules,

355
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,380
 so they found a loophole in the law,

356
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,700
 which said that there was no rule

357
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 that the animals couldn't be on British waters,

358
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
 and they leased a yacht for $20,000,

359
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,820
 I think huge amounts of money, about $2,000 a day,

360
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,060
 and moored it on the Thames and just kept these dogs

361
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,700
 on the Thames on a luxury yacht.

362
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,340
 - Yeah, it's very clever.

363
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,660
 She did a lot of crazy and weird things, right,

364
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,020
 but one thing that she also did is she saved the life

365
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,420
 of an extremely famous actor at the time.

366
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,820
 She was at a party with a man called Montgomery Cliff,

367
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,260
 and they were on the way home,

368
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,460
 and she was in the car behind, he was in the car in front.

369
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,260
 He had a massive accident, car flips over,

370
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,580
 smashes, and he's trapped underneath.

371
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,260
 She gets out of her car, she goes and climbs in

372
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,020
 through the broken window in the car to see him,

373
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,740
 and he's choking, and so she does something

374
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,780
 which I think is extraordinary.

375
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,420
 Most people would do like a Heimlich maneuver, right?

376
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,100
 Most people would tap the back like crazy.

377
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,780
 Elizabeth Taylor reaches into his mouth,

378
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,380
 and because the thing that was choking him

379
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,860
 was broken teeth stuck in his throat,

380
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,060
 she individually picked out all the teeth from his mouth

381
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,540
 until his airway was cleared,

382
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,300
 so he could breathe again, saved his life.

383
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,140
 - That's stunning.

384
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,340
 - I've never heard of a choking being fixed

385
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,660
 by a hand down the mountain.

386
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,940
 - I've heard once there was a dolphin

387
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,700
 who had swallowed some plastic,

388
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,780
 and the world's second tallest man

389
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,580
 went in with his rarely long arms and pulled the plastic out.

390
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,420
 - That's nice.

391
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,460
 - But I kind of think dolphins have wider mouths than humans.

392
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,300
 - Yeah.

393
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,460
 - This really doesn't fit.

394
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,020
 I don't think, if Andy, you had something in your mouth,

395
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,700
 and I'm looking at my hand and the size of your mouth,

396
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,340
 I don't think one fits into the other.

397
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,700
 - It wasn't down in his ringtone.

398
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,300
 It was very, it was quite shallow in the mouth.

399
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,540
 - She had waited for her fingers to grow long enough.

400
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,780
 - Yes.

401
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,620
 - That's the thing.

402
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,460
 - That's what happened.

403
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,300
 There we go.

404
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,880
 (upbeat music)

405
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,220
 - It is time for us to move on to fact number two,

406
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,700
 and that is my fact.

407
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,740
 My fact this week is that one of the leading investigators

408
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,920
 in the Jack the Ripper case,

409
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,220
 whose only major contribution was to arrest someone

410
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,260
 who wasn't capable of being the murderer,

411
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,500
 was called Sergeant Thick.

412
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,540
 - That was the guy.

413
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,040
 - Sergeant, yeah, Sergeant William Thick, or Willie Thick,

414
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,300
 which is just funny.

415
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,140
 He basically, yeah, he knocked on the door

416
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,500
 of a guy called John Pizer, or Pizzar,

417
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,620
 and he said, "You need to come with me."

418
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,300
 And the person said, "What for?"

419
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,820
 And Sergeant Thick, having no evidence,

420
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,540
 clearly didn't know what for,

421
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,580
 so he'd had to say, "You know what for?"

422
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,740
 And the guy went with him,

423
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,500
 and he was put into jail, and then he was released

424
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,220
 because there was no evidence whatsoever

425
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,660
 that this guy was guilty,

426
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,500
 and Thick, even himself, when he was interviewed later,

427
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,620
 saying, "Yeah, I don't think it could have been him.

428
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,140
 "I don't think he was capable of it.

429
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,580
 "I don't know why I did that."

430
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,460
 So, yeah. - Oh, wow.

431
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,460
 - We should just say Jack the Ripper was a murderer,

432
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,100
 'cause I know we're in Australia,

433
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,340
 and Ripper means something very different over here.

434
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,580
 - Oh, yeah.

435
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,220
 Yeah, it was not cool, this guy, yeah.

436
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,660
 And by the way, this is a subject

437
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,900
 which obviously involves horrific events,

438
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,980
 and we are probably gonna be talking largely

439
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,060
 about the people who were named as potential killers

440
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,380
 and so on, but just as a flip side thing,

441
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,060
 there's an amazing book called "The Five"

442
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,820
 that you should go and read, which is all about the women

443
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,460
 who often don't get humanized in this,

444
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,140
 and yeah, it's an amazing book.

445
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,900
 - So, Mary Jane Kelly, she was known in the press

446
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,660
 as Fair Emma, Ginger, Dark Mary, and Black Mary,

447
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,740
 suggesting that she must have changed her hair quite a lot

448
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,140
 at the various times. - Very nice.

449
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,180
 - There was Annie Chapman, who got into a fight

450
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,260
 with a female lodger just before she died,

451
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,860
 possibly over a man or possibly over a bar of soap.

452
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,700
 We're not sure.

453
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,060
 - They are often confused, I find.

454
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,580
 - There was Elizabeth Stride, who was Swedish,

455
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,780
 and she went around telling everyone that her husband

456
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,220
 and her child had died in a shipwreck on the River Thames

457
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
 that she survived it,

458
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,020
 but actually there was no such shipwreck.

459
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,580
 - I have a theory about her.

460
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,620
 Well, I have a theory about who the killer is,

461
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,700
 because I don't think we have enough people theorizing

462
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,420
 about who the killer was, and it's related to her,

463
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,580
 because she lived with a man called Michael Kidney,

464
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,940
 now Jack the Ripper, famously removed people's kidneys.

465
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,860
 - Oh. - Okay, coincidence.

466
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,700
 - Probably.

467
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,580
 - I don't think so. - Almost certainly.

468
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,260
 Otherwise, you're just going around looking for someone

469
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,180
 with the surname Murderer, I think, is the--

470
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,420
 - Did anyone try that? - I don't think so.

471
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,660
 But the women are kind of, they were written up,

472
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,100
 a lot of it was done, it was made very,

473
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,300
 you know, it was made exciting, it was made to sell papers.

474
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,180
 There were so many London papers at the time,

475
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,580
 about 20 daily papers, all trying to get information

476
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,820
 and sell copies off the back of it.

477
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,820
 So they were often written up as low women,

478
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,940
 or fallen women, or women who sold sex,

479
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,180
 and actually, like one or two of them had done,

480
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,220
 or may have done, but actually,

481
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,860
 most of them were out late at night.

482
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,420
 - Yeah, not that there should be any remote difference

483
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,940
 between someone who sells sex with money,

484
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,100
 and doesn't sell sex with money,

485
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,020
 in terms of whether or not they should be murdered.

486
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,660
 But yeah. - I wasn't trying

487
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,500
 to imply the word. - No, no, no, no.

488
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,020
 I just, I think there's a bit of an implication of that.

489
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,660
 - They couldn't afford lodging some of them,

490
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,540
 and so that's why the killer had the sort of means,

491
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,420
 or the opportunity to kill them.

492
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,580
 Yeah, so Jack the Ripper,

494
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,940
 I think this is quite a fun little detail.

495
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,260
 (audience laughing)

496
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,020
 There's so many fun details about the guy.

497
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,780
 In a poll in 2006,

498
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,060
 he was voted the worst Britain in history.

499
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,900
 (audience laughing)

500
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,500
 - That was before Brexit, though.

501
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,340
 - It was.

502
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,380
 (audience laughing)

503
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,460
 That's true, yeah.

504
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,420
 - Who else was in there?

505
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,500
 Do you have any details of who else came?

506
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,380
 - Yeah, I've got them, if you want them.

507
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,540
 So Thomas Beckett came second.

508
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,380
 - Thomas Beckett?

509
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,620
 - Yeah, King John came fourth.

510
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,940
 - When was this poll done in the 12th century?

511
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,300
 (audience laughing)

512
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,380
 - King John Fair.

513
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,660
 - Yeah, Edric Striota.

514
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
 - Who's that?

515
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
 - Good question.

516
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,820
 (audience laughing)

517
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,860
 Sir Richard Rich, Lord Rich of Lees.

518
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,300
 - I don't like the sound of him based on his name,

519
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,940
 but I don't know.

520
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,300
 - Hugh Dispenser, the younger who you might know,

521
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,060
 autonomous of Rundle, and Oswald Mosley.

522
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,900
 - Oh, okay.

523
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,740
 - And a few others.

524
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,100
 But basically the way that they did it is,

525
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,580
 they got a load of historians,

526
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,020
 and they were each allowed to nominate one person.

527
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,340
 And so some of them went really straight down the line

528
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,540
 and said, "Jack the Ripper,"

529
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,460
 and some of them said,

530
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,980
 "Here's someone you've never heard of."

531
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,260
 - Hugh Dispenser.

532
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,820
 (audience laughing)

533
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,300
 - You know all those anti-COVID things you see everywhere?

534
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,140
 - Yeah.

535
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,980
 - He invented those.

536
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,820
 - That's great.

537
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,660
 - It's an easy gig for their story to get,

538
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,860
 "Jack the Ripper," isn't it?

539
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,300
 They murdered loads of people, pulled their organs out.

540
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
 I win.

541
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,180
 - Yeah, that's the thing about the case,

542
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,940
 is that a lot of people get very obsessed with it,

543
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,300
 and I think it's a slightly unhealthy way.

544
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,860
 And it's written up sometimes as the first ever

545
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,180
 true crime story, you know,

546
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,900
 just because there were lots of people

547
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
 chucking in their own theories

548
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,540
 and debating with each other and all of that,

549
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,460
 and slightly sort of gamifying it.

550
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,620
 One of those theorized to have maybe been the murderer

551
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,420
 was Dr. Thomas Creme,

552
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,380
 who was a doctor who was eventually hanged

553
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,660
 for an unrelated murder at Newgate Prison.

554
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,780
 And his last words were,

555
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,340
 "I am Jack the..."

556
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 (audience laughing)

557
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,740
 And then he was hanged.

558
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
 - No!

559
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,420
 - Yeah.

560
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,380
 But it probably wasn't him, but--

561
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,420
 - Was that bad timing, or?

562
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,700
 - I think it was incredible timing by him.

563
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,540
 - I think--

564
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,140
 - So he saw the lever going down, so.

565
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,980
 - Wow.

566
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,140
 - Because he was in prison at the time the murders happened.

567
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,940
 I mean, it's just very, very, very unlikely

568
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,780
 that he was actually--

569
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,620
 - Yeah.

570
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,860
 - I think he was just--

571
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,700
 - He just had flair.

572
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,540
 - He's just--

573
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,380
 - I think he just had flair.

574
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,260
 - Having a bit of fun right at the end.

575
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,780
 - It was just happening.

576
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,740
 - Why the hell not?

577
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,580
 - Yeah.

578
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,980
 - The industry is pretty wild in the UK,

579
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,900
 and Jack the Ripper Tours are quite mad,

580
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,300
 but my favorite tour is a tour

581
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,420
 that was set up in about 2017 in Clithero,

582
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,180
 which, for those of you who don't know the UK,

583
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,980
 is in Lancashire, about 250 miles away from Whitechapel.

584
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,340
 It's the Jack the Ripper tour.

585
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,100
 It was started by a tour guy called Simon Entwistle,

586
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
 who just sort of noticed that bits of Clithero,

587
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,780
 actually, they haven't been developed very much

588
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,900
 since the 19th century,

589
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,060
 so they look a lot more like what Jack the Ripper

590
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,900
 would have experienced than London.

591
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,380
 - Yeah, 'cause that bit of London

592
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,620
 is completely developed now.

593
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,460
 It's all skyscrapers.

594
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,220
 - Yeah, I gotta say, having grown up near Clithero,

595
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,340
 or as we used to call it, Clithero,

596
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,900
 (laughing)

597
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,580
 - It's a very nice little town.

598
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,100
 - I stopped after Guitar Hero.

599
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,700
 I just didn't think.

600
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,500
 - Well, it's much more difficult figuring on that one.

601
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,540
 (laughing)

602
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,460
 - And you never get any points

603
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,340
 'cause you can't find the fucking thing.

604
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,580
 (laughing)

605
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,460
 - How interesting, Clithero.

606
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,820
 - Yeah, that's really, there are all sorts of,

607
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,940
 there's slightly sort of unpleasant,

608
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,700
 they're like, okay, is this tasteless?

609
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,900
 Efficient chip shop called Jack the Chipper.

610
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
 (laughing)

611
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,740
 Is it, like, you know, some people say

612
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,420
 it's been long enough and that's fine.

613
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,620
 The proprietor said it was history, never a celebration,

614
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,220
 which, and then they said,

615
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,660
 we've already shown our respectfulness

616
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,940
 by offering a 50% discount for women.

617
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,820
 Which, is that okay?

618
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,140
 - We chopped them in half as soon as they come in.

619
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,940
 My favorite theory about Jack the Ripper

620
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,940
 is that there was no such person.

621
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,780
 - Okay.

622
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,980
 - And this is the one I actually believe.

623
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,620
 This is a guy called Peter Turnbull

624
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,380
 who wrote a book called The Killer That Never Was.

625
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,740
 His idea is that these people obviously

626
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,100
 were very sadly killed,

627
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,580
 but a lot of them were copycat crimes.

628
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,860
 And they were done by people who'd read the stories

629
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,220
 in the newspaper and thought,

630
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,660
 I'm gonna go and do that same thing.

631
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,020
 So there wasn't a single serial killer.

632
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,540
 And his theories say that there was no consistent

633
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,580
 modus operandi, so the way that the people were killed

634
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,020
 was different each time.

635
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,940
 It wasn't over an extended period,

636
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,420
 so normally serial killers kill over several years,

637
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,860
 whereas this only happened over 13 weeks.

638
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,780
 And it all took place in a very single area,

639
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,220
 whereas usually serial killers will kill over

640
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,260
 a little bit more of a wide area.

641
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,100
 - Okay.

642
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,860
 - And some of the really terrible things,

643
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,540
 like that when they were disembowelled the victims,

644
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,220
 they occurred after people in the newspapers

645
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,060
 had speculated that that might happen.

646
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,900
 - Right.

647
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,740
 - Right.

648
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,580
 - So that's, I think that might-

649
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,180
 - So the first one wasn't?

650
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,940
 - The first one wasn't disembowelling.

651
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,820
 - 'Cause she was the one who drew lots of tourists, right?

652
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,900
 The industry's been going on since the start.

653
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,820
 As soon as the first person was killed.

654
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,060
 I think it was the second person when people started to think,

655
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,940
 "Ooh, something's going on here."

656
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,460
 It was in 1888, and locals paid a penny

657
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,140
 to go and see her there.

658
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,860
 And then when she was taken away,

659
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,420
 then locals kept paying a penny,

660
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,780
 and it was the people who lived next door,

661
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,260
 which good business minds started charging people

662
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,060
 just to come and look at the bit of pavement.

663
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,900
 - Right.

664
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,740
 - Wow.

665
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,340
 - And there's quite a few other people

666
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,260
 who were being named, obviously, there's a big, big list.

667
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,820
 There was a guy, this was a big one,

668
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,740
 Francis Tumblety, which is the most

669
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,540
 un-serial killer name I've ever heard.

670
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,380
 Take a tea.

671
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,540
 - Again, you can't really judge people by their name.

672
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
 (laughing)

673
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,180
 - I'm gonna judge Francis, I think.

674
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,300
 So he was supposedly, not only was he Jack the Ripper,

675
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,420
 but he was also complicit in the assassination

676
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,820
 of Abraham Lincoln.

677
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
 So supposedly he'd done that and he'd come over.

678
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,660
 But what he was was a miracle quack.

679
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,260
 He just used to sell medicine.

680
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,980
 His big invention was called Tumblety's Pimple Destroyer.

681
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,900
 - So even if he was guilty, he did some good

682
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,340
 and he did some bad, right?

683
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,100
 - I mean, Deadpool's are a real blight.

684
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,940
 - There you go.

685
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,060
 - A lot of adolescents.

686
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,740
 - Have you heard of Richard Mansfield?

687
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,300
 - Oh, the actor?

688
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,100
 - He was an actor who got caught up in this completely.

689
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,940
 This was nothing to do with him.

690
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,020
 But at the time the murders happened,

691
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,260
 there was a play on, which was a dramatization

692
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,780
 of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,

693
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,660
 which is about a doctor who drinks a potion

694
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,580
 and then becomes, you know, changes personality

695
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,820
 and becomes evil.

696
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,140
 And people thought that he might be the murderer

697
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,700
 simply because he was such a good actor

698
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,300
 at playing both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

699
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,900
 And the production was shut down,

700
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,780
 but the stage craft was so unbelievable.

701
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,300
 People couldn't work out how it was done

702
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,540
 because he changed physically.

703
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,540
 And people thought that I can't believe what I'm seeing, right?

704
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,460
 It was so effective that they thought,

705
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,620
 people sat with opera glasses,

706
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,380
 trying to look at what this guy had done on stage.

707
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,660
 - Like physically?

708
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
 - Yeah.

709
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,380
 And some people said, oh, he's just putting a mask on.

710
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,780
 And actually, can I just tell you what he did?

711
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,700
 This is so good.

712
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,580
 They had pre-painted his face

713
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,420
 in a way that standard theater lighting wouldn't show.

714
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,700
 And then they introduced a colored filter

715
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,220
 in the lights in the theater,

716
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,260
 which showed up the grease paint

717
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,860
 and he would contort his face a little bit,

718
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,940
 but it would completely change the look of his face.

719
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,860
 - That's very clever.

720
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,020
 - And I have not done that tonight.

721
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,220
 But imagine if I had, how interesting that would have been.

722
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,300
 - Wow.

723
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,700
 - And he got completely caught up in it,

724
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,900
 but nothing to do with him.

725
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,300
 - That's exciting, yeah.

726
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,100
 - We're gonna have to move on in a sec, guys.

727
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,980
 - Have you heard of Jack the Flipper?

728
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,820
 - Jack the Flipper.

729
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,860
 - An aggressive dolphin in a 2013 study.

730
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,980
 (laughing)

731
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,140
 - The dipper, on the other hand,

732
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,220
 is an ice cream shop in North Carolina.

733
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,460
 (laughing)

734
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,140
 - Are you culminating in Amsterdam's Jack the Stripper?

735
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,700
 I've got to say, I'm really anxious

736
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,540
 about what's coming up.

737
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,380
 - Oh, yeah.

738
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,220
 - Okay.

739
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,800
 (upbeat music)

740
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,140
 - It is time for fact number three,

741
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,220
 and that is Andy.

742
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,420
 My fact is that German mini golfers

743
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,900
 refrigerate their balls.

744
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,740
 So.

745
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,100
 - Doesn't it hurt when they close the door?

746
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,140
 (laughing)

747
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,980
 - Lovely.

748
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,820
 (laughing)

749
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,020
 Lovely stuff.

750
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,180
 - Very good.

751
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,460
 - This was a great piece in the FT

752
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,060
 about the world of mini golf,

753
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,140
 which is just, this is not crazy golf.

754
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,340
 It is big golf, made small.

755
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,320
 Mini golf, as the title applies.

756
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,540
 It's not, there are no windmills,

757
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,020
 there are no clowns, there are no dinosaurs.

758
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,860
 - Okay, I was saying,

759
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,820
 "Creative Golf" is a segment of mini golf,

760
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,540
 the fun guy segment, if you will.

761
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,380
 - Yeah, exactly.

762
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,700
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,220
 All crazy golf is mini,

764
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,540
 but not all mini golf is crazy.

765
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,140
 And the correspondent went to see

767
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,660
 the World Finals, the seniors,

768
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,740
 mini golf world championships,

769
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,500
 and they take it very seriously.

770
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,020
 And the Germans chill their balls.

771
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,740
 They have special ball fridges

772
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,900
 to ensure they have ball homeostasis.

773
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,940
 And it's a very big deal.

774
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,980
 And you know, some players keep their balls in their socks.

775
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,660
 They tuck them into their trousers.

776
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,500
 - All right.

777
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,380
 - 'Cause you want consistency of temperature.

778
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,020
 You want consistency of rolling.

779
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,380
 - How do you make your shoes fit?

780
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,460
 If you've got a,

781
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,420
 is it, you just have to buy much larger shoe?

782
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,700
 - Oh no, your sock, your sock goes higher than your,

783
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
 unless you're wearing those ankle socks.

784
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,460
 - Oh yeah.

785
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,300
 - That's not gonna work.

786
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,140
 - Oh no, sorry, it's not like,

787
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,980
 I was imagining the end of the sock.

788
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
 - I believe it is at the end of the sock,

789
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,420
 but it's at the other end you're thinking of.

790
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,780
 - Yes, okay, yes.

791
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,620
 - It's, I think we've said it before,

792
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,780
 that these balls that they use in mini golf,

793
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,980
 they're not golf balls.

794
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,820
 Are they? - No.

795
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,460
 - They're kind of rubbery things,

796
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,380
 which I guess makes it more important

797
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,500
 that they're the right temperature.

798
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,340
 - Right.

799
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,180
 - There's still golf balls of it.

800
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,020
 They're mini golf balls.

801
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,540
 - They're mini golf balls, yeah.

802
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,500
 - And they are, you can pick your own balls?

803
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,860
 I think we said, did we say that?

804
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
 - No.

805
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,880
 - If you play golf, you'll have a,

806
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,820
 you might like select your club.

807
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,980
 Or you've got a caddy, is it?

808
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,620
 Your caddy carries your clubs for you.

809
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,460
 - Yeah.

810
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,500
 - Is that, does that happen?

811
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,340
 - Parking.

812
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,660
 - Do you have a,

813
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,540
 like do you have a caddy when you play golf?

814
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,100
 - You can on occasion.

815
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,140
 - Okay, but you can, if you're a mini golf,

816
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,300
 I have a ball caddy,

817
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,220
 because you've got so many balls to choose from.

818
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,060
 - Oh really?

819
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,140
 - Which balls you play and which holes?

820
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,860
 - So when professional golfers say,

821
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,380
 give me the nine iron or whatever that language is,

822
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,540
 in mini golf, it's the opposite.

823
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,180
 Give me the red ball.

824
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,260
 - Give me the big, big round ball.

825
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,100
 - Big round ball.

826
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,940
 - Yeah, round ball.

827
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,820
 - They're all the same size, we should say.

828
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,020
 - So what are you choosing?

829
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,860
 - Yes.

830
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,700
 - Of course, Andy.

831
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,460
 - Come on, we can't play with a marble

832
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,740
 some of the time in a beach ball,

833
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,580
 some of the rest of the time.

834
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
 - Are you sure, sir?

835
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,300
 This one is twice the size of the hole.

836
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,740
 - Yes, I'll take it.

837
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,580
 - James.

838
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,420
 - Yes.

839
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,260
 - Tiger Woods once,

840
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,060
 this is something I don't know about golf.

841
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,100
 He played the big championship that he won.

842
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,820
 He ran out of balls.

843
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,660
 - Okay.

844
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,820
 - And he was only, he was down to like one ball

845
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,620
 and you can't just request more balls.

846
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,460
 - No, no.

847
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,620
 - Did he have to use one of his balls?

848
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,940
 (laughing)

849
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,220
 - He did use, Tiger Woods famously used his balls a lot,

850
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,220
 but in golf, however many you bring with you

851
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,460
 on the first tee is how many you have to,

852
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,660
 you know, you can't get any more from the club.

853
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,500
 - That's crazy.

854
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,900
 - The ones you've got are the ones you're stuck with.

855
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,740
 - That's extraordinary.

856
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,140
 - Here's one really interesting thing

857
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,260
 that is different about mini golf and maxi golf.

858
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,140
 And that is, in mini golf, you refrigerate your balls.

859
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,460
 In maxi golf, it is against the rules

860
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,980
 to warm your balls up explicitly.

861
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,100
 You're not allowed to warm because it changes the way

862
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,660
 that they might fly through the air.

863
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,660
 You are allowed to warm them up before the round,

864
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,420
 but then they will go cold quite quickly.

865
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,420
 But during the game, you're not allowed to.

866
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,500
 And it's to such an extent that when you play golf

867
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,540
 in a country that isn't fucking boiling like this one,

868
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,580
 you get cold a lot and you would have like hand warmers

869
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,200
 in your pockets, you'd be advised not to put your balls

870
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,980
 near those hand warmers because your opponents could say,

871
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,620
 you're artificially warming them up,

872
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,940
 you're gonna get kicked out.

873
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,780
 - Are you allowed to, but you're allowed to pocket your balls?

874
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,820
 - You can put them in your pocket.

875
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,980
 - Can you put them in your armpits?

876
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,460
 Can you keep them in your mouth?

877
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,300
 (laughing)

878
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,980
 Can you, I'm not gonna ask any more questions,

879
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,980
 but I can think of a few locations which would ensure--

880
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,140
 - Every hole's a goal.

881
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,380
 (laughing)

882
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,980
 The rule specifically says you're not allowed

883
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,620
 to artificially warm your golf balls.

884
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,460
 - But is my bum--

885
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,460
 - It doesn't specifically say it would be a case by case basis.

886
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,500
 - Right.

887
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,220
 - I can assure you my bum is 100% real.

888
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,060
 You know?

889
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,140
 (laughing)

890
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,300
 - I feel like it might affect your stance.

891
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,420
 (laughing)

892
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,860
 - I think you failed the caddy interview,

893
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,660
 is all I can tell you, so.

894
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,260
 (laughing)

895
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,540
 - I'm telling you, you're caddy.

896
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,300
 Just walk to the spot you're teeing off,

897
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,540
 and just squeeze their cheeks and drop.

898
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,660
 (laughing)

899
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,580
 - If they can land it directly on the tee,

900
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,660
 that is a great caddy.

901
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,540
 - That's a caddy.

902
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,380
 - Oh my God.

903
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,580
 (laughing)

904
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,900
 - Moving, moving on.

905
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,980
 - You brought it up.

906
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
 - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

907
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,380
 - Moving on to the balls up the pump.

908
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,380
 - Hey, check this out.

909
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,060
 A 2009 search for the Loch Ness Monster.

910
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,900
 - Oh my God.

911
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,940
 (laughing)

912
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,780
 - How do you do it?

913
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,500
 How do you do it?

914
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,260
 - It didn't find the Loch Ness Monster,

915
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,140
 it found 100,000 golf balls.

916
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,740
 And basically they've worked out that there's a driving range

917
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,180
 where golf balls have been lobbed into Loch Ness,

918
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,940
 and they're just all over the ground.

919
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,740
 They were registering all these signals,

920
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,060
 and there was 100,000 of them.

921
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,580
 They thought, my God, they're baby Loch Ness Monster eggs.

922
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,900
 (laughing)

923
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,980
 - They all had type list written on the side.

924
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,220
 (laughing)

925
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,060
 - Yeah, they didn't think that.

926
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,300
 That's what I would have thought, is what I mean.

927
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,660
 But yeah, so, Lost Balls,

928
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,380
 I mean, this is an actual job that you can get

929
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,220
 at a golf course, not a mini golf course,

930
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
 but they have scuba divers

931
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,220
 who are paid to go into all the bits of water,

932
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,580
 and they go hunting for balls,

933
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,500
 and they get paid by the ball that they found.

934
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,900
 So that's a job you can get if you're one of--

935
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,580
 - It's incredible, 'cause they build up so much over time.

936
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,740
 Have you heard of Glenn Berger?

937
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,540
 - This is a guy who has exactly the job

938
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,700
 that Dennis just described.

939
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,540
 He's been working, he was profiled about 10 years ago.

940
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,740
 He had already collected 15 million balls.

941
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,580
 - What?

942
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,060
 - His personal best is 17,000 balls in a day.

943
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,900
 - What?

944
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,740
 - How?

945
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,700
 - Again, he's employing lots of people

946
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,540
 to do his balls work, right?

947
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,460
 - Yeah, but that's, I think, his personal best.

948
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,860
 That's him going down. - No.

949
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,140
 - Yeah, 'cause if you've got someone that has been played

950
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,500
 on a golf course for years and years--

951
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,900
 - I guess if you're literally just dredging them, maybe.

952
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,140
 - He's dredging, or he goes down

953
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,940
 and he'll just pull them into sacks, you know,

954
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,300
 'cause they all settle in the same place.

955
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,340
 There is a website called golf.com.

956
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,540
 It's a very good website.

957
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,860
 (audience laughing)

958
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,900
 - If you like golf. - If you like golf, yeah.

959
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,060
 It claims that in the late 1990s,

960
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,380
 there was a golf ball diver who spent several hours

961
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,700
 stuck on the bottom because he was pinned down

962
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,540
 by an amorous alligator.

963
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,700
 - Right. - Oh my God.

964
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,100
 - Who was trying to flirt.

965
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,220
 - One way of improving your golf balls

966
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,100
 perhaps might be to make them radioactive.

967
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
 - Ooh, okay.

968
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,140
 In 1910, there was a company called

969
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,700
 the Worthington Golf Ball Company

970
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,540
 that started making golf balls with radium in them.

971
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,460
 And they said they were wise enough to stop.

972
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,220
 It's a reasonable position and not develop unduly

973
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,260
 a power that could be dangerous.

974
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,980
 So I think they just had a little bit in.

975
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,820
 - Why were you doing it?

976
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,100
 Is it so you can find them?

977
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,500
 - Well, the idea is in those days, they thought,

978
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,780
 'cause radium was this new sort of wonder material

979
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,100
 that they found, they thought you could add radium

980
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,460
 to anything and it would just make it better.

981
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,420
 They had radium condoms, for instance.

982
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,020
 - Yeah, yeah, radium crockery.

983
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,900
 I saw some of that recently in a shop.

984
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,220
 And I walked past at night and I thought,

985
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,060
 'Oh, what a cool light display they've got.'

986
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,460
 And it was just a display of, I think it was uranium.

987
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,540
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

988
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,220
 - Were you shopping in the 1910s?

989
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,540
 - It was an antique shop, but it was very--

990
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,020
 - I think that it's kind of,

991
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,140
 you're not supposed to really buy too many of those, are you?

992
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,380
 I think they're kind of, yeah.

993
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,420
 But they did these in 1910,

994
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,340
 but they didn't really sell very well.

995
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,940
 But then they came back

996
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,620
 and in recent years, there's been some scientists

997
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,660
 at the Atomic Energy of Canada

998
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,060
 who have said that they have put their golf balls

999
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,540
 in radioactive position

1000
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,540
 and they travel 20 to 30 yards further than conventional balls.

1001
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,740
 - Really? - Yeah, they put it

1002
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,580
 in an electron beam, but they have said

1003
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,860
 that they won't make any claims, you know,

1004
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,340
 claims in the shops to say this definitely will work.

1005
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,220
 They said that would require study

1006
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,180
 and we don't intend to study it.

1007
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,820
 - No? Okay, that's science.

1008
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,380
 (laughing)

1009
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,780
 There's actually a stop gap in between your 1910

1010
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,060
 and then more recent ones, which is in 1951.

1011
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,500
 There was a guy called Dr. William L. Davidson

1012
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,060
 and he supposedly was creating golf balls

1013
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,220
 but with little quantities of radioactive material inside.

1014
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,500
 And as you say, Andy, it was for if a golf ball got lost,

1015
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,260
 you would go with a Geiger counter

1016
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,020
 and you would be able to locate your ball.

1017
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,380
 - That's a pretty good idea.

1018
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,020
 - Yeah. - Yeah, that's a good idea.

1019
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,900
 - Do you know how many balls there are out there?

1020
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,540
 This is in America alone, USA alone,

1021
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,900
 300 million golf balls go missing every year.

1022
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,700
 - Wow, that's almost exactly the population of America.

1023
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,020
 - For every person in America,

1024
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,660
 if you're listening to this in the States,

1025
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,940
 there is a golf ball for every year of your life waiting.

1026
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,260
 (laughing)

1027
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,140
 It's out there and you'll never find them all.

1028
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,820
 - Oh, oh yes, yes.

1029
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,660
 - What a sobering thought. - Right, what a sobering thought.

1030
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,180
 - We don't know what happens to them either.

1031
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,100
 No one knows what happens to a golf ball

1032
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,180
 that doesn't get touched.

1033
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,140
 There's no recognized study, so they don't know--

1034
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,300
 - 'Cause they last 1,000 years.

1035
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,060
 We have no, they just don't degrade.

1036
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,900
 - Yes.

1037
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,780
 - The cockroaches will be able to play golf in the future.

1038
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,820
 Just a sort of lateral thinking test for you.

1039
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,220
 There was, so golf balls used to be surrounded

1040
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,380
 by a very hard, vulcanized rubber shell,

1041
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,980
 which isn't quite the same as they have now,

1042
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,020
 so that was replaced with fully synthetic rubber in the end.

1043
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,180
 But it was in 1965 that the transition started to be made.

1044
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,140
 It was a chemist called Harry Lander,

1045
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,740
 was one of the people who did it,

1046
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,380
 and he was trying to make a really durable golf ball,

1047
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,020
 and he made one, and it was successful,

1048
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,580
 but it didn't have that hard shell,

1049
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,700
 and so he had to make a tweak to it, a special change,

1050
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,100
 'cause it didn't do something that all golfers wanted it to do.

1051
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,740
 What did he have to add back in?

1052
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,340
 - Okay, what did it not do?

1053
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,740
 So it wasn't hard on the outside.

1054
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,580
 - Yes, it works still just as well.

1055
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,340
 - Okay, so they just like the sound of the flak.

1056
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,660
 - Like the sound, James, you've got the mind of a golfer,

1057
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,140
 he had to add the click back in.

1058
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,620
 - Really? - They came back and said...

1059
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,420
 - Like a car door. - Exactly like a car door.

1060
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,460
 - Wow. - They added the click back into golf balls.

1061
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,500
 - That's so funny.

1062
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,540
 - I'm gonna have to move us on, guys, so we're next back.

1063
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,380
 - Can I do a 2018 headline from the UK?

1064
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,020
 "Man filmed having sex with ninth hole of golf course."

1065
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,860
 (audience laughing)

1066
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 And a quote, "From where he was,

1067
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,180
 "it looked like he had his penis in the hole

1068
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,420
 "while he had the flak in his backside."

1069
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,220
 (audience laughing)

1070
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,060
 - Interesting.

1071
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,700
 - It was the most weirdest thing

1072
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,060
 I've ever had the most fortune to see.

1073
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,260
 All I can say is if my ball ever goes in the ninth hole

1074
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,380
 at Brackenwood, it can stay there.

1075
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,980
 (audience laughing)

1076
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,460
 - And that's where the 300 million others are.

1077
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,040
 (upbeat music)

1078
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,420
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

1079
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,100
 and that is James.

1080
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,100
 - Okay, and my fact this week is that M&Ms

1081
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,460
 deliberately made the green character sexy

1082
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,540
 because of a school ground rumour

1083
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,820
 that that coloured sweets were an aphrodisiac.

1084
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,260
 (audience laughing)

1085
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,380
 This is Ms. Green, and for people

1086
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,900
 who can't see her on the screen,

1087
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,300
 she has pouty lips and eyelashes and high heels,

1088
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,900
 and she was invented by a marketing agency called BBDO,

1089
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,500
 who wanted to transform M&Ms into a brand,

1090
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,580
 into a more iconic brand, I should say,

1091
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,780
 and they came up with these ideas of spokes candies,

1092
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,340
 and in their press release, they say that the green M&M,

1093
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,940
 she adds credence to the rumour

1094
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,420
 that her mere presence is a turn on,

1095
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,260
 and it turns out that kids throughout

1096
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,780
 the previous 20 years or so had all been saying,

1097
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
 if you eat the green ones, it's an aphrodisiac,

1098
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,940
 and they thought, oh, we might as well run with it.

1099
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,740
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing that every single colour

1100
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,780
 of an M&M was associated with a kind of school ground

1101
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,860
 or workplace or general life myth, right?

1102
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,100
 Like it just, it was everywhere.

1103
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,420
 So green ones were an aphrodisiac.

1104
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,340
 The last one you pulled out of the bag was red.

1105
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
 You need to make a wish, and it will come true.

1106
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,740
 If the last candy that comes out of the bag is yellow,

1107
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,740
 you can call in sick and stay at home.

1108
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,940
 Orange, yeah, orange.

1109
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,860
 - No one ever did that.

1110
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,380
 Did any boss ever receive that call?

1111
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,300
 Please write in if so.

1112
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,580
 - Orange M&Ms, good luck.

1113
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,860
 Brown ones, bad luck.

1114
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,820
 It was all, that's just, that was,

1115
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,020
 that's what people said when you pulled the thing out.

1116
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,860
 - I just feel like a lot of people

1117
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,300
 are probably similar to myself.

1118
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,700
 A packet out of packet of M&Ms without being aware,

1119
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,140
 any of them had personalities until now.

1120
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,980
 - Really?

1121
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,900
 - I certainly didn't know until I read this.

1122
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,460
 I couldn't believe she was sexy.

1123
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,020
 Did everyone else know this?

1124
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,860
 - Yeah.

1125
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,460
 - I was a loner at school.

1126
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,140
 I didn't pick up on those things.

1127
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,700
 - But the rumour, I think the rumour was that.

1128
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,100
 And I had no idea about the connection.

1129
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,740
 I just thought they'd been a bit weird

1130
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,140
 by making one of them a bit, a bit fit.

1131
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,460
 - And it's got controversial lately, hasn't it?

1132
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,660
 - I mean, to a certain extent.

1133
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,140
 - Oh, got extremely controversial.

1134
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,980
 - How come?

1135
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,800
 Why?

1136
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,180
 - Well, you know, should we have one

1137
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,620
 who's wearing high heels with no pants on?

1138
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,180
 To be honest, looking at that picture.

1139
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,020
 - None of them are wearing pants.

1140
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,340
 It's weirder if one of them's wearing pants.

1141
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,180
 - That's a really good point.

1142
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
 - I don't like the thought of an M&M wearing pants at all.

1143
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
 - They did attempt to replace

1144
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,940
 the green one's high heel boots with trainers.

1145
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,460
 And they put like sensible heels on the brown one

1146
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,700
 who used to wear little kitten heels.

1147
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,780
 And then there's a huge backlash by which I mean,

1148
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,820
 I think one person wrote an article about it.

1149
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,620
 And so they reverted, you know,

1150
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,700
 because it was woken as gone mad.

1151
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,540
 - Yeah.

1152
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,540
 - So there was one bit where she did a sports illustrated

1153
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,660
 swimsuit modeling thing.

1154
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,620
 - Weird.

1155
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,180
 - Where she sort of unzipped almost her entire body

1156
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
 to reveal the chocolate inside.

1157
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,020
 - Oh, wow.

1158
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,780
 - Which feels more like a horror movie thing

1159
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,620
 than a sexy thing.

1160
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,460
 - Yeah.

1161
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,580
 That's why cats got in trouble.

1162
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,060
 'Cause they had a cat taking off his,

1163
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,420
 or a cat wearing a fur coat.

1164
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,700
 And I was like, where'd you get that fur coat?

1165
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,780
 What's the fur?

1166
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,620
 Do you remember?

1167
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,140
 Judy Dench in Cats is wearing a fur coat.

1168
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,060
 Is a cat, but she's also wearing a fur coat.

1169
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,980
 And everyone was like, well, that's a bit rum, isn't it?

1170
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,820
 - Is it?

1171
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,660
 - Oh.

1172
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,500
 - It's a bit rum.

1173
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,340
 - Anyway.

1174
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,180
 - Was it more or less controversial

1175
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,260
 than the huge M&M controversy?

1176
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,260
 - I mean, that's extremely controversial.

1177
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,100
 Well, let's be real.

1178
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,940
 They're just smarties, right?

1179
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,780
 They're just smarties.

1180
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,620
 - What?

1181
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,460
 - Oh, come on.

1182
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,140
 - Can I just say for legal reasons,

1183
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,820
 they are not just smarties.

1184
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,660
 - They are basically smarties.

1185
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,740
 - But also, don't they predate smarties?

1186
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,940
 - No, smarties just predate them.

1187
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,780
 - Okay.

1188
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,940
 - So Forrest Mars is the scion of the Mars dynasty.

1189
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,860
 He had broken with his family firm,

1190
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,340
 but he was of chocolate pedigree.

1191
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,940
 And he was in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.

1192
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,260
 Unclear why he felt the need to stick his beak

1193
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,220
 into the Spanish Civil War, but.

1194
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,180
 - There was a lot of beak sticking happening.

1195
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,020
 - So much.

1196
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,860
 - Next time.

1197
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,380
 He spent time with George Harris from Roundtree.

1198
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,820
 And the story, which may not be true, but it may,

1199
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,980
 is that he noticed some soldiers with smarties

1200
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,060
 and they have a hard candy shell.

1201
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,900
 They don't melt as in the fierce Spanish sun,

1202
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,860
 as easily as just normal chocolate would do.

1203
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,100
 And miraculously, he then thought of M&Ms.

1204
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,940
 What gave me the idea?

1205
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,260
 We'll never know.

1206
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,740
 - And he's one of the M's of M&Ms.

1207
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,340
 So it's Forrest Mars.

1208
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,900
 And then the other person is Bruce Murray,

1209
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,340
 who was part of Hershey's.

1210
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,860
 And it was a sort of collaboration, right?

1211
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,060
 Where they had the chocolate.

1212
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,740
 He had the idea stolen from the Spanish Civil War.

1213
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,540
 And then they came together.

1214
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,100
 - And that's why it's M&Ms, right?

1215
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,180
 So it's the apostrophe M means it belongs to both of them.

1216
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,420
 So it means M&Ms means belongs to Murray and Mars.

1217
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,500
 But that means that a single M&M,

1218
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,740
 that still belongs to them both, right?

1219
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,580
 - Sure.

1220
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,740
 - So that, I reckon a single M&M really should be an M&Ms,

1221
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,020
 because it belongs to Murray and Mars.

1222
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,300
 And that means I reckon a full packet of M&Ms

1223
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,380
 should be M&Ms's.

1224
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,380
 And that's what I will be asking for

1225
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,820
 in the shops from now on.

1226
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,060
 - Right.

1227
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,500
 - This is gonna be the next big controversy, isn't it?

1228
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,180
 - One panino and two M&Ms's is great.

1229
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,060
 I completely forgot to check something

1230
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,260
 speaking of the M's and the M's on the sweets.

1231
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,460
 And I meant to.

1232
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,020
 So sorry, I wouldn't normally ask the audience,

1233
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,580
 but if you are listening at home, please try it.

1234
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,620
 I read in either the Atlantic or the New York Times

1235
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,220
 that if you pour a packet of M&Ms into some beer,

1236
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,380
 the lettles will peel off from their shelves

1237
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,980
 and float around the beer on their own

1238
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,700
 like a goat trying to spell out a message.

1239
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,540
 - Ooh.

1240
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,380
 - Oh, really?

1241
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,620
 - What was it that the ghost was just saying?

1242
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
 - Mm, yeah.

1243
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,740
 - If that is, he's in a pint of beer, so.

1244
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,900
 - Yeah, that's true.

1245
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,340
 - I think, didn't they, they invented it

1246
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,340
 or they changed and innovated an existing machine

1247
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,860
 specifically to print the M onto the M&Ms?

1248
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,900
 - They're very secretive about their machines.

1249
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,740
 - Yeah, right.

1250
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,460
 - There are stories that if you're an engineer

1251
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,580
 and a machine goes wrong at the M&M factory,

1252
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,260
 that you're led in to repair it blindfolded.

1253
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,100
 - What?

1254
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,940
 - It's not clear at all.

1255
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,860
 - Is the point complete?

1256
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,980
 It's not a secret where it is in the factory.

1257
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,140
 And you can't fix it blindfolded, presumably.

1258
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,180
 - I don't know, I think not.

1259
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,620
 But suppose that maybe you don't see

1260
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,380
 the Oompa Loompas as you pass them by.

1261
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,220
 It's the idea.

1262
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,060
 - Right.

1263
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,980
 - But you'd hear them singing.

1264
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,060
 - You'd hear them singing.

1265
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,020
 - But they're really, like Forrest Mars,

1266
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,300
 we have mentioned before on the show, he was insane.

1267
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,860
 So if executives had meetings

1268
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,020
 with competitors or outsiders,

1269
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,700
 they would sometimes turn up in disguise

1270
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,460
 with a false moustache or whatever.

1271
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,700
 Supposedly even their bankers

1272
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,900
 don't have access to their financial records.

1273
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,740
 - What?

1274
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,060
 - Don't know what's going on there.

1275
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,900
 But he was a total recluse.

1276
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,220
 There are no photos of him.

1277
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,580
 Or there might have been one photo of him ever taken.

1278
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,420
 - Publicly.

1279
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,380
 - He might have a lot in his family album.

1280
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,220
 - Maybe.

1281
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,620
 - But yeah, he never wanted to be seen in public.

1282
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,660
 - Yeah, someone in 1999 tried to find out

1283
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,020
 the name of the president of the Mars company, right?

1284
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,780
 1999, no one knew the name of the president

1285
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,620
 of the Mars company, one of the biggest companies

1286
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,660
 on the planet.

1287
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,180
 A journalist phoned up and said,

1288
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,140
 "Can you tell me who's the president

1289
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,620
 "of the Mars company, please?"

1290
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,900
 Only to be told, "I'm sorry,

1291
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,900
 "I can't give out the names of our associates."

1292
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,020
 Phone was hung up.

1293
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,860
 - Really?

1294
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,900
 - They had a cult of total secrecy for a long time.

1295
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,540
 - Has that changed or is that still the case?

1296
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,100
 - It's still pretty much, it's his descendants

1297
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,940
 who are running the place now, right?

1298
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,780
 - Yeah, right.

1299
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,620
 - It's still very, very, it's a touch ship.

1300
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,460
 - Yeah.

1301
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,540
 - It's very clever what they did with M&Ms

1302
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,980
 with giving each of the M&Ms a different color

1303
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,860
 because the color became the personality

1304
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,900
 and hence people trying to fill in the gaps

1305
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,100
 and work out what they brought to the table.

1306
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,980
 And I was thinking, could we do that?

1307
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,620
 That doesn't work, 'cause we're a podcast.

1308
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,700
 We can't wear colors.

1309
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,100
 People won't be able to hear the colors.

1310
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,180
 And then I thought, actually,

1311
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,180
 someone did it for us the other day

1312
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,940
 because we were at a gig here in Australia

1313
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,740
 and someone gave us a little fanzine

1314
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,900
 that they've done of us by George Rex Comics

1315
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,460
 and they've actually given us words to define who we are.

1316
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,940
 - Well, you mean like the Spice Girls.

1317
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,340
 - Like the Spice Girls, exactly.

1318
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,300
 So that's how we need to exist, right?

1319
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,060
 So in this quiz, which member of No Such Thing

1320
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,340
 as a Fish are you?

1321
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,860
 Here are the four options for what we could be.

1322
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,060
 Sarcastic.

1323
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,700
 Northern.

1324
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,060
 (audience laughing)

1325
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,900
 Boring.

1326
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,980
 And an idiot.

1327
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,260
 That's devastatingly bad to write.

1328
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,180
 So we've got boring Spice, stupid Spice.

1329
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,460
 Sarky Spice.

1330
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,780
 And Scow Spice.

1331
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,060
 (audience laughing)

1332
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,900
 Northern Spice.

1333
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,220
 - Scow Spice, great.

1334
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,700
 - No, I was trying to think of another S

1335
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,540
 that was in the North.

1336
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,380
 I got it wrong.

1337
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,100
 - Sounds like a really great quiz, Dan.

1338
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,580
 And really relevant as well.

1339
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,420
 - That was great.

1340
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,700
 - I'm stuck 'cause I'm sarcastic.

1341
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,540
 - Oh, yeah.

1342
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,380
 - I'm such an idiot.

1343
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,620
 I had no idea that you were.

1344
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,260
 - Hey, hop, hey, hop, let's get on with it.

1345
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,600
 - I can't think of anything interesting to add.

1346
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,600
 (audience laughing)

1347
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,300
 - Let's talk about Eminence a bit more.

1348
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,020
 - Can we talk about Van Halen?

1349
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,860
 The thing.

1350
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,700
 - Oh.

1351
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,540
 - Oh, of course, yeah.

1352
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,660
 - 'Cause we're on tour, and they toured,

1353
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,940
 and so basically we were rock band.

1354
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,780
 This is a really interesting thing about, you know,

1355
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,940
 supposedly Van Halen, when the rock big rock band

1356
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,220
 in the '70s, '80s, they had a line in the rider

1357
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,180
 which said, we want a bowl of Eminence

1358
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,780
 with all the brown Eminence removed, right?

1359
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,220
 That is a story that has done the rounds

1360
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,300
 for such a long time.

1361
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,340
 And the story was, it was so they were checking

1362
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,020
 that the venue was reading the rider in full

1363
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,340
 and doing everything right,

1364
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,140
 so that all the amps were in the right place

1365
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,260
 and the lights, it was actually a way of testing

1366
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,980
 to make sure the venue were reading and paying attention.

1367
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,420
 That has been turned on its head.

1368
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,020
 This is the exciting thing, double debunk.

1369
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,580
 I was reading Doug Max Snack Stack,

1370
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,300
 which is a food and snack-based blog

1371
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,460
 and is terrific.

1372
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,460
 It's so good.

1373
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,860
 - All right, barring spice.

1374
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,860
 (audience laughing)

1375
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,420
 - So the story A is just, they've got a big ego.

1376
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,500
 Story B is that it's actually more complicated,

1377
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,900
 but story C, think about it.

1378
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,020
 The person whose job is to remove all the brown Eminence,

1379
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,580
 it's not the same as the person whose job is to check

1380
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,700
 the amps or the safety of the overall gig.

1381
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,000
 That's an insane way of trying to ensure

1382
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,700
 the safety and actually they caused huge amounts

1383
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,020
 of damage to dressing rooms.

1384
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,060
 Like when they found some brown Eminence at a gig once,

1385
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,940
 they caused 100 grand of damage to a dining room.

1386
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,360
 It now seems that they were just being wankers, so.

1387
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,700
 - Right.

1388
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,340
 - So why are we assuming that?

1389
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,380
 Just 'cause they trashed the place.

1390
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,860
 They could have been trashing it because they were pissed off,

1391
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,700
 they hadn't read the rider.

1392
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,780
 - They trashed the place, but also based on their quotes,

1393
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,260
 it sounds like they genuinely did want it.

1394
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,580
 It was kind of a way of throwing it around.

1395
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,380
 'Cause also by the time anyone knows about it,

1396
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,940
 it's no longer an effective test

1397
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,500
 of whether a venue has read the rider.

1398
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,680
 - So it seems like it has been double debunked, yeah.

1399
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,720
 - Double debunked, you heard it here first.

1400
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,960
 Do you want to know something about blue Eminence?

1401
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,800
 No one got much of a look in.

1402
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,720
 The dye in blue Eminence could repair your spine

1403
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,320
 if your spine is damaged, but it might turn you blue.

1404
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,720
 And this is a really, the dye is called Brilliant Blue G.

1405
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,080
 And like scientists were just testing,

1406
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,960
 studying it a few years ago, and they realized

1407
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,080
 it blocks a chemical that makes your injuries worse

1408
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,120
 if you've got a spinal injury.

1409
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,620
 So it blocks a chemical that causes inflammation.

1410
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,980
 So it basically means that you don't get

1411
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,940
 the horrible repercussions of a spinal injury

1412
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,020
 that you otherwise would.

1413
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,180
 And they're looking into it, but the only thing is

1414
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,580
 that it does turn you a bit blue.

1415
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,940
 At the moment, if you're a rat, but we do know

1416
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,940
 that that could be the case.

1417
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,540
 And it just reminded me of another dye sweet base story

1418
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,340
 that I loved that came out recently,

1419
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,860
 which is that the food dye in Doritos

1420
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,820
 and pretty much any other yellow thing,

1421
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,640
 like macaroni and cheese, any yellow gummies,

1422
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,440
 Cheetos, cereals.

1423
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,280
 - Twisties.

1424
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,880
 - Twisties, sure.

1425
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,960
 Are they yellow?

1426
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,160
 (audience cheers)

1427
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,000
 - Orangey, yeah.

1428
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,720
 - Twisties, Orangeyna, it makes mice transparent,

1429
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,840
 the dye in that.

1430
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,400
 And they think there's no reason why it wouldn't also

1431
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,080
 make humans transparent.

1432
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,440
 - Not if they eat it, right?

1433
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,400
 - No, if you rub it on their skin, sorry.

1434
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,560
 - No way.

1435
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,400
 - Yes?

1436
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,480
 - Are we surrounded by invisible mice now?

1437
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,160
 (audience laughs)

1438
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,660
 - They've been rubbed with Cheeto dust.

1439
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,500
 - We don't, you know.

1440
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,240
 - They're not empty on the inside, Andy.

1441
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,240
 You would see, okay, you would see a big bag of mouse.

1442
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,020
 - It's Hellraiser for mice, yeah.

1443
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,100
 - So how many Doritos do I have to rub on myself tonight?

1444
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,100
 - Well, just keep trying, James,

1445
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,820
 and eventually you will go transparent.

1446
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,660
 - There are two brands of chocolate milk in Australia

1447
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,260
 that are made from cows that eat chocolate.

1448
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,540
 - What?

1449
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,060
 It doesn't come out when you milk them as chocolate milk.

1450
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,900
 - Does it?

1451
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,520
 Is that what we're saying?

1452
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,240
 - No, that is definitely not what I said.

1453
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,080
 - Okay.

1454
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,720
 - It was confusing, is chocolate made from the cows?

1455
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,280
 - Chocolate milk is made from the milk

1456
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,080
 from cows that eat chocolate.

1457
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,120
 - But you have led Dan up the garden path, haven't you?

1458
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,320
 - Is the milk any different to standard milk?

1459
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
 - No, no.

1460
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,160
 It's just milk.

1461
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,640
 It's just a coincidence, really.

1462
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,160
 But you get these brands of chocolate milk.

1463
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,740
 It's cartons of farmers union and purer flavored milks.

1464
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,500
 And the cows that they take the milk from

1465
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,940
 are fed with stuff from the nearby Cadbury factory

1466
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,580
 that's just like offshoots that they don't need anymore

1467
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,260
 because it's a really easy way of giving cows energy.

1468
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,180
 - So it's kind of the circular economy.

1469
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,140
 'Cause some of that milk will have been in,

1470
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,620
 some of the milk in the chocolate will have been in a cow.

1471
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,660
 - That's true.

1472
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,160
 - It's a closed system.

1473
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,600
 - We've solved sustainability.

1474
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,320
 (audience laughing)

1475
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,360
 Just feed the cows some chocolate.

1476
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,380
 (upbeat music)

1477
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,760
 - Okay, everyone, that is it.

1478
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,120
 That is all of our facts.

1479
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,800
 Thank you so much for listening.

1480
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,760
 Sydney, you've been awesome.

1481
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,400
 Thank you so much for having us.

1482
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,800
 We will be back again.

1483
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,640
 (audience cheering)

1484
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,500
 And until then, we will see you.

1485
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,820
 Goodbye!

1486
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,820
 (audience cheering)

1487
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,400
 (upbeat music)

1488
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,740
 (upbeat music)

1489
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,320
 (upbeat music)

1490
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:40,320
