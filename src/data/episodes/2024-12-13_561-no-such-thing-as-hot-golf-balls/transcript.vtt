00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.360
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.140
 This one comes to you from the State Theater in Sydney.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.540
 It's part of our massive Aussie and New Zealand tour

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 that we just finished.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740
 We had an absolutely incredible time

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.280
 while we were down there, as we did in the UK.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.260
 But the tour down under had one extra special element

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 that we didn't quite manage for the UK,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.700
 which was we had merch.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.100
 We had awesome Thundernerd t-shirts to go

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.060
 with the title of our show.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.020
 We had Thundernerd beanies.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.620
 We were selling our ultimate guide

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.940
 and no such thing as a fish tour book.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.420
 Which by the way, if you haven't got,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.900
 you really need to get your hands on.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.940
 It's got everything from a spread on Moss by Andy

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.580
 and his only day on Twitter.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.740
 There's timelines of everything that we've done.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.260
 We've got bios on every guest who's been on there.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.740
 There's a lot of behind the scenes.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.500
 In fact, there's a bunch of QR codes

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.620
 all throughout the book as well

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.820
 that has secret videos that we've never published anywhere.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.420
 And audio commentary from us.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.300
 So it's sort of a mini episode

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.860
 within the pages of the book.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.820
 Anyway, along with some pin badges,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.860
 all of that is available on our website.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.020
 Go to nosuchthingasafish.com/store.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.900
 And if you get in there quick enough,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260
 you're gonna be able to buy some of that swag

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.220
 just in time for Christmas.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980
 Now, if you're an Aussie in New Zealand

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.580
 are listening to this right now and thinking,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.620
 damn it, I didn't pick up anything at the gigs

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.020
 and now we've gotta buy it back from over in the UK.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.940
 Don't worry, we've got you covered.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.660
 Just head to the website and you will find a link there

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.940
 that is specifically for you Antipodians

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.860
 so that you can deal with it more locally.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.540
 Now, if you're looking for a good book

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.300
 to read over the Christmas period,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.740
 I highly recommend our books.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.620
 We're all authors.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.860
 We released books this year

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.300
 and he has a new comic novel called

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.860
 A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.020
 Brilliantly funny.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.900
 James Inanna wrote a fact-packed book

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.540
 which is the QI history of sports

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.860
 called A Load of Old Balls.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.900
 And I've written a non-fiction book for kids

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.220
 ages seven and above,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.020
 all about the mysteries of our universe

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.300
 called Impossible Things.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.660
 Okay, that's it for plugging.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.540
 A lot of plugging there.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.940
 But hey, you're a popular person.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.180
 You've got a lot of presents to buy.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420
 So there you go, problem solved.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.620
 Anyway, enjoy the show now,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.060
 coming to you from down under on with the podcast.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:25.460
 Hello and welcome!

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.140
 To another episode of None Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.260
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.460
 from the State Theater in Sydney!

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.180
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.340
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.820
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.140
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.300
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.900
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.580
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.580
 My fact this week is that in 1944,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.140
 the filming of the Oscar-winning movie National Velvet

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.340
 was delayed to give its lead actress

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.420
 time to grow a bit taller.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.300
 (audience laughing)

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.660
 Ah!

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.580
 And who was that?

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.780
 She's, no one's heard of her now,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.700
 so it's not worth mentioning,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.340
 but she was called Elizabeth Taylor.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.620
 (audience laughing)

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.140
 Yeah, this is one of her first films.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.060
 Did she fluctuate in height a lot, Elizabeth Taylor?

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.820
 Yeah, she was 35 at the time,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.300
 but sometimes she'd wake up six foot tall, sometimes five.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.060
 No, she was obviously, she was still a child,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.340
 she was about 12 at the time,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.020
 and this was a, so every child actress

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.020
 was trying out for this part.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.340
 And I think they've been preparing for years,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.380
 so a few of the tryouts were adults

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.260
 by the time they finally cast it.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.100
 And the--

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.700
 How much did she need to make it into the movie?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.580
 Well, she needed, it's a Pando Berman,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.260
 who was the producer, met her,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.140
 and thought she's absolutely perfect,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.420
 need her, but she needs three inches.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.900
 Right. Which is a hefty whack, really.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.740
 That is.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.740
 It's a decent amount.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.540
 They also, they asked her to wear braces.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.660
 I think tooth braces, not up and down ones.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.180
 And they pulled out two of her baby teeth.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.020
 What?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.820
 Yep, they also wanted to dye her hair,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.140
 seems like a minor imposition

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.020
 after they've pulled out two of your teeth.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.820
 And they wanted to change her name to Virginia,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.420
 but her parents refused.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.980
 And because they were really struggling

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.340
 to get the right actress for this role,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.220
 what they needed was a child

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.460
 who could speak with an English accent and ride a horse.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.700
 That was the whole brief.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.220
 But what's incredibly confusing,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.500
 'cause this is always the claim,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500
 is that the basis for it was she was very good at riding,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.580
 and we'll probably go into her relationship with horses,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.780
 which wasn't weird, like I've just made it sound.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.820
 And she was very good at riding,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.860
 and she had been born,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.820
 and a bit of her life brought up in England,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.980
 so she needed a British accent.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.620
 Now, if anyone's seen "National Velvet",

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.180
 she does not talk with a British accent

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.420
 at any point during that film.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.060
 So I'm not sure why it was a thing

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.380
 she needed to have in her backpack, just in case.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.220
 - Yeah, who knows?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.100
 - Yeah, she got a very bad back

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.300
 when she was riding King Charles,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.660
 which was the name of the horse, King Charles.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.500
 - It sure was.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.260
 - And she loved it so much that the head of MGM,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.700
 Louis B. Mayer, gave it to her as a 13th birthday gift.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.500
 - Oh wow, that's amazing.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.300
 - Did you read about how they met?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.140
 - No.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.780
 - Her and King Charles, it's so sweet.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.780
 It's like something in a film itself.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.140
 So she had been taken to go riding at this country club

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.300
 by her parents to try and teach her to ride,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.540
 and she'd seen this beautiful horse from afar,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.940
 fallen in love with him, said, "I must ride that horse."

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.540
 This is an 11-year-old girl.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.180
 The owner had said, "This horse is mad, it's my horse.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.940
 "Literally won't let anyone near it."

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.020
 She waited until everyone had left,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.980
 and then she climbed onto the hay bales

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.740
 and jumped through the hole where they fed the horse hay,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.260
 landing on his back, and she just lay on his back.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.660
 Just lay there in the stable,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.420
 and she did this day after day after day

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.580
 until eventually the owner one day went in to ride him

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.900
 and was like, "There's an 11-year-old on my horse.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.100
 "What's going on?"

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.380
 And said, "Okay, well, she's obviously tamed him

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.940
 "and handed him over."

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.940
 It was a beautiful tale, true love.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.460
 - She, her looks, we've mentioned a few things

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.540
 about what they wanted her to do,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.420
 moving the baby teeth, she needed more height.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.380
 When she was born, the doctor said to her mom,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.140
 "You've given birth to a mutant."

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.660
 - They didn't say those words, Dan.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.180
 - They did. - I refuse to believe.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.020
 - They did.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.260
 - But it's what she has in common with you.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.100
 - What?

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.700
 - Elizabeth, so I think I know what you're gonna say.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.900
 - So do I, but I don't think Dan has this.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.820
 - Dan, okay, it feels like all four of us

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.900
 are holding a hand of cards about what mutation,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.260
 Elizabeth and Dan, what I'm saying is excess hair,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.980
 but it's distributed differently on the two of them.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.500
 So, Dan, a suit man.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.340
 - Yeah. - I mean, big, big time.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.180
 - Yeah.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.460
 - 'Cause we're looking at a picture

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.780
 of Elizabeth Taylor on here,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.340
 and she doesn't quite have Dan's hairiness.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.180
 - No, but interestingly, that's me next to her naked.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.580
 (laughing)

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.220
 - We should save the listeners at home

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.980
 that that is Lassie, you know, don't we?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.260
 - But okay, so what she did have is,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.140
 she had a double set of eyelashes.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.980
 So her mom was like, "Oh, that's okay, that's fine."

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.980
 But it can be dangerous,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.860
 because it can be a condition

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.500
 where if the second layer of eyelash grows inward,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.340
 it can go into your eyeballs,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.940
 and a very low percentage of people who have had it

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.340
 have died of heart disease later in life,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.140
 which is how she died,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.060
 but I don't know if the connection has been made.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.860
 - Because it's a genetic thing, isn't it?

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.200
 That makes it happen. - Yeah, exactly.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.460
 - Yeah, it's a gene called Foxy2.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.500
 - Yeah, it's so cool! - Yeah, F-O-X-C2.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.860
 - Do you know one other thing about her face

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.700
 that she also had?

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.420
 She once, supposedly, I've read this in a few places,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.140
 won the title Most Memorable Eyebrows in a magazine poll,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.300
 and Lassie came second.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.420
 - No! - Yeah!

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.420
 - The dogs, sorry.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.540
 Just, the dogs have eyebrows?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.140
 Well, let's look. - Yeah, of course they do.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.580
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.740
 - I would say if the two people on screen,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.100
 Elizabeth Taylor's are more pronounced.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.140
 - Yeah. - But yeah,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.820
 certainly they have the rich, don't they, the dogs?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.660
 - Yeah, they do.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.420
 - So, I mean, Lassie was one of her first big hits,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.260
 wasn't it, Elizabeth Taylor?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.420
 - Yeah, it was basically Lassie first,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.420
 then National Velvet.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.180
 She did a very strong line in animal-based films, yeah.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.820
 - Yeah, and the dog was played by a dog called Pal,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.780
 and Pal earned a salary of $250 per week,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.980
 while Elizabeth Taylor was only paid $100 per week.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.220
 But the dog actually was male,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.180
 so it was kinda standard for the time.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.700
 (audience laughing)

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.340
 - So, obviously, for anyone under the age of 70,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.820
 we should just say that she's, you know,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.460
 in case you're not familiar with her stuff,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.180
 she's unbelievably famous throughout the 20th century.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.620
 Not only for her films, things like "Clear Patra,"

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.020
 which was the extremely famous one,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.580
 but lots and lots more,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.980
 but for having seven husbands and eight marriages.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.940
 - Yes. - 'Cause he's married

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.060
 to Richard Burton, twice.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.380
 - Was that his accent, or did he just have a weird throw?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.220
 - It wasn't his accent.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.420
 (audience laughing)

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.020
 Just stuffed out, sorry.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.700
 (audience laughing)

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.740
 And Richard Burton, as well, she was Welsh.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.820
 He was Welsh, that was not Welsh.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.820
 Anyway, the list of her husbands is so extraordinary,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.260
 because it goes through all of these, you know,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
 her first marriage was to this horrible guy

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.740
 called Conrad Hilton, who was the hotel chain,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.180
 she was 18 years old.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.380
 MGM picked the bridesmaids and invited the guests for her.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.660
 - So, she would have been step-mom,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.460
 eventually, or step-grandmother, to Paris Hilton, right?

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.700
 'Cause she married Eddie Fisher, as well, right?

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.260
 Eddie Fisher, who was mother of Carrie Fisher,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.740
 so she was step-mother to Princess Leia.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.220
 - Yeah, you find it, it's weird when you research people

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.420
 like this, because you find yourself getting

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.020
 into very heat magazine territory with celebrity gossip,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.900
 but it feels okay, 'cause it was 50 years ago,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.900
 but I found myself finding it so juicy

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.500
 that when she married Conrad Hilton,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.300
 Conrad himself was actually having an affair at the time

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.020
 with his own stepmother, Jean-Jacques Gabor.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.660
 - What? - Whoa!

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.980
 - Chajar's in the story, mate.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.340
 - Chajar. - Chajar Gabor.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.180
 - Yeah. - The woman

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.780
 who introduced the Rubik's Cube to America.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.900
 - Exactly, she's not just famous for that, James.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.500
 - She's famous for something else.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.060
 - Is that why you were fired from Heat Magazine, James?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.820
 (all laughing)

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.540
 - Chajar Gabor can fit into over 4 trillion positions.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.820
 (all laughing)

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.660
 - I wonder he liked her.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.900
 - Chajar, all their marriages,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.220
 they're obviously quite high-profile,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.300
 but the double marriage, the most famous one,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.300
 Richard Burton, like that one,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.740
 that one was the most interesting,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.540
 because those two ran Hollywood

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.020
 as if they were the king and queen of America.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.700
 They would go into parties,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.700
 they would spend ludicrous amounts of money on it,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.740
 they would have weird reasons for leaving parties,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.900
 and they would tear up rooms, they would have tantrums,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.740
 and no one seemed to do anything about it.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.100
 And so her life, Elizabeth Taylor's life,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.660
 really when you read the juicy stuff,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.020
 it's all about the divaism, all about the amazing demands.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.380
 Like for example, in Cleopatra,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.660
 when they were filming that,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.540
 she had twice a week delivered to her on set

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.220
 her local favorite meal from Dave Chasen's "Chili",

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.460
 because she just loved it so much.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.100
 And what made that really difficult is

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.500
 that restaurant was in LA, and she was filming in Rome.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.820
 So they got it on airplanes twice to three times a week,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.820
 just her meal to be delivered to her for lunch.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.180
 - It was so bad that the Vatican stepped in,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.260
 didn't they, and the Pope accused her

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.460
 of erotic vagrancy, her and Richard Burton actually.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.340
 And there's an amazing scene in Cleopatra

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.060
 where she's coming into, spoiler alert,

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.340
 coming into the city on a big chair,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.940
 and there's huge crowds, and apparently there was a moment

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.340
 where all of these extras who were all Italian Catholics

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.180
 are starting to come towards her,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.620
 and she thinks they're gonna lynch her

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.340
 because it's been in all the newspapers

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.980
 that the Pope hates her.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.380
 And then just in the last second,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.180
 they all turn round and go, "Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!"

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.620
 And they just loved her so much.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.980
 - Wow.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.540
 - The filming of that is absolutely insane,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.500
 because they tried filming in London, it didn't work.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.020
 It started Jackie Chan, a woman called Jackie Chan.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.180
 - That's so funny.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.740
 - There are so many stories of the filming

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.060
 because they could only film if Burton and Taylor

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.460
 both showed up, and if they had had a row the night before,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.500
 they just wouldn't.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.740
 So the production overran like crazy.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.820
 This is a story from Jackie Chan.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.700
 There was a scene where Cleopatra has a bath on set,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.700
 and the set was cleared of all superfluous people,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.900
 she reported, but a Scottish actor

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.140
 who played a blind poet gleefully told me

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.540
 he was allowed to stay because people had forgotten

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.980
 he wasn't really blind.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.980
 (audience laughing)

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.340
 - That's very funny.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.180
 On their mad demands, they both loved animals,

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.980
 Richard Burton loved dogs, she loved dogs.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.060
 There was a story going around that the dogs

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.580
 that they had liked her more than they liked him,

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.740
 so he bought a dog and it suddenly liked him

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.540
 more than it liked her, and everyone was like,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.380
 what's going on?

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.300
 And then his diaries later reported

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.740
 that the dog had come and it only spoke Welsh,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.340
 and Richard Burton spoke Welsh to it secretly,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.500
 but I couldn't verify that firsthand,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.980
 but I wouldn't put it past them,

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.980
 but they did both love dogs, and they were staying

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.660
 in the UK and they weren't allowed to bring

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.860
 their dogs to London because of quarantine rules,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.380
 so they found a loophole in the law,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.700
 which said that there was no rule

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.700
 that the animals couldn't be on British waters,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.500
 and they leased a yacht for $20,000,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.820
 I think huge amounts of money, about $2,000 a day,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.060
 and moored it on the Thames and just kept these dogs

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.700
 on the Thames on a luxury yacht.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.340
 - Yeah, it's very clever.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.660
 She did a lot of crazy and weird things, right,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.020
 but one thing that she also did is she saved the life

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.420
 of an extremely famous actor at the time.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.820
 She was at a party with a man called Montgomery Cliff,

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.260
 and they were on the way home,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.460
 and she was in the car behind, he was in the car in front.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.260
 He had a massive accident, car flips over,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.580
 smashes, and he's trapped underneath.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.260
 She gets out of her car, she goes and climbs in

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.020
 through the broken window in the car to see him,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.740
 and he's choking, and so she does something

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.780
 which I think is extraordinary.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.420
 Most people would do like a Heimlich maneuver, right?

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.100
 Most people would tap the back like crazy.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.780
 Elizabeth Taylor reaches into his mouth,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.380
 and because the thing that was choking him

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.860
 was broken teeth stuck in his throat,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.060
 she individually picked out all the teeth from his mouth

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.540
 until his airway was cleared,

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.300
 so he could breathe again, saved his life.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.140
 - That's stunning.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.340
 - I've never heard of a choking being fixed

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.660
 by a hand down the mountain.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.940
 - I've heard once there was a dolphin

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.700
 who had swallowed some plastic,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.780
 and the world's second tallest man

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.580
 went in with his rarely long arms and pulled the plastic out.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.420
 - That's nice.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.460
 - But I kind of think dolphins have wider mouths than humans.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.300
 - Yeah.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.460
 - This really doesn't fit.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.020
 I don't think, if Andy, you had something in your mouth,

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.700
 and I'm looking at my hand and the size of your mouth,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.340
 I don't think one fits into the other.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.700
 - It wasn't down in his ringtone.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.300
 It was very, it was quite shallow in the mouth.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.540
 - She had waited for her fingers to grow long enough.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.780
 - Yes.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.620
 - That's the thing.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.460
 - That's what happened.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.300
 There we go.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.880
 (upbeat music)

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:25.220
 - It is time for us to move on to fact number two,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.700
 and that is my fact.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.740
 My fact this week is that one of the leading investigators

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.920
 in the Jack the Ripper case,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.220
 whose only major contribution was to arrest someone

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.260
 who wasn't capable of being the murderer,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.500
 was called Sergeant Thick.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.540
 - That was the guy.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.040
 - Sergeant, yeah, Sergeant William Thick, or Willie Thick,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.300
 which is just funny.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.140
 He basically, yeah, he knocked on the door

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.500
 of a guy called John Pizer, or Pizzar,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.620
 and he said, "You need to come with me."

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.300
 And the person said, "What for?"

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.820
 And Sergeant Thick, having no evidence,

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.540
 clearly didn't know what for,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.580
 so he'd had to say, "You know what for?"

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.740
 And the guy went with him,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.500
 and he was put into jail, and then he was released

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.220
 because there was no evidence whatsoever

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.660
 that this guy was guilty,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.500
 and Thick, even himself, when he was interviewed later,

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.620
 saying, "Yeah, I don't think it could have been him.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.140
 "I don't think he was capable of it.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.580
 "I don't know why I did that."

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.460
 So, yeah. - Oh, wow.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:35.460
 - We should just say Jack the Ripper was a murderer,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.100
 'cause I know we're in Australia,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.340
 and Ripper means something very different over here.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.580
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.220
 Yeah, it was not cool, this guy, yeah.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.660
 And by the way, this is a subject

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.900
 which obviously involves horrific events,

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.980
 and we are probably gonna be talking largely

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.060
 about the people who were named as potential killers

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.380
 and so on, but just as a flip side thing,

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.060
 there's an amazing book called "The Five"

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.820
 that you should go and read, which is all about the women

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.460
 who often don't get humanized in this,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.140
 and yeah, it's an amazing book.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.900
 - So, Mary Jane Kelly, she was known in the press

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.660
 as Fair Emma, Ginger, Dark Mary, and Black Mary,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.740
 suggesting that she must have changed her hair quite a lot

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.140
 at the various times. - Very nice.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.180
 - There was Annie Chapman, who got into a fight

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.260
 with a female lodger just before she died,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.860
 possibly over a man or possibly over a bar of soap.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.700
 We're not sure.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.060
 - They are often confused, I find.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.580
 - There was Elizabeth Stride, who was Swedish,

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.780
 and she went around telling everyone that her husband

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.220
 and her child had died in a shipwreck on the River Thames

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.220
 that she survived it,

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.020
 but actually there was no such shipwreck.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.580
 - I have a theory about her.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.620
 Well, I have a theory about who the killer is,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.700
 because I don't think we have enough people theorizing

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.420
 about who the killer was, and it's related to her,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.580
 because she lived with a man called Michael Kidney,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.940
 now Jack the Ripper, famously removed people's kidneys.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.860
 - Oh. - Okay, coincidence.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.700
 - Probably.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.580
 - I don't think so. - Almost certainly.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.260
 Otherwise, you're just going around looking for someone

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.180
 with the surname Murderer, I think, is the--

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.420
 - Did anyone try that? - I don't think so.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.660
 But the women are kind of, they were written up,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.100
 a lot of it was done, it was made very,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.300
 you know, it was made exciting, it was made to sell papers.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.180
 There were so many London papers at the time,

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.580
 about 20 daily papers, all trying to get information

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.820
 and sell copies off the back of it.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.820
 So they were often written up as low women,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.940
 or fallen women, or women who sold sex,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.180
 and actually, like one or two of them had done,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.220
 or may have done, but actually,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.860
 most of them were out late at night.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.420
 - Yeah, not that there should be any remote difference

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.940
 between someone who sells sex with money,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.100
 and doesn't sell sex with money,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.020
 in terms of whether or not they should be murdered.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.660
 But yeah. - I wasn't trying

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.500
 to imply the word. - No, no, no, no.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.020
 I just, I think there's a bit of an implication of that.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.660
 - They couldn't afford lodging some of them,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.540
 and so that's why the killer had the sort of means,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.420
 or the opportunity to kill them.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.580
 Yeah, so Jack the Ripper,

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.940
 I think this is quite a fun little detail.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.260
 (audience laughing)

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.020
 There's so many fun details about the guy.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.780
 In a poll in 2006,

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.060
 he was voted the worst Britain in history.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.900
 (audience laughing)

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.500
 - That was before Brexit, though.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.340
 - It was.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.380
 (audience laughing)

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.460
 That's true, yeah.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.420
 - Who else was in there?

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.500
 Do you have any details of who else came?

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.380
 - Yeah, I've got them, if you want them.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.540
 So Thomas Beckett came second.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.380
 - Thomas Beckett?

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.620
 - Yeah, King John came fourth.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.940
 - When was this poll done in the 12th century?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.300
 (audience laughing)

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.380
 - King John Fair.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.660
 - Yeah, Edric Striota.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.660
 - Who's that?

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.660
 - Good question.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.820
 (audience laughing)

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.860
 Sir Richard Rich, Lord Rich of Lees.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.300
 - I don't like the sound of him based on his name,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.940
 but I don't know.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.300
 - Hugh Dispenser, the younger who you might know,

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.060
 autonomous of Rundle, and Oswald Mosley.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.900
 - Oh, okay.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.740
 - And a few others.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.100
 But basically the way that they did it is,

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.580
 they got a load of historians,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.020
 and they were each allowed to nominate one person.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.340
 And so some of them went really straight down the line

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.540
 and said, "Jack the Ripper,"

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.460
 and some of them said,

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.980
 "Here's someone you've never heard of."

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.260
 - Hugh Dispenser.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.820
 (audience laughing)

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.300
 - You know all those anti-COVID things you see everywhere?

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.140
 - Yeah.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:14.980
 - He invented those.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.820
 - That's great.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.660
 - It's an easy gig for their story to get,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.860
 "Jack the Ripper," isn't it?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.300
 They murdered loads of people, pulled their organs out.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.140
 I win.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.180
 - Yeah, that's the thing about the case,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.940
 is that a lot of people get very obsessed with it,

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.300
 and I think it's a slightly unhealthy way.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.860
 And it's written up sometimes as the first ever

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.180
 true crime story, you know,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.900
 just because there were lots of people

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.100
 chucking in their own theories

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.540
 and debating with each other and all of that,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.460
 and slightly sort of gamifying it.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.620
 One of those theorized to have maybe been the murderer

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.420
 was Dr. Thomas Creme,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.380
 who was a doctor who was eventually hanged

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.660
 for an unrelated murder at Newgate Prison.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.780
 And his last words were,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.340
 "I am Jack the..."

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.340
 (audience laughing)

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.740
 And then he was hanged.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.580
 - No!

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.420
 - Yeah.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.380
 But it probably wasn't him, but--

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.420
 - Was that bad timing, or?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.700
 - I think it was incredible timing by him.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.540
 - I think--

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.140
 - So he saw the lever going down, so.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.980
 - Wow.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.140
 - Because he was in prison at the time the murders happened.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.940
 I mean, it's just very, very, very unlikely

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.780
 that he was actually--

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.620
 - Yeah.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.860
 - I think he was just--

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.700
 - He just had flair.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.540
 - He's just--

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.380
 - I think he just had flair.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.260
 - Having a bit of fun right at the end.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.780
 - It was just happening.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.740
 - Why the hell not?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.580
 - Yeah.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.980
 - The industry is pretty wild in the UK,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.900
 and Jack the Ripper Tours are quite mad,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.300
 but my favorite tour is a tour

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.420
 that was set up in about 2017 in Clithero,

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.180
 which, for those of you who don't know the UK,

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.980
 is in Lancashire, about 250 miles away from Whitechapel.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.340
 It's the Jack the Ripper tour.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.100
 It was started by a tour guy called Simon Entwistle,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.100
 who just sort of noticed that bits of Clithero,

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.780
 actually, they haven't been developed very much

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.900
 since the 19th century,

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.060
 so they look a lot more like what Jack the Ripper

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.900
 would have experienced than London.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.380
 - Yeah, 'cause that bit of London

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.620
 is completely developed now.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.460
 It's all skyscrapers.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.220
 - Yeah, I gotta say, having grown up near Clithero,

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.340
 or as we used to call it, Clithero,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.900
 (laughing)

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.580
 - It's a very nice little town.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.100
 - I stopped after Guitar Hero.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.700
 I just didn't think.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.500
 - Well, it's much more difficult figuring on that one.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.540
 (laughing)

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.460
 - And you never get any points

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.340
 'cause you can't find the fucking thing.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.580
 (laughing)

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.460
 - How interesting, Clithero.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.820
 - Yeah, that's really, there are all sorts of,

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.940
 there's slightly sort of unpleasant,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.700
 they're like, okay, is this tasteless?

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.900
 Efficient chip shop called Jack the Chipper.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.500
 (laughing)

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.740
 Is it, like, you know, some people say

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.420
 it's been long enough and that's fine.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.620
 The proprietor said it was history, never a celebration,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.220
 which, and then they said,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.660
 we've already shown our respectfulness

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.940
 by offering a 50% discount for women.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.820
 Which, is that okay?

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.140
 - We chopped them in half as soon as they come in.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.940
 My favorite theory about Jack the Ripper

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.940
 is that there was no such person.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.780
 - Okay.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.980
 - And this is the one I actually believe.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.620
 This is a guy called Peter Turnbull

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.380
 who wrote a book called The Killer That Never Was.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.740
 His idea is that these people obviously

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.100
 were very sadly killed,

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.580
 but a lot of them were copycat crimes.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.860
 And they were done by people who'd read the stories

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.220
 in the newspaper and thought,

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.660
 I'm gonna go and do that same thing.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.020
 So there wasn't a single serial killer.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.540
 And his theories say that there was no consistent

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.580
 modus operandi, so the way that the people were killed

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.020
 was different each time.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.940
 It wasn't over an extended period,

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.420
 so normally serial killers kill over several years,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.860
 whereas this only happened over 13 weeks.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.780
 And it all took place in a very single area,

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.220
 whereas usually serial killers will kill over

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.260
 a little bit more of a wide area.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.100
 - Okay.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.860
 - And some of the really terrible things,

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.540
 like that when they were disembowelled the victims,

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.220
 they occurred after people in the newspapers

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.060
 had speculated that that might happen.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.900
 - Right.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.740
 - Right.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.580
 - So that's, I think that might-

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.180
 - So the first one wasn't?

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.940
 - The first one wasn't disembowelling.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.820
 - 'Cause she was the one who drew lots of tourists, right?

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.900
 The industry's been going on since the start.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.820
 As soon as the first person was killed.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.060
 I think it was the second person when people started to think,

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.940
 "Ooh, something's going on here."

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.460
 It was in 1888, and locals paid a penny

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.140
 to go and see her there.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.860
 And then when she was taken away,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.420
 then locals kept paying a penny,

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.780
 and it was the people who lived next door,

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.260
 which good business minds started charging people

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.060
 just to come and look at the bit of pavement.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.900
 - Right.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.740
 - Wow.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.340
 - And there's quite a few other people

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.260
 who were being named, obviously, there's a big, big list.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.820
 There was a guy, this was a big one,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.740
 Francis Tumblety, which is the most

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.540
 un-serial killer name I've ever heard.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.380
 Take a tea.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.540
 - Again, you can't really judge people by their name.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.540
 (laughing)

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.180
 - I'm gonna judge Francis, I think.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.300
 So he was supposedly, not only was he Jack the Ripper,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.420
 but he was also complicit in the assassination

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.820
 of Abraham Lincoln.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.820
 So supposedly he'd done that and he'd come over.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.660
 But what he was was a miracle quack.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.260
 He just used to sell medicine.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.980
 His big invention was called Tumblety's Pimple Destroyer.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.900
 - So even if he was guilty, he did some good

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.340
 and he did some bad, right?

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.100
 - I mean, Deadpool's are a real blight.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.940
 - There you go.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.060
 - A lot of adolescents.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.740
 - Have you heard of Richard Mansfield?

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.300
 - Oh, the actor?

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.100
 - He was an actor who got caught up in this completely.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.940
 This was nothing to do with him.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.020
 But at the time the murders happened,

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.260
 there was a play on, which was a dramatization

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.780
 of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.660
 which is about a doctor who drinks a potion

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.580
 and then becomes, you know, changes personality

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.820
 and becomes evil.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.140
 And people thought that he might be the murderer

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.700
 simply because he was such a good actor

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.300
 at playing both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.900
 And the production was shut down,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.780
 but the stage craft was so unbelievable.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.300
 People couldn't work out how it was done

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.540
 because he changed physically.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.540
 And people thought that I can't believe what I'm seeing, right?

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.460
 It was so effective that they thought,

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.620
 people sat with opera glasses,

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.380
 trying to look at what this guy had done on stage.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.660
 - Like physically?

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.500
 - Yeah.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.380
 And some people said, oh, he's just putting a mask on.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.780
 And actually, can I just tell you what he did?

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.700
 This is so good.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.580
 They had pre-painted his face

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.420
 in a way that standard theater lighting wouldn't show.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.700
 And then they introduced a colored filter

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.220
 in the lights in the theater,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.260
 which showed up the grease paint

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.860
 and he would contort his face a little bit,

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.940
 but it would completely change the look of his face.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.860
 - That's very clever.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.020
 - And I have not done that tonight.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:14.220
 But imagine if I had, how interesting that would have been.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.300
 - Wow.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.700
 - And he got completely caught up in it,

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.900
 but nothing to do with him.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.300
 - That's exciting, yeah.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.100
 - We're gonna have to move on in a sec, guys.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.980
 - Have you heard of Jack the Flipper?

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:23.820
 - Jack the Flipper.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.860
 - An aggressive dolphin in a 2013 study.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.980
 (laughing)

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.140
 - The dipper, on the other hand,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.220
 is an ice cream shop in North Carolina.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.460
 (laughing)

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.140
 - Are you culminating in Amsterdam's Jack the Stripper?

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.700
 I've got to say, I'm really anxious

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.540
 about what's coming up.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.380
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.220
 - Okay.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.800
 (upbeat music)

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.140
 - It is time for fact number three,

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.220
 and that is Andy.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.420
 My fact is that German mini golfers

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.900
 refrigerate their balls.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.740
 So.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.100
 - Doesn't it hurt when they close the door?

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.140
 (laughing)

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.980
 - Lovely.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.820
 (laughing)

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.020
 Lovely stuff.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.180
 - Very good.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.460
 - This was a great piece in the FT

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.060
 about the world of mini golf,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.140
 which is just, this is not crazy golf.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.340
 It is big golf, made small.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.320
 Mini golf, as the title applies.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.540
 It's not, there are no windmills,

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.020
 there are no clowns, there are no dinosaurs.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:14.860
 - Okay, I was saying,

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.820
 "Creative Golf" is a segment of mini golf,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.540
 the fun guy segment, if you will.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.380
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.700
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.220
 All crazy golf is mini,

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.540
 but not all mini golf is crazy.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.540
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.140
 And the correspondent went to see

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.660
 the World Finals, the seniors,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.740
 mini golf world championships,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.500
 and they take it very seriously.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.020
 And the Germans chill their balls.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.740
 They have special ball fridges

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.900
 to ensure they have ball homeostasis.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.940
 And it's a very big deal.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.980
 And you know, some players keep their balls in their socks.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.660
 They tuck them into their trousers.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.500
 - All right.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.380
 - 'Cause you want consistency of temperature.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.020
 You want consistency of rolling.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.380
 - How do you make your shoes fit?

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.460
 If you've got a,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.420
 is it, you just have to buy much larger shoe?

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.700
 - Oh no, your sock, your sock goes higher than your,

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.620
 unless you're wearing those ankle socks.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.460
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.300
 - That's not gonna work.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.140
 - Oh no, sorry, it's not like,

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.980
 I was imagining the end of the sock.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.980
 - I believe it is at the end of the sock,

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.420
 but it's at the other end you're thinking of.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.780
 - Yes, okay, yes.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.620
 - It's, I think we've said it before,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.780
 that these balls that they use in mini golf,

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.980
 they're not golf balls.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.820
 Are they? - No.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.460
 - They're kind of rubbery things,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.380
 which I guess makes it more important

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.500
 that they're the right temperature.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.340
 - Right.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.180
 - There's still golf balls of it.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.020
 They're mini golf balls.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.540
 - They're mini golf balls, yeah.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.500
 - And they are, you can pick your own balls?

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.860
 I think we said, did we say that?

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.700
 - No.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.880
 - If you play golf, you'll have a,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.820
 you might like select your club.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.980
 Or you've got a caddy, is it?

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.620
 Your caddy carries your clubs for you.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.460
 - Yeah.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.500
 - Is that, does that happen?

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.340
 - Parking.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.660
 - Do you have a,

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.540
 like do you have a caddy when you play golf?

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.100
 - You can on occasion.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.140
 - Okay, but you can, if you're a mini golf,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.300
 I have a ball caddy,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.220
 because you've got so many balls to choose from.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.060
 - Oh really?

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.140
 - Which balls you play and which holes?

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.860
 - So when professional golfers say,

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.380
 give me the nine iron or whatever that language is,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.540
 in mini golf, it's the opposite.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.180
 Give me the red ball.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.260
 - Give me the big, big round ball.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.100
 - Big round ball.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.940
 - Yeah, round ball.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.820
 - They're all the same size, we should say.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.020
 - So what are you choosing?

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.860
 - Yes.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.700
 - Of course, Andy.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.460
 - Come on, we can't play with a marble

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.740
 some of the time in a beach ball,

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.580
 some of the rest of the time.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.420
 - Are you sure, sir?

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.300
 This one is twice the size of the hole.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.740
 - Yes, I'll take it.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.580
 - James.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.420
 - Yes.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.260
 - Tiger Woods once,

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.060
 this is something I don't know about golf.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.100
 He played the big championship that he won.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.820
 He ran out of balls.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.660
 - Okay.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.820
 - And he was only, he was down to like one ball

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.620
 and you can't just request more balls.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.460
 - No, no.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.620
 - Did he have to use one of his balls?

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.940
 (laughing)

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.220
 - He did use, Tiger Woods famously used his balls a lot,

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.220
 but in golf, however many you bring with you

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.460
 on the first tee is how many you have to,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.660
 you know, you can't get any more from the club.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.500
 - That's crazy.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.900
 - The ones you've got are the ones you're stuck with.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.740
 - That's extraordinary.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.140
 - Here's one really interesting thing

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.260
 that is different about mini golf and maxi golf.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.140
 And that is, in mini golf, you refrigerate your balls.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.460
 In maxi golf, it is against the rules

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.980
 to warm your balls up explicitly.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.100
 You're not allowed to warm because it changes the way

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.660
 that they might fly through the air.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.660
 You are allowed to warm them up before the round,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.420
 but then they will go cold quite quickly.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.420
 But during the game, you're not allowed to.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.500
 And it's to such an extent that when you play golf

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.540
 in a country that isn't fucking boiling like this one,

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.580
 you get cold a lot and you would have like hand warmers

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.200
 in your pockets, you'd be advised not to put your balls

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.980
 near those hand warmers because your opponents could say,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.620
 you're artificially warming them up,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.940
 you're gonna get kicked out.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.780
 - Are you allowed to, but you're allowed to pocket your balls?

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.820
 - You can put them in your pocket.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.980
 - Can you put them in your armpits?

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.460
 Can you keep them in your mouth?

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.300
 (laughing)

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.980
 Can you, I'm not gonna ask any more questions,

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.980
 but I can think of a few locations which would ensure--

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.140
 - Every hole's a goal.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.380
 (laughing)

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.980
 The rule specifically says you're not allowed

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.620
 to artificially warm your golf balls.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.460
 - But is my bum--

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.460
 - It doesn't specifically say it would be a case by case basis.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.500
 - Right.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.220
 - I can assure you my bum is 100% real.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.060
 You know?

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.140
 (laughing)

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.300
 - I feel like it might affect your stance.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.420
 (laughing)

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.860
 - I think you failed the caddy interview,

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.660
 is all I can tell you, so.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.260
 (laughing)

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.540
 - I'm telling you, you're caddy.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.300
 Just walk to the spot you're teeing off,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.540
 and just squeeze their cheeks and drop.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.660
 (laughing)

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.580
 - If they can land it directly on the tee,

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.660
 that is a great caddy.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.540
 - That's a caddy.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.380
 - Oh my God.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.580
 (laughing)

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.900
 - Moving, moving on.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.980
 - You brought it up.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.980
 - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.380
 - Moving on to the balls up the pump.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.380
 - Hey, check this out.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.060
 A 2009 search for the Loch Ness Monster.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.900
 - Oh my God.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.940
 (laughing)

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.780
 - How do you do it?

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.500
 How do you do it?

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.260
 - It didn't find the Loch Ness Monster,

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.140
 it found 100,000 golf balls.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.740
 And basically they've worked out that there's a driving range

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.180
 where golf balls have been lobbed into Loch Ness,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.940
 and they're just all over the ground.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.740
 They were registering all these signals,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.060
 and there was 100,000 of them.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.580
 They thought, my God, they're baby Loch Ness Monster eggs.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.900
 (laughing)

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.980
 - They all had type list written on the side.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.220
 (laughing)

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.060
 - Yeah, they didn't think that.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.300
 That's what I would have thought, is what I mean.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.660
 But yeah, so, Lost Balls,

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.380
 I mean, this is an actual job that you can get

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.220
 at a golf course, not a mini golf course,

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.220
 but they have scuba divers

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.220
 who are paid to go into all the bits of water,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.580
 and they go hunting for balls,

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.500
 and they get paid by the ball that they found.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.900
 So that's a job you can get if you're one of--

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.580
 - It's incredible, 'cause they build up so much over time.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.740
 Have you heard of Glenn Berger?

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.540
 - This is a guy who has exactly the job

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.700
 that Dennis just described.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.540
 He's been working, he was profiled about 10 years ago.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.740
 He had already collected 15 million balls.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.580
 - What?

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.060
 - His personal best is 17,000 balls in a day.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:48.900
 - What?

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.740
 - How?

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.700
 - Again, he's employing lots of people

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.540
 to do his balls work, right?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.460
 - Yeah, but that's, I think, his personal best.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.860
 That's him going down. - No.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.140
 - Yeah, 'cause if you've got someone that has been played

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.500
 on a golf course for years and years--

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.900
 - I guess if you're literally just dredging them, maybe.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.140
 - He's dredging, or he goes down

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.940
 and he'll just pull them into sacks, you know,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.300
 'cause they all settle in the same place.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.340
 There is a website called golf.com.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.540
 It's a very good website.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.860
 (audience laughing)

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.900
 - If you like golf. - If you like golf, yeah.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.060
 It claims that in the late 1990s,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.380
 there was a golf ball diver who spent several hours

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.700
 stuck on the bottom because he was pinned down

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.540
 by an amorous alligator.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.700
 - Right. - Oh my God.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.100
 - Who was trying to flirt.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.220
 - One way of improving your golf balls

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.100
 perhaps might be to make them radioactive.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.100
 - Ooh, okay.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.140
 In 1910, there was a company called

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.700
 the Worthington Golf Ball Company

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.540
 that started making golf balls with radium in them.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.460
 And they said they were wise enough to stop.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.220
 It's a reasonable position and not develop unduly

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.260
 a power that could be dangerous.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.980
 So I think they just had a little bit in.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.820
 - Why were you doing it?

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.100
 Is it so you can find them?

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.500
 - Well, the idea is in those days, they thought,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.780
 'cause radium was this new sort of wonder material

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.100
 that they found, they thought you could add radium

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.460
 to anything and it would just make it better.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.420
 They had radium condoms, for instance.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.020
 - Yeah, yeah, radium crockery.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.900
 I saw some of that recently in a shop.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.220
 And I walked past at night and I thought,

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.060
 'Oh, what a cool light display they've got.'

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.460
 And it was just a display of, I think it was uranium.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.540
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.220
 - Were you shopping in the 1910s?

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.540
 - It was an antique shop, but it was very--

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.020
 - I think that it's kind of,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.140
 you're not supposed to really buy too many of those, are you?

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.380
 I think they're kind of, yeah.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.420
 But they did these in 1910,

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.340
 but they didn't really sell very well.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.940
 But then they came back

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.620
 and in recent years, there's been some scientists

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.660
 at the Atomic Energy of Canada

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.060
 who have said that they have put their golf balls

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.540
 in radioactive position

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.540
 and they travel 20 to 30 yards further than conventional balls.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.740
 - Really? - Yeah, they put it

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.580
 in an electron beam, but they have said

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.860
 that they won't make any claims, you know,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.340
 claims in the shops to say this definitely will work.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.220
 They said that would require study

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.180
 and we don't intend to study it.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.820
 - No? Okay, that's science.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.380
 (laughing)

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.780
 There's actually a stop gap in between your 1910

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.060
 and then more recent ones, which is in 1951.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.500
 There was a guy called Dr. William L. Davidson

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.060
 and he supposedly was creating golf balls

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.220
 but with little quantities of radioactive material inside.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.500
 And as you say, Andy, it was for if a golf ball got lost,

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.260
 you would go with a Geiger counter

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.020
 and you would be able to locate your ball.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.380
 - That's a pretty good idea.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.020
 - Yeah. - Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.900
 - Do you know how many balls there are out there?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.540
 This is in America alone, USA alone,

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.900
 300 million golf balls go missing every year.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.700
 - Wow, that's almost exactly the population of America.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.020
 - For every person in America,

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.660
 if you're listening to this in the States,

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.940
 there is a golf ball for every year of your life waiting.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.260
 (laughing)

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.140
 It's out there and you'll never find them all.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.820
 - Oh, oh yes, yes.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.660
 - What a sobering thought. - Right, what a sobering thought.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.180
 - We don't know what happens to them either.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.100
 No one knows what happens to a golf ball

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.180
 that doesn't get touched.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.140
 There's no recognized study, so they don't know--

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.300
 - 'Cause they last 1,000 years.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.060
 We have no, they just don't degrade.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.900
 - Yes.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.780
 - The cockroaches will be able to play golf in the future.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.820
 Just a sort of lateral thinking test for you.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.220
 There was, so golf balls used to be surrounded

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.380
 by a very hard, vulcanized rubber shell,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.980
 which isn't quite the same as they have now,

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.020
 so that was replaced with fully synthetic rubber in the end.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.180
 But it was in 1965 that the transition started to be made.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.140
 It was a chemist called Harry Lander,

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.740
 was one of the people who did it,

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.380
 and he was trying to make a really durable golf ball,

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.020
 and he made one, and it was successful,

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.580
 but it didn't have that hard shell,

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.700
 and so he had to make a tweak to it, a special change,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.100
 'cause it didn't do something that all golfers wanted it to do.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.740
 What did he have to add back in?

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.340
 - Okay, what did it not do?

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.740
 So it wasn't hard on the outside.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.580
 - Yes, it works still just as well.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.340
 - Okay, so they just like the sound of the flak.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.660
 - Like the sound, James, you've got the mind of a golfer,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.140
 he had to add the click back in.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.620
 - Really? - They came back and said...

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.420
 - Like a car door. - Exactly like a car door.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.460
 - Wow. - They added the click back into golf balls.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.500
 - That's so funny.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.540
 - I'm gonna have to move us on, guys, so we're next back.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.380
 - Can I do a 2018 headline from the UK?

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:12.020
 "Man filmed having sex with ninth hole of golf course."

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.860
 (audience laughing)

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.860
 And a quote, "From where he was,

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.180
 "it looked like he had his penis in the hole

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.420
 "while he had the flak in his backside."

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.220
 (audience laughing)

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.060
 - Interesting.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.700
 - It was the most weirdest thing

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.060
 I've ever had the most fortune to see.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.260
 All I can say is if my ball ever goes in the ninth hole

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.380
 at Brackenwood, it can stay there.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.980
 (audience laughing)

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.460
 - And that's where the 300 million others are.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.040
 (upbeat music)

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.420
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.100
 and that is James.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.100
 - Okay, and my fact this week is that M&Ms

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.460
 deliberately made the green character sexy

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.540
 because of a school ground rumour

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.820
 that that coloured sweets were an aphrodisiac.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.260
 (audience laughing)

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.380
 This is Ms. Green, and for people

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.900
 who can't see her on the screen,

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.300
 she has pouty lips and eyelashes and high heels,

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.900
 and she was invented by a marketing agency called BBDO,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.500
 who wanted to transform M&Ms into a brand,

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.580
 into a more iconic brand, I should say,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.780
 and they came up with these ideas of spokes candies,

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.340
 and in their press release, they say that the green M&M,

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.940
 she adds credence to the rumour

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.420
 that her mere presence is a turn on,

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.260
 and it turns out that kids throughout

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.780
 the previous 20 years or so had all been saying,

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.780
 if you eat the green ones, it's an aphrodisiac,

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.940
 and they thought, oh, we might as well run with it.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.740
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing that every single colour

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.780
 of an M&M was associated with a kind of school ground

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.860
 or workplace or general life myth, right?

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.100
 Like it just, it was everywhere.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.420
 So green ones were an aphrodisiac.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.340
 The last one you pulled out of the bag was red.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.340
 You need to make a wish, and it will come true.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.740
 If the last candy that comes out of the bag is yellow,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.740
 you can call in sick and stay at home.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.940
 Orange, yeah, orange.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.860
 - No one ever did that.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.380
 Did any boss ever receive that call?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.300
 Please write in if so.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.580
 - Orange M&Ms, good luck.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.860
 Brown ones, bad luck.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.820
 It was all, that's just, that was,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.020
 that's what people said when you pulled the thing out.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.860
 - I just feel like a lot of people

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.300
 are probably similar to myself.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.700
 A packet out of packet of M&Ms without being aware,

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.140
 any of them had personalities until now.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:23.980
 - Really?

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.900
 - I certainly didn't know until I read this.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.460
 I couldn't believe she was sexy.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.020
 Did everyone else know this?

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.860
 - Yeah.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.460
 - I was a loner at school.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.140
 I didn't pick up on those things.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.700
 - But the rumour, I think the rumour was that.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.100
 And I had no idea about the connection.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.740
 I just thought they'd been a bit weird

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.140
 by making one of them a bit, a bit fit.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.460
 - And it's got controversial lately, hasn't it?

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.660
 - I mean, to a certain extent.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.140
 - Oh, got extremely controversial.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.980
 - How come?

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.800
 Why?

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.180
 - Well, you know, should we have one

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.620
 who's wearing high heels with no pants on?

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.180
 To be honest, looking at that picture.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.020
 - None of them are wearing pants.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.340
 It's weirder if one of them's wearing pants.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.180
 - That's a really good point.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.180
 - I don't like the thought of an M&M wearing pants at all.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.180
 - They did attempt to replace

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.940
 the green one's high heel boots with trainers.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.460
 And they put like sensible heels on the brown one

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.700
 who used to wear little kitten heels.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.780
 And then there's a huge backlash by which I mean,

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.820
 I think one person wrote an article about it.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.620
 And so they reverted, you know,

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.700
 because it was woken as gone mad.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.540
 - Yeah.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.540
 - So there was one bit where she did a sports illustrated

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.660
 swimsuit modeling thing.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.620
 - Weird.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:31.180
 - Where she sort of unzipped almost her entire body

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.180
 to reveal the chocolate inside.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.020
 - Oh, wow.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.780
 - Which feels more like a horror movie thing

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.620
 than a sexy thing.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.460
 - Yeah.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.580
 That's why cats got in trouble.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.060
 'Cause they had a cat taking off his,

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.420
 or a cat wearing a fur coat.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.700
 And I was like, where'd you get that fur coat?

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.780
 What's the fur?

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.620
 Do you remember?

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.140
 Judy Dench in Cats is wearing a fur coat.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.060
 Is a cat, but she's also wearing a fur coat.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.980
 And everyone was like, well, that's a bit rum, isn't it?

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.820
 - Is it?

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.660
 - Oh.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.500
 - It's a bit rum.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.340
 - Anyway.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.180
 - Was it more or less controversial

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.260
 than the huge M&M controversy?

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.260
 - I mean, that's extremely controversial.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.100
 Well, let's be real.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.940
 They're just smarties, right?

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.780
 They're just smarties.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.620
 - What?

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.460
 - Oh, come on.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.140
 - Can I just say for legal reasons,

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.820
 they are not just smarties.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.660
 - They are basically smarties.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.740
 - But also, don't they predate smarties?

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.940
 - No, smarties just predate them.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.780
 - Okay.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.940
 - So Forrest Mars is the scion of the Mars dynasty.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.860
 He had broken with his family firm,

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.340
 but he was of chocolate pedigree.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.940
 And he was in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.260
 Unclear why he felt the need to stick his beak

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.220
 into the Spanish Civil War, but.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.180
 - There was a lot of beak sticking happening.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.020
 - So much.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:31.860
 - Next time.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.380
 He spent time with George Harris from Roundtree.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.820
 And the story, which may not be true, but it may,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.980
 is that he noticed some soldiers with smarties

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.060
 and they have a hard candy shell.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.900
 They don't melt as in the fierce Spanish sun,

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.860
 as easily as just normal chocolate would do.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.100
 And miraculously, he then thought of M&Ms.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.940
 What gave me the idea?

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.260
 We'll never know.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.740
 - And he's one of the M's of M&Ms.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.340
 So it's Forrest Mars.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.900
 And then the other person is Bruce Murray,

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.340
 who was part of Hershey's.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.860
 And it was a sort of collaboration, right?

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.060
 Where they had the chocolate.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.740
 He had the idea stolen from the Spanish Civil War.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.540
 And then they came together.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.100
 - And that's why it's M&Ms, right?

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.180
 So it's the apostrophe M means it belongs to both of them.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.420
 So it means M&Ms means belongs to Murray and Mars.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.500
 But that means that a single M&M,

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.740
 that still belongs to them both, right?

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.580
 - Sure.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.740
 - So that, I reckon a single M&M really should be an M&Ms,

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.020
 because it belongs to Murray and Mars.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.300
 And that means I reckon a full packet of M&Ms

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.380
 should be M&Ms's.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.380
 And that's what I will be asking for

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.820
 in the shops from now on.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.060
 - Right.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.500
 - This is gonna be the next big controversy, isn't it?

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.180
 - One panino and two M&Ms's is great.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.060
 I completely forgot to check something

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.260
 speaking of the M's and the M's on the sweets.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.460
 And I meant to.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.020
 So sorry, I wouldn't normally ask the audience,

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.580
 but if you are listening at home, please try it.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.620
 I read in either the Atlantic or the New York Times

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.220
 that if you pour a packet of M&Ms into some beer,

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.380
 the lettles will peel off from their shelves

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.980
 and float around the beer on their own

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.700
 like a goat trying to spell out a message.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.540
 - Ooh.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.380
 - Oh, really?

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.620
 - What was it that the ghost was just saying?

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.620
 - Mm, yeah.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.740
 - If that is, he's in a pint of beer, so.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:12.900
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.340
 - I think, didn't they, they invented it

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.340
 or they changed and innovated an existing machine

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.860
 specifically to print the M onto the M&Ms?

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.900
 - They're very secretive about their machines.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.740
 - Yeah, right.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.460
 - There are stories that if you're an engineer

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.580
 and a machine goes wrong at the M&M factory,

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.260
 that you're led in to repair it blindfolded.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.100
 - What?

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:31.940
 - It's not clear at all.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.860
 - Is the point complete?

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.980
 It's not a secret where it is in the factory.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.140
 And you can't fix it blindfolded, presumably.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.180
 - I don't know, I think not.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.620
 But suppose that maybe you don't see

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.380
 the Oompa Loompas as you pass them by.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.220
 It's the idea.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.060
 - Right.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:45.980
 - But you'd hear them singing.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.060
 - You'd hear them singing.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.020
 - But they're really, like Forrest Mars,

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.300
 we have mentioned before on the show, he was insane.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.860
 So if executives had meetings

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.020
 with competitors or outsiders,

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.700
 they would sometimes turn up in disguise

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.460
 with a false moustache or whatever.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.700
 Supposedly even their bankers

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.900
 don't have access to their financial records.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.740
 - What?

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.060
 - Don't know what's going on there.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.900
 But he was a total recluse.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.220
 There are no photos of him.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.580
 Or there might have been one photo of him ever taken.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.420
 - Publicly.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.380
 - He might have a lot in his family album.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.220
 - Maybe.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.620
 - But yeah, he never wanted to be seen in public.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.660
 - Yeah, someone in 1999 tried to find out

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.020
 the name of the president of the Mars company, right?

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.780
 1999, no one knew the name of the president

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.620
 of the Mars company, one of the biggest companies

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.660
 on the planet.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.180
 A journalist phoned up and said,

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.140
 "Can you tell me who's the president

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.620
 "of the Mars company, please?"

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.900
 Only to be told, "I'm sorry,

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.900
 "I can't give out the names of our associates."

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.020
 Phone was hung up.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.860
 - Really?

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.900
 - They had a cult of total secrecy for a long time.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.540
 - Has that changed or is that still the case?

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.100
 - It's still pretty much, it's his descendants

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.940
 who are running the place now, right?

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.780
 - Yeah, right.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.620
 - It's still very, very, it's a touch ship.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.460
 - Yeah.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.540
 - It's very clever what they did with M&Ms

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.980
 with giving each of the M&Ms a different color

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.860
 because the color became the personality

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.900
 and hence people trying to fill in the gaps

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.100
 and work out what they brought to the table.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.980
 And I was thinking, could we do that?

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.620
 That doesn't work, 'cause we're a podcast.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.700
 We can't wear colors.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.100
 People won't be able to hear the colors.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.180
 And then I thought, actually,

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.180
 someone did it for us the other day

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.940
 because we were at a gig here in Australia

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.740
 and someone gave us a little fanzine

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.900
 that they've done of us by George Rex Comics

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.460
 and they've actually given us words to define who we are.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.940
 - Well, you mean like the Spice Girls.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.340
 - Like the Spice Girls, exactly.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.300
 So that's how we need to exist, right?

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.060
 So in this quiz, which member of No Such Thing

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.340
 as a Fish are you?

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.860
 Here are the four options for what we could be.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.060
 Sarcastic.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.700
 Northern.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.060
 (audience laughing)

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:38.900
 Boring.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.980
 And an idiot.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.260
 That's devastatingly bad to write.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.180
 So we've got boring Spice, stupid Spice.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.460
 Sarky Spice.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.780
 And Scow Spice.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.060
 (audience laughing)

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:53.900
 Northern Spice.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.220
 - Scow Spice, great.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.700
 - No, I was trying to think of another S

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.540
 that was in the North.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.380
 I got it wrong.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.100
 - Sounds like a really great quiz, Dan.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.580
 And really relevant as well.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.420
 - That was great.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.700
 - I'm stuck 'cause I'm sarcastic.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.540
 - Oh, yeah.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.380
 - I'm such an idiot.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.620
 I had no idea that you were.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.260
 - Hey, hop, hey, hop, let's get on with it.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.600
 - I can't think of anything interesting to add.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.600
 (audience laughing)

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.300
 - Let's talk about Eminence a bit more.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.020
 - Can we talk about Van Halen?

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.860
 The thing.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.700
 - Oh.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.540
 - Oh, of course, yeah.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.660
 - 'Cause we're on tour, and they toured,

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.940
 and so basically we were rock band.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.780
 This is a really interesting thing about, you know,

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.940
 supposedly Van Halen, when the rock big rock band

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.220
 in the '70s, '80s, they had a line in the rider

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.180
 which said, we want a bowl of Eminence

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.780
 with all the brown Eminence removed, right?

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.220
 That is a story that has done the rounds

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.300
 for such a long time.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.340
 And the story was, it was so they were checking

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.020
 that the venue was reading the rider in full

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.340
 and doing everything right,

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.140
 so that all the amps were in the right place

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.260
 and the lights, it was actually a way of testing

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.980
 to make sure the venue were reading and paying attention.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.420
 That has been turned on its head.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.020
 This is the exciting thing, double debunk.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.580
 I was reading Doug Max Snack Stack,

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.300
 which is a food and snack-based blog

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.460
 and is terrific.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.460
 It's so good.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.860
 - All right, barring spice.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.860
 (audience laughing)

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.420
 - So the story A is just, they've got a big ego.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.500
 Story B is that it's actually more complicated,

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.900
 but story C, think about it.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.020
 The person whose job is to remove all the brown Eminence,

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.580
 it's not the same as the person whose job is to check

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.700
 the amps or the safety of the overall gig.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.000
 That's an insane way of trying to ensure

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.700
 the safety and actually they caused huge amounts

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.020
 of damage to dressing rooms.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.060
 Like when they found some brown Eminence at a gig once,

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.940
 they caused 100 grand of damage to a dining room.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.360
 It now seems that they were just being wankers, so.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.700
 - Right.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.340
 - So why are we assuming that?

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.380
 Just 'cause they trashed the place.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.860
 They could have been trashing it because they were pissed off,

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.700
 they hadn't read the rider.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.780
 - They trashed the place, but also based on their quotes,

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.260
 it sounds like they genuinely did want it.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.580
 It was kind of a way of throwing it around.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.380
 'Cause also by the time anyone knows about it,

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.940
 it's no longer an effective test

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.500
 of whether a venue has read the rider.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.680
 - So it seems like it has been double debunked, yeah.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.720
 - Double debunked, you heard it here first.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.960
 Do you want to know something about blue Eminence?

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.800
 No one got much of a look in.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.720
 The dye in blue Eminence could repair your spine

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.320
 if your spine is damaged, but it might turn you blue.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.720
 And this is a really, the dye is called Brilliant Blue G.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.080
 And like scientists were just testing,

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.960
 studying it a few years ago, and they realized

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.080
 it blocks a chemical that makes your injuries worse

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.120
 if you've got a spinal injury.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.620
 So it blocks a chemical that causes inflammation.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.980
 So it basically means that you don't get

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.940
 the horrible repercussions of a spinal injury

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.020
 that you otherwise would.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.180
 And they're looking into it, but the only thing is

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.580
 that it does turn you a bit blue.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.940
 At the moment, if you're a rat, but we do know

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.940
 that that could be the case.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.540
 And it just reminded me of another dye sweet base story

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.340
 that I loved that came out recently,

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.860
 which is that the food dye in Doritos

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.820
 and pretty much any other yellow thing,

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.640
 like macaroni and cheese, any yellow gummies,

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.440
 Cheetos, cereals.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.280
 - Twisties.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.880
 - Twisties, sure.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.960
 Are they yellow?

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.160
 (audience cheers)

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.000
 - Orangey, yeah.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.720
 - Twisties, Orangeyna, it makes mice transparent,

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.840
 the dye in that.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.400
 And they think there's no reason why it wouldn't also

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.080
 make humans transparent.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.440
 - Not if they eat it, right?

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.400
 - No, if you rub it on their skin, sorry.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.560
 - No way.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.400
 - Yes?

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.480
 - Are we surrounded by invisible mice now?

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.160
 (audience laughs)

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.660
 - They've been rubbed with Cheeto dust.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.500
 - We don't, you know.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.240
 - They're not empty on the inside, Andy.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:36.240
 You would see, okay, you would see a big bag of mouse.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.020
 - It's Hellraiser for mice, yeah.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:42.100
 - So how many Doritos do I have to rub on myself tonight?

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.100
 - Well, just keep trying, James,

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.820
 and eventually you will go transparent.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.660
 - There are two brands of chocolate milk in Australia

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.260
 that are made from cows that eat chocolate.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.540
 - What?

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.060
 It doesn't come out when you milk them as chocolate milk.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:57.900
 - Does it?

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.520
 Is that what we're saying?

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.240
 - No, that is definitely not what I said.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.080
 - Okay.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.720
 - It was confusing, is chocolate made from the cows?

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.280
 - Chocolate milk is made from the milk

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.080
 from cows that eat chocolate.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.120
 - But you have led Dan up the garden path, haven't you?

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.320
 - Is the milk any different to standard milk?

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.320
 - No, no.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.160
 It's just milk.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.640
 It's just a coincidence, really.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.160
 But you get these brands of chocolate milk.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.740
 It's cartons of farmers union and purer flavored milks.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.500
 And the cows that they take the milk from

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.940
 are fed with stuff from the nearby Cadbury factory

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.580
 that's just like offshoots that they don't need anymore

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.260
 because it's a really easy way of giving cows energy.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.180
 - So it's kind of the circular economy.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.140
 'Cause some of that milk will have been in,

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.620
 some of the milk in the chocolate will have been in a cow.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.660
 - That's true.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.160
 - It's a closed system.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.600
 - We've solved sustainability.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.320
 (audience laughing)

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.360
 Just feed the cows some chocolate.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.380
 (upbeat music)

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.760
 - Okay, everyone, that is it.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.120
 That is all of our facts.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.800
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.760
 Sydney, you've been awesome.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.400
 Thank you so much for having us.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.800
 We will be back again.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.640
 (audience cheering)

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.500
 And until then, we will see you.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.820
 Goodbye!

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.820
 (audience cheering)

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.400
 (upbeat music)

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.740
 (upbeat music)

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.320
 (upbeat music)

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:40.320
