00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:07,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:07,00:00:10,This one comes to you from the State Theater in Sydney.
00:00:10,00:00:12,It's part of our massive Aussie and New Zealand tour
00:00:12,00:00:13,that we just finished.
00:00:13,00:00:15,We had an absolutely incredible time
00:00:15,00:00:18,"while we were down there, as we did in the UK."
00:00:18,00:00:21,But the tour down under had one extra special element
00:00:21,00:00:22,"that we didn't quite manage for the UK,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,which was we had merch.
00:00:25,00:00:28,We had awesome Thundernerd t-shirts to go
00:00:28,00:00:29,with the title of our show.
00:00:29,00:00:31,We had Thundernerd beanies.
00:00:31,00:00:32,We were selling our ultimate guide
00:00:32,00:00:34,and no such thing as a fish tour book.
00:00:34,00:00:36,"Which by the way, if you haven't got,"
00:00:36,00:00:37,you really need to get your hands on.
00:00:37,00:00:40,It's got everything from a spread on Moss by Andy
00:00:40,00:00:42,and his only day on Twitter.
00:00:42,00:00:44,There's timelines of everything that we've done.
00:00:44,00:00:47,We've got bios on every guest who's been on there.
00:00:47,00:00:48,There's a lot of behind the scenes.
00:00:48,00:00:50,"In fact, there's a bunch of QR codes"
00:00:50,00:00:51,all throughout the book as well
00:00:51,00:00:54,that has secret videos that we've never published anywhere.
00:00:54,00:00:56,And audio commentary from us.
00:00:56,00:00:58,So it's sort of a mini episode
00:00:58,00:00:59,within the pages of the book.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"Anyway, along with some pin badges,"
00:01:01,00:01:03,all of that is available on our website.

00:01:08,00:01:09,"And if you get in there quick enough,"
00:01:09,00:01:12,you're gonna be able to buy some of that swag
00:01:12,00:01:14,just in time for Christmas.
00:01:14,00:01:15,"Now, if you're an Aussie in New Zealand"
00:01:15,00:01:17,"are listening to this right now and thinking,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,"damn it, I didn't pick up anything at the gigs"
00:01:19,00:01:22,and now we've gotta buy it back from over in the UK.

00:01:32,00:01:34,"to read over the Christmas period,"

00:01:36,00:01:37,We're all authors.
00:01:37,00:01:38,We released books this year
00:01:38,00:01:41,and he has a new comic novel called
00:01:41,00:01:43,A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering.
00:01:43,00:01:45,Brilliantly funny.
00:01:45,00:01:46,James Inanna wrote a fact-packed book
00:01:46,00:01:48,which is the QI history of sports
00:01:48,00:01:50,called A Load of Old Balls.
00:01:50,00:01:52,And I've written a non-fiction book for kids
00:01:52,00:01:54,"ages seven and above,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,all about the mysteries of our universe
00:01:56,00:01:58,called Impossible Things.
00:01:58,00:01:59,"Okay, that's it for plugging."
00:01:59,00:02:00,A lot of plugging there.
00:02:00,00:02:01,"But hey, you're a popular person."
00:02:01,00:02:03,You've got a lot of presents to buy.

00:02:05,00:02:06,"Anyway, enjoy the show now,"
00:02:06,00:02:10,coming to you from down under on with the podcast.
00:02:10,00:02:25,Hello and welcome!
00:02:26,00:02:31,"To another episode of None Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:31,00:02:34,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:02:34,00:02:36,from the State Theater in Sydney!
00:02:36,00:02:43,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:02:47,00:02:50,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:50,00:02:53,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:53,00:02:56,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:56,00:03:00,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:03:00,00:03:03,"My fact this week is that in 1944,"
00:03:03,00:03:07,the filming of the Oscar-winning movie National Velvet
00:03:07,00:03:09,was delayed to give its lead actress
00:03:09,00:03:11,time to grow a bit taller.
00:03:11,00:03:12,(audience laughing)
00:03:12,00:03:13,Ah!
00:03:13,00:03:15,And who was that?
00:03:15,00:03:16,"She's, no one's heard of her now,"
00:03:16,00:03:17,"so it's not worth mentioning,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,but she was called Elizabeth Taylor.
00:03:19,00:03:21,(audience laughing)
00:03:21,00:03:24,"Yeah, this is one of her first films."
00:03:24,00:03:27,"Did she fluctuate in height a lot, Elizabeth Taylor?"
00:03:27,00:03:28,"Yeah, she was 35 at the time,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"but sometimes she'd wake up six foot tall, sometimes five."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"No, she was obviously, she was still a child,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,"she was about 12 at the time,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"and this was a, so every child actress"
00:03:37,00:03:38,was trying out for this part.
00:03:38,00:03:39,"And I think they've been preparing for years,"
00:03:39,00:03:41,so a few of the tryouts were adults
00:03:41,00:03:43,by the time they finally cast it.
00:03:43,00:03:44,And the--
00:03:44,00:03:46,How much did she need to make it into the movie?
00:03:46,00:03:48,"Well, she needed, it's a Pando Berman,"
00:03:48,00:03:50,"who was the producer, met her,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"and thought she's absolutely perfect,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,"need her, but she needs three inches."
00:03:54,00:03:55,"Right. Which is a hefty whack, really."
00:03:55,00:03:56,That is.
00:03:56,00:03:57,It's a decent amount.
00:03:57,00:04:01,"They also, they asked her to wear braces."
00:04:01,00:04:04,"I think tooth braces, not up and down ones."
00:04:04,00:04:08,And they pulled out two of her baby teeth.
00:04:08,00:04:09,What?
00:04:09,00:04:11,"Yep, they also wanted to dye her hair,"
00:04:11,00:04:13,seems like a minor imposition
00:04:13,00:04:15,after they've pulled out two of your teeth.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"And they wanted to change her name to Virginia,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,but her parents refused.
00:04:19,00:04:20,And because they were really struggling
00:04:20,00:04:22,"to get the right actress for this role,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,what they needed was a child
00:04:24,00:04:27,who could speak with an English accent and ride a horse.
00:04:27,00:04:28,That was the whole brief.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"But what's incredibly confusing,"
00:04:30,00:04:31,"'cause this is always the claim,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,"is that the basis for it was she was very good at riding,"
00:04:33,00:04:35,"and we'll probably go into her relationship with horses,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,"which wasn't weird, like I've just made it sound."
00:04:37,00:04:39,"And she was very good at riding,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,"and she had been born,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"and a bit of her life brought up in England,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,so she needed a British accent.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"Now, if anyone's seen ""National Velvet"","
00:04:46,00:04:48,she does not talk with a British accent
00:04:48,00:04:49,at any point during that film.
00:04:49,00:04:51,So I'm not sure why it was a thing
00:04:51,00:04:53,"she needed to have in her backpack, just in case."
00:04:53,00:04:54,"- Yeah, who knows?"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"- Yeah, she got a very bad back"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"when she was riding King Charles,"
00:04:59,00:05:03,"which was the name of the horse, King Charles."
00:05:03,00:05:04,- It sure was.
00:05:04,00:05:08,"- And she loved it so much that the head of MGM,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,"Louis B. Mayer, gave it to her as a 13th birthday gift."
00:05:11,00:05:13,"- Oh wow, that's amazing."
00:05:13,00:05:15,- Did you read about how they met?
00:05:15,00:05:16,- No.
00:05:16,00:05:17,"- Her and King Charles, it's so sweet."
00:05:17,00:05:19,It's like something in a film itself.
00:05:19,00:05:22,So she had been taken to go riding at this country club
00:05:22,00:05:24,"by her parents to try and teach her to ride,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"and she'd seen this beautiful horse from afar,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,"fallen in love with him, said, ""I must ride that horse."""
00:05:28,00:05:30,This is an 11-year-old girl.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"The owner had said, ""This horse is mad, it's my horse."
00:05:33,00:05:34,"""Literally won't let anyone near it."""
00:05:34,00:05:37,"She waited until everyone had left,"
00:05:37,00:05:38,and then she climbed onto the hay bales
00:05:38,00:05:41,"and jumped through the hole where they fed the horse hay,"
00:05:41,00:05:45,"landing on his back, and she just lay on his back."
00:05:45,00:05:46,"Just lay there in the stable,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,and she did this day after day after day
00:05:48,00:05:50,until eventually the owner one day went in to ride him
00:05:50,00:05:52,"and was like, ""There's an 11-year-old on my horse."
00:05:52,00:05:54,"""What's going on?"""
00:05:54,00:05:56,"And said, ""Okay, well, she's obviously tamed him"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"""and handed him over."""
00:05:57,00:05:59,"It was a beautiful tale, true love."
00:05:59,00:06:02,"- She, her looks, we've mentioned a few things"
00:06:02,00:06:03,"about what they wanted her to do,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"moving the baby teeth, she needed more height."
00:06:06,00:06:09,"When she was born, the doctor said to her mom,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,"""You've given birth to a mutant."""
00:06:11,00:06:12,"- They didn't say those words, Dan."
00:06:12,00:06:14,- They did. - I refuse to believe.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- They did.
00:06:15,00:06:18,- But it's what she has in common with you.
00:06:18,00:06:19,- What?
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- Elizabeth, so I think I know what you're gonna say."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- So do I, but I don't think Dan has this."
00:06:23,00:06:26,"- Dan, okay, it feels like all four of us"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"are holding a hand of cards about what mutation,"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"Elizabeth and Dan, what I'm saying is excess hair,"
00:06:35,00:06:38,but it's distributed differently on the two of them.
00:06:38,00:06:43,"So, Dan, a suit man."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"- Yeah. - I mean, big, big time."
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Yeah.
00:06:46,00:06:47,- 'Cause we're looking at a picture
00:06:47,00:06:48,"of Elizabeth Taylor on here,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,and she doesn't quite have Dan's hairiness.
00:06:51,00:06:54,"- No, but interestingly, that's me next to her naked."
00:06:54,00:06:56,(laughing)
00:06:56,00:06:58,- We should save the listeners at home
00:06:58,00:07:00,"that that is Lassie, you know, don't we?"
00:07:00,00:07:04,"- But okay, so what she did have is,"
00:07:04,00:07:08,she had a double set of eyelashes.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"So her mom was like, ""Oh, that's okay, that's fine."""
00:07:10,00:07:11,"But it can be dangerous,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,because it can be a condition
00:07:13,00:07:17,"where if the second layer of eyelash grows inward,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"it can go into your eyeballs,"
00:07:19,00:07:22,and a very low percentage of people who have had it
00:07:22,00:07:26,"have died of heart disease later in life,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,"which is how she died,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,but I don't know if the connection has been made.
00:07:30,00:07:31,"- Because it's a genetic thing, isn't it?"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"That makes it happen. - Yeah, exactly."
00:07:33,00:07:35,"- Yeah, it's a gene called Foxy2."
00:07:35,00:07:38,"- Yeah, it's so cool! - Yeah, F-O-X-C2."
00:07:38,00:07:40,- Do you know one other thing about her face
00:07:40,00:07:42,that she also had?
00:07:42,00:07:45,"She once, supposedly, I've read this in a few places,"
00:07:45,00:07:50,"won the title Most Memorable Eyebrows in a magazine poll,"
00:07:50,00:07:52,and Lassie came second.
00:07:52,00:07:53,- No! - Yeah!
00:07:53,00:07:55,"- The dogs, sorry."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Just, the dogs have eyebrows?"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"Well, let's look. - Yeah, of course they do."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:00,00:08:02,"- I would say if the two people on screen,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,Elizabeth Taylor's are more pronounced.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"- Yeah. - But yeah,"
00:08:06,00:08:08,"certainly they have the rich, don't they, the dogs?"
00:08:08,00:08:09,"- Yeah, they do."
00:08:09,00:08:13,"- So, I mean, Lassie was one of her first big hits,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"wasn't it, Elizabeth Taylor?"
00:08:14,00:08:15,"- Yeah, it was basically Lassie first,"
00:08:15,00:08:16,then National Velvet.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"She did a very strong line in animal-based films, yeah."
00:08:19,00:08:23,"- Yeah, and the dog was played by a dog called Pal,"
00:08:23,00:08:27,"and Pal earned a salary of $250 per week,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,while Elizabeth Taylor was only paid $100 per week.
00:08:30,00:08:34,"But the dog actually was male,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,so it was kinda standard for the time.
00:08:36,00:08:38,(audience laughing)
00:08:38,00:08:43,"- So, obviously, for anyone under the age of 70,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,"we should just say that she's, you know,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"in case you're not familiar with her stuff,"
00:08:46,00:08:50,she's unbelievably famous throughout the 20th century.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"Not only for her films, things like ""Clear Patra,"""
00:08:52,00:08:54,"which was the extremely famous one,"
00:08:54,00:08:55,"but lots and lots more,"
00:08:55,00:08:59,but for having seven husbands and eight marriages.
00:08:59,00:09:00,- Yes. - 'Cause he's married
00:09:00,00:09:04,"to Richard Burton, twice."
00:09:04,00:09:06,"- Was that his accent, or did he just have a weird throw?"
00:09:06,00:09:07,- It wasn't his accent.
00:09:07,00:09:08,(audience laughing)
00:09:08,00:09:10,"Just stuffed out, sorry."
00:09:10,00:09:11,(audience laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:14,"And Richard Burton, as well, she was Welsh."
00:09:14,00:09:15,"He was Welsh, that was not Welsh."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"Anyway, the list of her husbands is so extraordinary,"
00:09:18,00:09:21,"because it goes through all of these, you know,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,her first marriage was to this horrible guy
00:09:23,00:09:26,"called Conrad Hilton, who was the hotel chain,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,she was 18 years old.
00:09:28,00:09:32,MGM picked the bridesmaids and invited the guests for her.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"- So, she would have been step-mom,"
00:09:34,00:09:38,"eventually, or step-grandmother, to Paris Hilton, right?"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"'Cause she married Eddie Fisher, as well, right?"
00:09:40,00:09:43,"Eddie Fisher, who was mother of Carrie Fisher,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,so she was step-mother to Princess Leia.
00:09:45,00:09:48,"- Yeah, you find it, it's weird when you research people"
00:09:48,00:09:49,"like this, because you find yourself getting"
00:09:49,00:09:52,"into very heat magazine territory with celebrity gossip,"
00:09:52,00:09:53,"but it feels okay, 'cause it was 50 years ago,"
00:09:53,00:09:55,but I found myself finding it so juicy
00:09:55,00:09:58,"that when she married Conrad Hilton,"
00:09:58,00:10:01,Conrad himself was actually having an affair at the time
00:10:01,00:10:04,"with his own stepmother, Jean-Jacques Gabor."
00:10:04,00:10:05,- What? - Whoa!
00:10:05,00:10:06,"- Chajar's in the story, mate."
00:10:06,00:10:08,- Chajar. - Chajar Gabor.
00:10:08,00:10:09,- Yeah. - The woman
00:10:09,00:10:11,who introduced the Rubik's Cube to America.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"- Exactly, she's not just famous for that, James."
00:10:14,00:10:16,- She's famous for something else.
00:10:16,00:10:19,"- Is that why you were fired from Heat Magazine, James?"
00:10:19,00:10:20,(all laughing)
00:10:20,00:10:23,- Chajar Gabor can fit into over 4 trillion positions.
00:10:23,00:10:24,(all laughing)
00:10:24,00:10:26,- I wonder he liked her.
00:10:26,00:10:28,"- Chajar, all their marriages,"
00:10:28,00:10:31,"they're obviously quite high-profile,"
00:10:31,00:10:34,"but the double marriage, the most famous one,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,"Richard Burton, like that one,"
00:10:37,00:10:38,"that one was the most interesting,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,because those two ran Hollywood
00:10:41,00:10:45,as if they were the king and queen of America.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"They would go into parties,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"they would spend ludicrous amounts of money on it,"
00:10:48,00:10:51,"they would have weird reasons for leaving parties,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,"and they would tear up rooms, they would have tantrums,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,and no one seemed to do anything about it.
00:10:56,00:10:59,"And so her life, Elizabeth Taylor's life,"
00:10:59,00:11:00,"really when you read the juicy stuff,"
00:11:00,00:11:04,"it's all about the divaism, all about the amazing demands."
00:11:04,00:11:05,"Like for example, in Cleopatra,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,"when they were filming that,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,she had twice a week delivered to her on set
00:11:09,00:11:13,"her local favorite meal from Dave Chasen's ""Chili"","
00:11:13,00:11:14,because she just loved it so much.
00:11:14,00:11:16,And what made that really difficult is
00:11:16,00:11:19,"that restaurant was in LA, and she was filming in Rome."
00:11:19,00:11:23,"So they got it on airplanes twice to three times a week,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,just her meal to be delivered to her for lunch.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"- It was so bad that the Vatican stepped in,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,"didn't they, and the Pope accused her"
00:11:32,00:11:36,"of erotic vagrancy, her and Richard Burton actually."
00:11:36,00:11:39,And there's an amazing scene in Cleopatra
00:11:39,00:11:42,"where she's coming into, spoiler alert,"
00:11:42,00:11:46,"coming into the city on a big chair,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"and there's huge crowds, and apparently there was a moment"
00:11:49,00:11:53,where all of these extras who were all Italian Catholics
00:11:53,00:11:55,"are starting to come towards her,"
00:11:55,00:11:56,and she thinks they're gonna lynch her
00:11:56,00:11:58,because it's been in all the newspapers
00:11:58,00:11:59,that the Pope hates her.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"And then just in the last second,"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"they all turn round and go, ""Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!"""
00:12:05,00:12:06,And they just loved her so much.
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Wow.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"- The filming of that is absolutely insane,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,"because they tried filming in London, it didn't work."
00:12:13,00:12:17,"It started Jackie Chan, a woman called Jackie Chan."
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:19,00:12:21,- That's so funny.
00:12:21,00:12:22,- There are so many stories of the filming
00:12:22,00:12:25,because they could only film if Burton and Taylor
00:12:25,00:12:27,"both showed up, and if they had had a row the night before,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,they just wouldn't.
00:12:28,00:12:31,So the production overran like crazy.
00:12:31,00:12:33,This is a story from Jackie Chan.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"There was a scene where Cleopatra has a bath on set,"
00:12:36,00:12:39,"and the set was cleared of all superfluous people,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"she reported, but a Scottish actor"
00:12:41,00:12:44,who played a blind poet gleefully told me
00:12:44,00:12:46,he was allowed to stay because people had forgotten
00:12:46,00:12:47,he wasn't really blind.
00:12:47,00:12:50,(audience laughing)
00:12:50,00:12:54,- That's very funny.
00:12:54,00:12:58,"On their mad demands, they both loved animals,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"Richard Burton loved dogs, she loved dogs."
00:13:00,00:13:03,There was a story going around that the dogs
00:13:03,00:13:05,"that they had liked her more than they liked him,"
00:13:05,00:13:09,so he bought a dog and it suddenly liked him
00:13:09,00:13:11,"more than it liked her, and everyone was like,"
00:13:11,00:13:12,what's going on?
00:13:12,00:13:14,And then his diaries later reported
00:13:14,00:13:16,"that the dog had come and it only spoke Welsh,"
00:13:16,00:13:19,"and Richard Burton spoke Welsh to it secretly,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,"but I couldn't verify that firsthand,"
00:13:21,00:13:22,"but I wouldn't put it past them,"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"but they did both love dogs, and they were staying"
00:13:24,00:13:27,in the UK and they weren't allowed to bring
00:13:27,00:13:29,"their dogs to London because of quarantine rules,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,"so they found a loophole in the law,"
00:13:32,00:13:33,which said that there was no rule
00:13:33,00:13:35,"that the animals couldn't be on British waters,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"and they leased a yacht for $20,000,"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"I think huge amounts of money, about $2,000 a day,"
00:13:41,00:13:45,and moored it on the Thames and just kept these dogs
00:13:45,00:13:47,on the Thames on a luxury yacht.
00:13:47,00:13:49,"- Yeah, it's very clever."
00:13:49,00:13:51,"She did a lot of crazy and weird things, right,"
00:13:51,00:13:54,but one thing that she also did is she saved the life
00:13:54,00:13:56,of an extremely famous actor at the time.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"She was at a party with a man called Montgomery Cliff,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,"and they were on the way home,"
00:14:00,00:14:02,"and she was in the car behind, he was in the car in front."
00:14:02,00:14:05,"He had a massive accident, car flips over,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,"smashes, and he's trapped underneath."
00:14:07,00:14:10,"She gets out of her car, she goes and climbs in"
00:14:10,00:14:13,"through the broken window in the car to see him,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,"and he's choking, and so she does something"
00:14:15,00:14:16,which I think is extraordinary.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"Most people would do like a Heimlich maneuver, right?"
00:14:19,00:14:23,Most people would tap the back like crazy.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"Elizabeth Taylor reaches into his mouth,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,and because the thing that was choking him
00:14:28,00:14:30,"was broken teeth stuck in his throat,"
00:14:30,00:14:34,she individually picked out all the teeth from his mouth
00:14:34,00:14:35,"until his airway was cleared,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,"so he could breathe again, saved his life."
00:14:37,00:14:38,- That's stunning.
00:14:38,00:14:40,- I've never heard of a choking being fixed
00:14:40,00:14:41,by a hand down the mountain.
00:14:41,00:14:43,- I've heard once there was a dolphin
00:14:43,00:14:45,"who had swallowed some plastic,"
00:14:45,00:14:47,and the world's second tallest man
00:14:47,00:14:50,went in with his rarely long arms and pulled the plastic out.
00:14:50,00:14:51,- That's nice.
00:14:51,00:14:55,- But I kind of think dolphins have wider mouths than humans.
00:14:55,00:14:56,- Yeah.
00:14:56,00:14:57,- This really doesn't fit.
00:14:57,00:15:01,"I don't think, if Andy, you had something in your mouth,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,"and I'm looking at my hand and the size of your mouth,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,I don't think one fits into the other.
00:15:05,00:15:06,- It wasn't down in his ringtone.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"It was very, it was quite shallow in the mouth."
00:15:09,00:15:12,- She had waited for her fingers to grow long enough.
00:15:12,00:15:13,- Yes.
00:15:13,00:15:14,- That's the thing.
00:15:14,00:15:15,- That's what happened.
00:15:15,00:15:16,There we go.
00:15:16,00:15:18,(upbeat music)
00:15:18,00:15:25,"- It is time for us to move on to fact number two,"
00:15:25,00:15:26,and that is my fact.
00:15:26,00:15:30,My fact this week is that one of the leading investigators
00:15:30,00:15:32,"in the Jack the Ripper case,"
00:15:32,00:15:36,whose only major contribution was to arrest someone
00:15:36,00:15:39,"who wasn't capable of being the murderer,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,was called Sergeant Thick.
00:15:41,00:15:45,- That was the guy.
00:15:45,00:15:50,"- Sergeant, yeah, Sergeant William Thick, or Willie Thick,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,which is just funny.
00:15:53,00:15:57,"He basically, yeah, he knocked on the door"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"of a guy called John Pizer, or Pizzar,"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"and he said, ""You need to come with me."""
00:16:03,00:16:05,"And the person said, ""What for?"""
00:16:05,00:16:07,"And Sergeant Thick, having no evidence,"
00:16:07,00:16:09,"clearly didn't know what for,"
00:16:09,00:16:12,"so he'd had to say, ""You know what for?"""
00:16:12,00:16:14,"And the guy went with him,"
00:16:14,00:16:17,"and he was put into jail, and then he was released"
00:16:17,00:16:19,because there was no evidence whatsoever
00:16:19,00:16:20,"that this guy was guilty,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,"and Thick, even himself, when he was interviewed later,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,"saying, ""Yeah, I don't think it could have been him."
00:16:25,00:16:27,"""I don't think he was capable of it."
00:16:27,00:16:28,"""I don't know why I did that."""
00:16:28,00:16:30,"So, yeah. - Oh, wow."
00:16:30,00:16:35,"- We should just say Jack the Ripper was a murderer,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"'cause I know we're in Australia,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,and Ripper means something very different over here.
00:16:39,00:16:40,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Yeah, it was not cool, this guy, yeah."
00:16:43,00:16:45,"And by the way, this is a subject"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"which obviously involves horrific events,"
00:16:47,00:16:49,and we are probably gonna be talking largely
00:16:49,00:16:53,about the people who were named as potential killers
00:16:53,00:16:55,"and so on, but just as a flip side thing,"
00:16:55,00:16:57,"there's an amazing book called ""The Five"""
00:16:57,00:16:58,"that you should go and read, which is all about the women"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"who often don't get humanized in this,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"and yeah, it's an amazing book."
00:17:02,00:17:05,"- So, Mary Jane Kelly, she was known in the press"
00:17:05,00:17:10,"as Fair Emma, Ginger, Dark Mary, and Black Mary,"
00:17:10,00:17:13,suggesting that she must have changed her hair quite a lot
00:17:13,00:17:16,at the various times. - Very nice.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"- There was Annie Chapman, who got into a fight"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"with a female lodger just before she died,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,possibly over a man or possibly over a bar of soap.
00:17:24,00:17:25,We're not sure.
00:17:25,00:17:28,"- They are often confused, I find."
00:17:28,00:17:31,"- There was Elizabeth Stride, who was Swedish,"
00:17:31,00:17:34,and she went around telling everyone that her husband
00:17:34,00:17:38,and her child had died in a shipwreck on the River Thames
00:17:38,00:17:39,"that she survived it,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,but actually there was no such shipwreck.
00:17:41,00:17:42,- I have a theory about her.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"Well, I have a theory about who the killer is,"
00:17:44,00:17:46,because I don't think we have enough people theorizing
00:17:46,00:17:49,"about who the killer was, and it's related to her,"
00:17:49,00:17:52,"because she lived with a man called Michael Kidney,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,"now Jack the Ripper, famously removed people's kidneys."
00:17:55,00:17:57,"- Oh. - Okay, coincidence."
00:17:57,00:17:58,- Probably.
00:17:58,00:18:01,- I don't think so. - Almost certainly.
00:18:01,00:18:05,"Otherwise, you're just going around looking for someone"
00:18:05,00:18:08,"with the surname Murderer, I think, is the--"
00:18:08,00:18:10,- Did anyone try that? - I don't think so.
00:18:10,00:18:13,"But the women are kind of, they were written up,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,"a lot of it was done, it was made very,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"you know, it was made exciting, it was made to sell papers."
00:18:18,00:18:20,"There were so many London papers at the time,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,"about 20 daily papers, all trying to get information"
00:18:23,00:18:24,and sell copies off the back of it.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"So they were often written up as low women,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"or fallen women, or women who sold sex,"
00:18:29,00:18:33,"and actually, like one or two of them had done,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,"or may have done, but actually,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,most of them were out late at night.
00:18:36,00:18:40,"- Yeah, not that there should be any remote difference"
00:18:40,00:18:41,"between someone who sells sex with money,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"and doesn't sell sex with money,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,in terms of whether or not they should be murdered.
00:18:46,00:18:48,But yeah. - I wasn't trying
00:18:48,00:18:50,"to imply the word. - No, no, no, no."
00:18:50,00:18:54,"I just, I think there's a bit of an implication of that."
00:18:54,00:18:55,"- They couldn't afford lodging some of them,"
00:18:55,00:18:58,"and so that's why the killer had the sort of means,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,or the opportunity to kill them.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:01,00:19:03,"Yeah, so Jack the Ripper,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,I think this is quite a fun little detail.
00:19:06,00:19:08,(audience laughing)
00:19:08,00:19:11,There's so many fun details about the guy.
00:19:11,00:19:12,"In a poll in 2006,"
00:19:12,00:19:16,he was voted the worst Britain in history.
00:19:16,00:19:16,(audience laughing)
00:19:16,00:19:18,"- That was before Brexit, though."
00:19:18,00:19:19,- It was.
00:19:19,00:19:20,(audience laughing)
00:19:20,00:19:22,"That's true, yeah."
00:19:22,00:19:23,- Who else was in there?
00:19:23,00:19:25,Do you have any details of who else came?
00:19:25,00:19:27,"- Yeah, I've got them, if you want them."
00:19:27,00:19:29,So Thomas Beckett came second.
00:19:29,00:19:30,- Thomas Beckett?
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- Yeah, King John came fourth."
00:19:32,00:19:34,- When was this poll done in the 12th century?
00:19:34,00:19:36,(audience laughing)
00:19:36,00:19:37,- King John Fair.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"- Yeah, Edric Striota."
00:19:39,00:19:40,- Who's that?
00:19:40,00:19:41,- Good question.
00:19:41,00:19:42,(audience laughing)
00:19:42,00:19:45,"Sir Richard Rich, Lord Rich of Lees."
00:19:45,00:19:47,"- I don't like the sound of him based on his name,"
00:19:47,00:19:48,but I don't know.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"- Hugh Dispenser, the younger who you might know,"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"autonomous of Rundle, and Oswald Mosley."
00:19:54,00:19:54,"- Oh, okay."
00:19:54,00:19:55,- And a few others.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"But basically the way that they did it is,"
00:19:57,00:19:58,"they got a load of historians,"
00:19:58,00:20:02,and they were each allowed to nominate one person.
00:20:02,00:20:04,And so some of them went really straight down the line
00:20:04,00:20:05,"and said, ""Jack the Ripper,"""
00:20:05,00:20:06,"and some of them said,"
00:20:06,00:20:07,"""Here's someone you've never heard of."""
00:20:07,00:20:09,- Hugh Dispenser.
00:20:09,00:20:10,(audience laughing)
00:20:10,00:20:13,- You know all those anti-COVID things you see everywhere?
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Yeah.
00:20:14,00:20:14,- He invented those.
00:20:14,00:20:15,- That's great.
00:20:15,00:20:16,"- It's an easy gig for their story to get,"
00:20:16,00:20:17,"""Jack the Ripper,"" isn't it?"
00:20:17,00:20:20,"They murdered loads of people, pulled their organs out."
00:20:20,00:20:21,I win.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- Yeah, that's the thing about the case,"
00:20:23,00:20:24,"is that a lot of people get very obsessed with it,"
00:20:24,00:20:26,and I think it's a slightly unhealthy way.
00:20:26,00:20:27,And it's written up sometimes as the first ever
00:20:27,00:20:30,"true crime story, you know,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,just because there were lots of people
00:20:31,00:20:33,chucking in their own theories
00:20:33,00:20:34,"and debating with each other and all of that,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,and slightly sort of gamifying it.
00:20:36,00:20:38,One of those theorized to have maybe been the murderer
00:20:38,00:20:40,"was Dr. Thomas Creme,"
00:20:40,00:20:44,who was a doctor who was eventually hanged
00:20:44,00:20:47,for an unrelated murder at Newgate Prison.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"And his last words were,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,"""I am Jack the..."""
00:20:51,00:20:52,(audience laughing)
00:20:52,00:20:53,And then he was hanged.
00:20:53,00:20:54,- No!
00:20:54,00:20:55,- Yeah.
00:20:55,00:20:57,"But it probably wasn't him, but--"
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- Was that bad timing, or?"
00:20:59,00:21:01,- I think it was incredible timing by him.
00:21:01,00:21:02,- I think--
00:21:02,00:21:04,"- So he saw the lever going down, so."
00:21:04,00:21:04,- Wow.
00:21:04,00:21:07,- Because he was in prison at the time the murders happened.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"I mean, it's just very, very, very unlikely"
00:21:08,00:21:09,that he was actually--
00:21:09,00:21:10,- Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- I think he was just--
00:21:11,00:21:12,- He just had flair.
00:21:12,00:21:13,- He's just--
00:21:13,00:21:14,- I think he just had flair.
00:21:14,00:21:16,- Having a bit of fun right at the end.
00:21:16,00:21:17,- It was just happening.
00:21:17,00:21:18,- Why the hell not?
00:21:18,00:21:19,- Yeah.
00:21:19,00:21:21,"- The industry is pretty wild in the UK,"
00:21:21,00:21:23,"and Jack the Ripper Tours are quite mad,"
00:21:23,00:21:26,but my favorite tour is a tour
00:21:26,00:21:29,"that was set up in about 2017 in Clithero,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"which, for those of you who don't know the UK,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,"is in Lancashire, about 250 miles away from Whitechapel."
00:21:34,00:21:36,It's the Jack the Ripper tour.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"It was started by a tour guy called Simon Entwistle,"
00:21:39,00:21:42,"who just sort of noticed that bits of Clithero,"
00:21:42,00:21:43,"actually, they haven't been developed very much"
00:21:43,00:21:44,"since the 19th century,"
00:21:44,00:21:48,so they look a lot more like what Jack the Ripper
00:21:48,00:21:49,would have experienced than London.
00:21:49,00:21:51,"- Yeah, 'cause that bit of London"
00:21:51,00:21:52,is completely developed now.
00:21:52,00:21:53,It's all skyscrapers.
00:21:53,00:21:56,"- Yeah, I gotta say, having grown up near Clithero,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"or as we used to call it, Clithero,"
00:21:58,00:21:59,(laughing)
00:21:59,00:22:01,- It's a very nice little town.
00:22:01,00:22:03,- I stopped after Guitar Hero.
00:22:03,00:22:04,I just didn't think.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"- Well, it's much more difficult figuring on that one."
00:22:07,00:22:09,(laughing)
00:22:09,00:22:10,- And you never get any points
00:22:10,00:22:12,'cause you can't find the fucking thing.
00:22:12,00:22:14,(laughing)
00:22:14,00:22:17,"- How interesting, Clithero."
00:22:17,00:22:20,"- Yeah, that's really, there are all sorts of,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"there's slightly sort of unpleasant,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,"they're like, okay, is this tasteless?"
00:22:24,00:22:26,Efficient chip shop called Jack the Chipper.
00:22:26,00:22:28,(laughing)
00:22:28,00:22:30,"Is it, like, you know, some people say"
00:22:30,00:22:32,it's been long enough and that's fine.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"The proprietor said it was history, never a celebration,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"which, and then they said,"
00:22:37,00:22:38,we've already shown our respectfulness
00:22:38,00:22:40,by offering a 50% discount for women.
00:22:40,00:22:43,"Which, is that okay?"
00:22:43,00:22:46,- We chopped them in half as soon as they come in.
00:22:46,00:22:48,My favorite theory about Jack the Ripper
00:22:48,00:22:50,is that there was no such person.
00:22:50,00:22:51,- Okay.
00:22:51,00:22:52,- And this is the one I actually believe.
00:22:52,00:22:54,This is a guy called Peter Turnbull
00:22:54,00:22:57,who wrote a book called The Killer That Never Was.
00:22:57,00:22:59,His idea is that these people obviously
00:22:59,00:23:01,"were very sadly killed,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,but a lot of them were copycat crimes.
00:23:03,00:23:05,And they were done by people who'd read the stories
00:23:05,00:23:07,"in the newspaper and thought,"
00:23:07,00:23:08,I'm gonna go and do that same thing.
00:23:08,00:23:11,So there wasn't a single serial killer.
00:23:11,00:23:14,And his theories say that there was no consistent
00:23:14,00:23:17,"modus operandi, so the way that the people were killed"
00:23:17,00:23:19,was different each time.
00:23:19,00:23:20,"It wasn't over an extended period,"
00:23:20,00:23:23,"so normally serial killers kill over several years,"
00:23:23,00:23:25,whereas this only happened over 13 weeks.
00:23:25,00:23:28,"And it all took place in a very single area,"
00:23:28,00:23:31,whereas usually serial killers will kill over
00:23:31,00:23:33,a little bit more of a wide area.
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Okay.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- And some of the really terrible things,"
00:23:35,00:23:38,"like that when they were disembowelled the victims,"
00:23:38,00:23:41,they occurred after people in the newspapers
00:23:41,00:23:43,had speculated that that might happen.
00:23:43,00:23:43,- Right.
00:23:43,00:23:44,- Right.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"- So that's, I think that might-"
00:23:45,00:23:47,- So the first one wasn't?
00:23:47,00:23:48,- The first one wasn't disembowelling.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"- 'Cause she was the one who drew lots of tourists, right?"
00:23:50,00:23:52,The industry's been going on since the start.
00:23:52,00:23:54,As soon as the first person was killed.
00:23:54,00:23:57,"I think it was the second person when people started to think,"
00:23:57,00:23:58,"""Ooh, something's going on here."""
00:23:58,00:24:01,"It was in 1888, and locals paid a penny"
00:24:01,00:24:03,to go and see her there.
00:24:03,00:24:04,"And then when she was taken away,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"then locals kept paying a penny,"
00:24:06,00:24:07,"and it was the people who lived next door,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,which good business minds started charging people
00:24:10,00:24:12,just to come and look at the bit of pavement.
00:24:12,00:24:12,- Right.
00:24:12,00:24:13,- Wow.
00:24:13,00:24:15,- And there's quite a few other people
00:24:15,00:24:18,"who were being named, obviously, there's a big, big list."
00:24:18,00:24:19,"There was a guy, this was a big one,"
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Francis Tumblety, which is the most"
00:24:22,00:24:25,un-serial killer name I've ever heard.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Take a tea.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"- Again, you can't really judge people by their name."
00:24:28,00:24:29,(laughing)
00:24:29,00:24:32,"- I'm gonna judge Francis, I think."
00:24:32,00:24:35,"So he was supposedly, not only was he Jack the Ripper,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,but he was also complicit in the assassination
00:24:37,00:24:38,of Abraham Lincoln.
00:24:38,00:24:40,So supposedly he'd done that and he'd come over.
00:24:40,00:24:42,But what he was was a miracle quack.
00:24:42,00:24:44,He just used to sell medicine.
00:24:44,00:24:47,His big invention was called Tumblety's Pimple Destroyer.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"- So even if he was guilty, he did some good"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"and he did some bad, right?"
00:24:52,00:24:54,"- I mean, Deadpool's are a real blight."
00:24:54,00:24:54,- There you go.
00:24:54,00:24:56,- A lot of adolescents.
00:24:56,00:24:57,- Have you heard of Richard Mansfield?
00:24:57,00:24:59,"- Oh, the actor?"
00:24:59,00:25:03,- He was an actor who got caught up in this completely.
00:25:03,00:25:04,This was nothing to do with him.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"But at the time the murders happened,"
00:25:07,00:25:09,"there was a play on, which was a dramatization"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,which is about a doctor who drinks a potion
00:25:13,00:25:16,"and then becomes, you know, changes personality"
00:25:16,00:25:17,and becomes evil.
00:25:17,00:25:21,And people thought that he might be the murderer
00:25:21,00:25:22,simply because he was such a good actor
00:25:22,00:25:25,at playing both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"And the production was shut down,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,but the stage craft was so unbelievable.
00:25:28,00:25:30,People couldn't work out how it was done
00:25:30,00:25:32,because he changed physically.
00:25:32,00:25:35,"And people thought that I can't believe what I'm seeing, right?"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"It was so effective that they thought,"
00:25:37,00:25:38,"people sat with opera glasses,"
00:25:38,00:25:41,trying to look at what this guy had done on stage.
00:25:41,00:25:42,- Like physically?
00:25:42,00:25:43,- Yeah.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"And some people said, oh, he's just putting a mask on."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"And actually, can I just tell you what he did?"
00:25:46,00:25:47,This is so good.
00:25:47,00:25:49,They had pre-painted his face
00:25:49,00:25:53,in a way that standard theater lighting wouldn't show.
00:25:53,00:25:55,And then they introduced a colored filter
00:25:55,00:25:57,"in the lights in the theater,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,which showed up the grease paint
00:25:59,00:26:00,"and he would contort his face a little bit,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,but it would completely change the look of his face.
00:26:03,00:26:04,- That's very clever.
00:26:04,00:26:09,- And I have not done that tonight.
00:26:09,00:26:14,"But imagine if I had, how interesting that would have been."
00:26:14,00:26:15,- Wow.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"- And he got completely caught up in it,"
00:26:16,00:26:17,but nothing to do with him.
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- That's exciting, yeah."
00:26:19,00:26:21,"- We're gonna have to move on in a sec, guys."
00:26:21,00:26:22,- Have you heard of Jack the Flipper?
00:26:22,00:26:23,- Jack the Flipper.
00:26:23,00:26:25,- An aggressive dolphin in a 2013 study.
00:26:25,00:26:27,(laughing)
00:26:27,00:26:29,"- The dipper, on the other hand,"
00:26:29,00:26:31,is an ice cream shop in North Carolina.
00:26:31,00:26:33,(laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:37,- Are you culminating in Amsterdam's Jack the Stripper?
00:26:37,00:26:38,"I've got to say, I'm really anxious"
00:26:38,00:26:39,about what's coming up.
00:26:39,00:26:40,"- Oh, yeah."
00:26:40,00:26:41,- Okay.
00:26:41,00:26:43,(upbeat music)
00:26:43,00:26:47,"- It is time for fact number three,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,and that is Andy.
00:26:49,00:26:51,My fact is that German mini golfers
00:26:51,00:26:53,refrigerate their balls.
00:26:53,00:26:54,So.
00:26:54,00:26:56,- Doesn't it hurt when they close the door?
00:26:56,00:26:58,(laughing)
00:26:58,00:26:58,- Lovely.
00:26:58,00:26:59,(laughing)
00:26:59,00:27:01,Lovely stuff.
00:27:01,00:27:02,- Very good.
00:27:02,00:27:03,- This was a great piece in the FT
00:27:03,00:27:05,"about the world of mini golf,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"which is just, this is not crazy golf."
00:27:07,00:27:09,"It is big golf, made small."
00:27:09,00:27:11,"Mini golf, as the title applies."
00:27:11,00:27:12,"It's not, there are no windmills,"
00:27:12,00:27:14,"there are no clowns, there are no dinosaurs."
00:27:14,00:27:14,"- Okay, I was saying,"
00:27:14,00:27:17,"""Creative Golf"" is a segment of mini golf,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,"the fun guy segment, if you will."
00:27:19,00:27:20,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:27:20,00:27:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:21,00:27:23,"All crazy golf is mini,"
00:27:23,00:27:24,but not all mini golf is crazy.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:25,00:27:28,And the correspondent went to see
00:27:28,00:27:29,"the World Finals, the seniors,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,"mini golf world championships,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,and they take it very seriously.
00:27:32,00:27:34,And the Germans chill their balls.
00:27:34,00:27:35,They have special ball fridges
00:27:35,00:27:37,to ensure they have ball homeostasis.
00:27:37,00:27:39,And it's a very big deal.
00:27:39,00:27:42,"And you know, some players keep their balls in their socks."
00:27:42,00:27:44,They tuck them into their trousers.
00:27:44,00:27:45,- All right.
00:27:45,00:27:47,- 'Cause you want consistency of temperature.
00:27:47,00:27:49,You want consistency of rolling.
00:27:49,00:27:50,- How do you make your shoes fit?
00:27:50,00:27:51,"If you've got a,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,"is it, you just have to buy much larger shoe?"
00:27:53,00:27:56,"- Oh no, your sock, your sock goes higher than your,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,unless you're wearing those ankle socks.
00:27:58,00:27:59,- Oh yeah.
00:27:59,00:28:00,- That's not gonna work.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"- Oh no, sorry, it's not like,"
00:28:01,00:28:01,I was imagining the end of the sock.
00:28:01,00:28:03,"- I believe it is at the end of the sock,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,but it's at the other end you're thinking of.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"- Yes, okay, yes."
00:28:06,00:28:08,"- It's, I think we've said it before,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"that these balls that they use in mini golf,"
00:28:10,00:28:11,they're not golf balls.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Are they? - No.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"- They're kind of rubbery things,"
00:28:14,00:28:16,which I guess makes it more important
00:28:16,00:28:17,that they're the right temperature.
00:28:17,00:28:18,- Right.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- There's still golf balls of it.
00:28:19,00:28:20,They're mini golf balls.
00:28:20,00:28:21,"- They're mini golf balls, yeah."
00:28:21,00:28:23,"- And they are, you can pick your own balls?"
00:28:23,00:28:24,"I think we said, did we say that?"
00:28:24,00:28:25,- No.
00:28:25,00:28:26,"- If you play golf, you'll have a,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,you might like select your club.
00:28:28,00:28:29,"Or you've got a caddy, is it?"
00:28:29,00:28:31,Your caddy carries your clubs for you.
00:28:31,00:28:32,- Yeah.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"- Is that, does that happen?"
00:28:33,00:28:34,- Parking.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"- Do you have a,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,like do you have a caddy when you play golf?
00:28:37,00:28:39,- You can on occasion.
00:28:39,00:28:41,"- Okay, but you can, if you're a mini golf,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,"I have a ball caddy,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,because you've got so many balls to choose from.
00:28:44,00:28:45,- Oh really?
00:28:45,00:28:46,- Which balls you play and which holes?
00:28:46,00:28:47,"- So when professional golfers say,"
00:28:47,00:28:51,"give me the nine iron or whatever that language is,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,"in mini golf, it's the opposite."
00:28:52,00:28:54,Give me the red ball.
00:28:54,00:28:55,"- Give me the big, big round ball."
00:28:55,00:28:56,- Big round ball.
00:28:56,00:28:56,"- Yeah, round ball."
00:28:56,00:28:58,"- They're all the same size, we should say."
00:28:58,00:29:00,- So what are you choosing?
00:29:00,00:29:00,- Yes.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"- Of course, Andy."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- Come on, we can't play with a marble"
00:29:03,00:29:04,"some of the time in a beach ball,"
00:29:04,00:29:05,some of the rest of the time.
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- Are you sure, sir?"
00:29:06,00:29:08,This one is twice the size of the hole.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"- Yes, I'll take it."
00:29:09,00:29:10,- James.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Yes.
00:29:11,00:29:12,"- Tiger Woods once,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,this is something I don't know about golf.
00:29:14,00:29:17,He played the big championship that he won.
00:29:17,00:29:18,He ran out of balls.
00:29:18,00:29:19,- Okay.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- And he was only, he was down to like one ball"
00:29:21,00:29:24,and you can't just request more balls.
00:29:24,00:29:25,"- No, no."
00:29:25,00:29:27,- Did he have to use one of his balls?
00:29:27,00:29:28,(laughing)
00:29:28,00:29:33,"- He did use, Tiger Woods famously used his balls a lot,"
00:29:33,00:29:38,"but in golf, however many you bring with you"
00:29:38,00:29:42,"on the first tee is how many you have to,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,"you know, you can't get any more from the club."
00:29:44,00:29:45,- That's crazy.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- The ones you've got are the ones you're stuck with.
00:29:46,00:29:47,- That's extraordinary.
00:29:47,00:29:49,- Here's one really interesting thing
00:29:49,00:29:52,that is different about mini golf and maxi golf.
00:29:52,00:29:56,"And that is, in mini golf, you refrigerate your balls."
00:29:56,00:29:59,"In maxi golf, it is against the rules"
00:29:59,00:30:02,to warm your balls up explicitly.
00:30:02,00:30:05,You're not allowed to warm because it changes the way
00:30:05,00:30:06,that they might fly through the air.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"You are allowed to warm them up before the round,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,but then they will go cold quite quickly.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"But during the game, you're not allowed to."
00:30:13,00:30:16,And it's to such an extent that when you play golf
00:30:16,00:30:19,"in a country that isn't fucking boiling like this one,"
00:30:19,00:30:22,you get cold a lot and you would have like hand warmers
00:30:22,00:30:26,"in your pockets, you'd be advised not to put your balls"
00:30:26,00:30:28,"near those hand warmers because your opponents could say,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,"you're artificially warming them up,"
00:30:30,00:30:31,you're gonna get kicked out.
00:30:31,00:30:33,"- Are you allowed to, but you're allowed to pocket your balls?"
00:30:33,00:30:34,- You can put them in your pocket.
00:30:34,00:30:35,- Can you put them in your armpits?
00:30:35,00:30:37,Can you keep them in your mouth?
00:30:37,00:30:38,(laughing)
00:30:38,00:30:39,"Can you, I'm not gonna ask any more questions,"
00:30:39,00:30:44,but I can think of a few locations which would ensure--
00:30:44,00:30:47,- Every hole's a goal.
00:30:47,00:30:48,(laughing)
00:30:48,00:30:52,The rule specifically says you're not allowed
00:30:52,00:30:55,to artificially warm your golf balls.
00:30:55,00:30:56,- But is my bum--
00:30:56,00:31:01,- It doesn't specifically say it would be a case by case basis.
00:31:01,00:31:03,- Right.
00:31:03,00:31:05,- I can assure you my bum is 100% real.
00:31:05,00:31:06,You know?
00:31:06,00:31:07,(laughing)
00:31:07,00:31:09,- I feel like it might affect your stance.
00:31:09,00:31:11,(laughing)
00:31:11,00:31:13,"- I think you failed the caddy interview,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,"is all I can tell you, so."
00:31:15,00:31:17,(laughing)
00:31:17,00:31:18,"- I'm telling you, you're caddy."
00:31:18,00:31:20,"Just walk to the spot you're teeing off,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,and just squeeze their cheeks and drop.
00:31:22,00:31:23,(laughing)
00:31:23,00:31:25,"- If they can land it directly on the tee,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,that is a great caddy.
00:31:26,00:31:27,- That's a caddy.
00:31:27,00:31:29,- Oh my God.
00:31:29,00:31:31,(laughing)
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- Moving, moving on."
00:31:32,00:31:33,- You brought it up.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
00:31:35,00:31:37,- Moving on to the balls up the pump.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"- Hey, check this out."
00:31:38,00:31:42,A 2009 search for the Loch Ness Monster.
00:31:42,00:31:42,- Oh my God.
00:31:42,00:31:43,(laughing)
00:31:43,00:31:44,- How do you do it?
00:31:44,00:31:46,How do you do it?
00:31:46,00:31:48,"- It didn't find the Loch Ness Monster,"
00:31:48,00:31:51,"it found 100,000 golf balls."
00:31:51,00:31:53,And basically they've worked out that there's a driving range
00:31:53,00:31:56,"where golf balls have been lobbed into Loch Ness,"
00:31:56,00:31:57,and they're just all over the ground.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"They were registering all these signals,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"and there was 100,000 of them."
00:32:01,00:32:03,"They thought, my God, they're baby Loch Ness Monster eggs."
00:32:03,00:32:05,(laughing)
00:32:05,00:32:07,- They all had type list written on the side.
00:32:07,00:32:09,(laughing)
00:32:09,00:32:10,"- Yeah, they didn't think that."
00:32:10,00:32:12,"That's what I would have thought, is what I mean."
00:32:12,00:32:14,"But yeah, so, Lost Balls,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,"I mean, this is an actual job that you can get"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"at a golf course, not a mini golf course,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,but they have scuba divers
00:32:21,00:32:24,"who are paid to go into all the bits of water,"
00:32:24,00:32:25,"and they go hunting for balls,"
00:32:25,00:32:27,and they get paid by the ball that they found.
00:32:27,00:32:29,So that's a job you can get if you're one of--
00:32:29,00:32:32,"- It's incredible, 'cause they build up so much over time."
00:32:32,00:32:34,Have you heard of Glenn Berger?
00:32:34,00:32:36,- This is a guy who has exactly the job
00:32:36,00:32:37,that Dennis just described.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"He's been working, he was profiled about 10 years ago."
00:32:40,00:32:43,He had already collected 15 million balls.
00:32:43,00:32:44,- What?
00:32:44,00:32:48,"- His personal best is 17,000 balls in a day."
00:32:48,00:32:48,- What?
00:32:48,00:32:49,- How?
00:32:49,00:32:50,"- Again, he's employing lots of people"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"to do his balls work, right?"
00:32:52,00:32:54,"- Yeah, but that's, I think, his personal best."
00:32:54,00:32:55,That's him going down. - No.
00:32:55,00:32:58,"- Yeah, 'cause if you've got someone that has been played"
00:32:58,00:33:00,on a golf course for years and years--
00:33:00,00:33:02,"- I guess if you're literally just dredging them, maybe."
00:33:02,00:33:04,"- He's dredging, or he goes down"
00:33:04,00:33:05,"and he'll just pull them into sacks, you know,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,'cause they all settle in the same place.
00:33:07,00:33:09,There is a website called golf.com.
00:33:09,00:33:10,It's a very good website.
00:33:10,00:33:11,(audience laughing)
00:33:11,00:33:13,"- If you like golf. - If you like golf, yeah."
00:33:13,00:33:17,"It claims that in the late 1990s,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,there was a golf ball diver who spent several hours
00:33:19,00:33:21,stuck on the bottom because he was pinned down
00:33:21,00:33:23,by an amorous alligator.
00:33:23,00:33:24,- Right. - Oh my God.
00:33:24,00:33:27,- Who was trying to flirt.
00:33:27,00:33:29,- One way of improving your golf balls
00:33:29,00:33:32,perhaps might be to make them radioactive.
00:33:32,00:33:33,"- Ooh, okay."
00:33:33,00:33:35,"In 1910, there was a company called"
00:33:35,00:33:36,the Worthington Golf Ball Company
00:33:36,00:33:39,that started making golf balls with radium in them.
00:33:39,00:33:43,And they said they were wise enough to stop.
00:33:43,00:33:46,It's a reasonable position and not develop unduly
00:33:46,00:33:48,a power that could be dangerous.
00:33:48,00:33:49,So I think they just had a little bit in.
00:33:49,00:33:50,- Why were you doing it?
00:33:50,00:33:52,Is it so you can find them?
00:33:52,00:33:54,"- Well, the idea is in those days, they thought,"
00:33:54,00:33:56,'cause radium was this new sort of wonder material
00:33:56,00:33:59,"that they found, they thought you could add radium"
00:33:59,00:34:01,to anything and it would just make it better.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"They had radium condoms, for instance."
00:34:03,00:34:06,"- Yeah, yeah, radium crockery."
00:34:06,00:34:07,I saw some of that recently in a shop.
00:34:07,00:34:09,"And I walked past at night and I thought,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"'Oh, what a cool light display they've got.'"
00:34:11,00:34:13,"And it was just a display of, I think it was uranium."
00:34:13,00:34:14,"- Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:14,00:34:17,- Were you shopping in the 1910s?
00:34:17,00:34:19,"- It was an antique shop, but it was very--"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"- I think that it's kind of,"
00:34:21,00:34:24,"you're not supposed to really buy too many of those, are you?"
00:34:24,00:34:25,"I think they're kind of, yeah."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"But they did these in 1910,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,but they didn't really sell very well.
00:34:29,00:34:30,But then they came back
00:34:30,00:34:33,"and in recent years, there's been some scientists"
00:34:33,00:34:35,at the Atomic Energy of Canada
00:34:35,00:34:39,who have said that they have put their golf balls
00:34:39,00:34:41,in radioactive position
00:34:41,00:34:45,and they travel 20 to 30 yards further than conventional balls.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"- Really? - Yeah, they put it"
00:34:46,00:34:49,"in an electron beam, but they have said"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"that they won't make any claims, you know,"
00:34:51,00:34:55,claims in the shops to say this definitely will work.
00:34:55,00:34:57,They said that would require study
00:34:57,00:34:59,and we don't intend to study it.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"- No? Okay, that's science."
00:35:01,00:35:03,(laughing)
00:35:03,00:35:06,There's actually a stop gap in between your 1910
00:35:06,00:35:09,"and then more recent ones, which is in 1951."
00:35:09,00:35:11,There was a guy called Dr. William L. Davidson
00:35:11,00:35:14,and he supposedly was creating golf balls
00:35:14,00:35:17,but with little quantities of radioactive material inside.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"And as you say, Andy, it was for if a golf ball got lost,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,you would go with a Geiger counter
00:35:22,00:35:24,and you would be able to locate your ball.
00:35:24,00:35:25,- That's a pretty good idea.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"- Yeah. - Yeah, that's a good idea."
00:35:27,00:35:28,- Do you know how many balls there are out there?
00:35:28,00:35:31,"This is in America alone, USA alone,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,300 million golf balls go missing every year.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"- Wow, that's almost exactly the population of America."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"- For every person in America,"
00:35:39,00:35:40,"if you're listening to this in the States,"
00:35:40,00:35:43,there is a golf ball for every year of your life waiting.
00:35:43,00:35:45,(laughing)
00:35:45,00:35:48,It's out there and you'll never find them all.
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Oh, oh yes, yes."
00:35:49,00:35:53,"- What a sobering thought. - Right, what a sobering thought."
00:35:53,00:35:55,- We don't know what happens to them either.
00:35:55,00:35:57,No one knows what happens to a golf ball
00:35:57,00:35:58,that doesn't get touched.
00:35:58,00:36:00,"There's no recognized study, so they don't know--"
00:36:00,00:36:01,"- 'Cause they last 1,000 years."
00:36:01,00:36:03,"We have no, they just don't degrade."
00:36:03,00:36:03,- Yes.
00:36:03,00:36:06,- The cockroaches will be able to play golf in the future.
00:36:06,00:36:09,Just a sort of lateral thinking test for you.
00:36:09,00:36:12,"There was, so golf balls used to be surrounded"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"by a very hard, vulcanized rubber shell,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"which isn't quite the same as they have now,"
00:36:16,00:36:20,so that was replaced with fully synthetic rubber in the end.
00:36:20,00:36:23,But it was in 1965 that the transition started to be made.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"It was a chemist called Harry Lander,"
00:36:25,00:36:26,"was one of the people who did it,"
00:36:26,00:36:29,"and he was trying to make a really durable golf ball,"
00:36:29,00:36:32,"and he made one, and it was successful,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"but it didn't have that hard shell,"
00:36:34,00:36:37,"and so he had to make a tweak to it, a special change,"
00:36:37,00:36:41,'cause it didn't do something that all golfers wanted it to do.
00:36:41,00:36:42,What did he have to add back in?
00:36:42,00:36:44,"- Okay, what did it not do?"
00:36:44,00:36:46,So it wasn't hard on the outside.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"- Yes, it works still just as well."
00:36:48,00:36:51,"- Okay, so they just like the sound of the flak."
00:36:51,00:36:54,"- Like the sound, James, you've got the mind of a golfer,"
00:36:54,00:36:56,he had to add the click back in.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- Really? - They came back and said...
00:36:57,00:37:00,- Like a car door. - Exactly like a car door.
00:37:00,00:37:02,- Wow. - They added the click back into golf balls.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- That's so funny.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"- I'm gonna have to move us on, guys, so we're next back."
00:37:05,00:37:08,- Can I do a 2018 headline from the UK?
00:37:08,00:37:12,"""Man filmed having sex with ninth hole of golf course."""
00:37:12,00:37:13,(audience laughing)
00:37:13,00:37:15,"And a quote, ""From where he was,"
00:37:15,00:37:18,"""it looked like he had his penis in the hole"
00:37:18,00:37:20,"""while he had the flak in his backside."""
00:37:20,00:37:22,(audience laughing)
00:37:22,00:37:23,- Interesting.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- It was the most weirdest thing
00:37:24,00:37:27,I've ever had the most fortune to see.
00:37:27,00:37:30,All I can say is if my ball ever goes in the ninth hole
00:37:30,00:37:32,"at Brackenwood, it can stay there."
00:37:32,00:37:34,(audience laughing)
00:37:34,00:37:37,- And that's where the 300 million others are.
00:37:37,00:37:40,(upbeat music)
00:37:40,00:37:45,"- It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:37:45,00:37:47,and that is James.
00:37:47,00:37:50,"- Okay, and my fact this week is that M&Ms"
00:37:50,00:37:53,deliberately made the green character sexy
00:37:53,00:37:55,because of a school ground rumour
00:37:55,00:37:58,that that coloured sweets were an aphrodisiac.
00:37:58,00:38:01,(audience laughing)
00:38:01,00:38:04,"This is Ms. Green, and for people"
00:38:04,00:38:05,"who can't see her on the screen,"
00:38:05,00:38:10,"she has pouty lips and eyelashes and high heels,"
00:38:10,00:38:14,"and she was invented by a marketing agency called BBDO,"
00:38:14,00:38:17,"who wanted to transform M&Ms into a brand,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"into a more iconic brand, I should say,"
00:38:19,00:38:22,"and they came up with these ideas of spokes candies,"
00:38:22,00:38:26,"and in their press release, they say that the green M&M,"
00:38:26,00:38:27,she adds credence to the rumour
00:38:27,00:38:30,"that her mere presence is a turn on,"
00:38:30,00:38:33,and it turns out that kids throughout
00:38:33,00:38:35,"the previous 20 years or so had all been saying,"
00:38:35,00:38:38,"if you eat the green ones, it's an aphrodisiac,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"and they thought, oh, we might as well run with it."
00:38:40,00:38:43,"- Yeah, it's pretty amazing that every single colour"
00:38:43,00:38:46,of an M&M was associated with a kind of school ground
00:38:46,00:38:48,"or workplace or general life myth, right?"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"Like it just, it was everywhere."
00:38:50,00:38:52,So green ones were an aphrodisiac.
00:38:52,00:38:54,The last one you pulled out of the bag was red.
00:38:54,00:38:56,"You need to make a wish, and it will come true."
00:38:56,00:38:58,"If the last candy that comes out of the bag is yellow,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,you can call in sick and stay at home.
00:39:00,00:39:02,"Orange, yeah, orange."
00:39:02,00:39:03,- No one ever did that.
00:39:03,00:39:06,Did any boss ever receive that call?
00:39:06,00:39:08,Please write in if so.
00:39:08,00:39:09,"- Orange M&Ms, good luck."
00:39:09,00:39:10,"Brown ones, bad luck."
00:39:10,00:39:12,"It was all, that's just, that was,"
00:39:12,00:39:15,that's what people said when you pulled the thing out.
00:39:15,00:39:16,- I just feel like a lot of people
00:39:16,00:39:18,are probably similar to myself.
00:39:18,00:39:20,"A packet out of packet of M&Ms without being aware,"
00:39:20,00:39:23,any of them had personalities until now.
00:39:23,00:39:23,- Really?
00:39:23,00:39:25,- I certainly didn't know until I read this.
00:39:25,00:39:27,I couldn't believe she was sexy.
00:39:27,00:39:29,Did everyone else know this?
00:39:29,00:39:29,- Yeah.
00:39:29,00:39:33,- I was a loner at school.
00:39:33,00:39:35,I didn't pick up on those things.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"- But the rumour, I think the rumour was that."
00:39:37,00:39:39,And I had no idea about the connection.
00:39:39,00:39:40,I just thought they'd been a bit weird
00:39:40,00:39:44,"by making one of them a bit, a bit fit."
00:39:44,00:39:46,"- And it's got controversial lately, hasn't it?"
00:39:46,00:39:47,"- I mean, to a certain extent."
00:39:47,00:39:50,"- Oh, got extremely controversial."
00:39:50,00:39:50,- How come?
00:39:50,00:39:51,Why?
00:39:51,00:39:53,"- Well, you know, should we have one"
00:39:53,00:39:55,who's wearing high heels with no pants on?
00:39:55,00:39:57,"To be honest, looking at that picture."
00:39:57,00:39:58,- None of them are wearing pants.
00:39:58,00:39:59,It's weirder if one of them's wearing pants.
00:39:59,00:40:00,- That's a really good point.
00:40:00,00:40:02,- I don't like the thought of an M&M wearing pants at all.
00:40:02,00:40:04,- They did attempt to replace
00:40:04,00:40:06,the green one's high heel boots with trainers.
00:40:06,00:40:09,And they put like sensible heels on the brown one
00:40:09,00:40:10,who used to wear little kitten heels.
00:40:10,00:40:12,"And then there's a huge backlash by which I mean,"
00:40:12,00:40:14,I think one person wrote an article about it.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"And so they reverted, you know,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,because it was woken as gone mad.
00:40:18,00:40:19,- Yeah.
00:40:19,00:40:23,- So there was one bit where she did a sports illustrated
00:40:23,00:40:25,swimsuit modeling thing.
00:40:25,00:40:26,- Weird.
00:40:26,00:40:31,- Where she sort of unzipped almost her entire body
00:40:31,00:40:33,to reveal the chocolate inside.
00:40:33,00:40:34,"- Oh, wow."
00:40:34,00:40:35,- Which feels more like a horror movie thing
00:40:35,00:40:36,than a sexy thing.
00:40:36,00:40:37,- Yeah.
00:40:37,00:40:38,That's why cats got in trouble.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"'Cause they had a cat taking off his,"
00:40:40,00:40:41,or a cat wearing a fur coat.
00:40:41,00:40:42,"And I was like, where'd you get that fur coat?"
00:40:42,00:40:43,What's the fur?
00:40:43,00:40:44,Do you remember?
00:40:44,00:40:47,Judy Dench in Cats is wearing a fur coat.
00:40:47,00:40:49,"Is a cat, but she's also wearing a fur coat."
00:40:49,00:40:51,"And everyone was like, well, that's a bit rum, isn't it?"
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Is it?
00:40:52,00:40:53,- Oh.
00:40:53,00:40:54,- It's a bit rum.
00:40:54,00:40:55,- Anyway.
00:40:55,00:40:56,- Was it more or less controversial
00:40:56,00:40:57,than the huge M&M controversy?
00:40:57,00:40:59,"- I mean, that's extremely controversial."
00:40:59,00:41:00,"Well, let's be real."
00:41:00,00:41:00,"They're just smarties, right?"
00:41:00,00:41:01,They're just smarties.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- What?
00:41:02,00:41:03,"- Oh, come on."
00:41:03,00:41:06,"- Can I just say for legal reasons,"
00:41:06,00:41:07,they are not just smarties.
00:41:07,00:41:08,- They are basically smarties.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"- But also, don't they predate smarties?"
00:41:10,00:41:12,"- No, smarties just predate them."
00:41:12,00:41:13,- Okay.
00:41:13,00:41:16,- So Forrest Mars is the scion of the Mars dynasty.
00:41:16,00:41:18,"He had broken with his family firm,"
00:41:18,00:41:21,but he was of chocolate pedigree.
00:41:21,00:41:23,And he was in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.
00:41:23,00:41:26,Unclear why he felt the need to stick his beak
00:41:26,00:41:28,"into the Spanish Civil War, but."
00:41:28,00:41:30,- There was a lot of beak sticking happening.
00:41:30,00:41:31,- So much.
00:41:31,00:41:31,- Next time.
00:41:31,00:41:34,He spent time with George Harris from Roundtree.
00:41:34,00:41:36,"And the story, which may not be true, but it may,"
00:41:36,00:41:38,is that he noticed some soldiers with smarties
00:41:38,00:41:41,and they have a hard candy shell.
00:41:41,00:41:43,"They don't melt as in the fierce Spanish sun,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,as easily as just normal chocolate would do.
00:41:45,00:41:49,"And miraculously, he then thought of M&Ms."
00:41:49,00:41:49,What gave me the idea?
00:41:49,00:41:51,We'll never know.
00:41:51,00:41:52,- And he's one of the M's of M&Ms.
00:41:52,00:41:54,So it's Forrest Mars.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"And then the other person is Bruce Murray,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,who was part of Hershey's.
00:41:58,00:41:59,"And it was a sort of collaboration, right?"
00:41:59,00:42:01,Where they had the chocolate.
00:42:01,00:42:03,He had the idea stolen from the Spanish Civil War.
00:42:03,00:42:05,And then they came together.
00:42:05,00:42:07,"- And that's why it's M&Ms, right?"
00:42:07,00:42:10,So it's the apostrophe M means it belongs to both of them.
00:42:10,00:42:14,So it means M&Ms means belongs to Murray and Mars.
00:42:14,00:42:17,"But that means that a single M&M,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"that still belongs to them both, right?"
00:42:19,00:42:20,- Sure.
00:42:20,00:42:23,"- So that, I reckon a single M&M really should be an M&Ms,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,because it belongs to Murray and Mars.
00:42:26,00:42:28,And that means I reckon a full packet of M&Ms
00:42:28,00:42:30,should be M&Ms's.
00:42:30,00:42:33,And that's what I will be asking for
00:42:33,00:42:34,in the shops from now on.
00:42:34,00:42:36,- Right.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"- This is gonna be the next big controversy, isn't it?"
00:42:39,00:42:44,- One panino and two M&Ms's is great.
00:42:44,00:42:46,I completely forgot to check something
00:42:46,00:42:49,speaking of the M's and the M's on the sweets.
00:42:49,00:42:50,And I meant to.
00:42:50,00:42:53,"So sorry, I wouldn't normally ask the audience,"
00:42:53,00:42:54,"but if you are listening at home, please try it."
00:42:54,00:42:56,I read in either the Atlantic or the New York Times
00:42:56,00:42:59,"that if you pour a packet of M&Ms into some beer,"
00:42:59,00:43:01,the lettles will peel off from their shelves
00:43:01,00:43:02,and float around the beer on their own
00:43:02,00:43:04,like a goat trying to spell out a message.
00:43:04,00:43:05,- Ooh.
00:43:05,00:43:06,"- Oh, really?"
00:43:06,00:43:07,- What was it that the ghost was just saying?
00:43:07,00:43:09,"- Mm, yeah."
00:43:09,00:43:11,"- If that is, he's in a pint of beer, so."
00:43:11,00:43:12,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:43:12,00:43:14,"- I think, didn't they, they invented it"
00:43:14,00:43:17,or they changed and innovated an existing machine
00:43:17,00:43:20,specifically to print the M onto the M&Ms?
00:43:20,00:43:22,- They're very secretive about their machines.
00:43:22,00:43:23,"- Yeah, right."
00:43:23,00:43:25,- There are stories that if you're an engineer
00:43:25,00:43:27,"and a machine goes wrong at the M&M factory,"
00:43:27,00:43:30,that you're led in to repair it blindfolded.
00:43:30,00:43:31,- What?
00:43:31,00:43:31,- It's not clear at all.
00:43:31,00:43:32,- Is the point complete?
00:43:32,00:43:35,It's not a secret where it is in the factory.
00:43:35,00:43:38,"And you can't fix it blindfolded, presumably."
00:43:38,00:43:40,"- I don't know, I think not."
00:43:40,00:43:41,But suppose that maybe you don't see
00:43:41,00:43:43,the Oompa Loompas as you pass them by.
00:43:43,00:43:44,It's the idea.
00:43:44,00:43:45,- Right.
00:43:45,00:43:45,- But you'd hear them singing.
00:43:45,00:43:48,- You'd hear them singing.
00:43:48,00:43:50,"- But they're really, like Forrest Mars,"
00:43:50,00:43:52,"we have mentioned before on the show, he was insane."
00:43:52,00:43:53,So if executives had meetings
00:43:53,00:43:55,"with competitors or outsiders,"
00:43:55,00:43:56,they would sometimes turn up in disguise
00:43:56,00:43:58,with a false moustache or whatever.
00:43:58,00:43:59,Supposedly even their bankers
00:43:59,00:44:01,don't have access to their financial records.
00:44:01,00:44:02,- What?
00:44:02,00:44:04,- Don't know what's going on there.
00:44:04,00:44:05,But he was a total recluse.
00:44:05,00:44:07,There are no photos of him.
00:44:07,00:44:09,Or there might have been one photo of him ever taken.
00:44:09,00:44:10,- Publicly.
00:44:10,00:44:12,- He might have a lot in his family album.
00:44:12,00:44:13,- Maybe.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"- But yeah, he never wanted to be seen in public."
00:44:15,00:44:17,"- Yeah, someone in 1999 tried to find out"
00:44:17,00:44:21,"the name of the president of the Mars company, right?"
00:44:21,00:44:23,"1999, no one knew the name of the president"
00:44:23,00:44:25,"of the Mars company, one of the biggest companies"
00:44:25,00:44:26,on the planet.
00:44:26,00:44:28,"A journalist phoned up and said,"
00:44:28,00:44:29,"""Can you tell me who's the president"
00:44:29,00:44:30,"""of the Mars company, please?"""
00:44:30,00:44:31,"Only to be told, ""I'm sorry,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,"""I can't give out the names of our associates."""
00:44:33,00:44:35,Phone was hung up.
00:44:35,00:44:35,- Really?
00:44:35,00:44:37,- They had a cult of total secrecy for a long time.
00:44:37,00:44:39,- Has that changed or is that still the case?
00:44:39,00:44:41,"- It's still pretty much, it's his descendants"
00:44:41,00:44:41,"who are running the place now, right?"
00:44:41,00:44:42,"- Yeah, right."
00:44:42,00:44:44,"- It's still very, very, it's a touch ship."
00:44:44,00:44:45,- Yeah.
00:44:45,00:44:47,- It's very clever what they did with M&Ms
00:44:47,00:44:49,with giving each of the M&Ms a different color
00:44:49,00:44:51,because the color became the personality
00:44:51,00:44:53,and hence people trying to fill in the gaps
00:44:53,00:44:56,and work out what they brought to the table.
00:44:56,00:44:58,"And I was thinking, could we do that?"
00:44:58,00:45:00,"That doesn't work, 'cause we're a podcast."
00:45:00,00:45:01,We can't wear colors.
00:45:01,00:45:04,People won't be able to hear the colors.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"And then I thought, actually,"
00:45:06,00:45:08,someone did it for us the other day
00:45:08,00:45:10,because we were at a gig here in Australia
00:45:10,00:45:13,and someone gave us a little fanzine
00:45:13,00:45:16,that they've done of us by George Rex Comics
00:45:16,00:45:20,and they've actually given us words to define who we are.
00:45:20,00:45:21,"- Well, you mean like the Spice Girls."
00:45:21,00:45:23,"- Like the Spice Girls, exactly."
00:45:23,00:45:25,"So that's how we need to exist, right?"
00:45:25,00:45:28,"So in this quiz, which member of No Such Thing"
00:45:28,00:45:29,as a Fish are you?
00:45:29,00:45:31,Here are the four options for what we could be.
00:45:31,00:45:33,Sarcastic.
00:45:33,00:45:35,Northern.
00:45:35,00:45:38,(audience laughing)
00:45:38,00:45:38,Boring.
00:45:38,00:45:41,And an idiot.
00:45:41,00:45:45,That's devastatingly bad to write.
00:45:45,00:45:48,"So we've got boring Spice, stupid Spice."
00:45:48,00:45:49,Sarky Spice.
00:45:49,00:45:50,And Scow Spice.
00:45:50,00:45:53,(audience laughing)
00:45:53,00:45:53,Northern Spice.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"- Scow Spice, great."
00:45:55,00:45:56,"- No, I was trying to think of another S"
00:45:56,00:45:57,that was in the North.
00:45:57,00:45:58,I got it wrong.
00:45:58,00:46:01,"- Sounds like a really great quiz, Dan."
00:46:01,00:46:03,And really relevant as well.
00:46:03,00:46:04,- That was great.
00:46:04,00:46:05,- I'm stuck 'cause I'm sarcastic.
00:46:05,00:46:07,"- Oh, yeah."
00:46:07,00:46:08,- I'm such an idiot.
00:46:08,00:46:10,I had no idea that you were.
00:46:10,00:46:14,"- Hey, hop, hey, hop, let's get on with it."
00:46:14,00:46:16,- I can't think of anything interesting to add.
00:46:16,00:46:19,(audience laughing)
00:46:19,00:46:23,- Let's talk about Eminence a bit more.
00:46:23,00:46:25,- Can we talk about Van Halen?
00:46:25,00:46:25,The thing.
00:46:25,00:46:26,- Oh.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"- Oh, of course, yeah."
00:46:27,00:46:29,"- 'Cause we're on tour, and they toured,"
00:46:29,00:46:30,and so basically we were rock band.
00:46:30,00:46:33,"This is a really interesting thing about, you know,"
00:46:33,00:46:36,"supposedly Van Halen, when the rock big rock band"
00:46:36,00:46:39,"in the '70s, '80s, they had a line in the rider"
00:46:39,00:46:41,"which said, we want a bowl of Eminence"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"with all the brown Eminence removed, right?"
00:46:43,00:46:45,That is a story that has done the rounds
00:46:45,00:46:46,for such a long time.
00:46:46,00:46:49,"And the story was, it was so they were checking"
00:46:49,00:46:52,that the venue was reading the rider in full
00:46:52,00:46:53,"and doing everything right,"
00:46:53,00:46:55,so that all the amps were in the right place
00:46:55,00:46:57,"and the lights, it was actually a way of testing"
00:46:57,00:46:59,to make sure the venue were reading and paying attention.
00:46:59,00:47:01,That has been turned on its head.
00:47:01,00:47:04,"This is the exciting thing, double debunk."
00:47:04,00:47:06,"I was reading Doug Max Snack Stack,"
00:47:06,00:47:09,which is a food and snack-based blog
00:47:09,00:47:11,and is terrific.
00:47:11,00:47:13,It's so good.
00:47:13,00:47:14,"- All right, barring spice."
00:47:14,00:47:17,(audience laughing)
00:47:17,00:47:22,"- So the story A is just, they've got a big ego."
00:47:22,00:47:24,"Story B is that it's actually more complicated,"
00:47:24,00:47:25,"but story C, think about it."
00:47:25,00:47:28,"The person whose job is to remove all the brown Eminence,"
00:47:28,00:47:29,it's not the same as the person whose job is to check
00:47:29,00:47:31,the amps or the safety of the overall gig.
00:47:31,00:47:34,That's an insane way of trying to ensure
00:47:34,00:47:36,the safety and actually they caused huge amounts
00:47:36,00:47:38,of damage to dressing rooms.
00:47:38,00:47:40,"Like when they found some brown Eminence at a gig once,"
00:47:40,00:47:42,they caused 100 grand of damage to a dining room.
00:47:42,00:47:46,"It now seems that they were just being wankers, so."
00:47:46,00:47:47,- Right.
00:47:47,00:47:49,- So why are we assuming that?
00:47:49,00:47:50,Just 'cause they trashed the place.
00:47:50,00:47:51,"They could have been trashing it because they were pissed off,"
00:47:51,00:47:52,they hadn't read the rider.
00:47:52,00:47:54,"- They trashed the place, but also based on their quotes,"
00:47:54,00:47:56,it sounds like they genuinely did want it.
00:47:56,00:47:57,It was kind of a way of throwing it around.
00:47:57,00:47:59,"'Cause also by the time anyone knows about it,"
00:47:59,00:48:00,it's no longer an effective test
00:48:00,00:48:02,of whether a venue has read the rider.
00:48:02,00:48:05,"- So it seems like it has been double debunked, yeah."
00:48:05,00:48:07,"- Double debunked, you heard it here first."
00:48:07,00:48:09,Do you want to know something about blue Eminence?
00:48:09,00:48:11,No one got much of a look in.
00:48:11,00:48:14,The dye in blue Eminence could repair your spine
00:48:14,00:48:18,"if your spine is damaged, but it might turn you blue."
00:48:18,00:48:21,"And this is a really, the dye is called Brilliant Blue G."
00:48:21,00:48:24,"And like scientists were just testing,"
00:48:24,00:48:26,"studying it a few years ago, and they realized"
00:48:26,00:48:29,it blocks a chemical that makes your injuries worse
00:48:29,00:48:30,if you've got a spinal injury.
00:48:30,00:48:32,So it blocks a chemical that causes inflammation.
00:48:32,00:48:34,So it basically means that you don't get
00:48:34,00:48:36,the horrible repercussions of a spinal injury
00:48:36,00:48:38,that you otherwise would.
00:48:38,00:48:40,"And they're looking into it, but the only thing is"
00:48:40,00:48:42,that it does turn you a bit blue.
00:48:42,00:48:46,"At the moment, if you're a rat, but we do know"
00:48:46,00:48:47,that that could be the case.
00:48:47,00:48:51,And it just reminded me of another dye sweet base story
00:48:51,00:48:53,"that I loved that came out recently,"
00:48:53,00:48:55,which is that the food dye in Doritos
00:48:55,00:48:57,"and pretty much any other yellow thing,"
00:48:57,00:49:00,"like macaroni and cheese, any yellow gummies,"
00:49:00,00:49:02,"Cheetos, cereals."
00:49:02,00:49:03,- Twisties.
00:49:03,00:49:05,"- Twisties, sure."
00:49:05,00:49:06,Are they yellow?
00:49:06,00:49:08,(audience cheers)
00:49:08,00:49:09,"- Orangey, yeah."
00:49:09,00:49:12,"- Twisties, Orangeyna, it makes mice transparent,"
00:49:12,00:49:13,the dye in that.
00:49:13,00:49:16,And they think there's no reason why it wouldn't also
00:49:16,00:49:18,make humans transparent.
00:49:18,00:49:19,"- Not if they eat it, right?"
00:49:19,00:49:21,"- No, if you rub it on their skin, sorry."
00:49:21,00:49:22,- No way.
00:49:22,00:49:23,- Yes?
00:49:23,00:49:25,- Are we surrounded by invisible mice now?
00:49:25,00:49:27,(audience laughs)
00:49:27,00:49:28,- They've been rubbed with Cheeto dust.
00:49:28,00:49:29,"- We don't, you know."
00:49:29,00:49:31,"- They're not empty on the inside, Andy."
00:49:31,00:49:36,"You would see, okay, you would see a big bag of mouse."
00:49:36,00:49:39,"- It's Hellraiser for mice, yeah."
00:49:39,00:49:42,- So how many Doritos do I have to rub on myself tonight?
00:49:42,00:49:45,"- Well, just keep trying, James,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,and eventually you will go transparent.
00:49:47,00:49:50,- There are two brands of chocolate milk in Australia
00:49:50,00:49:53,that are made from cows that eat chocolate.
00:49:53,00:49:54,- What?
00:49:54,00:49:57,It doesn't come out when you milk them as chocolate milk.
00:49:57,00:49:57,- Does it?
00:49:57,00:50:00,Is that what we're saying?
00:50:00,00:50:03,"- No, that is definitely not what I said."
00:50:03,00:50:04,- Okay.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"- It was confusing, is chocolate made from the cows?"
00:50:06,00:50:08,- Chocolate milk is made from the milk
00:50:08,00:50:10,from cows that eat chocolate.
00:50:10,00:50:14,"- But you have led Dan up the garden path, haven't you?"
00:50:14,00:50:17,- Is the milk any different to standard milk?
00:50:17,00:50:18,"- No, no."
00:50:18,00:50:19,It's just milk.
00:50:19,00:50:20,"It's just a coincidence, really."
00:50:20,00:50:23,But you get these brands of chocolate milk.
00:50:23,00:50:27,It's cartons of farmers union and purer flavored milks.
00:50:27,00:50:30,And the cows that they take the milk from
00:50:30,00:50:33,are fed with stuff from the nearby Cadbury factory
00:50:33,00:50:36,that's just like offshoots that they don't need anymore
00:50:36,00:50:40,because it's a really easy way of giving cows energy.
00:50:40,00:50:43,- So it's kind of the circular economy.
00:50:43,00:50:45,"'Cause some of that milk will have been in,"
00:50:45,00:50:47,some of the milk in the chocolate will have been in a cow.
00:50:47,00:50:48,- That's true.
00:50:48,00:50:50,- It's a closed system.
00:50:51,00:50:53,- We've solved sustainability.
00:50:53,00:50:55,(audience laughing)
00:50:55,00:50:57,Just feed the cows some chocolate.
00:50:57,00:51:02,(upbeat music)
00:51:02,00:51:06,"- Okay, everyone, that is it."
00:51:06,00:51:08,That is all of our facts.
00:51:08,00:51:09,Thank you so much for listening.
00:51:09,00:51:11,"Sydney, you've been awesome."
00:51:11,00:51:13,Thank you so much for having us.
00:51:13,00:51:14,We will be back again.
00:51:14,00:51:15,(audience cheering)
00:51:15,00:51:17,"And until then, we will see you."
00:51:17,00:51:18,Goodbye!
00:51:18,00:51:21,(audience cheering)
00:51:21,00:51:24,(upbeat music)
00:51:25,00:51:27,(upbeat music)
00:51:27,00:51:30,(upbeat music)
