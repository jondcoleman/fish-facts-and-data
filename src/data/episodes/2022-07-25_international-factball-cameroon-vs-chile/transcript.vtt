00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Presents, the World Cup of Facts brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.760
 This is a football podcast in which we make absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.840
 We are the QILBs, my name is Dan, I'm sitting here with Jack, Anna, and James.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.480
 And once again, we're pitting two countries against each other to find out who the most quite interesting is.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 And today, those countries are Cameroon versus Chili.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 We're going to start with Cameroon, so let's go. We've got some confirmed Cameroon.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240
 Yeah, I read something really interesting.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.440
 During the Great Depression, in 1931, the people of Cameroon clubbed together to collect money to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.040
 send to the starving Americans, and they managed to send over a total of $3.77.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.920
 A lot of fact, that's amazing. You could buy a bagel for that.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.520
 It would have been worth more though, wouldn't it?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.200
 $3. Yeah, probably two bagels.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.120
 Two bagels. Yeah, I'm also sort of brought them out of extreme depression,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.080
 but yeah, probably would have made them more depressed, the idea that Cameroon was sending them,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.720
 but yeah, like, wow, that's how bad it's got.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.080
 Yeah, how times have changed?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.520
 Because, so I'm kind of interested by the president of Cameroon, Paul Beer,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.600
 who's been president in 1982.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.920
 Paul Beer. Paul Beer. Oh, yeah.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.200
 Sounds like Paul Beer. It's not spelled like that.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.000
 It's B-I-Y-A, but he leads an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle, him and his wife,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.520
 in 2009, he took a holiday in France, and he spent £25,000 a day on hotels.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.920
 And that's coming from a country where the average annual income is about £600 a year.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 He's an interesting guy. In 2004, he got so annoyed by the criticisms of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.160
 the international vote monitoring groups.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.880
 They were constantly saying that he just makes these elections up.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.520
 He just doesn't for show to prove that he's a legitimate president,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.360
 that he set up his own committee with six ex-US congressmen, paid them all,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.480
 who certified his election as free and fair.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.360
 You have to, if you hear the national anthem in Cameroon, you have to stand still.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.160
 Wherever you are, if anyone's ever there, you can be put in prison for not doing it.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.720
 It's like a nationwide game of musical statues.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.320
 Wow. It's exactly like that. That's great.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.600
 But if you have to stand still and you don't, presumably you've got enough of a getaway time

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.040
 from the police who do have to stand still.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.080
 Or it could be the last person to stand still gets kicked out of the country.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 Oh my god, yeah.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440
 It's a new UKIP policy, isn't it?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.360
 We're going to play the national anthem.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 And the last Romanian to stand still gets kicked out.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.920
 In Cameroon, you can pay for taxi rides with beer bottle caps.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 What?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.280
 There's a competition in the country with the beer companies.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 And if you get the caps with a certain symbol on, then you get a free beer.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.600
 And everyone knows how much beer is worth.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.840
 So people are using these caps as payments.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.600
 So would then, if you were paying a cap driver in it,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.960
 would the cab driver go off and get a beer or would then he use it as money?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.200
 Yes, he could do or he could get himself a beer.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.400
 So it's a whole new currency.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360
 It's a whole new currency.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.600
 Even bribes have been paid in this beer bottle cap currency.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.080
 Wow.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080
 Can you forge a beer bottle cap?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.120
 I shouldn't think so.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.200
 Otherwise, the competition would be a bit pointless.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.680
 Yeah.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.000
 Well, just speaking of beers, the bars in Cameroon,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 where you would buy such beers, they've got fantastic names.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.240
 There's one called Begon Gloom, another called polygamy,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.760
 and one called Word of God.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.160
 I'm suspicious about the purpose of the polygamy bar.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.000
 I feel like it's got it behind the scenes.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.440
 Other means of getting money.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.360
 Yeah, they do have some good names.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.640
 There are 21,400 people in Cameroon who speak a language called BUM.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.960
 There are 3,000 Cameroonians

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.480
 because of the language "gimme".

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.160
 But it's an extraordinarily diverse place.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.760
 Anyway, isn't it? There are 275 ethno-linguistic groups.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.840
 So it's incredibly varied.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 They're biggest mountain or not.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.680
 They're biggest mountain, but just a really nice named mountain.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 If we're going on names, Mount Facker.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.840
 How are we spelling that?

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.600
 Mount F-A-K-A.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.280
 Yeah, Mount Cameroon must be the highest mountain issue.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240
 Yeah, it's known by locals as a mountain of greatness.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.640
 I guess as we're on geographical features,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.960
 it's got the most dangerous lake in the world, hasn't it?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.600
 Lake Nios, which in 1986 killed 1700 people

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 and 3,500 livestock.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.200
 It's one of only three lakes in the world

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.880
 that's saturated with carbon dioxide and there's volcanic activity

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.440
 and earthquakes around it, and they're not entirely sure what happened.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.840
 But the whole lake exploded with carbon dioxide suddenly.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 It got super saturated, and it spilled carbon dioxide

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.520
 all over the surrounding village.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.200
 It's completely wiped out the population of one village.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.400
 Oh my god, that's terrible.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.160
 Asphyxiated, scary stuff.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.640
 Yeah.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.920
 It's rude in Cameroon to beckon with your palm turned upwards apparently.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 So you know how we, if we tell someone to come,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.680
 come hither to say I'm going to you right now, Dan.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.600
 You have to turn your palm downwards.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.440
 It's a scene to have your hand turned upwards.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.640
 I don't know anyone who does the upward.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.640
 Who summons people without saying, hey, can you just come here?

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.560
 Stephen Fry is the kind of person who would do that.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.320
 Doesn't the rock do it in light?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.880
 He does. The rock is a wrestler from the WWF,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.640
 and he wants to do that, Dwayne Johnson,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.480
 but he does that when he wants to kick your ass.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.640
 Yeah, you're right. The rock doesn't go, come hither.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.640
 One thing that Cameroon, this is very exciting, I think,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.160
 the first ever disco record was released by a Cameroon-born sax player.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.880
 Wow, really?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880
 Mano de Banjo.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.320
 And doesn't play the Banjo.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.760
 Does not play the Banjo, but because that's not a featured disco musical instrument,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.120
 certainly not as far as I know, but so they're a kind of responsible for disco.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.920
 Cameroon.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.880
 Well, there's always B-A-N-J-O.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.800
 Do you know what they gave the Pope as a gift when he visited them in 2009?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.520
 No, what?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.160
 A turtle.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.920
 No, really, it was nice.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.560
 Yeah, because it's the symbol of wisdom amongst the back of pigmies of Cameroon.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.960
 I do find the pygmy tribes fascinating in Cameroon.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.400
 And so I think there's some objections to the term pygmy, because that actually

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 encompasses a lot of tribes, but let's say the back of tribes which do inhabit the forest of Cameroon,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.160
 because they, the legends of the back of tribes people,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.840
 completely mirror Christian, ancient Egyptian, Jewish legends,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.920
 but without them having had any contact so far as we know in the last 4,000 years,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.520
 with any of those major religions.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.320
 So for instance, they've got a story where God made man.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.080
 So in back of legend and God made man.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.560
 And he said that they'd have eternal life and live in this blissful haven on earth.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.280
 The tarhu tree, he said, is absolutely forbidden to man.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.640
 You must never for any reason violate this law and eat the fruit of the tarhu tree.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.160
 And then the woman violates this law, convinces her husband to eat it.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.840
 She eats it, and God says, I'll punish you by making you come to grips with mortality

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840
 and living on earth and suffering and working.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.680
 Which is, that sounds very familiar.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.120
 So it's not a coincidence.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.080
 They came into contact with ancient Egyptians, thousands and thousands of years ago,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.720
 and these legends would pass up and then put wisdom to Christianity.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.600
 That's amazing.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.240
 Yeah.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.520
 That's my favorite fact.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.080
 Okay, let's call half time on that.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.600
 That was a fantastic half.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.240
 Okay, it's time for our visitingland.com half time quiz.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.680
 The QILs have put together three great facts about England,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.480
 and we're going to reveal the answer at the end of the match.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.840
 And the three questions this match are, Jack.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.560
 In which town did the Battle of Hastings take place?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.200
 Anna?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.840
 What animal-related museum can you find in the grounds of Leeds Castle?

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680
 And question number three, James.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.720
 Which town has passed between England and Scotland 13 times?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.000
 Find out the answers to all of these at the end of the match.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.920
 And now it's back to the game.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.200
 Chile, let's do it.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.880
 Anyone got a chili foot?

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.720
 Yeah, I like that they have an extremely large telescope in Chile,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.920
 and that it is built, it's is 2,600 meters up in the Andes.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.720
 It's not finished yet.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.280
 It's going to be finished in 2021.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.240
 And it's going to be the most powerful optical instrument in the world.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.120
 But my favorite thing is its name, which is the ELT.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.360
 Does anyone know what the ELT stands for?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.480
 Egglet is tomato.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.960
 I don't know.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.400
 Maybe named after a local Chilean astronomer?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.120
 You would think.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.560
 Yeah, no, no, it's not.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.360
 The ELT stands for extremely large telescope.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.080
 It's what it is.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.280
 That's what it says on the tin.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.560
 Wow, they have the largest swimming pool in the world in Chile.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.600
 Have you seen that?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.640
 I've seen a picture of it.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.920
 Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.600
 It's over a kilometer in length.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.800
 It's right next to the sea and they bring in the water from the sea.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.400
 And you can navigate it by boat.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.040
 Yeah, like it's big enough that you can actually put a boat in it

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.840
 and actually take it round the pool.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.440
 Why you do that?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.320
 I don't know.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.000
 I mean, I put boats and pools.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.880
 What are you talking about?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.600
 Public pool?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.400
 Dig cop pool?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.920
 He's put a little rubber dingy in there.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.480
 Yeah, dingy.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.440
 Not impressive.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.480
 Not a yacht.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.000
 We're not talking Titanic.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.440
 We're not talking Titanic, but we're talking a big ship.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.720
 A giant ship.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.160
 An extremely large ship.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.680
 An E L S.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.120
 So I reckon they've used up all their imagination on their slang.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.720
 Because Chileans have really good slang

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.280
 and it's all like very metaphorical and it's full of imagery.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.480
 So things like they call popcorn cabridas,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.360
 which means goats.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.960
 Because of the way it jumps around like goats.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.320
 They have a saying, tirad on chancho,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.160
 which literally means to throw a pig

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.600
 that it actually means to burp.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.200
 And they have another saying,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.360
 araglass los bigotas,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.920
 which means arranging their moustaches.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.960
 And that actually means making a secret deal

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.240
 or lining their pockets.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.360
 Ah, like a villain sort of twirling his moustache.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.320
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.120
 There is a bird that's only found in Chile

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.280
 called the moustache-yod turca.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.000
 Is there?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.200
 Yep, couple more seaside sink low days.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.520
 And the one Fernandez tits tyrant.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.040
 Wow.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.320
 As seen on QI, I think.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.840
 In 2010, the general manager of the Royal Mint

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.880
 was fired after misspelling Chile on over a thousand coins.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.840
 The 50-page Swiss coin had Chile's belt

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.200
 with a double eye instead of a IL.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.360
 They were printed in 2008,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.280
 but no one noticed until 2009.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.240
 Wow.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.480
 And then they're quite valuable now these coins.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.560
 In 2007, 6,000 Chileans were duped by Madame Gilbert Van Erp's

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.000
 Magic Cheese Kits.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.360
 Let's just end on that, no explanation.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.560
 No explanation.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.080
 If you'd like any explanation to that,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.080
 send me a macek for 20 pounds.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.040
 Go on, tell us about that.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell us about it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:28.320
 Cheese Kits, please.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.160
 There's one guy that spent a million pesos.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.840
 He's a Chilean newspaper vendor.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.720
 And he's spent it on having 82 Julia Roberts tattoos

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.680
 all over his body.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.320
 Each one is from a different scene of the movie.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.680
 If you have on Google now,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.880
 and listen to the podcast.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.560
 One movie or all of the movies?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.360
 Various movies.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.560
 Various scenes from our films.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.880
 If you look him up, his name is Miljenko Bukovic

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.520
 and they're all over his torso and arm and legs

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.360
 and his dream is one day to meet her.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.160
 Yeah, I'm sure she's excited about that as well.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.760
 I'm sure when they say we've got a fan outside,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.760
 he has 80-something tattoos of you.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.120
 She's going to go bring him in.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.720
 That's very exciting.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.920
 He's not going to stab me.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.520
 I've got a Chilean badass for you.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.960
 Oh, great.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.120
 Yeah, he was a native Chilean.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.480
 He fought the Spaniards.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.880
 His name was Galvarino and the Spanish caught him

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.080
 and cut off his hands.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.160
 But it didn't put him off.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.000
 He went back and attached swords to the stubs of his hands

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 and then went back and attacked the Spanish.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.760
 That's amazing.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.560
 That's amazing.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.440
 What was his name?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.320
 Galvarino.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.000
 Galvarino, so he had sword hands.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.600
 Yeah, like Edward's is a hands bit.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.320
 Yeah, but not.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.560
 Okay, we're going to have to wrap up.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.240
 Anyone got any last?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.640
 Yeah, I think it has the coolest plant in the world, Chile.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.400
 Which has only recently been discovered.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.600
 It's capacity to do this.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.080
 But it's a woody vine called the Boquia trifolialata.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.120
 And it's the only plant that's known to mimic the leaves

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.680
 of surrounding trees completely and everything

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.640
 in terms of size, shape, color, orientation.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.200
 It can even...

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.760
 So what it does is it seeks out trees around it

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.840
 and it climbs up them and it pretends to be them

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.440
 by looking exactly like them.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.120
 Otherwise, insects would eat it.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.800
 So it's like easy prey for insects.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.560
 Unless it pretends to be a tree that's not very edible,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.200
 which it does.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.000
 But one of these vines can mimic multiple trees at once.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.360
 To the extent that if there's a tree

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360
 that like grows little spines on its tips and stuff,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.600
 it will grow a spine on the tip of its leaf.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.640
 Oh my god.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.840
 It's like an octopus.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.040
 It's like an X-mom.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.320
 I haven't seen it, but probably...

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.360
 Okay, that's full time.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.240
 That's the end of the match.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.880
 Before we give the scores out,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.600
 I'm just going to give you the results of the quiz

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.960
 from the halftime shows sponsored by visit england.com.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.200
 And they are, if you give the question and the answer,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.160
 start with Jack.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.200
 So the question was, "In which town did the battle of Hastings take place?"

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.280
 And the answer is battle, not Hastings.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.560
 So really, it was the Hastings of Battle.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.840
 Anna, what was your question?

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.400
 My question was, "Which animal related museum would you find in the grounds of Leeds Castle?"

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.880
 And the answer is the dog collar museum.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.720
 Oh, that makes sense because you would attach a lead to a dog collar, right?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.960
 That's what I was just saying.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.280
 All right, James, what was yours?

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.920
 The town which has changed hands between England and Scotland

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.320
 13 times is Berwick Pond Tweed.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.640
 Okay, that's the answers to the quiz.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.480
 If you would like to win a prize, though,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.480
 you can actually head over to visit england.com

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.280
 where there's going to be all sorts of QI goodies waiting there.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.880
 But who won today's match?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.800
 Due to the fact that I just get to decide,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.760
 I am going to say it was Cameroon because I love that

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.200
 the original Genesis story of Adam and Eve

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.920
 is traced earliest back to Cameroon.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.880
 I think that's amazing.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.280
 So that's Cameroon moving forward to the next match.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.120
 And we are going to be back again tomorrow

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.360
 with another World Cup of Facts match.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.200
 And this time it's going to be James.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.680
 Columbia versus the Côte d'Ivoire.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.560
 Ooh, okay.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.360
 Exciting.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.320
 Exciting.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.040
 Okay, if you want to again contact with any of us about the facts

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.840
 that we've been saying today,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.800
 you want to find out any more.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.240
 We're all on Twitter.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.760
 I'm at @SriBlandJack.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.960
 @JackEsperk.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.640
 James @egshaped.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.160
 And Anna, you can get me on the Côte d'Ivoire

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.320
 which is @Quickipedia.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.000
 Anna still doesn't have a Twitter account.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.160
 We'll be back again tomorrow with that match.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.200
 And we'll see you then.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.400
 Goodbye.
