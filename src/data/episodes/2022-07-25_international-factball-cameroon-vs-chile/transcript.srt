00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Presents, the World Cup of Facts brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,760
 This is a football podcast in which we make absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,840
 We are the QILBs, my name is Dan, I'm sitting here with Jack, Anna, and James.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,480
 And once again, we're pitting two countries against each other to find out who the most quite interesting is.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,680
 And today, those countries are Cameroon versus Chili.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,480
 We're going to start with Cameroon, so let's go. We've got some confirmed Cameroon.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,240
 Yeah, I read something really interesting.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,440
 During the Great Depression, in 1931, the people of Cameroon clubbed together to collect money to

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,040
 send to the starving Americans, and they managed to send over a total of $3.77.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
 A lot of fact, that's amazing. You could buy a bagel for that.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
 It would have been worth more though, wouldn't it?

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
 $3. Yeah, probably two bagels.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
 Two bagels. Yeah, I'm also sort of brought them out of extreme depression,

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,080
 but yeah, probably would have made them more depressed, the idea that Cameroon was sending them,

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,720
 but yeah, like, wow, that's how bad it's got.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,080
 Yeah, how times have changed?

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,520
 Because, so I'm kind of interested by the president of Cameroon, Paul Beer,

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
 who's been president in 1982.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
 Paul Beer. Paul Beer. Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,200
 Sounds like Paul Beer. It's not spelled like that.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,000
 It's B-I-Y-A, but he leads an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle, him and his wife,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
 in 2009, he took a holiday in France, and he spent £25,000 a day on hotels.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,920
 And that's coming from a country where the average annual income is about £600 a year.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
 He's an interesting guy. In 2004, he got so annoyed by the criticisms of

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,160
 the international vote monitoring groups.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,880
 They were constantly saying that he just makes these elections up.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
 He just doesn't for show to prove that he's a legitimate president,

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,360
 that he set up his own committee with six ex-US congressmen, paid them all,

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,480
 who certified his election as free and fair.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,360
 You have to, if you hear the national anthem in Cameroon, you have to stand still.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,160
 Wherever you are, if anyone's ever there, you can be put in prison for not doing it.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,720
 It's like a nationwide game of musical statues.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
 Wow. It's exactly like that. That's great.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,600
 But if you have to stand still and you don't, presumably you've got enough of a getaway time

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
 from the police who do have to stand still.

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,080
 Or it could be the last person to stand still gets kicked out of the country.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
 Oh my god, yeah.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
 It's a new UKIP policy, isn't it?

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
 We're going to play the national anthem.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,160
 And the last Romanian to stand still gets kicked out.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,920
 In Cameroon, you can pay for taxi rides with beer bottle caps.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,880
 What?

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,280
 There's a competition in the country with the beer companies.

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,200
 And if you get the caps with a certain symbol on, then you get a free beer.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
 And everyone knows how much beer is worth.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,840
 So people are using these caps as payments.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,600
 So would then, if you were paying a cap driver in it,

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,960
 would the cab driver go off and get a beer or would then he use it as money?

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,200
 Yes, he could do or he could get himself a beer.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
 So it's a whole new currency.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
 It's a whole new currency.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,600
 Even bribes have been paid in this beer bottle cap currency.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,080
 Wow.

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 Can you forge a beer bottle cap?

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
 I shouldn't think so.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
 Otherwise, the competition would be a bit pointless.

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,680
 Yeah.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
 Well, just speaking of beers, the bars in Cameroon,

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
 where you would buy such beers, they've got fantastic names.

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,240
 There's one called Begon Gloom, another called polygamy,

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,760
 and one called Word of God.

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,160
 I'm suspicious about the purpose of the polygamy bar.

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,000
 I feel like it's got it behind the scenes.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
 Other means of getting money.

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
 Yeah, they do have some good names.

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
 There are 21,400 people in Cameroon who speak a language called BUM.

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,960
 There are 3,000 Cameroonians

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,480
 because of the language "gimme".

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,160
 But it's an extraordinarily diverse place.

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,760
 Anyway, isn't it? There are 275 ethno-linguistic groups.

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
 So it's incredibly varied.

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
 They're biggest mountain or not.

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,680
 They're biggest mountain, but just a really nice named mountain.

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 If we're going on names, Mount Facker.

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
 How are we spelling that?

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,600
 Mount F-A-K-A.

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,280
 Yeah, Mount Cameroon must be the highest mountain issue.

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,240
 Yeah, it's known by locals as a mountain of greatness.

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,640
 I guess as we're on geographical features,

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,960
 it's got the most dangerous lake in the world, hasn't it?

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,600
 Lake Nios, which in 1986 killed 1700 people

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 and 3,500 livestock.

83
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
 It's one of only three lakes in the world

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,880
 that's saturated with carbon dioxide and there's volcanic activity

85
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,440
 and earthquakes around it, and they're not entirely sure what happened.

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,840
 But the whole lake exploded with carbon dioxide suddenly.

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,560
 It got super saturated, and it spilled carbon dioxide

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,520
 all over the surrounding village.

89
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,200
 It's completely wiped out the population of one village.

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
 Oh my god, that's terrible.

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
 Asphyxiated, scary stuff.

92
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,640
 Yeah.

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,920
 It's rude in Cameroon to beckon with your palm turned upwards apparently.

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
 So you know how we, if we tell someone to come,

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,680
 come hither to say I'm going to you right now, Dan.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
 You have to turn your palm downwards.

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
 It's a scene to have your hand turned upwards.

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,640
 I don't know anyone who does the upward.

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,640
 Who summons people without saying, hey, can you just come here?

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,560
 Stephen Fry is the kind of person who would do that.

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
 Doesn't the rock do it in light?

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,880
 He does. The rock is a wrestler from the WWF,

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,640
 and he wants to do that, Dwayne Johnson,

104
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,480
 but he does that when he wants to kick your ass.

105
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,640
 Yeah, you're right. The rock doesn't go, come hither.

106
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,640
 One thing that Cameroon, this is very exciting, I think,

107
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,160
 the first ever disco record was released by a Cameroon-born sax player.

108
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,880
 Wow, really?

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
 Mano de Banjo.

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
 And doesn't play the Banjo.

111
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,760
 Does not play the Banjo, but because that's not a featured disco musical instrument,

112
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,120
 certainly not as far as I know, but so they're a kind of responsible for disco.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
 Cameroon.

114
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,880
 Well, there's always B-A-N-J-O.

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,800
 Do you know what they gave the Pope as a gift when he visited them in 2009?

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,520
 No, what?

117
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,160
 A turtle.

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,920
 No, really, it was nice.

119
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,560
 Yeah, because it's the symbol of wisdom amongst the back of pigmies of Cameroon.

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,960
 I do find the pygmy tribes fascinating in Cameroon.

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
 And so I think there's some objections to the term pygmy, because that actually

122
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,200
 encompasses a lot of tribes, but let's say the back of tribes which do inhabit the forest of Cameroon,

123
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,160
 because they, the legends of the back of tribes people,

124
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
 completely mirror Christian, ancient Egyptian, Jewish legends,

125
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,920
 but without them having had any contact so far as we know in the last 4,000 years,

126
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,520
 with any of those major religions.

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,320
 So for instance, they've got a story where God made man.

128
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,080
 So in back of legend and God made man.

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,560
 And he said that they'd have eternal life and live in this blissful haven on earth.

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,280
 The tarhu tree, he said, is absolutely forbidden to man.

131
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,640
 You must never for any reason violate this law and eat the fruit of the tarhu tree.

132
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,160
 And then the woman violates this law, convinces her husband to eat it.

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
 She eats it, and God says, I'll punish you by making you come to grips with mortality

134
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
 and living on earth and suffering and working.

135
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,680
 Which is, that sounds very familiar.

136
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
 So it's not a coincidence.

137
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,080
 They came into contact with ancient Egyptians, thousands and thousands of years ago,

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
 and these legends would pass up and then put wisdom to Christianity.

139
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
 That's amazing.

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,240
 Yeah.

141
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,520
 That's my favorite fact.

142
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
 Okay, let's call half time on that.

143
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
 That was a fantastic half.

144
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,240
 Okay, it's time for our visitingland.com half time quiz.

145
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,680
 The QILs have put together three great facts about England,

146
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,480
 and we're going to reveal the answer at the end of the match.

147
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,840
 And the three questions this match are, Jack.

148
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
 In which town did the Battle of Hastings take place?

149
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,200
 Anna?

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,840
 What animal-related museum can you find in the grounds of Leeds Castle?

151
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
 And question number three, James.

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
 Which town has passed between England and Scotland 13 times?

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,000
 Find out the answers to all of these at the end of the match.

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,920
 And now it's back to the game.

155
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
 Chile, let's do it.

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,880
 Anyone got a chili foot?

157
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,720
 Yeah, I like that they have an extremely large telescope in Chile,

158
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,920
 and that it is built, it's is 2,600 meters up in the Andes.

159
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
 It's not finished yet.

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
 It's going to be finished in 2021.

161
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
 And it's going to be the most powerful optical instrument in the world.

162
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
 But my favorite thing is its name, which is the ELT.

163
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
 Does anyone know what the ELT stands for?

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
 Egglet is tomato.

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,960
 I don't know.

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
 Maybe named after a local Chilean astronomer?

167
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
 You would think.

168
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
 Yeah, no, no, it's not.

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
 The ELT stands for extremely large telescope.

170
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
 It's what it is.

171
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
 That's what it says on the tin.

172
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
 Wow, they have the largest swimming pool in the world in Chile.

173
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
 Have you seen that?

174
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,640
 I've seen a picture of it.

175
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
 Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

176
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
 It's over a kilometer in length.

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,800
 It's right next to the sea and they bring in the water from the sea.

178
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
 And you can navigate it by boat.

179
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,040
 Yeah, like it's big enough that you can actually put a boat in it

180
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,840
 and actually take it round the pool.

181
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
 Why you do that?

182
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
 I don't know.

183
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,000
 I mean, I put boats and pools.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,880
 What are you talking about?

185
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,600
 Public pool?

186
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
 Dig cop pool?

187
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,920
 He's put a little rubber dingy in there.

188
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,480
 Yeah, dingy.

189
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
 Not impressive.

190
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,480
 Not a yacht.

191
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,000
 We're not talking Titanic.

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
 We're not talking Titanic, but we're talking a big ship.

193
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
 A giant ship.

194
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,160
 An extremely large ship.

195
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,680
 An E L S.

196
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,120
 So I reckon they've used up all their imagination on their slang.

197
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
 Because Chileans have really good slang

198
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,280
 and it's all like very metaphorical and it's full of imagery.

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,480
 So things like they call popcorn cabridas,

200
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
 which means goats.

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
 Because of the way it jumps around like goats.

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,320
 They have a saying, tirad on chancho,

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
 which literally means to throw a pig

204
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
 that it actually means to burp.

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
 And they have another saying,

206
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
 araglass los bigotas,

207
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
 which means arranging their moustaches.

208
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,960
 And that actually means making a secret deal

209
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
 or lining their pockets.

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
 Ah, like a villain sort of twirling his moustache.

211
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,320
 Yeah, exactly.

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,120
 There is a bird that's only found in Chile

213
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,280
 called the moustache-yod turca.

214
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,000
 Is there?

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
 Yep, couple more seaside sink low days.

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,520
 And the one Fernandez tits tyrant.

217
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,040
 Wow.

218
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
 As seen on QI, I think.

219
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,840
 In 2010, the general manager of the Royal Mint

220
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,880
 was fired after misspelling Chile on over a thousand coins.

221
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,840
 The 50-page Swiss coin had Chile's belt

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,200
 with a double eye instead of a IL.

223
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
 They were printed in 2008,

224
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,280
 but no one noticed until 2009.

225
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
 Wow.

226
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
 And then they're quite valuable now these coins.

227
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,560
 In 2007, 6,000 Chileans were duped by Madame Gilbert Van Erp's

228
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
 Magic Cheese Kits.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
 Let's just end on that, no explanation.

230
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
 No explanation.

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,080
 If you'd like any explanation to that,

232
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
 send me a macek for 20 pounds.

233
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,040
 Go on, tell us about that.

234
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell us about it.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:28,320
 Cheese Kits, please.

236
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
 There's one guy that spent a million pesos.

237
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,840
 He's a Chilean newspaper vendor.

238
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,720
 And he's spent it on having 82 Julia Roberts tattoos

239
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
 all over his body.

240
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
 Each one is from a different scene of the movie.

241
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,680
 If you have on Google now,

242
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
 and listen to the podcast.

243
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
 One movie or all of the movies?

244
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,360
 Various movies.

245
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,560
 Various scenes from our films.

246
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
 If you look him up, his name is Miljenko Bukovic

247
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,520
 and they're all over his torso and arm and legs

248
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,360
 and his dream is one day to meet her.

249
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
 Yeah, I'm sure she's excited about that as well.

250
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,760
 I'm sure when they say we've got a fan outside,

251
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 he has 80-something tattoos of you.

252
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,120
 She's going to go bring him in.

253
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
 That's very exciting.

254
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
 He's not going to stab me.

255
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,520
 I've got a Chilean badass for you.

256
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,960
 Oh, great.

257
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,120
 Yeah, he was a native Chilean.

258
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
 He fought the Spaniards.

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,880
 His name was Galvarino and the Spanish caught him

260
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
 and cut off his hands.

261
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,160
 But it didn't put him off.

262
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
 He went back and attached swords to the stubs of his hands

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 and then went back and attacked the Spanish.

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
 That's amazing.

265
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
 That's amazing.

266
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,440
 What was his name?

267
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
 Galvarino.

268
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
 Galvarino, so he had sword hands.

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
 Yeah, like Edward's is a hands bit.

270
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,320
 Yeah, but not.

271
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,560
 Okay, we're going to have to wrap up.

272
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
 Anyone got any last?

273
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
 Yeah, I think it has the coolest plant in the world, Chile.

274
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,400
 Which has only recently been discovered.

275
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
 It's capacity to do this.

276
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,080
 But it's a woody vine called the Boquia trifolialata.

277
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,120
 And it's the only plant that's known to mimic the leaves

278
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,680
 of surrounding trees completely and everything

279
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,640
 in terms of size, shape, color, orientation.

280
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,200
 It can even...

281
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,760
 So what it does is it seeks out trees around it

282
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,840
 and it climbs up them and it pretends to be them

283
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
 by looking exactly like them.

284
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
 Otherwise, insects would eat it.

285
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
 So it's like easy prey for insects.

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,560
 Unless it pretends to be a tree that's not very edible,

287
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,200
 which it does.

288
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
 But one of these vines can mimic multiple trees at once.

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
 To the extent that if there's a tree

290
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
 that like grows little spines on its tips and stuff,

291
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,600
 it will grow a spine on the tip of its leaf.

292
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,640
 Oh my god.

293
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
 It's like an octopus.

294
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,040
 It's like an X-mom.

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
 I haven't seen it, but probably...

296
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
 Okay, that's full time.

297
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,240
 That's the end of the match.

298
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
 Before we give the scores out,

299
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,600
 I'm just going to give you the results of the quiz

300
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,960
 from the halftime shows sponsored by visit england.com.

301
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,200
 And they are, if you give the question and the answer,

302
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
 start with Jack.

303
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,200
 So the question was, "In which town did the battle of Hastings take place?"

304
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,280
 And the answer is battle, not Hastings.

305
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,560
 So really, it was the Hastings of Battle.

306
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,840
 Anna, what was your question?

307
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,400
 My question was, "Which animal related museum would you find in the grounds of Leeds Castle?"

308
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,880
 And the answer is the dog collar museum.

309
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
 Oh, that makes sense because you would attach a lead to a dog collar, right?

310
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,960
 That's what I was just saying.

311
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,280
 All right, James, what was yours?

312
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,920
 The town which has changed hands between England and Scotland

313
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
 13 times is Berwick Pond Tweed.

314
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,640
 Okay, that's the answers to the quiz.

315
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
 If you would like to win a prize, though,

316
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
 you can actually head over to visit england.com

317
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,280
 where there's going to be all sorts of QI goodies waiting there.

318
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,880
 But who won today's match?

319
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
 Due to the fact that I just get to decide,

320
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
 I am going to say it was Cameroon because I love that

321
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
 the original Genesis story of Adam and Eve

322
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
 is traced earliest back to Cameroon.

323
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,880
 I think that's amazing.

324
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,280
 So that's Cameroon moving forward to the next match.

325
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,120
 And we are going to be back again tomorrow

326
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
 with another World Cup of Facts match.

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,200
 And this time it's going to be James.

328
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,680
 Columbia versus the Côte d'Ivoire.

329
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
 Ooh, okay.

330
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,360
 Exciting.

331
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
 Exciting.

332
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,040
 Okay, if you want to again contact with any of us about the facts

333
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
 that we've been saying today,

334
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
 you want to find out any more.

335
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,240
 We're all on Twitter.

336
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
 I'm at @SriBlandJack.

337
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
 @JackEsperk.

338
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,640
 James @egshaped.

339
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,160
 And Anna, you can get me on the Côte d'Ivoire

340
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
 which is @Quickipedia.

341
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
 Anna still doesn't have a Twitter account.

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
 We'll be back again tomorrow with that match.

343
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,200
 And we'll see you then.

344
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
 Goodbye.
