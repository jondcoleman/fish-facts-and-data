00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 This week coming to you right from up the creek in Greenwich London.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 My name is Dan Shriver and I am sitting here with Anish Zensky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And once again we have gathered around the table with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in an particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Starting with my facts.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 My fact this week is that scientists can now predict when someone is going to fall over.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Three weeks before it happens.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 [Laughter]

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 These are scientists who have been studying Miranda.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 This is shockingly true.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 So what they do is they notice obviously it's a problem that a lot of elderly people fall over and that leads to a lot of problems.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So they've been studying it and what they've realized is that you can actually spot the moment when a fall is going to happen due to the speed that someone travels at.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So what they've done is they put cameras into this into a house and they've monitored someone walking and they've noticed a speed change that happens.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And when the speed change happens it means because something is deteriorated inside the body so it means that they walk a lot slower.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Therefore they predict and they've shown from these studies that in the subsequent three weeks a fall is going to happen.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So robots are now monitoring old people to see if they're changing speed and they're like down by like 0.5 miles an hour,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 set the text and you can stop them from falling over.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Well and then as the granddaughter or whatever you have to go to the house immediately and stand there in front of them with your arms out at all times.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It does sound like the old people are falling over in slow motion.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I've watched you been framed and that's kind of what happened.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 If you're stride length so the other thing it can measure actually I'm not sure how they do this with the sensors that they install.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 But if you're stride length changes by just about seven centimetres that can be detected and that also is a strong indicator that you're going to have a fall within the coming few weeks.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And to illustrate how effective it is because it is unbelievable if you're walking speed decreases by 5.1 centimetres a second.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 You have an eight as a pensioner, you have an 86% chance of falling over within three weeks compared to a 20% chance if your speed hasn't decreased that much.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Which is an unbelievable difference. Is this just huge change that suddenly happens?

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And I think the idea is that you get these robots in people's houses and it means that they can kind of hang out a lot more without people looking after them.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 They're not actual robots, are they?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I mean what is a robot? Like hello, how are you?

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 That's an android. And that android is human shaped whereas a robot is just anything that's robotic.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 If I bought my best friend is a robot and he arrived and it was like a camera.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Do you know what robots they use for older people actually?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 No. One robot they use is Paro who is a seal and so Paro was built in Japan and it's a little seal which is robotic and it responds to like being hugged and being spoken to.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And the creator of this little robot seal is called Takanori Shibata and he chose it because he said people are unlikely to have unhelpful memories of real seals.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So it's not going to freak anyone out because very few people have been assaulted by a seal.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Just one person who's lost a hand to a seal.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So there is a bastard to sue a creature that doesn't have a recent development on mine.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 The British researchers are currently teaming up with Japanese, or written Japanese robots, the teaming up with Japanese researchers to use monitoring robots and they're trying to install cultural differences.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And one of the reasons that they don't get in the UK is you have a lot of people from a lot of different cultures living here.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 One of the researchers said the following. I think she was Greek herself.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 She said a robot might be taught not to try and cheer up a Greek woman whose husband died months ago because Greek widows are expected to be sad for at least a year.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Wow. So it's kind of installing the cultural sensitivity.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 That's very good to know.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Where does I suppose in other cultures the robot will just say, "Come on, Geron!"

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 (Laughter)

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 But it instructs them to stay depressed if they're Greek.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 (Laughter)

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Can't help but notice you smiled a second ago.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 You know, you've lost your husband.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 (Laughter)

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Yeah, you're appropriate.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Just on falling over, this is an experiment that you might not see.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 See, it's fantastic. It's an experiment on penguins, which put penguins on treadmills.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 (Laughter)

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And it's fantastic.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 So penguins have to, they have to strike a balance, right?

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Because they have to go a long time without food because they're feeding their young and they're foraging for their young.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And they have to, you know, so they lose a lot of weight during the period where they're hunting.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So they need to put on as much weight as possible.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 But if they put on too much weight, they become completely in agile and predators will catch and eat them.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And so that's no good for the young either, obviously.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So the scientists from the University of London wanted to test, you know, the sort of relationship between weight and walking speed.

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And this team just put them on treadmills and didn't feed them for hours and days, in fact.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 No, they used to it, that's fine.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 (Laughter)

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 They didn't feed them for two weeks and put them on a treadmill.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And some of the penguins started cheating, right? So there's a treadmill and then there's a little hood over the treadmill.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Okay, so that they're in the same place all the way along.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And some of the penguins just leaned against the back wall of this canopy and sort of water-skied along the treadmill.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 (Laughter)

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 No way, really.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 (Laughter)

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 That's the thing about penguins is, is it not, there's a, I think it's a myth, but in the Falcon Islands supposedly planes go over them, fly over them and they just look and look and look and look and look and they fall on them.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 No, they deep- they debunked it just very recently.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 They did a study where I think people went out to film them and they sent planes over and they looked up and they were like, "I was playing."

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And then they were, they were all good. Yeah, no, they don't actually fall over.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 No, the discovery the penguins can talk, really Trump. (Laughter)

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And there's a lot of quotes going, "Is that Emirates?"

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 (Laughter)

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So another thing that is done in old people's homes, another thing that's done in nursing homes is installing therapy animals sometimes.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So to make people feel better and there's one particular therapy cat called Oscar who's been adopted in a nursing home in Rhode Island.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And it's quite confusing the reasons why he was adopted because apparently he's generally unsociable.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But his one skill is bizarrely, he can tell when someone's about to die.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So the only time he goes near someone is when they are about to die.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He's the most terrifying cat. (Laughter)

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And if he's so, he'll just suddenly run to somebody's room and sit on their bed and then if he's removed, then he'll scratch on the door, scratch on the door until he's let back in again.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 (Laughter)

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Is he killed it? Is he killing the people? (Laughter)

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It's been all the mysterious cats. (Laughter)

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 They're always dead soon. (Laughter)

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 But he's detected over 50 deaths and it's within hours.

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So I mean it's very strong. This is a book written by a doctor who works at a nursing home.

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And they think maybe he's detecting ketones which are the chemicals that you release, chemicals that die in cells release.

97
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So there is a very subtle change in the chemicals you release. He is in an old people's home though, isn't he?

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Like a lot of these people are going to die at certain times. I like seeing putt in a football stadium. (Laughter)

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So what's happening to the cat? Is he still there?

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He's still there because he wanted to know. He's on your seat. (Laughter)

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But that can't be good for the morale. (Laughter)

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Phew. Wow. Where is the home? Sorry?

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's in Pittsburgh and you're scheduled to go next week.

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Do you know why we don't fall over in terms of our body and the balance?

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Do you know why we don't fall over?

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I don't know what you're going to get your feet given the way. So yes, it is our legs.

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But there's a thing and I've not actually read it earlier. I didn't write it down.

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 So I'm freestyling here. There's a thing in our ear which everyone thought was a balance-making thing.

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Otolith. Thank you.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 The otolith which meant to be a thing that just gave us balance.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I guess kind of like when you're measuring a door and you have that little thing in the mirror level.

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So you have a spirit level thing in your otolith and everyone thought that that's what was keeping you up.

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 But it turns out they didn't experiment and they worked out how to shut that off so that it wasn't in the humans that they were testing.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 That wasn't playing a factor into it. They managed to turn off the switch and just turn it off.

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And what I noticed was the calves of a human is what actually provides the balance.

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It's not the feet, it's not the between the foot and the calf.

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I really want to make this all right now.

118
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Okay, because you can't see this but Dan is saying calves but he's clutching his thigh.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Where the fuck's the calf?

120
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Oh, that's your calf.

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 We need to remember I'm sorry next time.

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Where did you think your thigh was?

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I posted it from there.

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Dan, unfortunately for you, I also read about this experience and I did write it down.

125
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Because we're doing a factual podcast.

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 At least write.

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 We need to move on to our next action.

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Can I tell you very quickly one more thing about walking around?

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 The elephants can't run.

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 They can run with their front half.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They run with their front legs but not with their back legs.

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 What happens when we run is our centre of gravity starts bumping up and down and that weighs energy.

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So what elephants do is they start trotting along with their front legs to speed up their movement

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 but they keep on walking with their back legs.

135
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I guess Linky.

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's true that the centre of gravity stays a constant height from the ground which most things doesn't.

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 So they only run with half of their bodies.

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 That's my fact and it's true as yours.

139
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Let's move on to our okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 My fact this week is that when he became president Lyndon B. Johnson installed a special shower in the White House

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 that fired a jet directly at his penis.

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I mean he became president after the assassination of Kennedy.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 He did.

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It depends how long after he became president I suppose.

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 If immediately after he was sworn in he said right let's sort out this shower.

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He wanted it as well to have the sort of the force of a firehose.

147
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 That's right.

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 He wanted a needle like intensity which was the equivalent of a fire hose.

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And he had lots of jets especially one up his bum and another one directly at his penis.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And the jets which went directly at his penis he nicknamed a jumbo which is weirdly exactly what he nicknamed his actual penis.

151
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And that's true he did he did.

152
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It's weird though I think in the UK it sounds more of a sort of audacious thing to name your penis because I have a lot of American friends.

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 They're just like they they have names they were like me jumbo like it's meat meat.

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 What do you say cans?

155
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You say that's normal for your American friends.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 This is also something that LBJ was kind of known for.

157
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 So there's a guy called Robert Carrot who was riding a five volume biography of him.

158
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He's 80 now he's done four volumes he's working on the fifth.

159
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Listen to this, this is about LBJ.

160
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He early became famous for a Ravalasian earthiness urinating in the parking lot of the house office building as the urge took him.

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 If a colleague came into a capital bathroom as he was finishing at the urinal though he would sometimes swing around still holding his member which he liked to call jumbo.

162
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Moving once have you ever seen anything as big as this and shaking it in a brandishing manner as he began disclosing about some pending legislation.

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 He genuinely I can't believe that we've only found this out like we've been looking at presidents for ages and suddenly it's like okay LBJ just took his penis out a lot and he would do it in public in front of any reporter that was chatting to him.

164
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 He's inauguration speech actually was asked.

165
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He's much better attended than Trump's.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Oh it's the biggest.

167
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I don't know Mr. President the photos don't seem to say it.

168
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It was called it was raining.

169
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So he would take it out while the journalists were sort of talking to him famously and this is a bit that obviously they just keep having to hide these moments because I we can't report on this.

170
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 They asked him about the Vietnam War and they were like why we why we fighting with Vietnam.

171
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 His response and I think it's because he was like I don't quite have an answer.

172
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 He unzipped his trousers he pulled out his penis and he held it at them.

173
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He went this is why.

174
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Isn't it amazing that presidential press conference has got no better since then.

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He did used to frequently ask aides to join him in the laboratory didn't he when he was so when he was giving them briefings or when he was just hanging out with them.

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 So I think one of his men and women as well one of his aides Doris Kerns goodwin said she often accompanied him into the bathroom because he needed to take a pee but he also wanted to continue talking.

177
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And she recalled that the security adviser when he joined he complied really reluctantly and he stood in the furthest corner away from Johnson while Johnson was urinating understandably with his back to him and the president said to him come closer come closer.

178
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I don't know if it was in that tone of voice but then funding complied and came closer and Johnson later remarked I thought he was going to sit on my lap.

179
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Hasn't that guy ever been in the army and I don't know what any of that really means.

180
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's so weird.

181
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So he had a lot of affairs lbj.

182
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Also all the people in his family had the initials lbj.

183
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 His wife was called Lady Bird Johnson.

184
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Her first name was Lady?

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 No her first name was Bird.

186
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Sorry Lady Bird was was her first name Lady Bird.

187
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 It kind of was in a way they like when she was a kid they called her cutes as a Lady Bird and they're not sure if they meant Lady Bird or whatever.

188
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And then she was known as Bird throughout her whole life and then when she became a first Lady she became first Lady Bird.

189
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Carry on.

190
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So he did have a lot of affairs. He used to be very boastful about it actually and I think he got quite annoyed that JFK had a bit of a reputation for being a womanizer in his time.

191
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And apparently whenever anyone mentioned Kennedy's multiple affairs Johnson would bang the table and declare that he had had more women by accident than Kennedy had had on purpose.

192
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I don't know what that means either.

193
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Jumbo has a mind of his own.

194
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 When he wanted to install the shower into the White House he was questioned about him they said you know why would we do this.

195
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And he said if I can move 10,000 troops on a day you can certainly fix the bathroom in any way I want.

196
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And then it was a complete waste because as soon as Nixon entered the White House after him he took one look at the elaborate setup and said get rid of this stuff.

197
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I like to think he took one shower, it blew his cock off many times.

198
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 The show I did get reviewed by people other than LBJ.

199
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I thought you were like on TripAdvisor.

200
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Blue my cock off one star.

201
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 LBJ by the way, he was in by all accounts of Dickhead.

202
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He would make people come in while he was having a poo to tell them what he wanted to do.

203
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 But he also did a lot of prints which were quite exciting.

204
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 We had mentioned this ages ago on the podcast but he had a car that was a amphibious car.

205
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So it's a car that can drive on the road and then go into a body of water and still work.

206
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It's a boat all of a sudden but it's still the car.

207
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So what he used to do at the White House is he used to drive people around in the car and he would be talking to them.

208
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And in the White House property there's a bit of a lake, it's a tiny bit of body water where you can go and just hang out.

209
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And he would drive the car down suddenly, down the hill and then he would pretend that the brakes had broken.

210
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And he would freak them out.

211
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And they'd hit the body of water and then just become a boat and then high fides all around.

212
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 That was the thing he did while he was a president.

213
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Do we have amphibious cars?

214
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I do not believe we have those that switch quickly enough for that practice work.

215
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Have you never been on a duck tour?

216
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I think he takes like 45 minutes for them to do the transport on the road to risk it.

217
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I don't know, I've never been on a duck tour.

218
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is Andy Murray.

219
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 My fact is that rejected names for British storms include Baldrick, Noddy, Megatron and Branch Warbler.

220
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Why? Some of my shouts.

221
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I was going to tell you all I love.

222
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So this is us that we've just had a big storm in the UK and this was a piece of wide about storm non-englature.

223
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 The Met Office started naming British storms in 2015 and the rationale was you sort of have a better handle.

224
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 It's a bit confusing when someone says that a large weather system or a storm is on the way, it's a bit vague.

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Whereas if you pin a name to a storm, it makes it a lot more concrete and the idea is easier to prepare for.

226
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So they've been doing this in America with tropical storms and harrowcates and things for decades.

227
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So we've got names for our storms and the Met Office in the wisdom asked the public to submit names.

228
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 So there were things, one of the rejected word names was Ena Teacup.

229
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 There were other rejected ones, Big Boss, Vader, Voldemort.

230
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 My favourite one was, and I think this was for a hurricane in the state.

231
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 This was from someone called @Yuldalthelcon and he wanted to call it Schmurakane.

232
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So you'd be, "Hurakane Schmurakane."

233
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Usually named after people aren't they, and it's usually names.

234
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 So what was the one, Doris?

235
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 So we did that Doris, yeah.

236
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I quite like the idea of gale.

237
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And is that one that's been accepted?

238
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 No, no, they didn't accept it.

239
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It's a good one, isn't it?

240
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 A few others, like what was the one you said branch wobble on?

241
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So some of the things like that, leaf shake and leaf stripper and root ripper.

242
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 No, it's good.

243
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And also I quite like someone said we should call a storm, King Henry V.

244
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Why?

245
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I told him I didn't storm through Northern France during the hundred years world.

246
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So do you know the first person who started to name weather events?

247
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 No, no.

248
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 This is a guy called Clementine.

249
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He was Welsh.

250
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Okay, okay.

251
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 What storm?

252
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Right.

253
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 The first person to name weather events was a guy called Clement-Linley-Rag.

254
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 This was a British guy in the 19th century who lived in Tasmania.

255
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 He was a meteorologist and he decided to name storms.

256
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They made them more memorable.

257
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 But he named them largely after politicians so that he was able to say the name of a politician he didn't like

258
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 and then followed that with things like causing great distress.

259
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So you know what you say?

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 David Cameron is causing great distress on the coast of Cornwall.

261
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And you know, George Ossblon is wandering aimlessly about the Pacific.

262
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Michael Gove is blowing people all over the place.

263
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 So they named storms only after women for a long time.

264
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Yeah.

265
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And that was thought to be very misogynistic because the idea was the people who did it was in the 19th century

266
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 and it was because women were similarly unpredictable to the weather.

267
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And then they changed it eventually thankfully.

268
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 There was a women's right activist called Roxie Bolton, which is where I spent a lot of my teenage years.

269
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 But she suggested replacing the word hurricane because it sounds a bit like hurt again to him again.

270
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So there is a theory that this is a 2014 study and it's a bit controversial.

271
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 It's a theory that hurricanes in America with women's names have higher death tolls than those with men's names

272
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 because people think it's only Cindy or whatever it might be.

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I don't need to worry about a hurricane.

274
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Is that actually what they think?

275
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Yeah, but it is controversial and it's a theory.

276
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And it does include all the data from I think before the 70s when hurricanes only had women's names.

277
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 It seems a bit dubious to me.

278
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 What Roxie Bolton said in her defence of hurricanes being gender equal,

279
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 she said women are not disasters destroying life and communities and leaving a lasting and devastating effect,

280
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 which I think would be so cool if we were.

281
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 But then she didn't mean to be a suggestion named after senators, that was her suggestion.

282
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 She had a nice to grind.

283
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 It's good that they brought in the names.

284
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 In the old days you would just call the names sometimes after a saint's day or some other things.

285
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 In Ireland they had one very big, it wasn't a hurricane, it was a storm,

286
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 but they called it the night of the big wind.

287
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 But it was such a severe storm.

288
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 People thought the end of the world was happening because it happened on the epiphany.

289
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And they thought that maybe this was judgment day or whatever.

290
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And it was so famous in the time, in 1908 they introduced pensions into Ireland.

291
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And a lot of people didn't have their birth records.

292
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And so the way they would tell how old you are was to ask you if you remembered the night of the big wind.

293
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 You know there's a theory, it's no longer believed but back in the day.

294
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 No thanks.

295
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Wind was created by time travellers.

296
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 All the wind and all the songs were created because of trees waving their branches.

297
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 So they were waving that and suddenly winds were created.

298
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 That makes completely sense.

299
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I think as a child, I think that's a natural thing to think, right?

300
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Because it's windy and there are trees moving.

301
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And you think maybe this comes from this? But then do you think like, oh this wind is caused by my hat falling off or something like that?

302
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I think it was James.

303
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 There is a possibility that that's not a theory and it's actually a poem by Ogden Nash.

304
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But it's also a line of the Terry Pratchett book you might be thinking of that.

305
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 So we should probably ignore the whole last minute.

306
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 What I find amazing is with weather. Obviously it's all this kind of butterfly effects and chaos theory and stuff like that.

307
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 The tiniest little thing can cause massive weather systems.

308
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And so that means that weather forecast is actually, they say that they cannot predict any weather at all for 14 days.

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Anything over 14 days is completely impossible.

310
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 But we can predict that all people are going to fall over for three weeks.

311
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 But they often fall over when it's windy, so I assume that all people are going to fall out of the wind.

312
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 We should move on to our final fact.

313
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I have a quick thing just about asking the public to name things.

314
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 So a couple of years ago, groupies had a competition.

315
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 They wanted to name a whale to raise awareness of whaling.

316
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And they wanted to sort of limit Japanese whaling efforts.

317
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And so they picked a whale and they said, please submit your names.

318
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 The finalists included things like Kaimana, which is a Hawaiian word, which means power of the ocean.

319
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 There's a word shanti, which is Sanskrit for tranquility.

320
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And there was a huge amount of voting. And after all the voting had ended, the winner will miss the splashy pants.

321
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And they absolutely crushed the others. It was 78% of the vote.

322
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Next was Humphrey with 3%. The other top 10 got less than 1% each.

323
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Still out there swimming around with the splashy pants.

324
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is Juzinski.

325
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Yeah, my fact this week is that books are crabs. You see anemones as boxing gloves.

326
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And I don't know why I chose this fact because I can't pronounce the word anemone.

327
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I actually think if we all just say anemone, right, I've said it.

328
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Anemone. I'm just saying anemone.

329
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 This is actually a really interesting fact, guys.

330
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I was thinking with my editor's head on, I've said it once, so now I can snip that in every single time.

331
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I know we're going to get wrong every single time, aren't we?

332
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 So what is it? So this is incredible. This is books are crabs, or they're also known as pom-pom crabs.

333
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And they use, known as pom-pom crabs, but the obvious reason that on the two front claws,

334
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 they always have two sea anemones. And they, so sea anemones are often poisonous to other fish,

335
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 even though they're not to us, they have like poison cells in them.

336
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 So they use these to ward off other fish, and they just wave these anemones at other fish to make sure they go away.

337
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 But the thing that they've discovered in the last few weeks is that if a boxer crab loses one of the anemones off one of its claws,

338
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 they will tear the other one in half, and they reproduce eggs sexually, so effectively the crab is cloning the anemone,

339
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and it shoves that anemone onto its other claw, so it rips it in half, shoves it onto its other claw.

340
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And they think this is one of the main ways that this species of anemone reproduces.

341
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 It's like the equivalent of like fighting Mike Tyson, knocking a glove off him, ripping a glove off him,

342
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 and it gromming it to a fallen botting glove in front of your face.

343
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Except that it's a live species that it's doing it, so it's like if Mike Tyson was boxing you and he's got cats.

344
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 So defend yourself.

345
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And he rips a cat into it, and it grows another into a cat.

346
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 The other thing this crab does, if it wants to eat, because it can't put them down,

347
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 because it constantly has to be holding these two anemones for its defense.

348
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 But sometimes it needs to eat, so what it does, it just leans over to some food and wipes the anemone

349
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 along the surface it wants to eat from.

350
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 So it's like the cat brings up food for you.

351
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 So what it's like is holding a cat in your hand, and then pipping it in some soup, and then sucking it off the cat.

352
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Another annoying thing for the anemones is that the crabs starve them to an extent,

353
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 because if they're allowed to eat the normal amount that they would eat, they'd be too heavy for them to carry on their claws.

354
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 So the crabs really control their eating, like a horrible dietician or something,

355
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 to make sure that they remain light enough for them to carry.

356
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 What? Is it talking?

357
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 What also happens is that say you're a crab, and you've only got one anemone.

358
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And then you meet another guy who's got two of them, then you can fight him to get one of them off him.

359
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Okay, now say you have three of them, and one guy's got none, they'll keep fighting,

360
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 and then they'll rip them apart, rip them apart, until it doesn't matter what the number of crabs is,

361
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 they'll keep doing it until everyone has one on each arm.

362
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Yeah, it's incredible.

363
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 It's weird that they fight, though, because all the fights end up with the guy who had two.

364
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 He then only has one, and he says, "Okay, well, I just ripped mine into it. Now I've got two."

365
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 But they have this weird little wrestling match.

366
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 So you know, I want one to...

367
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Are you saying they should just distribute it at the start?

368
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Go, "How many of us are we?"

369
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Okay, we need double that. I'll pop them up.

370
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Exactly, yeah. It's very bizarre.

371
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Yeah.

372
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Maybe it's flirtatious, though, because a lot of crabs use their claws to flirt.

373
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 So one of the most famous examples is the fiddler crab.

374
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And the fiddler crab looks so cool, because it really does just have this one claw,

375
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 which is enormous, and a different color as the rest of its body.

376
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 So it's often like blue or yellow, really bright color.

377
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And the way they seduce is they just wave.

378
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And so it gives a lady a wave when they're a distance away.

379
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And then if the lady gets closer, they then start using their claw to vibrate, I think,

380
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 and they vibrate the ground with their claw.

381
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And scientists are saying it's like Morse code, as in they're communicating with their vibrations.

382
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 But basically what it does is, if the longer they can vibrate and the harder...

383
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Two, we're going with this.

384
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 The more stamina they have.

385
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Yeah, and so women think, "Yeah, this guy can last."

386
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Oh, no.

387
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 It's not called the rampant crab, isn't it?

388
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 So I started looking into other animals that use other animals to attack.

389
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So animals are like, "I now have a weapon, and it's alive."

390
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And I was very surprised by finding out that dolphins do this as well.

391
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Not just a box of crab.

392
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Yeah, so what do they use to see snakes?

393
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Really?

394
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 How would they do that?

395
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 This is extraordinary.

396
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 So dolphins will find a sea snake, and it will bite it on the midsection,

397
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 and it will drag it immediately and plunge it into a school of fish.

398
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 All these things need to be very close to each other as it happens.

399
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 They grab it, and they bring it through, and the snake is freaking out,

400
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 and it's biting things as it goes along.

401
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 So what it does is, as it shoots into the school of fish,

402
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 the snake is biting all these fish and killing them as it goes,

403
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and then the dolphin releases the snake and heads back and finds the booty.

404
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

405
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Yeah, is that extraordinary?

406
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Yeah.

407
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And then there's this other thing that I read about, which is called the Indiana Jones Octopus.

408
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 I've renamed it.

409
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 It's actually called the blanket octopus, and it's an extraordinary octopus

410
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 in that it's got webbing between its tentacles.

411
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 That's very rare, but it uses it, so it can sail through the ocean,

412
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 which is quite exciting.

413
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 It takes the tides and just kind of goes.

414
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 But it's immune to the man-of-war jellyfish.

415
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And what it does is it grips it with a tentacle,

416
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 and when it's going up to a prey that it wants to eat,

417
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 it whips it like a whip and adds the thing.

418
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 So it'll go tap, and it'll hit it, poison it, and kill it,

419
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 and then they'll die, and they'll eat it.

420
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 So there are Indiana Jones-style octopuses in the ocean,

421
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 whipping stuff to death.

422
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That's incredible.

423
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Why is this not on David Edinburgh's planet Earth?

424
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Why have we not seen that guy?

425
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 That's unbelievable.

426
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

427
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It has to be quite romantic in lots of ways.

428
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 What's fascinating is, most crabs can only mate when they've melted,

429
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 so when they're out of their skin and when they're soft and vulnerable,

430
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 and then they meet...

431
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Yeah, exactly.

432
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 They have both literally made themselves vulnerable to each other.

433
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 They take their clothes off.

434
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And they take their clothes off.

435
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 That's so nice.

436
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 So they meet.

437
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 The first thing is they meet.

438
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And then they hug each other for several days.

439
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And then they mold, and then they mate.

440
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I don't know.

441
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 You say that is romantic, but being hugged for several days.

442
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 It's one of them going...

443
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Oh!

444
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 That definitely sounds one-sided.

446
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 We need to wrap up very shortly.

447
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 So do you guys have stuff you want to say before we do?

448
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I really got distracted by lobsters when researching this,

449
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 which are like crabs, but more fun.

450
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 It's really quickly.

451
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Just on crustaceans fighting.

452
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 So lobsters, I didn't realise, all hate each other.

453
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 So ever lobster comes across another lobster, then they'll start fighting.

454
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 That's why lobster nets aren't that effective.

455
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Because as soon as one lobster is in there,

456
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 it fights off all the other lobsters that try to get in.

457
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And what happens in the lobsters?

458
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 This is my safe space.

459
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I'm king of this enclosed prison.

460
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 I'm happy you can harm me in here.

461
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 So what there is is in every lobster community,

462
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 there's a dominant lobster, and what he does is every night,

463
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 he goes out around the other male lobsters houses,

464
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 and he beats them up just to show...

465
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 ...just to show that he's the main lobster genuinely.

466
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And the women have really turned on by this.

467
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So the women try to seduce him,

468
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 because they're like, "He's the dominant one."

469
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 But as National Geographic said,

470
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 "The problem when the women go to his door

471
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 and knock on his door and say,

472
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 "I want to mate with you, you're the dominant lobster,"

473
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 is he just wants to beat people up all the time.

474
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So he's not that interested in sex.

475
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 What the female lobsters do is,

476
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 they release a pheromone,

477
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 so they urinate out their eyes,

478
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 which lobsters do.

479
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Well, this is much more romantic than you'll trap guys.

480
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 This release is a drug into the male lobster lab,

481
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 which relaxes him,

482
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and then means that he's ready to mate.

483
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I can't believe someone urinates out their eyes at you.

484
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And your first thing is,

485
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 "I'm now so relaxed."

486
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 I'm ready for sexy time.

487
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Netflix and urinates out their eyes.

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 I'm going to wrap up some,

489
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 "Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

490
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
