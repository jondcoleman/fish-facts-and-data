00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 This week coming to you right from up the creek in Greenwich London.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 My name is Dan Shriver and I am sitting here with Anish Zensky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And once again we have gathered around the table with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in an particular order, here we go.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Starting with my facts.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 My fact this week is that scientists can now predict when someone is going to fall over.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Three weeks before it happens.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 These are scientists who have been studying Miranda.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 This is shockingly true.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 So what they do is they notice obviously it's a problem that a lot of elderly people fall over and that leads to a lot of problems.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So they've been studying it and what they've realized is that you can actually spot the moment when a fall is going to happen due to the speed that someone travels at.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 So what they've done is they put cameras into this into a house and they've monitored someone walking and they've noticed a speed change that happens.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And when the speed change happens it means because something is deteriorated inside the body so it means that they walk a lot slower.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Therefore they predict and they've shown from these studies that in the subsequent three weeks a fall is going to happen.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 So robots are now monitoring old people to see if they're changing speed and they're like down by like 0.5 miles an hour,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 set the text and you can stop them from falling over.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Well and then as the granddaughter or whatever you have to go to the house immediately and stand there in front of them with your arms out at all times.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 It does sound like the old people are falling over in slow motion.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 I've watched you been framed and that's kind of what happened.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 If you're stride length so the other thing it can measure actually I'm not sure how they do this with the sensors that they install.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 But if you're stride length changes by just about seven centimetres that can be detected and that also is a strong indicator that you're going to have a fall within the coming few weeks.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And to illustrate how effective it is because it is unbelievable if you're walking speed decreases by 5.1 centimetres a second.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 You have an eight as a pensioner, you have an 86% chance of falling over within three weeks compared to a 20% chance if your speed hasn't decreased that much.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Which is an unbelievable difference. Is this just huge change that suddenly happens?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And I think the idea is that you get these robots in people's houses and it means that they can kind of hang out a lot more without people looking after them.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 They're not actual robots, are they?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I mean what is a robot? Like hello, how are you?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 That's an android. And that android is human shaped whereas a robot is just anything that's robotic.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 If I bought my best friend is a robot and he arrived and it was like a camera.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Do you know what robots they use for older people actually?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 No. One robot they use is Paro who is a seal and so Paro was built in Japan and it's a little seal which is robotic and it responds to like being hugged and being spoken to.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And the creator of this little robot seal is called Takanori Shibata and he chose it because he said people are unlikely to have unhelpful memories of real seals.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 So it's not going to freak anyone out because very few people have been assaulted by a seal.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Just one person who's lost a hand to a seal.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So there is a bastard to sue a creature that doesn't have a recent development on mine.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 The British researchers are currently teaming up with Japanese, or written Japanese robots, the teaming up with Japanese researchers to use monitoring robots and they're trying to install cultural differences.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And one of the reasons that they don't get in the UK is you have a lot of people from a lot of different cultures living here.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 One of the researchers said the following. I think she was Greek herself.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 She said a robot might be taught not to try and cheer up a Greek woman whose husband died months ago because Greek widows are expected to be sad for at least a year.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Wow. So it's kind of installing the cultural sensitivity.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 That's very good to know.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Where does I suppose in other cultures the robot will just say, "Come on, Geron!"

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 (Laughter)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 But it instructs them to stay depressed if they're Greek.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 (Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Can't help but notice you smiled a second ago.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 You know, you've lost your husband.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 (Laughter)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Yeah, you're appropriate.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Just on falling over, this is an experiment that you might not see.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 See, it's fantastic. It's an experiment on penguins, which put penguins on treadmills.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 (Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And it's fantastic.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 So penguins have to, they have to strike a balance, right?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Because they have to go a long time without food because they're feeding their young and they're foraging for their young.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And they have to, you know, so they lose a lot of weight during the period where they're hunting.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 So they need to put on as much weight as possible.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 But if they put on too much weight, they become completely in agile and predators will catch and eat them.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And so that's no good for the young either, obviously.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 So the scientists from the University of London wanted to test, you know, the sort of relationship between weight and walking speed.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And this team just put them on treadmills and didn't feed them for hours and days, in fact.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 No, they used to it, that's fine.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 (Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 They didn't feed them for two weeks and put them on a treadmill.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And some of the penguins started cheating, right? So there's a treadmill and then there's a little hood over the treadmill.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Okay, so that they're in the same place all the way along.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And some of the penguins just leaned against the back wall of this canopy and sort of water-skied along the treadmill.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 (Laughter)

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 No way, really.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 (Laughter)

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 That's the thing about penguins is, is it not, there's a, I think it's a myth, but in the Falcon Islands supposedly planes go over them, fly over them and they just look and look and look and look and look and they fall on them.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 No, they deep- they debunked it just very recently.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 They did a study where I think people went out to film them and they sent planes over and they looked up and they were like, "I was playing."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And then they were, they were all good. Yeah, no, they don't actually fall over.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 No, the discovery the penguins can talk, really Trump. (Laughter)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And there's a lot of quotes going, "Is that Emirates?"

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 (Laughter)

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 So another thing that is done in old people's homes, another thing that's done in nursing homes is installing therapy animals sometimes.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 So to make people feel better and there's one particular therapy cat called Oscar who's been adopted in a nursing home in Rhode Island.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And it's quite confusing the reasons why he was adopted because apparently he's generally unsociable.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 But his one skill is bizarrely, he can tell when someone's about to die.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 So the only time he goes near someone is when they are about to die.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 He's the most terrifying cat. (Laughter)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And if he's so, he'll just suddenly run to somebody's room and sit on their bed and then if he's removed, then he'll scratch on the door, scratch on the door until he's let back in again.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Is he killed it? Is he killing the people? (Laughter)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 It's been all the mysterious cats. (Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 They're always dead soon. (Laughter)

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 But he's detected over 50 deaths and it's within hours.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 So I mean it's very strong. This is a book written by a doctor who works at a nursing home.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And they think maybe he's detecting ketones which are the chemicals that you release, chemicals that die in cells release.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So there is a very subtle change in the chemicals you release. He is in an old people's home though, isn't he?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Like a lot of these people are going to die at certain times. I like seeing putt in a football stadium. (Laughter)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 So what's happening to the cat? Is he still there?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 He's still there because he wanted to know. He's on your seat. (Laughter)

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 But that can't be good for the morale. (Laughter)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Phew. Wow. Where is the home? Sorry?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 It's in Pittsburgh and you're scheduled to go next week.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Do you know why we don't fall over in terms of our body and the balance?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Do you know why we don't fall over?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 I don't know what you're going to get your feet given the way. So yes, it is our legs.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 But there's a thing and I've not actually read it earlier. I didn't write it down.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 So I'm freestyling here. There's a thing in our ear which everyone thought was a balance-making thing.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Otolith. Thank you.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 The otolith which meant to be a thing that just gave us balance.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 I guess kind of like when you're measuring a door and you have that little thing in the mirror level.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So you have a spirit level thing in your otolith and everyone thought that that's what was keeping you up.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 But it turns out they didn't experiment and they worked out how to shut that off so that it wasn't in the humans that they were testing.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 That wasn't playing a factor into it. They managed to turn off the switch and just turn it off.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And what I noticed was the calves of a human is what actually provides the balance.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 It's not the feet, it's not the between the foot and the calf.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 I really want to make this all right now.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Okay, because you can't see this but Dan is saying calves but he's clutching his thigh.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Where the fuck's the calf?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Oh, that's your calf.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 We need to remember I'm sorry next time.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Where did you think your thigh was?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 I posted it from there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Dan, unfortunately for you, I also read about this experience and I did write it down.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Because we're doing a factual podcast.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 At least write.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 We need to move on to our next action.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Can I tell you very quickly one more thing about walking around?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 The elephants can't run.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 They can run with their front half.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 They run with their front legs but not with their back legs.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 What happens when we run is our centre of gravity starts bumping up and down and that weighs energy.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 So what elephants do is they start trotting along with their front legs to speed up their movement

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 but they keep on walking with their back legs.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I guess Linky.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 It's true that the centre of gravity stays a constant height from the ground which most things doesn't.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So they only run with half of their bodies.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 That's my fact and it's true as yours.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Let's move on to our okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 My fact this week is that when he became president Lyndon B. Johnson installed a special shower in the White House

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 that fired a jet directly at his penis.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 I mean he became president after the assassination of Kennedy.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 He did.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 It depends how long after he became president I suppose.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 If immediately after he was sworn in he said right let's sort out this shower.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 He wanted it as well to have the sort of the force of a firehose.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 That's right.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 He wanted a needle like intensity which was the equivalent of a fire hose.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And he had lots of jets especially one up his bum and another one directly at his penis.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And the jets which went directly at his penis he nicknamed a jumbo which is weirdly exactly what he nicknamed his actual penis.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 And that's true he did he did.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 It's weird though I think in the UK it sounds more of a sort of audacious thing to name your penis because I have a lot of American friends.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 They're just like they they have names they were like me jumbo like it's meat meat.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 What do you say cans?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 You say that's normal for your American friends.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 This is also something that LBJ was kind of known for.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 So there's a guy called Robert Carrot who was riding a five volume biography of him.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 He's 80 now he's done four volumes he's working on the fifth.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Listen to this, this is about LBJ.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 He early became famous for a Ravalasian earthiness urinating in the parking lot of the house office building as the urge took him.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 If a colleague came into a capital bathroom as he was finishing at the urinal though he would sometimes swing around still holding his member which he liked to call jumbo.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Moving once have you ever seen anything as big as this and shaking it in a brandishing manner as he began disclosing about some pending legislation.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 He genuinely I can't believe that we've only found this out like we've been looking at presidents for ages and suddenly it's like okay LBJ just took his penis out a lot and he would do it in public in front of any reporter that was chatting to him.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 He's inauguration speech actually was asked.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 He's much better attended than Trump's.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Oh it's the biggest.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 I don't know Mr. President the photos don't seem to say it.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 It was called it was raining.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 So he would take it out while the journalists were sort of talking to him famously and this is a bit that obviously they just keep having to hide these moments because I we can't report on this.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 They asked him about the Vietnam War and they were like why we why we fighting with Vietnam.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 His response and I think it's because he was like I don't quite have an answer.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 He unzipped his trousers he pulled out his penis and he held it at them.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 He went this is why.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Isn't it amazing that presidential press conference has got no better since then.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 He did used to frequently ask aides to join him in the laboratory didn't he when he was so when he was giving them briefings or when he was just hanging out with them.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 So I think one of his men and women as well one of his aides Doris Kerns goodwin said she often accompanied him into the bathroom because he needed to take a pee but he also wanted to continue talking.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 And she recalled that the security adviser when he joined he complied really reluctantly and he stood in the furthest corner away from Johnson while Johnson was urinating understandably with his back to him and the president said to him come closer come closer.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 I don't know if it was in that tone of voice but then funding complied and came closer and Johnson later remarked I thought he was going to sit on my lap.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Hasn't that guy ever been in the army and I don't know what any of that really means.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 It's so weird.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So he had a lot of affairs lbj.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Also all the people in his family had the initials lbj.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 His wife was called Lady Bird Johnson.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Her first name was Lady?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 No her first name was Bird.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Sorry Lady Bird was was her first name Lady Bird.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 It kind of was in a way they like when she was a kid they called her cutes as a Lady Bird and they're not sure if they meant Lady Bird or whatever.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And then she was known as Bird throughout her whole life and then when she became a first Lady she became first Lady Bird.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Carry on.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 So he did have a lot of affairs. He used to be very boastful about it actually and I think he got quite annoyed that JFK had a bit of a reputation for being a womanizer in his time.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 And apparently whenever anyone mentioned Kennedy's multiple affairs Johnson would bang the table and declare that he had had more women by accident than Kennedy had had on purpose.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 I don't know what that means either.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Jumbo has a mind of his own.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 When he wanted to install the shower into the White House he was questioned about him they said you know why would we do this.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And he said if I can move 10,000 troops on a day you can certainly fix the bathroom in any way I want.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And then it was a complete waste because as soon as Nixon entered the White House after him he took one look at the elaborate setup and said get rid of this stuff.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 I like to think he took one shower, it blew his cock off many times.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 The show I did get reviewed by people other than LBJ.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 I thought you were like on TripAdvisor.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Blue my cock off one star.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 LBJ by the way, he was in by all accounts of Dickhead.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 He would make people come in while he was having a poo to tell them what he wanted to do.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 But he also did a lot of prints which were quite exciting.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 We had mentioned this ages ago on the podcast but he had a car that was a amphibious car.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 So it's a car that can drive on the road and then go into a body of water and still work.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 It's a boat all of a sudden but it's still the car.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 So what he used to do at the White House is he used to drive people around in the car and he would be talking to them.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And in the White House property there's a bit of a lake, it's a tiny bit of body water where you can go and just hang out.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And he would drive the car down suddenly, down the hill and then he would pretend that the brakes had broken.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And he would freak them out.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And they'd hit the body of water and then just become a boat and then high fides all around.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 That was the thing he did while he was a president.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Do we have amphibious cars?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 I do not believe we have those that switch quickly enough for that practice work.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Have you never been on a duck tour?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 I think he takes like 45 minutes for them to do the transport on the road to risk it.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 I don't know, I've never been on a duck tour.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is Andy Murray.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 My fact is that rejected names for British storms include Baldrick, Noddy, Megatron and Branch Warbler.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Why? Some of my shouts.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 I was going to tell you all I love.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So this is us that we've just had a big storm in the UK and this was a piece of wide about storm non-englature.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 The Met Office started naming British storms in 2015 and the rationale was you sort of have a better handle.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 It's a bit confusing when someone says that a large weather system or a storm is on the way, it's a bit vague.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Whereas if you pin a name to a storm, it makes it a lot more concrete and the idea is easier to prepare for.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 So they've been doing this in America with tropical storms and harrowcates and things for decades.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 So we've got names for our storms and the Met Office in the wisdom asked the public to submit names.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 So there were things, one of the rejected word names was Ena Teacup.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 There were other rejected ones, Big Boss, Vader, Voldemort.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 My favourite one was, and I think this was for a hurricane in the state.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 This was from someone called @Yuldalthelcon and he wanted to call it Schmurakane.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 So you'd be, "Hurakane Schmurakane."

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Usually named after people aren't they, and it's usually names.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 So what was the one, Doris?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 So we did that Doris, yeah.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 I quite like the idea of gale.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And is that one that's been accepted?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 No, no, they didn't accept it.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 It's a good one, isn't it?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 A few others, like what was the one you said branch wobble on?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 So some of the things like that, leaf shake and leaf stripper and root ripper.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 No, it's good.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 And also I quite like someone said we should call a storm, King Henry V.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Why?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 I told him I didn't storm through Northern France during the hundred years world.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 So do you know the first person who started to name weather events?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 No, no.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 This is a guy called Clementine.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 He was Welsh.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Okay, okay.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 What storm?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Right.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 The first person to name weather events was a guy called Clement-Linley-Rag.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 This was a British guy in the 19th century who lived in Tasmania.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 He was a meteorologist and he decided to name storms.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 They made them more memorable.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 But he named them largely after politicians so that he was able to say the name of a politician he didn't like

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 and then followed that with things like causing great distress.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 So you know what you say?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 David Cameron is causing great distress on the coast of Cornwall.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 And you know, George Ossblon is wandering aimlessly about the Pacific.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Michael Gove is blowing people all over the place.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 So they named storms only after women for a long time.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Yeah.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And that was thought to be very misogynistic because the idea was the people who did it was in the 19th century

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 and it was because women were similarly unpredictable to the weather.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 And then they changed it eventually thankfully.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 There was a women's right activist called Roxie Bolton, which is where I spent a lot of my teenage years.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 But she suggested replacing the word hurricane because it sounds a bit like hurt again to him again.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 So there is a theory that this is a 2014 study and it's a bit controversial.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 It's a theory that hurricanes in America with women's names have higher death tolls than those with men's names

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 because people think it's only Cindy or whatever it might be.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 I don't need to worry about a hurricane.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Is that actually what they think?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Yeah, but it is controversial and it's a theory.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 And it does include all the data from I think before the 70s when hurricanes only had women's names.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 It seems a bit dubious to me.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 What Roxie Bolton said in her defence of hurricanes being gender equal,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 she said women are not disasters destroying life and communities and leaving a lasting and devastating effect,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 which I think would be so cool if we were.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 But then she didn't mean to be a suggestion named after senators, that was her suggestion.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 She had a nice to grind.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 It's good that they brought in the names.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 In the old days you would just call the names sometimes after a saint's day or some other things.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 In Ireland they had one very big, it wasn't a hurricane, it was a storm,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 but they called it the night of the big wind.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 But it was such a severe storm.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 People thought the end of the world was happening because it happened on the epiphany.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 And they thought that maybe this was judgment day or whatever.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And it was so famous in the time, in 1908 they introduced pensions into Ireland.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 And a lot of people didn't have their birth records.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 And so the way they would tell how old you are was to ask you if you remembered the night of the big wind.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 You know there's a theory, it's no longer believed but back in the day.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 No thanks.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Wind was created by time travellers.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 All the wind and all the songs were created because of trees waving their branches.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So they were waving that and suddenly winds were created.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 That makes completely sense.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 I think as a child, I think that's a natural thing to think, right?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Because it's windy and there are trees moving.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 And you think maybe this comes from this? But then do you think like, oh this wind is caused by my hat falling off or something like that?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 I think it was James.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 There is a possibility that that's not a theory and it's actually a poem by Ogden Nash.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 But it's also a line of the Terry Pratchett book you might be thinking of that.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 So we should probably ignore the whole last minute.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 What I find amazing is with weather. Obviously it's all this kind of butterfly effects and chaos theory and stuff like that.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 The tiniest little thing can cause massive weather systems.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 And so that means that weather forecast is actually, they say that they cannot predict any weather at all for 14 days.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Anything over 14 days is completely impossible.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 But we can predict that all people are going to fall over for three weeks.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 But they often fall over when it's windy, so I assume that all people are going to fall out of the wind.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 We should move on to our final fact.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 I have a quick thing just about asking the public to name things.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 So a couple of years ago, groupies had a competition.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 They wanted to name a whale to raise awareness of whaling.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 And they wanted to sort of limit Japanese whaling efforts.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 And so they picked a whale and they said, please submit your names.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 The finalists included things like Kaimana, which is a Hawaiian word, which means power of the ocean.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 There's a word shanti, which is Sanskrit for tranquility.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 And there was a huge amount of voting. And after all the voting had ended, the winner will miss the splashy pants.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And they absolutely crushed the others. It was 78% of the vote.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Next was Humphrey with 3%. The other top 10 got less than 1% each.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Still out there swimming around with the splashy pants.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is Juzinski.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Yeah, my fact this week is that books are crabs. You see anemones as boxing gloves.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And I don't know why I chose this fact because I can't pronounce the word anemone.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 I actually think if we all just say anemone, right, I've said it.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Anemone. I'm just saying anemone.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 This is actually a really interesting fact, guys.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 I was thinking with my editor's head on, I've said it once, so now I can snip that in every single time.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 I know we're going to get wrong every single time, aren't we?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 So what is it? So this is incredible. This is books are crabs, or they're also known as pom-pom crabs.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And they use, known as pom-pom crabs, but the obvious reason that on the two front claws,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 they always have two sea anemones. And they, so sea anemones are often poisonous to other fish,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 even though they're not to us, they have like poison cells in them.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 So they use these to ward off other fish, and they just wave these anemones at other fish to make sure they go away.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 But the thing that they've discovered in the last few weeks is that if a boxer crab loses one of the anemones off one of its claws,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 they will tear the other one in half, and they reproduce eggs sexually, so effectively the crab is cloning the anemone,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 and it shoves that anemone onto its other claw, so it rips it in half, shoves it onto its other claw.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And they think this is one of the main ways that this species of anemone reproduces.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 It's like the equivalent of like fighting Mike Tyson, knocking a glove off him, ripping a glove off him,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 and it gromming it to a fallen botting glove in front of your face.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Except that it's a live species that it's doing it, so it's like if Mike Tyson was boxing you and he's got cats.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 So defend yourself.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And he rips a cat into it, and it grows another into a cat.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 The other thing this crab does, if it wants to eat, because it can't put them down,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 because it constantly has to be holding these two anemones for its defense.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 But sometimes it needs to eat, so what it does, it just leans over to some food and wipes the anemone

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 along the surface it wants to eat from.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 So it's like the cat brings up food for you.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 So what it's like is holding a cat in your hand, and then pipping it in some soup, and then sucking it off the cat.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Another annoying thing for the anemones is that the crabs starve them to an extent,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 because if they're allowed to eat the normal amount that they would eat, they'd be too heavy for them to carry on their claws.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 So the crabs really control their eating, like a horrible dietician or something,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 to make sure that they remain light enough for them to carry.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 What? Is it talking?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 What also happens is that say you're a crab, and you've only got one anemone.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 And then you meet another guy who's got two of them, then you can fight him to get one of them off him.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Okay, now say you have three of them, and one guy's got none, they'll keep fighting,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 and then they'll rip them apart, rip them apart, until it doesn't matter what the number of crabs is,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 they'll keep doing it until everyone has one on each arm.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Yeah, it's incredible.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 It's weird that they fight, though, because all the fights end up with the guy who had two.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 He then only has one, and he says, "Okay, well, I just ripped mine into it. Now I've got two."

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 But they have this weird little wrestling match.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 So you know, I want one to...

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Are you saying they should just distribute it at the start?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Go, "How many of us are we?"

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Okay, we need double that. I'll pop them up.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Exactly, yeah. It's very bizarre.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Yeah.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Maybe it's flirtatious, though, because a lot of crabs use their claws to flirt.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 So one of the most famous examples is the fiddler crab.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 And the fiddler crab looks so cool, because it really does just have this one claw,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 which is enormous, and a different color as the rest of its body.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 So it's often like blue or yellow, really bright color.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And the way they seduce is they just wave.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 And so it gives a lady a wave when they're a distance away.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 And then if the lady gets closer, they then start using their claw to vibrate, I think,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 and they vibrate the ground with their claw.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And scientists are saying it's like Morse code, as in they're communicating with their vibrations.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 But basically what it does is, if the longer they can vibrate and the harder...

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Two, we're going with this.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 The more stamina they have.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Yeah, and so women think, "Yeah, this guy can last."

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Oh, no.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 It's not called the rampant crab, isn't it?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 So I started looking into other animals that use other animals to attack.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 So animals are like, "I now have a weapon, and it's alive."

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And I was very surprised by finding out that dolphins do this as well.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Not just a box of crab.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Yeah, so what do they use to see snakes?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Really?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 How would they do that?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 This is extraordinary.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 So dolphins will find a sea snake, and it will bite it on the midsection,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 and it will drag it immediately and plunge it into a school of fish.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 All these things need to be very close to each other as it happens.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 They grab it, and they bring it through, and the snake is freaking out,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 and it's biting things as it goes along.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 So what it does is, as it shoots into the school of fish,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 the snake is biting all these fish and killing them as it goes,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 and then the dolphin releases the snake and heads back and finds the booty.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Yeah, is that extraordinary?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Yeah.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 And then there's this other thing that I read about, which is called the Indiana Jones Octopus.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 I've renamed it.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 It's actually called the blanket octopus, and it's an extraordinary octopus

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 in that it's got webbing between its tentacles.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 That's very rare, but it uses it, so it can sail through the ocean,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 which is quite exciting.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 It takes the tides and just kind of goes.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 But it's immune to the man-of-war jellyfish.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And what it does is it grips it with a tentacle,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 and when it's going up to a prey that it wants to eat,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 it whips it like a whip and adds the thing.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 So it'll go tap, and it'll hit it, poison it, and kill it,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 and then they'll die, and they'll eat it.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 So there are Indiana Jones-style octopuses in the ocean,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 whipping stuff to death.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 That's incredible.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Why is this not on David Edinburgh's planet Earth?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Why have we not seen that guy?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 That's unbelievable.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 It has to be quite romantic in lots of ways.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 What's fascinating is, most crabs can only mate when they've melted,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 so when they're out of their skin and when they're soft and vulnerable,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 and then they meet...

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 They have both literally made themselves vulnerable to each other.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 They take their clothes off.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 And they take their clothes off.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 That's so nice.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 So they meet.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 The first thing is they meet.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And then they hug each other for several days.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 And then they mold, and then they mate.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 I don't know.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 You say that is romantic, but being hugged for several days.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 It's one of them going...

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Oh!

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 That definitely sounds one-sided.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 We need to wrap up very shortly.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 So do you guys have stuff you want to say before we do?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 I really got distracted by lobsters when researching this,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 which are like crabs, but more fun.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 It's really quickly.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Just on crustaceans fighting.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So lobsters, I didn't realise, all hate each other.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 So ever lobster comes across another lobster, then they'll start fighting.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 That's why lobster nets aren't that effective.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Because as soon as one lobster is in there,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 it fights off all the other lobsters that try to get in.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 And what happens in the lobsters?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 This is my safe space.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 I'm king of this enclosed prison.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 I'm happy you can harm me in here.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 So what there is is in every lobster community,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 there's a dominant lobster, and what he does is every night,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 he goes out around the other male lobsters houses,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 and he beats them up just to show...

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 ...just to show that he's the main lobster genuinely.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 And the women have really turned on by this.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 So the women try to seduce him,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 because they're like, "He's the dominant one."

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 But as National Geographic said,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 "The problem when the women go to his door

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 and knock on his door and say,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 "I want to mate with you, you're the dominant lobster,"

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 is he just wants to beat people up all the time.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 So he's not that interested in sex.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 What the female lobsters do is,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 they release a pheromone,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 so they urinate out their eyes,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 which lobsters do.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Well, this is much more romantic than you'll trap guys.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 This release is a drug into the male lobster lab,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 which relaxes him,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and then means that he's ready to mate.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 I can't believe someone urinates out their eyes at you.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 And your first thing is,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 "I'm now so relaxed."

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 I'm ready for sexy time.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Netflix and urinates out their eyes.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 I'm going to wrap up some,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 "Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
