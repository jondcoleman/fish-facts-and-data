00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,800

 And I suppose on with the podcast

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:41,440
 Welcome back everyone it is time to move on to our next guest and boy do we have an exciting one

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,800
 We have someone who is I guess the biggest quizzing personality on TV

31
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,040
 You'll know him from house of games. You'll know him from pointless, but just as a sort of side project

32
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,960
 He's also become the best-selling fictional author to have a debut book out in the history of books

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,640
 That's his kind of side plate of things that he does

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,640
 You'll know it as the Thursday murder club. We're so excited to have him here for fact number eight. It is Mr

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
 Richard Osmond

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,320
 How are you? We are good. How is it going so far great cracking really?

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,000
 It's we've raised 45,000 pounds since

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,680
 Since going which is very exciting. We had a target of 35,000 so we've exceeded that and

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,100
 Yeah, if all your all your fans watching now

40
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:37,960
 Can contribute as well. We would be hugely grateful to be on 45,150

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,480
 Well, let's get into it. We understand you brought a fact so it's time for fact number eight and that is Richard Osmond

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,360
 I have brought a fact that it's it's it's who wants to be a millionaire related for reasons

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,260
 We will get on to but my fact is the man who wrote the theme tune so he wants to be a millionaire also wrote mistletoe and wine

44
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,960
 A gentleman called Keith Strachan

45
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,800
 He's been around for years and years. He's a musician musical director all sorts of things like that wrote mistletoe and wine from musical fun

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,760
 enough

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,640
 Cliff took hold of it so he won a live in the valley for it

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,880
 But for years also rate theme music for sell a door

49
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,680
 So we do lots of ill remembered shows like talking telephone numbers

50
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,960
 And then you know one day gets the call saying that we're doing this pilot in a couple of days time

51
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,800
 It's this thing called who wants to be a millionaire. We're not happy with the song

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,120
 We've got which was written by Pete Waterman stock eighth in the water and so we're not happy with it

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 Is there anything you can do he sat down with his son put something together lots of sort of streams and stuff like that

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,560
 Couple of days later the pilot goes out that song is probably made in tens of millions

55
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,200
 Or theme tune in the history of television that they use the same thing tune around the world. Yeah

56
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,040
 Millionaire and and weakest link one of those shows that was always done as a kid apart

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,680
 I you buy you buy the look you buy the set you buy the graphics you buy the music

58
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,520
 She's not always the case. So yeah, every time it's played in America every time it's based on

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Keith Stratton is

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,920
 Like the millionaire theme it's not my lot not that melodic is it well, that's the thing you couldn't whistle it right no

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:26,660
 Yeah, I've heard that you are meant to be able to sing along to it and I can just about get the who wants to be

62
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
 What's to be a million?

63
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,480
 Do little a little and I don't know if I'm seeing the right bit to the right. I don't think

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,220
 What I do is you've just made Keith Stratton seven and a half

65
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:48,880
 That part of it is based on the musical song who wants to be a millionaire is that I think that's the other part that he

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
 I kind of know that song when you say

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,960
 Those from Fiddler on the roof or something, but someone in the chat will know what it's from. Yeah

68
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,560
 Now normally we have sandy toxin tell us these things

69
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,040
 You don't know we shut down our computers

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,320
 I have to ring up my mum and ask her the answer the question

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,600
 That pilot of who wants to be a millionaire

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 Actually the first episode that went out. I think the pilot was broadcast

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,400
 It got 46 of the total tv audience at the time

74
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,680
 And I mean it was it was so huge Chris Tarrant said the day after the first episode went out

75
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,560
 Someone shouted at him from a passing lorry phone a friend and he said that happened every day for the next 15 years

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:52,000
 Host you barely go through three shows or that's someone looking nervous if they don't know an answer and saying can I phone a friend

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
 It's the goat

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,320
 When you sit in the makeup chair

79
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,800
 As well. So if you're if you're a new contestant you sit in the makeup chair

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 This is just if anyone ever goes on a quiz

81
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
 every single man

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,720
 Nervous of course sits down and says short back and sides, please

83
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,640
 Every single one and there's poor makeup artists happening up

84
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,760
 So many people watching who would have been one of those people rich

85
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,040
 Crying into that

86
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,080
 But I would do it as well, you know, you're nervous and so yeah

87
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,920
 Yeah, Richard do you get like people shouting things at you in the street like central african republic or

88
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,640
 Or what are the things but people always just shout the pointless to me in the street

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,560
 I'm aware that other people walking past you might not know who I am

90
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
 I've just seen someone

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,640
 If I get most off the pointless honestly, what it used to in these days

92
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,520
 It's it's it's the book in its house against but the thing I think I used to get more as much as pointless is people saying

93
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
 Oh count down

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,200
 you're like, oh

95
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
 really

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,000
 The Zondra and I you know, who are they so rich? Who do they think they think you're Susie Dentore?

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,280
 Richard Whiteley?

98
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,240
 I think I know I don't think they really think I'm on count down. I think you have been on count down a couple of times

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
 So maybe they just really like that episode

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,600
 And so I've got hundreds of millions of viewers around the world

101
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,520
 We want Zondra wants to literally introduce the show. I'm Alexander Armstrong and welcome to count down

102
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,800
 Those are so exciting but the reason he did it is because the audition for count down

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,160
 and

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,320
 We were genuinely thinking because you know, he would he's obviously a brilliant comic actor and was doing the vital use for you all the time

105
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,600
 And we thought we'll never do a daytime show and then we got some info that he was doing an audition for count down

106
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,040
 And we thought well, if he's up for doing that then perhaps he'd be up for doing our show

107
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,760
 And so literally off the back of that we thought let's get him in and he came in and then then we had our house

108
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
 So we have count down

109
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,120
 Yeah, if he'll do a countdown he will do any daytime show that's nice

110
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,200
 What's your favorite theme tune Richard? You must have one

111
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,840
 Favorite theme tune is superstars. I would think from the uh from from the 70s

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,200
 Uh, it's you know, it's absolutely. I'm quite but you know if they play like theme tunes

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,880
 If you're watching university challenge or something and there's uh, you recognize all of them

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,240
 But you can I always think they're from kickstart. Um, but superstars is the one. Yeah, absolutely

115
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,400
 It's so brilliant. If you if you haven't heard it have have a little go and listen to it best show ever and best theme tune ever

116
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
 I learned the other day, uh, actually this was a few months ago

117
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,560
 But that the inspector gadget theme tune

118
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,480
 And the mysterious cities of gold theme tune and the he-man theme tune and jason the wheel warriors new overseas for people of a certain age

119
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,720
 We're all written by the same guy

120
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
 called shuki levy and he also wrote the israeli

121
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,920
 1981 eurovision song contest entry, which I haven't heard but you must be amazing, right because they are absolutely everyone is an

122
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,680
 Absolutely, thank you. Although it's going to gadget is just a big old plagiarism the same as sonic the hedgehog

123
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
 It's it's in fact a gadget goes

124
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:09,600
 Yeah, that's hall of the mountain king same as sonic the hedgehog. Oh, he's just slightly changed the timing. Uh, that's just hall of the mountain king

125
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,200
 He wants to be available there based on holster planets. Yeah, that's a particular

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,400
 Like stab of brass or stab of horns or something that yeah, he worked from

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,480
 I think a cool thing about the holster's planets the other day. I think it was for net tune

128
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
 um, they had

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,240
 The choir that's in the song fade out, but they weren't able to fade it out properly at the time

130
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,520
 And so what they did was they had the choir in a different room and they slowly closed the door

131
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
 And then once it was shut, yeah

132
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,200
 What is you know, again, if we uh, we're editing this this might not end up in the final show

133
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,360
 possibly not true

134
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,960
 Do you know my favorite um theme tune because of a fact is the seinfeld theme tune now

135
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,440
 I've always I've always loved it because I love seinfeld and the stand-up moment at the beginning

136
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
 So for anyone that doesn't remember it, it's like

137
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,920
 Baseline uh, but it was done on a synth what I didn't realize was that for the first I think it must have been eight series

138
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,320
 That theme tune was re-recorded for every single episode

139
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,600
 Because and it makes total sense seinfeld is doing stand-up. There are different beats to where his joke is going to land each time

140
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,680
 So this guy used to get sent the footage of the latest stand-up bit going at the front of seinfeld

141
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,760
 And he would live jam the theme tune for every single episode

142
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
 Put all those moments in when he could see seinfeld coming to a beat in the joke

143
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,720
 It's something like 200 episodes that he've re-wrote it for every single time. He must have got tired of that tune

144
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
 Could you tell at the end it was losing some of its vigor?

145
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,320
 That's like when the circus when you used to see dancing horses dancing to the music

146
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,640
 And you think how do they get the horses to dance to the music?

147
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,360
 They don't they play the music to match whatever the hell the horses are doing that seinfeld is the horse in that scenario

148
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,840
 Yeah, and I can't believe you've just ruined that magic for children in the 1950s

149
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:19,360
 He went to the circus but still my favorite scene tune is also the most well-known piece of music in the uk apparently

150
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,480
 According to a 2000. I think it was 2008 poll actually

151
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
 EastEnders

152
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,520
 Correct must be EastEnders there and that beat god save the queen into number two

153
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,840
 But I didn't realize very neat EastEnders fact. It has a spin-off called julius theme written by one of the EastEnders

154
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,200
 Creators and that's when you know when you get an ending which is a bit more poignant and it doesn't really suit the boom boom boom

155
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,360
 And then julius theme comes in and it comes in about once a year

156
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
 Oh

157
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,800
 If you get a julius theme that must be a big moment as an east ender that's it

158
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
 Of course, Elita Dobson had a big hit they put lyrics to the east enders theme tune

159
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,480
 Anyone can fall in love and Elita Dobson who's Angie had a pit with it on top of the pops and all sorts of things

160
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,280
 Back in those days you had eight sides and b-sides and I wonder what the b-sides of that must have been

161
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:11,280
 They used to um if you used to watch bullseye back in the day at the very end

162
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,600
 They would throw the darts and try and win the big prize

163
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,520
 And if they won the prize they would have the theme tune and if they lost the prize

164
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,840
 They would have the same theme tune but in a minor key

165
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,520
 A little bit slower

166
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,560
 So sometimes they release the the themes and they they chart

167
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,760
 Um, can you think of the highest charting tv teams? You never it's gonna be a kids show, right?

168
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,160
 It's got to be like Barney or builder or I've got suit for you right here. I bet theme from match

169
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,960
 Was number one suicide is painless. Yeah

170
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,320
 And another number one with eye levels. I think was found of all so there's a couple for you right there

171
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
 Okay, I've got an answer for you all anyway

172
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,400
 And it's going to divide opinion

173
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,200
 It's going to divide the room because you've named a lot of songs that went to number one

174
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,560
 So it's clearly a dead tie

175
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,120
 But a million people in 1997 bought the tally tubby's theme tune. I believe that's in the uk

176
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,520
 I was one of them. Really?

177
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,600
 Were you on that?

178
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,160
 See I was a student at the time and that's that was the demographic for the show. So it was um

179
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,000
 But bob the builder was which dan I think dan mentioned

180
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,320
 Yeah, I said bob the builder bob the builder not only had a huge number one hit

181
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,400
 I think second only to tally tubbies

182
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,640
 But bob the builder released a version of mambo number five which also sold 400 000 copies

183
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,760
 So sorry, did bob the builder rewrote mambo number five?

184
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,280
 Yeah

185
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,160
 And changed the lyrics because it's still non-child friendly. The lyrics are the same. It's all about women. Bob is accused

186
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,560
 These are sexy man. Everyone's got to build a fantasy, you know

187
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,640
 Okay, so on mambo number five that was the theme tune to something else

188
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,280
 Um, which I always love this fact that was a theme tune to one of bill clinton's democratic conventions

189
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
 In the early 90s

190
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,880
 Do you and it was it was set to be like the proper walk-in walk-out music until someone pointed out at the last minute

191
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,440
 That it did contain the line a little bit of monica in my life

192
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:18,560
 Wow, that's an oversight, isn't it from me? You know, Lou Baker. Yeah. Yeah, did you know where he's from?

193
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,280
 Oh, damn. He's german, isn't he? He's german

194
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,880
 I mean, I just didn't know he was did you did any all right? Can we count richard out for a second?

195
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
 Did you guys know he was german? I don't fully know who he is

196
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,160
 Well, it's the singer of mambo number five, which is not like a very latin song. It doesn't sound like a you know, a calvinist

197
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,640
 rhythm

198
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,880
 A lot of those names what I've never thought about a lot of those names are quite germanic as monica

199
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,840
 Angela, you know, they're quite unusual names, but helga

200
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,480
 A little bit of brunhilde in my head

201
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
 Yeah

202
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,640
 I think I know the oldest theme tune in the world

203
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,320
 Plansdown is almost a thousand years old the arches

204
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:11,280
 That's I mean, it's correct. He's won the money. What does what prizes you get a tea towel or something? It's the arches

205
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,200
 Oh, really? I was saying the arches is a very old show and

206
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,600
 It was a weird question because the joke answer is the same as the real answer in this

207
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,200
 This is something that was spotted by howard goodall in um, the story of music and he

208
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,320
 pointed out that there's a 12th century piece

209
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
 Which is a gregarian chant it was written we think about 1198

210
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
 It's a weed aren't omnis or weed aren't omnis

211
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,920
 And he is right if you listen to it it is very similar to

212
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,920
 Is a little bit more

213
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 Oh

214
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,960
 But it's there

215
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,760
 Isn't that exciting and then it sort of stuck around as a theme in various tunes through the centuries

216
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,880
 Rocked up in Prokofiev that start the 20th century and then

217
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
 Sought into the arches

218
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
 Do any of you I know one of you knows this who wrote the theme tune for eight out ten cats?

219
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,360
 Oh

220
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,400
 Rich there was it. It was one of the cats, wasn't it? It was someone from one of my favorite bands

221
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,760
 Oh, uh, oh steps so, um

222
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,280
 No, a band not as good as slips. Yeah, okay next best it was richard's brother that husband from swade

223
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,320
 Your brothers in sw- why didn't we get him on?

224
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,720
 That's cool, isn't it?

225
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,560
 He did that and uh, with with a guy called Alex league it was in strange love and swade now is in france and the machine

226
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,920
 Uh, and yeah, they put that together with it. It's fascinating to be there still makes money out of it today, obviously

227
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,200
 And cats does countdown which by and large is the countdown theme music

228
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,960
 But then continues with the drums for cats, but because it continues with that he still gets money from it's nice, isn't it?

229
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
 Yeah

230
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,320
 The guy who does weakest link makes millions millions upon millions upon millions

231
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,080
 We all know everyone knows that's the key is to write a jingle that's used as a theme tune and no one can ever do it

232
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
 It doesn't always work though. So for example in 1973

233
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,200
 I love this fact the theme tune to last of the summer wine was released as a as a pop single

234
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,840
 Well, certainly i'm it was released into the singles chart and I say into the chart it did not chart

235
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,960
 Um, yeah, I think that's adorable. Um, ronnie hazelhurst richard. I imagine you know his name

236
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,600
 He he came up with so many theme tunes. It was the bbc light entertainment music director

237
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,680
 Um, so I'll just list a few are you being served, uh, regi pair in yes minister

238
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,800
 Some others do have them the two ronnie's blankety blank generation game

239
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,200
 You could spend a whole evening watching bbc output and he would have done pretty much the whole thing

240
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,680
 but uh after

241
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,080
 Oh and he conducted the british and euro the british eurovision entry seven times in a row

242
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,560
 You know great great figure of musical composition

243
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:02,080
 But after he died several of his obituaries mentioned this amazing fact, which is that he also wrote s club seven's reach

244
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
 Well, no hang on he didn't he absolutely didn't

245
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,200
 It was just it had just been banged up onto his wikipedia page and that you know

246
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,000
 The times the independent the guardian all these papers just sloshed it right into their obituary

247
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,320
 He did not like reach of course they wrote all the wrong stuff didn't they s club seven

248
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,080
 Alan hawkshaw did countdown too

249
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,520
 And he it's really nice whenever you listen to countdown

250
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
 The theme tune is the sound of students being given grants because the royalties from

251
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,000
 It goes to underprivileged students that leads college of music

252
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,920
 If you listen to cats just count down you know that 50 percent of the money is going to underprivileged students

253
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,480
 50 percent is going into my brother's pocket

254
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:54,400
 Well, we do need to wrap up. Thank you so much richard. We've been dying to talk to you as a foursome
