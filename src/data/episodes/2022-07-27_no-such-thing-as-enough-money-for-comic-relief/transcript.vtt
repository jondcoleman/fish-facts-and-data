 Hi everyone welcome to a very special mini little episode of no such thing as a fish now if

 Anyway, I really hope you enjoy this little chat with Richard

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.080
 And I suppose on with the podcast

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:41.440
 Welcome back everyone it is time to move on to our next guest and boy do we have an exciting one

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.800
 We have someone who is I guess the biggest quizzing personality on TV

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.040
 You'll know him from house of games. You'll know him from pointless, but just as a sort of side project

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.960
 He's also become the best-selling fictional author to have a debut book out in the history of books

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.640
 That's his kind of side plate of things that he does

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 You'll know it as the Thursday murder club. We're so excited to have him here for fact number eight. It is Mr

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 Richard Osmond

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.320
 How are you? We are good. How is it going so far great cracking really?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.000
 It's we've raised 45,000 pounds since

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.680
 Since going which is very exciting. We had a target of 35,000 so we've exceeded that and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.100
 Yeah, if all your all your fans watching now

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.960
 Can contribute as well. We would be hugely grateful to be on 45,150

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.480
 Well, let's get into it. We understand you brought a fact so it's time for fact number eight and that is Richard Osmond

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.360
 I have brought a fact that it's it's it's who wants to be a millionaire related for reasons

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.260
 We will get on to but my fact is the man who wrote the theme tune so he wants to be a millionaire also wrote mistletoe and wine

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.960
 A gentleman called Keith Strachan

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.800
 He's been around for years and years. He's a musician musical director all sorts of things like that wrote mistletoe and wine from musical fun

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.760
 enough

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.640
 Cliff took hold of it so he won a live in the valley for it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.880
 But for years also rate theme music for sell a door

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.680
 So we do lots of ill remembered shows like talking telephone numbers

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.960
 And then you know one day gets the call saying that we're doing this pilot in a couple of days time

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.800
 It's this thing called who wants to be a millionaire. We're not happy with the song

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.120
 We've got which was written by Pete Waterman stock eighth in the water and so we're not happy with it

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 Is there anything you can do he sat down with his son put something together lots of sort of streams and stuff like that

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.560
 Couple of days later the pilot goes out that song is probably made in tens of millions

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.200
 Or theme tune in the history of television that they use the same thing tune around the world. Yeah

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.040
 Millionaire and and weakest link one of those shows that was always done as a kid apart

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.680
 I you buy you buy the look you buy the set you buy the graphics you buy the music

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.520
 She's not always the case. So yeah, every time it's played in America every time it's based on

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Keith Stratton is

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.920
 Like the millionaire theme it's not my lot not that melodic is it well, that's the thing you couldn't whistle it right no

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:26.660
 Yeah, I've heard that you are meant to be able to sing along to it and I can just about get the who wants to be

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.660
 What's to be a million?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.480
 Do little a little and I don't know if I'm seeing the right bit to the right. I don't think

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.220
 What I do is you've just made Keith Stratton seven and a half

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:48.880
 That part of it is based on the musical song who wants to be a millionaire is that I think that's the other part that he

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.240
 I kind of know that song when you say

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.960
 Those from Fiddler on the roof or something, but someone in the chat will know what it's from. Yeah

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.560
 Now normally we have sandy toxin tell us these things

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.040
 You don't know we shut down our computers

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.320
 I have to ring up my mum and ask her the answer the question

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.600
 That pilot of who wants to be a millionaire

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 Actually the first episode that went out. I think the pilot was broadcast

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.400
 It got 46 of the total tv audience at the time

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.680
 And I mean it was it was so huge Chris Tarrant said the day after the first episode went out

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.560
 Someone shouted at him from a passing lorry phone a friend and he said that happened every day for the next 15 years

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:52.000
 Host you barely go through three shows or that's someone looking nervous if they don't know an answer and saying can I phone a friend

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.240
 It's the goat

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.320
 When you sit in the makeup chair

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.800
 As well. So if you're if you're a new contestant you sit in the makeup chair

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800
 This is just if anyone ever goes on a quiz

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.280
 every single man

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.720
 Nervous of course sits down and says short back and sides, please

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.640
 Every single one and there's poor makeup artists happening up

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.760
 So many people watching who would have been one of those people rich

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.040
 Crying into that

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.080
 But I would do it as well, you know, you're nervous and so yeah

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.920
 Yeah, Richard do you get like people shouting things at you in the street like central african republic or

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.640
 Or what are the things but people always just shout the pointless to me in the street

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.560
 I'm aware that other people walking past you might not know who I am

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.880
 I've just seen someone

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.640
 If I get most off the pointless honestly, what it used to in these days

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.520
 It's it's it's the book in its house against but the thing I think I used to get more as much as pointless is people saying

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.840
 Oh count down

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.200
 you're like, oh

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.200
 really

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.000
 The Zondra and I you know, who are they so rich? Who do they think they think you're Susie Dentore?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.280
 Richard Whiteley?

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.240
 I think I know I don't think they really think I'm on count down. I think you have been on count down a couple of times

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.240
 So maybe they just really like that episode

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.600
 And so I've got hundreds of millions of viewers around the world

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.520
 We want Zondra wants to literally introduce the show. I'm Alexander Armstrong and welcome to count down

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:26.800
 Those are so exciting but the reason he did it is because the audition for count down

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.160
 and

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.320
 We were genuinely thinking because you know, he would he's obviously a brilliant comic actor and was doing the vital use for you all the time

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.600
 And we thought we'll never do a daytime show and then we got some info that he was doing an audition for count down

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.040
 And we thought well, if he's up for doing that then perhaps he'd be up for doing our show

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.760
 And so literally off the back of that we thought let's get him in and he came in and then then we had our house

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.920
 So we have count down

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.120
 Yeah, if he'll do a countdown he will do any daytime show that's nice

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.200
 What's your favorite theme tune Richard? You must have one

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.840
 Favorite theme tune is superstars. I would think from the uh from from the 70s

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.200
 Uh, it's you know, it's absolutely. I'm quite but you know if they play like theme tunes

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.880
 If you're watching university challenge or something and there's uh, you recognize all of them

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.240
 But you can I always think they're from kickstart. Um, but superstars is the one. Yeah, absolutely

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.400
 It's so brilliant. If you if you haven't heard it have have a little go and listen to it best show ever and best theme tune ever

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.600
 I learned the other day, uh, actually this was a few months ago

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.560
 But that the inspector gadget theme tune

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:38.480
 And the mysterious cities of gold theme tune and the he-man theme tune and jason the wheel warriors new overseas for people of a certain age

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.720
 We're all written by the same guy

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.320
 called shuki levy and he also wrote the israeli

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.920
 1981 eurovision song contest entry, which I haven't heard but you must be amazing, right because they are absolutely everyone is an

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.680
 Absolutely, thank you. Although it's going to gadget is just a big old plagiarism the same as sonic the hedgehog

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.760
 It's it's in fact a gadget goes

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:09.600
 Yeah, that's hall of the mountain king same as sonic the hedgehog. Oh, he's just slightly changed the timing. Uh, that's just hall of the mountain king

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.200
 He wants to be available there based on holster planets. Yeah, that's a particular

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.400
 Like stab of brass or stab of horns or something that yeah, he worked from

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.480
 I think a cool thing about the holster's planets the other day. I think it was for net tune

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.640
 um, they had

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.240
 The choir that's in the song fade out, but they weren't able to fade it out properly at the time

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.520
 And so what they did was they had the choir in a different room and they slowly closed the door

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.680
 And then once it was shut, yeah

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.200
 What is you know, again, if we uh, we're editing this this might not end up in the final show

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.360
 possibly not true

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.960
 Do you know my favorite um theme tune because of a fact is the seinfeld theme tune now

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.440
 I've always I've always loved it because I love seinfeld and the stand-up moment at the beginning

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.680
 So for anyone that doesn't remember it, it's like

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.920
 Baseline uh, but it was done on a synth what I didn't realize was that for the first I think it must have been eight series

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.320
 That theme tune was re-recorded for every single episode

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.600
 Because and it makes total sense seinfeld is doing stand-up. There are different beats to where his joke is going to land each time

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.680
 So this guy used to get sent the footage of the latest stand-up bit going at the front of seinfeld

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.760
 And he would live jam the theme tune for every single episode

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.440
 Put all those moments in when he could see seinfeld coming to a beat in the joke

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.720
 It's something like 200 episodes that he've re-wrote it for every single time. He must have got tired of that tune

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.040
 Could you tell at the end it was losing some of its vigor?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:56.320
 That's like when the circus when you used to see dancing horses dancing to the music

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.640
 And you think how do they get the horses to dance to the music?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:05.360
 They don't they play the music to match whatever the hell the horses are doing that seinfeld is the horse in that scenario

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.840
 Yeah, and I can't believe you've just ruined that magic for children in the 1950s

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:19.360
 He went to the circus but still my favorite scene tune is also the most well-known piece of music in the uk apparently

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.480
 According to a 2000. I think it was 2008 poll actually

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.600
 EastEnders

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.520
 Correct must be EastEnders there and that beat god save the queen into number two

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.840
 But I didn't realize very neat EastEnders fact. It has a spin-off called julius theme written by one of the EastEnders

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.200
 Creators and that's when you know when you get an ending which is a bit more poignant and it doesn't really suit the boom boom boom

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.360
 And then julius theme comes in and it comes in about once a year

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.680
 Oh

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.800
 If you get a julius theme that must be a big moment as an east ender that's it

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.040
 Of course, Elita Dobson had a big hit they put lyrics to the east enders theme tune

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.480
 Anyone can fall in love and Elita Dobson who's Angie had a pit with it on top of the pops and all sorts of things

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.280
 Back in those days you had eight sides and b-sides and I wonder what the b-sides of that must have been

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.280
 They used to um if you used to watch bullseye back in the day at the very end

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.600
 They would throw the darts and try and win the big prize

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.520
 And if they won the prize they would have the theme tune and if they lost the prize

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.840
 They would have the same theme tune but in a minor key

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.520
 A little bit slower

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:30.560
 So sometimes they release the the themes and they they chart

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.760
 Um, can you think of the highest charting tv teams? You never it's gonna be a kids show, right?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.160
 It's got to be like Barney or builder or I've got suit for you right here. I bet theme from match

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.960
 Was number one suicide is painless. Yeah

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.320
 And another number one with eye levels. I think was found of all so there's a couple for you right there

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.480
 Okay, I've got an answer for you all anyway

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.400
 And it's going to divide opinion

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200
 It's going to divide the room because you've named a lot of songs that went to number one

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.560
 So it's clearly a dead tie

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:05.120
 But a million people in 1997 bought the tally tubby's theme tune. I believe that's in the uk

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.520
 I was one of them. Really?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.600
 Were you on that?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.160
 See I was a student at the time and that's that was the demographic for the show. So it was um

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.000
 But bob the builder was which dan I think dan mentioned

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.320
 Yeah, I said bob the builder bob the builder not only had a huge number one hit

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.400
 I think second only to tally tubbies

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.640
 But bob the builder released a version of mambo number five which also sold 400 000 copies

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.760
 So sorry, did bob the builder rewrote mambo number five?

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.280
 Yeah

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.160
 And changed the lyrics because it's still non-child friendly. The lyrics are the same. It's all about women. Bob is accused

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.560
 These are sexy man. Everyone's got to build a fantasy, you know

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.640
 Okay, so on mambo number five that was the theme tune to something else

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.280
 Um, which I always love this fact that was a theme tune to one of bill clinton's democratic conventions

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.280
 In the early 90s

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.880
 Do you and it was it was set to be like the proper walk-in walk-out music until someone pointed out at the last minute

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.440
 That it did contain the line a little bit of monica in my life

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:18.560
 Wow, that's an oversight, isn't it from me? You know, Lou Baker. Yeah. Yeah, did you know where he's from?

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.280
 Oh, damn. He's german, isn't he? He's german

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.880
 I mean, I just didn't know he was did you did any all right? Can we count richard out for a second?

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.240
 Did you guys know he was german? I don't fully know who he is

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.160
 Well, it's the singer of mambo number five, which is not like a very latin song. It doesn't sound like a you know, a calvinist

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.640
 rhythm

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:46.880
 A lot of those names what I've never thought about a lot of those names are quite germanic as monica

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.840
 Angela, you know, they're quite unusual names, but helga

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.480
 A little bit of brunhilde in my head

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.680
 Yeah

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.640
 I think I know the oldest theme tune in the world

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.320
 Plansdown is almost a thousand years old the arches

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:11.280
 That's I mean, it's correct. He's won the money. What does what prizes you get a tea towel or something? It's the arches

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.200
 Oh, really? I was saying the arches is a very old show and

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.600
 It was a weird question because the joke answer is the same as the real answer in this

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:27.200
 This is something that was spotted by howard goodall in um, the story of music and he

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.320
 pointed out that there's a 12th century piece

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.680
 Which is a gregarian chant it was written we think about 1198

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.240
 It's a weed aren't omnis or weed aren't omnis

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.920
 And he is right if you listen to it it is very similar to

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.920
 Is a little bit more

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.080
 Oh

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.960
 But it's there

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.760
 Isn't that exciting and then it sort of stuck around as a theme in various tunes through the centuries

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.880
 Rocked up in Prokofiev that start the 20th century and then

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.880
 Sought into the arches

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.120
 Do any of you I know one of you knows this who wrote the theme tune for eight out ten cats?

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.360
 Oh

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.400
 Rich there was it. It was one of the cats, wasn't it? It was someone from one of my favorite bands

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.760
 Oh, uh, oh steps so, um

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:21.280
 No, a band not as good as slips. Yeah, okay next best it was richard's brother that husband from swade

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.320
 Your brothers in sw- why didn't we get him on?

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:32.720
 That's cool, isn't it?

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.560
 He did that and uh, with with a guy called Alex league it was in strange love and swade now is in france and the machine

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.920
 Uh, and yeah, they put that together with it. It's fascinating to be there still makes money out of it today, obviously

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.200
 And cats does countdown which by and large is the countdown theme music

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.960
 But then continues with the drums for cats, but because it continues with that he still gets money from it's nice, isn't it?

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.400
 Yeah

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.320
 The guy who does weakest link makes millions millions upon millions upon millions

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:06.080
 We all know everyone knows that's the key is to write a jingle that's used as a theme tune and no one can ever do it

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.440
 It doesn't always work though. So for example in 1973

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.200
 I love this fact the theme tune to last of the summer wine was released as a as a pop single

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.840
 Well, certainly i'm it was released into the singles chart and I say into the chart it did not chart

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.960
 Um, yeah, I think that's adorable. Um, ronnie hazelhurst richard. I imagine you know his name

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.600
 He he came up with so many theme tunes. It was the bbc light entertainment music director

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.680
 Um, so I'll just list a few are you being served, uh, regi pair in yes minister

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.800
 Some others do have them the two ronnie's blankety blank generation game

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.200
 You could spend a whole evening watching bbc output and he would have done pretty much the whole thing

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.680
 but uh after

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.080
 Oh and he conducted the british and euro the british eurovision entry seven times in a row

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.560
 You know great great figure of musical composition

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:02.080
 But after he died several of his obituaries mentioned this amazing fact, which is that he also wrote s club seven's reach

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.320
 Well, no hang on he didn't he absolutely didn't

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.200
 It was just it had just been banged up onto his wikipedia page and that you know

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.000
 The times the independent the guardian all these papers just sloshed it right into their obituary

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.320
 He did not like reach of course they wrote all the wrong stuff didn't they s club seven

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.080
 Alan hawkshaw did countdown too

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.520
 And he it's really nice whenever you listen to countdown

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.360
 The theme tune is the sound of students being given grants because the royalties from

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.000
 It goes to underprivileged students that leads college of music

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.920
 If you listen to cats just count down you know that 50 percent of the money is going to underprivileged students

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.480
 50 percent is going into my brother's pocket

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:54.400
 Well, we do need to wrap up. Thank you so much richard. We've been dying to talk to you as a foursome
