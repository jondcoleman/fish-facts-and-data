00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,360
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,120
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntermari and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,080
 around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,840
 here we go. Starting with you Chazinski. My fact this week is that the dome of the Taj Mahal is

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 held together with sugar, fruit juice and egg white. It's actually just a pudding recipe that they

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,240
 accidentally turned into muslim. This is also with bricks. There are conventional building materials

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,760
 in there as well, so it's actually a mixture of lime, which is probably delicious. Yeah, I'm

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,080
 sounding more and more like a kaipere in here. Yeah, sorry, it's the other kind of lime,

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,160
 you know, the one they build buildings with. Lime stone. Quick lime. Lime and it's mixed together

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,640
 with fruit juice and sugar and egg and it's called tuna. C-H-U-N-A, it's all very food stuffy,

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,080
 I know, with some shells, bits of shells and some gum and yeah, this was the plaster that's used

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,000
 on the inside of the dome of the Taj Mahal to hold it all together and it actually turns out that

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
 egg white especially was quite a common building material. But this is used in lots of places? Yeah,

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,480
 I think so. So I heard something in passing on the radio and I ended up looking into egg whites

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,600
 in buildings and there's quite a lot on it in like vaguely obscure books, so there's an essay

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,280
 by a Filipino food researcher who has an essay called "Eggs in Philippine Church Architecture"

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,080
 and it's cuisine, as if cuisine is just a leftover. I reckon that you're the only person who's

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:58,080
 ever read that book. It's gotta be right. It's about Filipino churches. What's her name? Give her a

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,640
 shout out. She's called "Peer Lim Castillo." It's not obscure however if you're a devout chef

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,560
 in the Philippines, it's like a massive seller in that community maybe. And also if you are

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,440
 Filipino and you know about traditional Filipino recipes, this is really interesting. A lot of them

23
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
 contain just egg yolks. So in a lot of traditional Filipino food it's just egg yolk and that's

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,360
 because they had so much leftover egg yolks. Millions and millions of egg whites were big used to

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,320
 build their churches. This is for centuries, absolutely true. So there's traditional food like

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,360
 Briosh, a thing called Yema which is egg yolk sweets and it's just because there's loads of egg yolk

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 lying around. That sounds extremely untrue, doesn't it? That's amazing. Take it out with "Peer Lim Castillo."

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,280
 So here's a fact. The Taj Mahal was built by 22,000 workers and it took 17 years to complete.

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,840
 And 22,000 workers is the same number of workers as Facebook has and they've been going for 14 years.

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,360
 Wow. That is very good. They also had a thousand elephants working in construction. I don't know if

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,400
 they're sorry I'm talking about the Taj Mahal now, not Facebook. Yeah they did, didn't they?

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
 Dragging all the building materials and I think they had some elephants operating pulleys.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,920
 Those are the especially trusted elephants that were working the pulley system.

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,440
 Because I don't fully understand pulleys. Pulleys are a really simple concept. God, if you don't

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,760
 understand pulleys, I do worry about what else you're missing. And there was a story wasn't there that

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,360
 they cut off all the sculptors' hands after they built it. And so they couldn't build anything else.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,000
 Really? Yeah. Do they tell you that? The start of the gig? Probably not. Ironically, they do ask

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,320
 you to sign something at the beginning and then there's no room for us. But what if they made a mistake

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,600
 and of course they said, "Oh dear, we're going to have to get the second gallery redone." Can you

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,840
 get the guys who made the second gallery in? They turn up. Sorry. Yeah, I don't think they actually did

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,160
 do that. There's also a theory that they blinded them so they wouldn't be able to build anything

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,360
 as beautiful. But that kind of myth is for lots of different buildings like St. Basil's in Moscow,

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,720
 has the same myth. I have my place, I have my flat repainted recently. I did the same thing at the end

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,920
 of it. You know, I cut my bike's hands off and I blinded him and yeah. There was also a tale that

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,000
 they use brick scaffolding, that's not a tale, that's true, which was quite unusual. They usually would

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,920
 use like bamboo or something. But it was said that they did it to conceal what was happening as they

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,280
 built it. So it would be a big surprise when it came down. And then there was another thing. The

48
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,880
 brick scaffolding, Shah Jahan, who was the Emperor, who commissioned the whole thing and it was a

49
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
 Muslim for his favourite wife. He was told that the brick scaffolding would take five years to

50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,520
 dismantle. And so he had the bright idea of telling the workers that if they dismantled it as

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
 fast as they could, they could keep whatever bricks they removed. And it came down overnight.

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
 Supposedly, he tried to tell me that it was like made of delicious chocolate.

53
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,000
 Is it true? Have you guys heard about the architecture being angled at such a case and built

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
 in such a way that should it topple over, it would fall perfectly away from the tomb itself?

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
 Well, supposedly the minarets, there are four minarets around the outside and supposedly they

56
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
 are angled to fall outward rather than inwards. But I would presume that they're just built not to

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,120
 fall over. I think we're building in a structural floor that meant that they only fall over in one

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
 direction. Yeah, I know. But at the same time, you've made half your building with eggs and flour

59
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,040
 and fruit juice. So you know how we were saying that it was built for his favourite wife?

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,880
 So it was what's his name again? Shah Jahan, it was his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal,

61
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,480
 that it was built for. But there is a Muslim for his first wife on the other side of the river,

62
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,240
 which I've seen a picture of it and it's currently covered in black mold and cats.

63
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,000
 Black mold and cats? Yeah, just cats everywhere. Oh, just they're there, not covered in cats.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
 It's just full of cats. Was she a cat person? Well, that's what they say now.

65
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,560
 The locals say, well, the whole of the cats are here because she was such a lover of cats.

66
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,880
 She's also a black mold person. That's quite cool though, just I read about how they clean

67
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,320
 the Taj Mahal. So that one's covered in black mold. That one needs a cleaning. But the Taj Mahal,

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,040
 in order to clean it, they don't do a classic sort of water-based clean. They give it a mud bath,

69
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,880
 effectively. It's like a spa treatment, and that gives it the glistening white. Wow, and then

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,560
 I was asked to follow. You have put some cucumber on it. That's why there are no lights allowed

71
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,320
 on it at night. You're not allowed to have big spotlights lighting it up because it would look

72
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,560
 beautiful at night, but they don't do that because that would attract insects, which would then poo

73
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,200
 all over it. And these particular insects, poo green. And that's partly why it's been looking

74
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,240
 a bit grubby in recent years. Oh, yeah. It's just constantly battling against excretion from insects.

75
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,040
 What an error. Yeah, an error pollution is getting so bad now that they think the mud bath is not

76
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,600
 enough now. They're going to have a shower post mud bath. I was looking to some stuff about building

77
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,880
 materials. I thought this was really interesting. So first of all, hair is added to plaster to make it

78
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,360
 stronger. And actually, you will have seen this. So it genuinely adds proper extra strength. It's

79
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
 added to lime plaster. So any bit of lime plaster has got lots of hair running for it. You can order

80
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,440
 horse or goat or cow hair from just construction suppliers companies. And actually, if you imagine

81
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,920
 like a broken off bit of plaster, you know, because I don't see little threads coming out, that I always

82
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,880
 thought, I don't know, it's a dust that it all got together. That's just actual hair. Yeah,

83
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,960
 looking like broken off plaster. And then there's, you'll see the goat hair. Isn't that weird?

84
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,200
 That's very weird. Yeah. Also, sugar is used as a concrete retarder, which is a thing that stops

85
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,040
 concrete from solidifying too fast. So if you need to properly shape concrete, you pour it down. And

86
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,720
 maybe it's like a particularly hot day. So it will bake really fast. If you add lots of sugar to it,

87
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,160
 which a lot of builders do, then that slows down the setting process. That is why builders always want

88
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,040
 lots of sugar in their tea. They then whip it out so they can stick it in the concrete. Have you

89
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,080
 heard of the English equivalent of the Taj Mahal? It's a memorial to a wife by a grieving husband.

90
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,800
 And it's this thing called the Eleanor Crosses. Oh, yeah. So there's, yeah? Oh, yeah. There's one

91
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,640
 just down the road. Yes, exactly. So they were built by Edward I in 1290. Queen Eleanor died,

92
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,200
 and he wanted to commemorate her, and she died up in Nottinghamshire, and he commissioned a huge

93
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,400
 spire cross. Everywhere her funeral procession stopped on the way from Nottinghamshire to London,

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,200
 he commissioned one of these huge crosses. So there were 12 of them. There are only three remaining.

95
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,680
 And outside Charing Cross, there's a restored Victorian replica. And it looks very cool, like a

96
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,880
 little space needle. It's got three statues of a woman. And it was Eleanor of Castile, wasn't it?

97
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,920
 Yes. That's why. Yeah. And she had a triple burial. There's a rare. So her heart was buried at Black

98
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,280
 Friars Station. I think it was something else before it was Black Friars Station. Why?

99
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,000
 They've just renovated Black Friars Station, haven't they? Oh, yeah. I wonder if they found

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
 the heart when they were doing that. Maybe. Yeah. You probably missed that, wouldn't you,

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,000
 with your big truck. I don't think you'd spot a shriveled 1,000-year-old heart.

102
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,960
 But maybe it helps the concrete to set. It does. That's why it has to put a heart in every crack.

103
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,160
 And her organs went to Lincoln Cathedral and her body went to Westminster Robbie.

104
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
 So where would you go to grieve at her grave site? Where was closest, I guess.

105
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,280
 Guess that's not the true convenience of it. A good point. I think you would go to Black Friars

106
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,840
 because of the heart. And easy train connection.

107
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,840
 OK, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that there is an ice

108
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,560
 golf championship held each year in Greenland, 600 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. However,

109
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,600
 because of the constantly shifting ice shelf, no players hold any records on that course

110
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,200
 because it changes on a daily basis. It's not nuts. So there must be no guide as to how to play the

111
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,480
 course well. Is that right? There's a lot of guidance on how to play it well because it's you're

112
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
 playing on icy terrain. You're allowed things that you're not allowed in a normal game of golf.

113
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,400
 For example, you're allowed to clear the path. Like in curling. Yes, exactly. You can, yeah, you can

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,480
 sort of just make it nice and a bit softer. The par is much higher. I don't really play golf or

115
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,760
 understand the rules. So it's a par of 36 per hole. Wow. OK. So in normal golf, you wouldn't go

116
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,040
 above five. Right. Wow. You sure it's 36. Sorry. It's it's maximum handicap of 36. Ah, OK. It's

117
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,040
 different. That basically means that you get more shots taken off. Right. Basically. Oh, OK.

118
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,760
 All right. Otherwise the par of 36 will just be so tediously long. Golf's tedious enough anyway.

119
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,800
 Imagine if it was 36 shots per hole. I mean, is that what we're going to say that golf's tedious?

120
00:10:50,800 --> 00:11:00,400
 I've got some stuff about that. So just a bit of explanation about this. This is played in a town called

121
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,240
 a set up by a man called Arnie Nyman. He's a hotel manager. And it's this tiny, tiny town. It's got

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,840
 it's got, you know, just over a thousand residents. There's more dogs there than there are people by

123
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,480
 factor of three to one at least because you get everywhere by dog sledding. That's the motor

124
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,160
 transport. So yeah. And so he set this up in 1997. It's an annual event, except for when it's

125
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,840
 too cold and the course has to be closed because it's just too icy and impossible and you'd get frostbite

126
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,080
 the moment you step out. Maybe if it got too hot, they'd have to cancel it as well. Yeah, that's true.

127
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,800
 Yeah. And the ball is red, isn't it? The ball is red so that they can see it. The the hole that

128
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,480
 you hit the ball into is twice the size. So there's lots of different rules that get played. But

129
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,200
 it's seen by golfers. I know you're a golfer and you probably didn't know about it necessarily

130
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,600
 beforehand. But a lot of golfers talk about it as the craziest course you could ever play. So

131
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,040
 they actively fly out to this remote place to yeah, to be a part of this odd game. And it has

132
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
 all the holes are a bit closer together because the cold air is more dense and so there's more drag.

133
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,880
 So I didn't realize this and the golf balls move a bit slower through cold air. That does happen.

134
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,240
 If you play golf, you know that when the cold weather's on, it just doesn't go as far.

135
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,400
 I play golf once in the Himalayas where the air is really thin and it just goes miles really.

136
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,040
 That's the best place to play golf. Is it not having to tussle its way through a load of air molecules?

137
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,640
 All the molecules. That's it. The molecules get in the way. Well, this is what's confusing because

138
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,000
 cold air is more dense because the molecules aren't moving as fast. So there's more drag. But you

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,520
 would have thought as you say, want to get an altitude and it's cold because there are just fewer

140
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,920
 air molecules. It must move faster because they get in the way. So it moves slower through some

141
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,320
 cold air, but then faster altitude sounds like. This is why golf is such an interesting game.

142
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,000
 Is this what the commentary's like? I'm a bother to turn it on.

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,920
 You know the, I was reading about the dimples inside the golf balls. That doesn't really have

144
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,960
 a proper science to it. It's just, what do you mean by that? What do you mean it works outside the

145
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,200
 laws of physics? No, I guess you would look at any sort of sporting equipment and you would assume

146
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,440
 that the design and the shape was for a specific purpose and tests. And it sounds like original

147
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,680
 golf balls didn't have any of these dimples, but golf players prefer to play with ones that had

148
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,400
 little indentations on them. But as far as I know, but you might know better, there's no exact

149
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,040
 reason why it's that many dimples. No, I don't know why it is. It's easier to pick up a golf ball

150
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
 with dimples than it is to pick up a golf ball without dimples. Yeah, they're like finger holes.

151
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,920
 If you're a little appucian. But then ping pong balls are easy to pick up. Yeah, I don't find that

152
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,080
 actually. I find ping pong balls almost impossible. You should play with sticky gloves. That's good idea.

153
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,920
 But then you'd never let it go for the serve. What would it be a problem? What I do is I put the ball

154
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,840
 on a bit of string. Actually, this is all the problem. I think you would get my grip on the balls

155
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,280
 to get spin on it. Yeah. And there might be a thing about bortices, but I just, you know, I don't know

156
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,400
 what that is. Okay, James, here's a question. Have you found that golf has been getting harder?

157
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,520
 Because you've been playing for some years. How many years would you say you've been playing?

158
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:23,600
 30. Wow. Okay, so supposedly development. You've been playing since you were 32. It's just a

159
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:34,240
 joke about your being old. Sorry. Yeah, I actually got the hurtful comment. Sorry. So supposedly

160
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
 developers have been building at longer and harder courses because professionals were getting

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,880
 really good in the 90s and 2000s. And I think there was a conflation between pros playing on courses

162
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,000
 and amateurs. The equipment's a lot better though. Right. Just to be. Yeah, so apparently they're

163
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,840
 allowed with quite hard courses now these days. And people who might not want a very hard game of

164
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,680
 golf are saying, oh, I can't be bothered with that. Is that right? I don't know. There's a theory.

165
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,680
 It's hard for me to remember back so long. Well, I started playing. It was just sticks of wood

166
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,240
 and golf ball stuff with duck feathers. And I remember on the first round, they said to

167
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,360
 Mary Queen of Scots. We should put dimples into these balls. Do you guys know about the most

168
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,400
 southerly golf club in the world? No, of course. So this is called Scott Based Country Club and it's

169
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,720
 13 degrees above the South Pole. And if so, there are a lot of scuba birds around. So if you have your

170
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,080
 ball stolen by a scuba, you get a one shot penalty, which seems harsh. They're always stealing the balls.

171
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,360
 It does seem hard. Yeah. But if you hit one, it counts as a birdie. So it's the one instance where

172
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,280
 if you hit a bird, you get a birdie. I think that sounds cruel though. Do you mean hit it while it's

173
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,840
 trying to steal your ball or you hit it as part of a hit and it's in the sky? No, it's part of a hit

174
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,200
 in the sky. I don't think you see it trying to steal your ball, then you attack it with your golf.

175
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,560
 What happens when you do that? Because you don't want the penalty? No, you get arrested, I don't know.

176
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,880
 Ah, okay. This is a confusing game. I mean, you could just try and hit the skewer bird into the golf

177
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,600
 ball hole, but it's probably too big. It's a ball hole. We really don't know the sport too,

178
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,160
 what's the name of it? It's called a hole. Interesting. It's good for the expert for once.

179
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,440
 I heard tell, James, of a thing about golf. I read that until January this year,

180
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,560
 you were allowed to ring up a tournament if you were watching at home and report a rule violation.

181
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,000
 I know that that happened last year. Yeah, and they've just brought it to an end. Have they?

182
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
 Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Lots of the tours have come together and said,

183
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,640
 guys, stop phoning in. We'll just have some officials watching you know. But this used to be a major

184
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,480
 thing. And also, if you committed a mistake and someone phoned it in, and you didn't know,

185
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
 you would then, at the end of the day or the end of the round, you fill in a scorecard, don't you?

186
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,320
 And there's a penalty for filling in a scorecard incorrectly. Yeah. So you get the penalty for

187
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,840
 making a mistake, which you didn't know you made. Yeah. And then you get a double penalty for

188
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,920
 filling in your scorecard role. Exactly. There's so much. It's just qualified from tournaments.

189
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,800
 I think Lexi Thompson had that done to her. Yes. Yeah. I read that too. That's not fair as the skewer bird

190
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,480
 thing. Yeah. Could you imagine if someone ragged in and goes, I'm pretty sure you hit that skewer bird.

191
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,840
 Do you, James, as a former accountant, do you prefer golf for the admin side of things or for

192
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,520
 the sport itself? Or does it combine the two loves? It's my two loves. Yeah. Sparta and admin. Wow.

193
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,320
 Filling in that form. Yeah. What's crunching numbers a lot of the time? Well, it's mostly just

194
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,160
 adding one every time you hit a ball. Apparently, apparently a lot of high-end professionals can't even

195
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:40,320
 manage to do that. Yeah. Ormanak, this place, just wanted to tiny little facts about this very,

196
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,960
 very small place. They have notable people. With for such a tiny little town, you would think that

197
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,800
 wouldn't be the case, but Miss Greenland was from from that place. Ormanak, she's married to an actor

198
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,360
 called Nicola Costa Waldo, who you would know better as Jamie Lannister from the Game of Thrones.

199
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,520
 Yeah. TV shows. So, yeah, Jamie Lannister's wife is from this very tiny town where ice golf has played.

200
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,560
 Yeah. That's my fact. That's a good fact. Yeah. Well, you know, it's a very tiny, tiny place. Lots of ice

201
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,240
 and game of thrones. Lots of ice, yes. Yeah. Winter is always there. It has come. Not much golf.

202
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,000
 Well, we haven't seen the last series yet. Very true. They're going to have to put a lot of golf to

203
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
 make up for the deficit the last year series. Wouldn't it be great if the last series is just golf by

204
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,360
 all the characters? It would be amazing. I might start watching. And then whoever wins a golf

205
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,080
 ton of it gets the throw. Yeah, it'd be brilliant. Perfect. Did I money's on Brianna of Taf? Oh, good

206
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,160
 for the Game of Thrones. But then Cersei Lannister gets penalised because she illegally moved the ball when

207
00:18:48,160 --> 00:19:01,920
 no was looking. A scuba bird dies. That's a grand finale. Okay, it's time for fact number three,

208
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,520
 and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century, you could be executed in

209
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:15,120
 France for wearing stripes because they were the clothing of the devil. There was a cobbler in

210
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,640
 the town of Ruan, and he was also part of the local clergy, and apparently he got caught in

211
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,480
 stripe clothes and he got condemned to death. It's such an easy condemned to death to avoid,

212
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,560
 isn't it? I'd have to really, really like stripes. You are wearing stripes today. That's true,

213
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,920
 but that's only because I'm not in 14th century France. Yeah, I'd just wear something plain. So I read

214
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,880
 this in a review in the New York Times of a book called The Devil's Cloth, A History of Stripes and

215
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,360
 Striped Fabric by Michelle Pastaro, and it looks like an amazing book from the review, I gotta say.

216
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,880
 And they think that maybe it was from the Bible. In the Bible, it says, you will not wear upon yourself

217
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,520
 a garment that is made from two, and maybe in medieval France, they thought that meant you

218
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,400
 can't wear stripes, and so they would send you to death if you did. It's such an extreme reaction

219
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,600
 against something relatively, what we think is innocuous. Supposedly that even Zebra's,

220
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,480
 I also read the same review that Zebra's were included in Satan's Bestiary, as they were thought

221
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,080
 to be a satanic animal. So was all Zebra's were put to death? That's right. That's why we don't

222
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,920
 have any Zebra's anymore. That's correct, they used to be huge in France. No, they would make

223
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,440
 bestories, wouldn't they? And they put the animals in different places in the books, and the Zebra's

224
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,520
 would be in the evil part. Such a, it's so mean to animal to just call them evil for their reason.

225
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,000
 I guess we still do it a bit. But it seems like 14th century France was just you would be executed

226
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,040
 for a lot of things that would seem ridiculous. You would be executed if you were a naughty pig.

227
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,400
 For example, like pigs were taken to court, actual animal pigs, and tried in court,

228
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,600
 although we do execute pigs now. Yeah, even the nice ones. Yeah, but we don't take them to court.

229
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,560
 No. To charge them. We don't have lawyers. They deserve a trial.

230
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:11,280
 You're right. Actually, we've gone worse. That's true. Bacon's going to get a lot rarer if every

231
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
 pig has to go through a full judicial process. The appeals process is much like that.

232
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,520
 It's weird that stripes have often been negative associations though, because stripes

233
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,240
 obviously were the attire of prisoners for since the 19th century. That was seen as a badge of shame.

234
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,200
 In fact, it was so much so that by the mid-20th century, prisoners would stop wearing stripes,

235
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,080
 and that's where the jumpsuit came on the all-one colour jumpsuit, because it was kind of unfair,

236
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,920
 because it was so associated with this shameful thing. And weirdly, they are coming back in.

237
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,440
 I think maybe it's a sign of the direction that America is going in, but because it shows

238
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,680
 you're tough on crime, if you introduce stripes, because it's a proper badge of "I'm a prisoner."

239
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,520
 So it's like stripes of the new orange, which is a new black stripe of the orange, absolutely right?

240
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,760
 Supposedly, the stripes in prison's thing is not connected to this 14th-century France thing,

241
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,440
 as in the author of this book, Mr. Pasteurot, just has found no direct link, so there's no guarantee.

242
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
 But prostitutes used to wear stripes. And jugglers?

243
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,840
 Prostitutes and jugglers. Prostitutes. Too much dangerous groups in society.

244
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,720
 Clowns, hangmen, lepers. It's a mixed face, isn't it? Hangmen and clowns.

245
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,280
 Is this breadin or is this France? This is going to be Europe, you should think.

246
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,240
 So you've got prostitutes, jugglers, clowns, hangmen, lepers, cripples, heretics,

247
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,560
 Jews, Africans, bastards and the condemned. Wow. Did you book the clown for a random party?

248
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,680
 No, but I got a condemned man, a leper, and a bastard.

249
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,440
 Yeah, it's all people who have outside society, wasn't it? That was kind of...

250
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
 Jugglers, come on.

251
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,560
 Juggling is not a normal social profession.

252
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,520
 Imagine that. I tell you what, if you've got condemned to death for juggling,

253
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
 then that's an easier thing not to do than wearing stripes.

254
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,760
 It is very easy not to do.

255
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,680
 Oh, my God. If you accidentally dropped something, and then you caught it just as it was falling.

256
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:21,280
 Death. I like that in France, in the 14th century, they tried to band those long-toed shoes

257
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,160
 that you see almost as parodies. This is my favourite fact ever.

258
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,360
 Because they band specifically band shoes shaped like penises.

259
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,960
 Because they got bigger and bigger and bigger, and more pointy and pointy and pointy.

260
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,920
 And then someone thought, "I'm going to make mine look like a penis."

261
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,480
 And then they were like, "We're going to have to put a stop to this."

262
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
 I think it's so good.

263
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,800
 You don't get shoes shaped like penises now, do you?

264
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,640
 No. So they did. It worked.

265
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,240
 So the long-pointy shoe thing, they tried to band that in France.

266
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,120
 And in England, you could get them in the 14th century as long as two feet

267
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,240
 in length, that sort of long point.

268
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,960
 And they were very fashionable and cool, but they were never practical if you had to

269
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,840
 suddenly make a dash, you know, if someone was chasing you or whatever.

270
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
 So what they used to do is if they knew that they were in trouble,

271
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,400
 they would cut off the fronts of them, and then they would dash off.

272
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
 Nice, like a lizard.

273
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,560
 Yeah, exactly.

274
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,280
 So cool.

275
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,200
 Yeah, that's amazing.

276
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,640
 You couldn't have a mullet either in the 13th century.

277
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,760
 You couldn't have an Irish hairstyle, which it turns out Irish hairstyles were having

278
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
 the top of your head shaved and then a long head down at the bottom.

279
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,520
 Wow. Like a mullet.

280
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,320
 Like a bullet.

281
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,760
 Like a bullet.

282
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,040
 A bold mullet.

283
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,400
 Like a bold mullet.

284
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,760
 Oh, yeah, I thought that a mullet, that was a name for the bold head.

285
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,440
 No, a mullet was more like shot on top and long at the back.

286
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
 Whereas a completely bold on top.

287
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
 Like the Bill Bailey style.

288
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,800
 Why weren't you allowed an Irish hairstyle?

289
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,880
 It was a classic kind of racism, you know, they thought the Irish were a bit barbaric,

290
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,080
 and then they had this weird hairstyle.

291
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,160
 So don't do the hairstyle otherwise you're a barbarian.

292
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,200
 They had something this week where there's a school that's banned them,

293
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,520
 meet me at McDonald's haircut, which is the opposite of that.

294
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,080
 A mullet is like kind of curly and long on top and then shaved on the sides.

295
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,920
 That all the kids have.

296
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,360
 Why is it called meet me at McDonald's?

297
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
 I don't think anyone knows.

298
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,960
 I think actually people under the age of 20 know.

299
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,160
 And then people of our age are just like, why do they call it that?

300
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,840
 And they're refusing to tell us.

301
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,880
 In the Elizabethan era, only royalty could wear leopard.

302
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,560
 Leopard skin.

303
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,000
 Completely limited to royalty.

304
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
 Yeah, I mean, there weren't many, there weren't thousands of leopards around,

305
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,560
 which, you know, depends on the availability of leopards.

306
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,200
 That's really good.

307
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,080
 Yeah, and Yomans wives, there was, there were, due to these summary laws,

308
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,400
 Yomans wives were only allowed to wear lamb, rabbit, fox, or cat for nothing else.

309
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
 The leopard is a type of cat.

310
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
 Oh yeah.

311
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,360
 I'm just saying, if I was a Yoman and my wife wanted to wear leopard,

312
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,160
 I'd let her wear leopard and then just argue.

313
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,200
 Well, she'd be arrested and put in prison and she'd blame you.

314
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
 Because she said, are you sure I'm okay to wear this outside?

315
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
 And you said, yeah, it's officially a cat.

316
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,680
 Yeah.

317
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,520
 They'll find that out in 500 years.

318
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
 Maybe.

319
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,440
 How terrible husband.

320
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,880
 (laughs)

321
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:27,600
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

322
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,760
 My fact is that Victorian Britain had such a fern mania for so many years

323
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,240
 that some species were almost completely wiped out.

324
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,920
 Yeah.

325
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,800
 There was this massive fern craze and it lasted 50 years.

326
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,200
 Victorian Britain, all the other stuff they did,

327
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
 they were basically just killing time in between collecting more ferns.

328
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,680
 So people would go on these huge collecting parties into the countryside

329
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,920
 and they collect ferns for their homes and there were so many collectors going out

330
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,240
 that there's one species called the Kilani fern

331
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,680
 which was almost wiped out in the UK and it's barely clung on to survival.

332
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,360
 So it was a huge problem.

333
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
 Well, it was a problem but on the other hand,

334
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,760
 they were doing lots of crossbreeding.

335
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
 So they invented a whole load of new species.

336
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,120
 So actually by the end there were more species than where you started.

337
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
 That's cool.

338
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,120
 Yeah.

339
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
 So for example,

340
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,520
 custard creams, the biscuits.

341
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,160
 Yeah.

342
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,280
 They have ferns on them.

343
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
 You know that curly design on a custard cream.

344
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,520
 Yeah.

345
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,480
 That's a fern.

346
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,280
 Yeah, it's so good.

347
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,160
 From fern mania days.

348
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,280
 From fern mania days.

349
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,800
 Is that...

350
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
 This isn't actually that useful for a podcast

351
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,120
 but I think we've got a fern in this very room haven't we?

352
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,760
 Is that a fern?

353
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,480
 Is that a fern?

354
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,280
 I don't think it is a fern.

355
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,240
 I don't think it is a fern.

356
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
 It looks like just a pot plant for me.

357
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,120
 Because ferns have got these kind of fractal biscuits coming off.

358
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,800
 No, they're more intricate, aren't they?

359
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,640
 Sorry, Andy's giving me a look like literally.

360
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,720
 I just saw a dog and said, look at that lovely horse.

361
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,440
 Okay.

362
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,040
 They're coming from a guy who doesn't know how polys work.

363
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,600
 It's literally named after the thing you do.

364
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,240
 You just pull it.

365
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,920
 Andy turns up in the poly and just pushes it.

366
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,880
 What's going on?

367
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
 And with fern mania,

368
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,680
 they marketed it as something that only appealed to intelligent people.

369
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
 They said that's really good bit of marketing, isn't it?

370
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
 So clever.

371
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,880
 Yeah.

372
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,920
 And the other nice thing about it was railways were spreading across the country

373
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,320
 so you could go on more expeditions than you could before.

374
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,520
 Literally travel was easier

375
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,640
 and you got to maybe talk to the opposite sex without a chaperone.

376
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,520
 So that was a big draw.

377
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,040
 Well, that seemed to be the big thing

378
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,280
 from the bits of reading that I did about it.

379
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,400
 The big thing was ferns.

380
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,320
 No, no.

381
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
 Ferns was tinder.

382
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,760
 Ferns allowed you, as Andy says, to talk to the opposite of sex

383
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,800
 and go on adventure.

384
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
 You always say this.

385
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,640
 I like to have sex.

386
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
 Opposite sex.

387
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,440
 Yes.

388
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,120
 Opposite sex is marriage.

389
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,600
 Yes.

390
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,880
 Just on the flirting thing,

391
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,280
 I think it was also kind of liberating for women.

392
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,960
 So it was quite an important phenomenon for women's liberation

393
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,160
 because it was something that was deemed acceptable for them to do on their own.

394
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,640
 So it wasn't really acceptable for women to go out without a chaperone

395
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,160
 for many reasons at all.

396
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,640
 Right.

397
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,360
 Fernmania was particularly attractive to the ladies

398
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,960
 because whatever they like collecting plants

399
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,840
 and so they could all go out on their own and collect them.

400
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,000
 So it gave them all this independence and this adventure

401
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
 and really caused suffrage.

402
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,800
 Wow.

403
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,720
 Made a big leap.

404
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,200
 Big leap.

405
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,920
 Gonna stick to it.

406
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,240
 Yeah, it sounds like it sort of just took over, well, let's say,

407
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
 London even.

408
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,520
 Just every theatre suddenly became

409
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,000
 packed with it.

410
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,040
 The orchestra pits, they just used to just turn it into

411
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,640
 basically a botanical garden.

412
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,040
 It was just the orchestra would just cover it in ferns as they were playing.

413
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,480
 But people loved it because they were there for the ferns more than the music even.

414
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
 Yeah, I think that was the Prince of Wales theatre

415
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
 was where they did that turn it into a fernery.

416
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,400
 And it was, we should say, it was all because of this thing called the Wardian case,

417
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,320
 which is, which Andy looks really excited about already.

418
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,960
 But this was invented in 1829 by Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward

419
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,800
 and it was basically, he accidentally discovered that in a glass

420
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,560
 airtight jar ferns could survive and it meant that ferns, which wouldn't have been

421
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,560
 able to cope with the British climate until then, when they've been imported from China

422
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,600
 or Australia or whatever, could suddenly survive in these jars.

423
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,400
 And these Wardian cases became really fashionable.

424
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,600
 So if you were anyone in high society, you had to have this big,

425
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
 beautiful, Wardian case full of ferns sitting on your dining room table.

426
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,400
 Can you still get them, do you think?

427
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,560
 Ooh, maybe antique ones.

428
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,000
 I don't know if you could buy new ones.

429
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
 Or maybe you can because I'm looking at kind of decorating my spare room

430
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,080
 with curiosities and stuff.

431
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,560
 So I thought, like a Wardian case would be really good.

432
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,160
 Ferns with ferns, yeah.

433
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
 Because they're really lovely looking.

434
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
 I think that's a great idea.

435
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,000
 They do look gorgeous.

436
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,440
 I think Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward might be the man who won the Second World War.

437
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
 Oh god, here we go.

438
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,360
 This is a nice spot.

439
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,800
 So ferns got a suffrage man winning the Second World War.

440
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,600
 Pretty much.

441
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
 Okay, so basically...

442
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
 Could he also invent Facebook?

443
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
 Yes, he did.

444
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,680
 So his whole innovation, he's covered it kind of a little bit by mistake.

445
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,480
 But when he realized that these hermetically sealed things

446
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,400
 you could keep a fern alive in them,

447
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,800
 he built two custom made cases,

448
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,600
 He had a carpenter and he sent them to Sydney full of ferns.

449
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
 Okay, so they were on the boat for six months.

450
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,240
 They got there.

451
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,960
 They were alive.

452
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
 They were all fine.

453
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,560
 So that was incredible.

454
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,440
 So then he filled his case up with Australian ferns,

455
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,240
 which previously they'd never been able to get to the UK.

456
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,440
 And they returned.

457
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,280
 So they arrived about 18 months later.

458
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,960
 Very, very long journey.

459
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,400
 And it completely changed the entire world history of botany, basically.

460
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,200
 So it meant that tea plants could be transplanted to India from China.

461
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,560
 So that created the British Empire in a no small way.

462
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,040
 Wow.

463
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,760
 It contributed to the British Empire's rise.

464
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,840
 Smash the Chinese tea monopoly.

465
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,080
 And it meant that rubber trees could be brought from Brazil to Q Gardens in the UK

466
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,160
 and then to Malaya and Sri Lanka.

467
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,880
 And that created the British colonial rubber industry

468
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,600
 which was very significant in the Second World War.

469
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,440
 But then I think it also sounds like you're saying he invented colonialism.

470
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,720
 It massively changed the imperial project.

471
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,680
 That's true.

472
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,240
 That's the diplomat's response to that.

473
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,520
 Well, it's just like huge unintended consequences.

474
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,000
 I guess of this, of this hermetically sealed case

475
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,720
 which just meant suddenly you could move plants around the world like ever before.

476
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,280
 Also, Russia and America played a big part in winning the Second World War

477
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,160
 and I should make that clear.

478
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,560
 Wasn't just, it wasn't just this one guy.

479
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,480
 No, but, you know, yeah.

480
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,240
 That's pretty, no, that's pretty cool.

481
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,720
 It's often very amazing and mind blowing to hear how a tiny

482
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,240
 invention somehow impacts a world in a way that you previously thought it was just flirting.

483
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,360
 I don't know, okay, that's all it was.

484
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,640
 All of your notes on Tinder, Dan.

485
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,920
 Yeah, it's amazing that Tinder helps us win World War 3.

486
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,640
 Do you know how ferns have sex?

487
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,280
 So they're really spores, which is known.

488
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,840
 But then they sprout into a specific sexual generation which looks nothing like a fern.

489
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,520
 So it's a specific organism called a prothalus

490
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,160
 and that grows independently for several weeks and then that grows its own sex organs

491
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,920
 and they produce the eggs on the sperm and then that sporo fight it produces grows into a new fern.

492
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,200
 But it's like if we had sex and then gave birth to something that wasn't a person

493
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,280
 and then that person then produced a person.

494
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,960
 Yeah, that is weird.

495
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,160
 The double stage. You don't want to be, I don't think, in the crap generation that's only got half

496
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,480
 the right number of chromosomes and that just its job is to make this sperm and the egg

497
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,160
 which then create the real one.

498
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,200
 It's like if we get birth to penis this.

499
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
 No, it's like if we gave birth to testis and ovaries.

500
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
 Yeah, it is, yeah.

501
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,920
 And then the human grows off of it.

502
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,320
 Well, then the testis and the ovaries would hang out together

503
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,640
 and then they'd bump into some more testis and ovaries and then they'd create humans again.

504
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,600
 Wow, that is weird.

505
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,280
 Every analogy breaks down eventually.

506
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,840
 That one was pre-broken down, I think.

507
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
 But that helped me understand that more.

508
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,960
 But what I find amazing is in this, the crappy stage where they're the thing that creates

509
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,200
 the sperm and the egg, the sperm swim.

510
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,560
 So this is why ferns only survive in damp environments

511
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,520
 because they need to swim through water to find themselves an egg.

512
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,440
 So you've got little ferns sperm, something around everywhere looking for eggs.

513
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
 That's very cool.

514
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
 Yeah, but they didn't know how it worked for ages, did they?

515
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,960
 And they thought it must be seeds, but they couldn't find these seeds.

516
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,400
 So they thought the seeds were invisible.

517
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,000
 And what they thought was, if you could find a fern seed and carry it on you,

518
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,120
 it would make you invisible.

519
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,480
 Because they thought we had shit in the old days, didn't they?

520
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,200
 But that was, it was the idea that if you, you know,

521
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,560
 if you eat a walnuts, it looks like a brain, then it will help your brain.

522
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,360
 And in the same way, if you managed to find an invisible fern seed,

523
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,240
 it would make you invisible.

524
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,280
 And how do you find an invisible?

525
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,880
 Well, they don't exist, the seeds.

526
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,760
 No, I know, but like, if you were peddling that as an idea.

527
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,680
 Do you think people ever thought they'd found one?

528
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,720
 That's what I mean.

529
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
 Would you sell, would there be a guy in the, you know, the alleys going?

530
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,320
 I've got, yeah, some side-matchy beans, isn't it?

531
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,040
 Yeah, exactly.

532
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,800
 Just a bag of invisible fern seeds.

533
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,360
 And then, I think it would be really fun, if it, in like a medieval Truman show way,

534
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,120
 to have an entire village persuade someone that they were invisible.

535
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,960
 So if you let someone sink, you've got some fern seeds,

536
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,920
 and then he buys them, and then everyone just pretends they can't see him for the rest of his life.

537
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,040
 Yeah.

538
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
 In 2015, there was a fern found in the French mountains,

539
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,920
 which was the offspring of two groups of ferns,

540
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,520
 which haven't interbred in 60 million years.

541
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,160
 They split into separate lines of descent that long ago,

542
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,200
 and one of the authors of the paper on this is called Kathleen Pryor.

543
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,160
 She said, "Reproducing after such long evolutionary breakup

544
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,640
 is akin to an elephant hybridising with a manatee or a human with a lemur."

545
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,280
 Wow.

546
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,120
 But she did, she did also say,

547
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,600
 although to most people, they just look like two ferns.

548
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
 And that is incredible.

549
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
 And it also implies that we're all going to start

550
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,400
 interbreeding with other species until we go back to being a single-celled organiser.

551
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,280
 Oh, wow.

552
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,600
 Yeah.

553
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,880
 Wow.

554
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,520
 That's such an interesting idea, is it?

555
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,680
 So it really feels like that's the obvious conclusion to her all.

556
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,720
 Isn't the problem that a lot of the people who we'd have to

557
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,400
 interbreed with have died out?

558
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,760
 So really, we'd have to breed with some of the underthales first,

559
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,120
 and then the homo erectus, and then the monkeys, and then the lemurs,

560
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,000
 and then some of the old fish eventually.

561
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
 And then some of them aren't there anymore.

562
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,160
 So soup.

563
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,520
 This shit, the theory is falling apart.

564
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,560
 Yeah, does this work?

565
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,840
 It's such a cool theory.

566
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,960
 It's like the big crunch comparison to the big bang.

567
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,520
 Yes.

568
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
 Imagine that's how it all goes back.

569
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,240
 What, sorry, what's the benefit?

570
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
 It's the benefit, Andy.

571
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,840
 It's just kind of happened.

572
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,800
 Just life.

573
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
 It's just the way...

574
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,160
 Oh, you just think this is how evolution's going to do?

575
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,680
 Ah, it's just a great sci-fi idea.

576
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,960
 It's just inevitable.

577
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,080
 Started with the ferns.

578
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,440
 And it ends with you having sex with the sealer kind of.

579
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
 I'm not sure.

580
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,320
 They'll be saying, as we de-evolve.

581
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,880
 I can't believe they didn't spot this with those ferns.

582
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
 All the players were there.

583
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,280
 They should have known.

584
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,640
 Fernmania.

585
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,080
 There was also tulip mania, wasn't there?

586
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,880
 Mm-hmm.

587
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
 I didn't know there was also rosmania.

588
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,160
 Hyacinthmania.

589
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
 Dalia mania.

590
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,240
 And cactus mania.

591
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,720
 Really?

592
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,280
 Yeah.

593
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,960
 And carnation mania.

594
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,120
 When were these around the same time?

595
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,560
 No, cactus mania in the USA in the 1830s.

596
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,080
 Rosmania in ancient Rome.

597
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,200
 Hyacinth mania in Holland in the 1730s.

598
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,320
 Dalia mania in England in the 1820s.

599
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,640
 It just seemed to be a thing where every now and then,

600
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,680
 everyone would just love a plant and just go crazy for that plant.

601
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,560
 And then stop.

602
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,880
 And we haven't had a mania for ages for plants.

603
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
 Well, no, but we have manias, don't we?

604
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
 I think maybe they just had less stuff back then.

605
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,920
 They didn't have Bitcoin, did they?

606
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,320
 Exactly.

607
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,280
 They didn't have tamagotches.

608
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,800
 They didn't have Pokemon Go.

609
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,760
 But they did have an abundance of rare plants.

610
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,400
 Have you heard of orchid delirium?

611
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,840
 Yes, so that still exists.

612
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,400
 As good?

613
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,920
 Well, as in everyone's still into orchids.

614
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,600
 I would say that's the longest-lasting mania.

615
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,480
 You could still, if you find the rare orchid,

616
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,440
 the police will look after it to make sure no one steals it and stuff.

617
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,840
 Really?

618
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,560
 Yeah, wow.

619
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,480
 That happened on the golf course that I used to play on.

620
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,280
 Oh, yeah.

621
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,320
 As in, the orchid was found in nature in the golf course?

622
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,320
 Yes, so the orchid was just by the side of the golf course.

623
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,560
 Yeah.

624
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,880
 And then they had a policeman there kind of looking after it.

625
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,080
 Wow.

626
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,040
 That's so weird.

627
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,760
 Why?

628
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,120
 Because otherwise, if you damage it, then you've destroyed an entire species.

629
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,800
 Because it was extremely rare.

630
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,320
 Oh, but couldn't you can dig it up and just cultivate it somewhere else?

631
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,600
 Well, they were quite difficult to.

632
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,560
 Yeah, exactly that.

633
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,360
 They died, basically.

634
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,240
 If you try and do anything with an orchid, it just goes no, man.

635
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,480
 Okay.

636
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,200
 It's just going to die.

637
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,240
 It's almost drawing attention to it to have a policeman standing next to it, though.

638
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,640
 Yeah, you know what?

639
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,320
 I did play golf a lot on that golf course.

640
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
 I was a member and I never saw the policeman.

641
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,440
 Oh, he was very good.

642
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,680
 Yeah, it's some of those fern seeds.

643
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,320
 On a really rare plant, and how mad we go over them in 2010,

644
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,080
 a group of botanists were doing this routine plant survey on Ascension Island.

645
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,240
 You know, it's the tiny island in the South Atlantic.

646
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,760
 And they saw what looked like a tiny mini parsley sprig on a sheer cliff face,

647
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,360
 like sticking out of a rock.

648
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,320
 And apparently, they, both of them, two of them saw it.

649
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,200
 They instantly recognized it as a fern that had been described first in 1876.

650
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,960
 Only seen two more times in history at the last time in 1958.

651
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,040
 So instantly, both of them were like, oh my god, check that out.

652
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,240
 So it'd been just declared extinct in 2003.

653
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,720
 So obviously, they ab sailed down to it to check it out.

654
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,120
 And then they thought we've got to preserve this fern.

655
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,160
 This is really precious.

656
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,440
 So they ab sailed down every day or a couple of times a week to water it,

657
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
 and to weed it, and to care for it,

658
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,680
 and to let produce spores, because it was so valuable.

659
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,080
 Yeah.

660
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,960
 And then when it finally produced spores,

661
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,080
 that was obviously an incredibly exciting day, because they could collect them.

662
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,120
 So two of them went down, and they have only 24 hours before the spores

663
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,160
 weren't used for anymore.

664
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,480
 Yeah.

665
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,040
 And they had 24 hours to get them to queue gardens.

666
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,600
 And so...

667
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,640
 From Ascension Island.

668
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,760
 From Ascension Island.

669
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,240
 Yeah.

670
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
 I'm not sure I could get to queue gardens from here.

671
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,600
 I'm talking about three hours.

672
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,200
 Well, they had some extra help put on.

673
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,240
 So they rushed them to this airfield where they were flown immediately

674
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,400
 to RAF Brysnorton in Oxfordshire.

675
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
 And a car was specifically waiting for them there

676
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,800
 to drive them straight to New Gardens.

677
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,040
 And then they got on the district line.

678
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,080
 Saturday else caught for four hours.

679
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,880
 Wow, at least it there, no?

680
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,720
 Still there, and it's produced a few offspring.

681
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,680
 And yeah, hang on.

682
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,880
 That's so cool.

683
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,160
 That's the census I've been.

684
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,480
 I've seen films in the last week that were as long as good as that.

685
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,440
 Okay, that's it.

686
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
 That is all of our facts.

687
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
