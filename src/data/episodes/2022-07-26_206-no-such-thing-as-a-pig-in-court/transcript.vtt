 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.360
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.120
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntermari and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.080
 around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.840
 here we go. Starting with you Chazinski. My fact this week is that the dome of the Taj Mahal is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 held together with sugar, fruit juice and egg white. It's actually just a pudding recipe that they

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.240
 accidentally turned into muslim. This is also with bricks. There are conventional building materials

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.760
 in there as well, so it's actually a mixture of lime, which is probably delicious. Yeah, I'm

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.080
 sounding more and more like a kaipere in here. Yeah, sorry, it's the other kind of lime,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.160
 you know, the one they build buildings with. Lime stone. Quick lime. Lime and it's mixed together

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.640
 with fruit juice and sugar and egg and it's called tuna. C-H-U-N-A, it's all very food stuffy,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.080
 I know, with some shells, bits of shells and some gum and yeah, this was the plaster that's used

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.000
 on the inside of the dome of the Taj Mahal to hold it all together and it actually turns out that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.240
 egg white especially was quite a common building material. But this is used in lots of places? Yeah,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.480
 I think so. So I heard something in passing on the radio and I ended up looking into egg whites

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.600
 in buildings and there's quite a lot on it in like vaguely obscure books, so there's an essay

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.280
 by a Filipino food researcher who has an essay called "Eggs in Philippine Church Architecture"

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.080
 and it's cuisine, as if cuisine is just a leftover. I reckon that you're the only person who's

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 ever read that book. It's gotta be right. It's about Filipino churches. What's her name? Give her a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.640
 shout out. She's called "Peer Lim Castillo." It's not obscure however if you're a devout chef

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 in the Philippines, it's like a massive seller in that community maybe. And also if you are

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.440
 Filipino and you know about traditional Filipino recipes, this is really interesting. A lot of them

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.760
 contain just egg yolks. So in a lot of traditional Filipino food it's just egg yolk and that's

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.360
 because they had so much leftover egg yolks. Millions and millions of egg whites were big used to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.320
 build their churches. This is for centuries, absolutely true. So there's traditional food like

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.360
 Briosh, a thing called Yema which is egg yolk sweets and it's just because there's loads of egg yolk

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.360
 lying around. That sounds extremely untrue, doesn't it? That's amazing. Take it out with "Peer Lim Castillo."

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.280
 So here's a fact. The Taj Mahal was built by 22,000 workers and it took 17 years to complete.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 And 22,000 workers is the same number of workers as Facebook has and they've been going for 14 years.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.360
 Wow. That is very good. They also had a thousand elephants working in construction. I don't know if

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.400
 they're sorry I'm talking about the Taj Mahal now, not Facebook. Yeah they did, didn't they?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.000
 Dragging all the building materials and I think they had some elephants operating pulleys.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.920
 Those are the especially trusted elephants that were working the pulley system.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.440
 Because I don't fully understand pulleys. Pulleys are a really simple concept. God, if you don't

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.760
 understand pulleys, I do worry about what else you're missing. And there was a story wasn't there that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.360
 they cut off all the sculptors' hands after they built it. And so they couldn't build anything else.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.000
 Really? Yeah. Do they tell you that? The start of the gig? Probably not. Ironically, they do ask

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.320
 you to sign something at the beginning and then there's no room for us. But what if they made a mistake

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.600
 and of course they said, "Oh dear, we're going to have to get the second gallery redone." Can you

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.840
 get the guys who made the second gallery in? They turn up. Sorry. Yeah, I don't think they actually did

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.160
 do that. There's also a theory that they blinded them so they wouldn't be able to build anything

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.360
 as beautiful. But that kind of myth is for lots of different buildings like St. Basil's in Moscow,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.720
 has the same myth. I have my place, I have my flat repainted recently. I did the same thing at the end

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.920
 of it. You know, I cut my bike's hands off and I blinded him and yeah. There was also a tale that

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.000
 they use brick scaffolding, that's not a tale, that's true, which was quite unusual. They usually would

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.920
 use like bamboo or something. But it was said that they did it to conceal what was happening as they

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.280
 built it. So it would be a big surprise when it came down. And then there was another thing. The

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.880
 brick scaffolding, Shah Jahan, who was the Emperor, who commissioned the whole thing and it was a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.040
 Muslim for his favourite wife. He was told that the brick scaffolding would take five years to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.520
 dismantle. And so he had the bright idea of telling the workers that if they dismantled it as

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.040
 fast as they could, they could keep whatever bricks they removed. And it came down overnight.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 Supposedly, he tried to tell me that it was like made of delicious chocolate.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.000
 Is it true? Have you guys heard about the architecture being angled at such a case and built

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.560
 in such a way that should it topple over, it would fall perfectly away from the tomb itself?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.360
 Well, supposedly the minarets, there are four minarets around the outside and supposedly they

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.000
 are angled to fall outward rather than inwards. But I would presume that they're just built not to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.120
 fall over. I think we're building in a structural floor that meant that they only fall over in one

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.680
 direction. Yeah, I know. But at the same time, you've made half your building with eggs and flour

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.040
 and fruit juice. So you know how we were saying that it was built for his favourite wife?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.880
 So it was what's his name again? Shah Jahan, it was his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.480
 that it was built for. But there is a Muslim for his first wife on the other side of the river,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.240
 which I've seen a picture of it and it's currently covered in black mold and cats.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.000
 Black mold and cats? Yeah, just cats everywhere. Oh, just they're there, not covered in cats.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.160
 It's just full of cats. Was she a cat person? Well, that's what they say now.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.560
 The locals say, well, the whole of the cats are here because she was such a lover of cats.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:04.880
 She's also a black mold person. That's quite cool though, just I read about how they clean

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.320
 the Taj Mahal. So that one's covered in black mold. That one needs a cleaning. But the Taj Mahal,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.040
 in order to clean it, they don't do a classic sort of water-based clean. They give it a mud bath,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.880
 effectively. It's like a spa treatment, and that gives it the glistening white. Wow, and then

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:28.560
 I was asked to follow. You have put some cucumber on it. That's why there are no lights allowed

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.320
 on it at night. You're not allowed to have big spotlights lighting it up because it would look

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.560
 beautiful at night, but they don't do that because that would attract insects, which would then poo

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.200
 all over it. And these particular insects, poo green. And that's partly why it's been looking

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.240
 a bit grubby in recent years. Oh, yeah. It's just constantly battling against excretion from insects.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.040
 What an error. Yeah, an error pollution is getting so bad now that they think the mud bath is not

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.600
 enough now. They're going to have a shower post mud bath. I was looking to some stuff about building

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.880
 materials. I thought this was really interesting. So first of all, hair is added to plaster to make it

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.360
 stronger. And actually, you will have seen this. So it genuinely adds proper extra strength. It's

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.680
 added to lime plaster. So any bit of lime plaster has got lots of hair running for it. You can order

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.440
 horse or goat or cow hair from just construction suppliers companies. And actually, if you imagine

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.920
 like a broken off bit of plaster, you know, because I don't see little threads coming out, that I always

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.880
 thought, I don't know, it's a dust that it all got together. That's just actual hair. Yeah,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.960
 looking like broken off plaster. And then there's, you'll see the goat hair. Isn't that weird?

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.200
 That's very weird. Yeah. Also, sugar is used as a concrete retarder, which is a thing that stops

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.040
 concrete from solidifying too fast. So if you need to properly shape concrete, you pour it down. And

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.720
 maybe it's like a particularly hot day. So it will bake really fast. If you add lots of sugar to it,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.160
 which a lot of builders do, then that slows down the setting process. That is why builders always want

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.040
 lots of sugar in their tea. They then whip it out so they can stick it in the concrete. Have you

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.080
 heard of the English equivalent of the Taj Mahal? It's a memorial to a wife by a grieving husband.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.800
 And it's this thing called the Eleanor Crosses. Oh, yeah. So there's, yeah? Oh, yeah. There's one

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.640
 just down the road. Yes, exactly. So they were built by Edward I in 1290. Queen Eleanor died,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.200
 and he wanted to commemorate her, and she died up in Nottinghamshire, and he commissioned a huge

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.400
 spire cross. Everywhere her funeral procession stopped on the way from Nottinghamshire to London,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.200
 he commissioned one of these huge crosses. So there were 12 of them. There are only three remaining.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.680
 And outside Charing Cross, there's a restored Victorian replica. And it looks very cool, like a

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.880
 little space needle. It's got three statues of a woman. And it was Eleanor of Castile, wasn't it?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.920
 Yes. That's why. Yeah. And she had a triple burial. There's a rare. So her heart was buried at Black

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.280
 Friars Station. I think it was something else before it was Black Friars Station. Why?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.000
 They've just renovated Black Friars Station, haven't they? Oh, yeah. I wonder if they found

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.600
 the heart when they were doing that. Maybe. Yeah. You probably missed that, wouldn't you,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.000
 with your big truck. I don't think you'd spot a shriveled 1,000-year-old heart.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.960
 But maybe it helps the concrete to set. It does. That's why it has to put a heart in every crack.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.160
 And her organs went to Lincoln Cathedral and her body went to Westminster Robbie.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.480
 So where would you go to grieve at her grave site? Where was closest, I guess.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:31.280
 Guess that's not the true convenience of it. A good point. I think you would go to Black Friars

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.840
 because of the heart. And easy train connection.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.840
 OK, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that there is an ice

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.560
 golf championship held each year in Greenland, 600 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. However,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.600
 because of the constantly shifting ice shelf, no players hold any records on that course

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.200
 because it changes on a daily basis. It's not nuts. So there must be no guide as to how to play the

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.480
 course well. Is that right? There's a lot of guidance on how to play it well because it's you're

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.640
 playing on icy terrain. You're allowed things that you're not allowed in a normal game of golf.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.400
 For example, you're allowed to clear the path. Like in curling. Yes, exactly. You can, yeah, you can

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.480
 sort of just make it nice and a bit softer. The par is much higher. I don't really play golf or

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.760
 understand the rules. So it's a par of 36 per hole. Wow. OK. So in normal golf, you wouldn't go

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:35.040
 above five. Right. Wow. You sure it's 36. Sorry. It's it's maximum handicap of 36. Ah, OK. It's

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.040
 different. That basically means that you get more shots taken off. Right. Basically. Oh, OK.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.760
 All right. Otherwise the par of 36 will just be so tediously long. Golf's tedious enough anyway.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.800
 Imagine if it was 36 shots per hole. I mean, is that what we're going to say that golf's tedious?

00:10:50.800 --> 00:11:00.400
 I've got some stuff about that. So just a bit of explanation about this. This is played in a town called

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.240
 a set up by a man called Arnie Nyman. He's a hotel manager. And it's this tiny, tiny town. It's got

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.840
 it's got, you know, just over a thousand residents. There's more dogs there than there are people by

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.480
 factor of three to one at least because you get everywhere by dog sledding. That's the motor

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.160
 transport. So yeah. And so he set this up in 1997. It's an annual event, except for when it's

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.840
 too cold and the course has to be closed because it's just too icy and impossible and you'd get frostbite

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.080
 the moment you step out. Maybe if it got too hot, they'd have to cancel it as well. Yeah, that's true.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.800
 Yeah. And the ball is red, isn't it? The ball is red so that they can see it. The the hole that

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.480
 you hit the ball into is twice the size. So there's lots of different rules that get played. But

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.200
 it's seen by golfers. I know you're a golfer and you probably didn't know about it necessarily

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.600
 beforehand. But a lot of golfers talk about it as the craziest course you could ever play. So

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:03.040
 they actively fly out to this remote place to yeah, to be a part of this odd game. And it has

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.480
 all the holes are a bit closer together because the cold air is more dense and so there's more drag.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.880
 So I didn't realize this and the golf balls move a bit slower through cold air. That does happen.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.240
 If you play golf, you know that when the cold weather's on, it just doesn't go as far.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.400
 I play golf once in the Himalayas where the air is really thin and it just goes miles really.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.040
 That's the best place to play golf. Is it not having to tussle its way through a load of air molecules?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.640
 All the molecules. That's it. The molecules get in the way. Well, this is what's confusing because

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.000
 cold air is more dense because the molecules aren't moving as fast. So there's more drag. But you

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.520
 would have thought as you say, want to get an altitude and it's cold because there are just fewer

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.920
 air molecules. It must move faster because they get in the way. So it moves slower through some

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.320
 cold air, but then faster altitude sounds like. This is why golf is such an interesting game.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.000
 Is this what the commentary's like? I'm a bother to turn it on.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.920
 You know the, I was reading about the dimples inside the golf balls. That doesn't really have

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.960
 a proper science to it. It's just, what do you mean by that? What do you mean it works outside the

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:11.200
 laws of physics? No, I guess you would look at any sort of sporting equipment and you would assume

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.440
 that the design and the shape was for a specific purpose and tests. And it sounds like original

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.680
 golf balls didn't have any of these dimples, but golf players prefer to play with ones that had

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.400
 little indentations on them. But as far as I know, but you might know better, there's no exact

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.040
 reason why it's that many dimples. No, I don't know why it is. It's easier to pick up a golf ball

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 with dimples than it is to pick up a golf ball without dimples. Yeah, they're like finger holes.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:41.920
 If you're a little appucian. But then ping pong balls are easy to pick up. Yeah, I don't find that

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.080
 actually. I find ping pong balls almost impossible. You should play with sticky gloves. That's good idea.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.920
 But then you'd never let it go for the serve. What would it be a problem? What I do is I put the ball

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:01.840
 on a bit of string. Actually, this is all the problem. I think you would get my grip on the balls

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.280
 to get spin on it. Yeah. And there might be a thing about bortices, but I just, you know, I don't know

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.400
 what that is. Okay, James, here's a question. Have you found that golf has been getting harder?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.520
 Because you've been playing for some years. How many years would you say you've been playing?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:23.600
 30. Wow. Okay, so supposedly development. You've been playing since you were 32. It's just a

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:34.240
 joke about your being old. Sorry. Yeah, I actually got the hurtful comment. Sorry. So supposedly

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.000
 developers have been building at longer and harder courses because professionals were getting

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.880
 really good in the 90s and 2000s. And I think there was a conflation between pros playing on courses

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.000
 and amateurs. The equipment's a lot better though. Right. Just to be. Yeah, so apparently they're

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.840
 allowed with quite hard courses now these days. And people who might not want a very hard game of

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.680
 golf are saying, oh, I can't be bothered with that. Is that right? I don't know. There's a theory.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.680
 It's hard for me to remember back so long. Well, I started playing. It was just sticks of wood

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:10.240
 and golf ball stuff with duck feathers. And I remember on the first round, they said to

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:17.360
 Mary Queen of Scots. We should put dimples into these balls. Do you guys know about the most

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.400
 southerly golf club in the world? No, of course. So this is called Scott Based Country Club and it's

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:28.720
 13 degrees above the South Pole. And if so, there are a lot of scuba birds around. So if you have your

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.080
 ball stolen by a scuba, you get a one shot penalty, which seems harsh. They're always stealing the balls.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.360
 It does seem hard. Yeah. But if you hit one, it counts as a birdie. So it's the one instance where

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.280
 if you hit a bird, you get a birdie. I think that sounds cruel though. Do you mean hit it while it's

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.840
 trying to steal your ball or you hit it as part of a hit and it's in the sky? No, it's part of a hit

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.200
 in the sky. I don't think you see it trying to steal your ball, then you attack it with your golf.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.560
 What happens when you do that? Because you don't want the penalty? No, you get arrested, I don't know.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.880
 Ah, okay. This is a confusing game. I mean, you could just try and hit the skewer bird into the golf

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.600
 ball hole, but it's probably too big. It's a ball hole. We really don't know the sport too,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:14.160
 what's the name of it? It's called a hole. Interesting. It's good for the expert for once.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.440
 I heard tell, James, of a thing about golf. I read that until January this year,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.560
 you were allowed to ring up a tournament if you were watching at home and report a rule violation.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.000
 I know that that happened last year. Yeah, and they've just brought it to an end. Have they?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.560
 Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Lots of the tours have come together and said,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.640
 guys, stop phoning in. We'll just have some officials watching you know. But this used to be a major

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.480
 thing. And also, if you committed a mistake and someone phoned it in, and you didn't know,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.000
 you would then, at the end of the day or the end of the round, you fill in a scorecard, don't you?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.320
 And there's a penalty for filling in a scorecard incorrectly. Yeah. So you get the penalty for

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.840
 making a mistake, which you didn't know you made. Yeah. And then you get a double penalty for

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.920
 filling in your scorecard role. Exactly. There's so much. It's just qualified from tournaments.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.800
 I think Lexi Thompson had that done to her. Yes. Yeah. I read that too. That's not fair as the skewer bird

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.480
 thing. Yeah. Could you imagine if someone ragged in and goes, I'm pretty sure you hit that skewer bird.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:15.840
 Do you, James, as a former accountant, do you prefer golf for the admin side of things or for

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.520
 the sport itself? Or does it combine the two loves? It's my two loves. Yeah. Sparta and admin. Wow.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.320
 Filling in that form. Yeah. What's crunching numbers a lot of the time? Well, it's mostly just

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:32.160
 adding one every time you hit a ball. Apparently, apparently a lot of high-end professionals can't even

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:40.320
 manage to do that. Yeah. Ormanak, this place, just wanted to tiny little facts about this very,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.960
 very small place. They have notable people. With for such a tiny little town, you would think that

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.800
 wouldn't be the case, but Miss Greenland was from from that place. Ormanak, she's married to an actor

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.360
 called Nicola Costa Waldo, who you would know better as Jamie Lannister from the Game of Thrones.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.520
 Yeah. TV shows. So, yeah, Jamie Lannister's wife is from this very tiny town where ice golf has played.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:14.560
 Yeah. That's my fact. That's a good fact. Yeah. Well, you know, it's a very tiny, tiny place. Lots of ice

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.240
 and game of thrones. Lots of ice, yes. Yeah. Winter is always there. It has come. Not much golf.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:26.000
 Well, we haven't seen the last series yet. Very true. They're going to have to put a lot of golf to

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.400
 make up for the deficit the last year series. Wouldn't it be great if the last series is just golf by

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.360
 all the characters? It would be amazing. I might start watching. And then whoever wins a golf

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.080
 ton of it gets the throw. Yeah, it'd be brilliant. Perfect. Did I money's on Brianna of Taf? Oh, good

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.160
 for the Game of Thrones. But then Cersei Lannister gets penalised because she illegally moved the ball when

00:18:48.160 --> 00:19:01.920
 no was looking. A scuba bird dies. That's a grand finale. Okay, it's time for fact number three,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.520
 and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century, you could be executed in

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:15.120
 France for wearing stripes because they were the clothing of the devil. There was a cobbler in

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.640
 the town of Ruan, and he was also part of the local clergy, and apparently he got caught in

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:26.480
 stripe clothes and he got condemned to death. It's such an easy condemned to death to avoid,

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.560
 isn't it? I'd have to really, really like stripes. You are wearing stripes today. That's true,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.920
 but that's only because I'm not in 14th century France. Yeah, I'd just wear something plain. So I read

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.880
 this in a review in the New York Times of a book called The Devil's Cloth, A History of Stripes and

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.360
 Striped Fabric by Michelle Pastaro, and it looks like an amazing book from the review, I gotta say.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.880
 And they think that maybe it was from the Bible. In the Bible, it says, you will not wear upon yourself

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.520
 a garment that is made from two, and maybe in medieval France, they thought that meant you

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:06.400
 can't wear stripes, and so they would send you to death if you did. It's such an extreme reaction

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.600
 against something relatively, what we think is innocuous. Supposedly that even Zebra's,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.480
 I also read the same review that Zebra's were included in Satan's Bestiary, as they were thought

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.080
 to be a satanic animal. So was all Zebra's were put to death? That's right. That's why we don't

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.920
 have any Zebra's anymore. That's correct, they used to be huge in France. No, they would make

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:33.440
 bestories, wouldn't they? And they put the animals in different places in the books, and the Zebra's

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.520
 would be in the evil part. Such a, it's so mean to animal to just call them evil for their reason.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.000
 I guess we still do it a bit. But it seems like 14th century France was just you would be executed

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.040
 for a lot of things that would seem ridiculous. You would be executed if you were a naughty pig.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.400
 For example, like pigs were taken to court, actual animal pigs, and tried in court,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:01.600
 although we do execute pigs now. Yeah, even the nice ones. Yeah, but we don't take them to court.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.560
 No. To charge them. We don't have lawyers. They deserve a trial.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:11.280
 You're right. Actually, we've gone worse. That's true. Bacon's going to get a lot rarer if every

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.960
 pig has to go through a full judicial process. The appeals process is much like that.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.520
 It's weird that stripes have often been negative associations though, because stripes

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:28.240
 obviously were the attire of prisoners for since the 19th century. That was seen as a badge of shame.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.200
 In fact, it was so much so that by the mid-20th century, prisoners would stop wearing stripes,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.080
 and that's where the jumpsuit came on the all-one colour jumpsuit, because it was kind of unfair,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.920
 because it was so associated with this shameful thing. And weirdly, they are coming back in.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.440
 I think maybe it's a sign of the direction that America is going in, but because it shows

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.680
 you're tough on crime, if you introduce stripes, because it's a proper badge of "I'm a prisoner."

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:57.520
 So it's like stripes of the new orange, which is a new black stripe of the orange, absolutely right?

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.760
 Supposedly, the stripes in prison's thing is not connected to this 14th-century France thing,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.440
 as in the author of this book, Mr. Pasteurot, just has found no direct link, so there's no guarantee.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.000
 But prostitutes used to wear stripes. And jugglers?

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.840
 Prostitutes and jugglers. Prostitutes. Too much dangerous groups in society.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.720
 Clowns, hangmen, lepers. It's a mixed face, isn't it? Hangmen and clowns.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.280
 Is this breadin or is this France? This is going to be Europe, you should think.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.240
 So you've got prostitutes, jugglers, clowns, hangmen, lepers, cripples, heretics,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:38.560
 Jews, Africans, bastards and the condemned. Wow. Did you book the clown for a random party?

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.680
 No, but I got a condemned man, a leper, and a bastard.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.440
 Yeah, it's all people who have outside society, wasn't it? That was kind of...

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.720
 Jugglers, come on.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.560
 Juggling is not a normal social profession.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.520
 Imagine that. I tell you what, if you've got condemned to death for juggling,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.480
 then that's an easier thing not to do than wearing stripes.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.760
 It is very easy not to do.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:11.680
 Oh, my God. If you accidentally dropped something, and then you caught it just as it was falling.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:21.280
 Death. I like that in France, in the 14th century, they tried to band those long-toed shoes

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.160
 that you see almost as parodies. This is my favourite fact ever.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.360
 Because they band specifically band shoes shaped like penises.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.960
 Because they got bigger and bigger and bigger, and more pointy and pointy and pointy.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.920
 And then someone thought, "I'm going to make mine look like a penis."

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.480
 And then they were like, "We're going to have to put a stop to this."

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.480
 I think it's so good.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.800
 You don't get shoes shaped like penises now, do you?

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.640
 No. So they did. It worked.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:58.240
 So the long-pointy shoe thing, they tried to band that in France.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.120
 And in England, you could get them in the 14th century as long as two feet

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.240
 in length, that sort of long point.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.960
 And they were very fashionable and cool, but they were never practical if you had to

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.840
 suddenly make a dash, you know, if someone was chasing you or whatever.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.480
 So what they used to do is if they knew that they were in trouble,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.400
 they would cut off the fronts of them, and then they would dash off.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.440
 Nice, like a lizard.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.280
 So cool.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.200
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.640
 You couldn't have a mullet either in the 13th century.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.760
 You couldn't have an Irish hairstyle, which it turns out Irish hairstyles were having

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.400
 the top of your head shaved and then a long head down at the bottom.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.520
 Wow. Like a mullet.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.320
 Like a bullet.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.760
 Like a bullet.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.040
 A bold mullet.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.400
 Like a bold mullet.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.760
 Oh, yeah, I thought that a mullet, that was a name for the bold head.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.440
 No, a mullet was more like shot on top and long at the back.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.200
 Whereas a completely bold on top.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.760
 Like the Bill Bailey style.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.800
 Why weren't you allowed an Irish hairstyle?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.880
 It was a classic kind of racism, you know, they thought the Irish were a bit barbaric,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.080
 and then they had this weird hairstyle.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.160
 So don't do the hairstyle otherwise you're a barbarian.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.200
 They had something this week where there's a school that's banned them,

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.520
 meet me at McDonald's haircut, which is the opposite of that.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.080
 A mullet is like kind of curly and long on top and then shaved on the sides.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.920
 That all the kids have.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.360
 Why is it called meet me at McDonald's?

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.560
 I don't think anyone knows.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.960
 I think actually people under the age of 20 know.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.160
 And then people of our age are just like, why do they call it that?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.840
 And they're refusing to tell us.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.880
 In the Elizabethan era, only royalty could wear leopard.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.560
 Leopard skin.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.000
 Completely limited to royalty.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.240
 Yeah, I mean, there weren't many, there weren't thousands of leopards around,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.560
 which, you know, depends on the availability of leopards.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.200
 That's really good.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.080
 Yeah, and Yomans wives, there was, there were, due to these summary laws,

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.400
 Yomans wives were only allowed to wear lamb, rabbit, fox, or cat for nothing else.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.760
 The leopard is a type of cat.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.440
 Oh yeah.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.360
 I'm just saying, if I was a Yoman and my wife wanted to wear leopard,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.160
 I'd let her wear leopard and then just argue.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.200
 Well, she'd be arrested and put in prison and she'd blame you.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.440
 Because she said, are you sure I'm okay to wear this outside?

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.200
 And you said, yeah, it's officially a cat.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.680
 Yeah.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.520
 They'll find that out in 500 years.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.320
 Maybe.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.440
 How terrible husband.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.880
 (laughs)

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:27.600
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.760
 My fact is that Victorian Britain had such a fern mania for so many years

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.240
 that some species were almost completely wiped out.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.920
 Yeah.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.800
 There was this massive fern craze and it lasted 50 years.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.200
 Victorian Britain, all the other stuff they did,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.000
 they were basically just killing time in between collecting more ferns.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.680
 So people would go on these huge collecting parties into the countryside

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.920
 and they collect ferns for their homes and there were so many collectors going out

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.240
 that there's one species called the Kilani fern

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.680
 which was almost wiped out in the UK and it's barely clung on to survival.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.360
 So it was a huge problem.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.520
 Well, it was a problem but on the other hand,

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.760
 they were doing lots of crossbreeding.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.080
 So they invented a whole load of new species.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.120
 So actually by the end there were more species than where you started.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.320
 That's cool.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.120
 Yeah.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.440
 So for example,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.520
 custard creams, the biscuits.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.160
 Yeah.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.280
 They have ferns on them.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.280
 You know that curly design on a custard cream.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:23.520
 Yeah.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.480
 That's a fern.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.280
 Yeah, it's so good.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.160
 From fern mania days.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.280
 From fern mania days.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.800
 Is that...

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.400
 This isn't actually that useful for a podcast

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.120
 but I think we've got a fern in this very room haven't we?

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.760
 Is that a fern?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.480
 Is that a fern?

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.280
 I don't think it is a fern.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.240
 I don't think it is a fern.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.880
 It looks like just a pot plant for me.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.120
 Because ferns have got these kind of fractal biscuits coming off.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.800
 No, they're more intricate, aren't they?

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.640
 Sorry, Andy's giving me a look like literally.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.720
 I just saw a dog and said, look at that lovely horse.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.440
 Okay.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.040
 They're coming from a guy who doesn't know how polys work.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.600
 It's literally named after the thing you do.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.240
 You just pull it.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.920
 Andy turns up in the poly and just pushes it.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.880
 What's going on?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.320
 And with fern mania,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.680
 they marketed it as something that only appealed to intelligent people.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.360
 They said that's really good bit of marketing, isn't it?

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.320
 So clever.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:12.880
 Yeah.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.920
 And the other nice thing about it was railways were spreading across the country

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.320
 so you could go on more expeditions than you could before.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.520
 Literally travel was easier

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.640
 and you got to maybe talk to the opposite sex without a chaperone.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.520
 So that was a big draw.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.040
 Well, that seemed to be the big thing

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.280
 from the bits of reading that I did about it.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.400
 The big thing was ferns.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.320
 No, no.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.320
 Ferns was tinder.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.760
 Ferns allowed you, as Andy says, to talk to the opposite of sex

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.800
 and go on adventure.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.600
 You always say this.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.640
 I like to have sex.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.560
 Opposite sex.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.440
 Yes.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.120
 Opposite sex is marriage.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:47.600
 Yes.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.880
 Just on the flirting thing,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.280
 I think it was also kind of liberating for women.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.960
 So it was quite an important phenomenon for women's liberation

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.160
 because it was something that was deemed acceptable for them to do on their own.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.640
 So it wasn't really acceptable for women to go out without a chaperone

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.160
 for many reasons at all.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.640
 Right.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.360
 Fernmania was particularly attractive to the ladies

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.960
 because whatever they like collecting plants

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.840
 and so they could all go out on their own and collect them.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.000
 So it gave them all this independence and this adventure

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.760
 and really caused suffrage.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.800
 Wow.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.720
 Made a big leap.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.200
 Big leap.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.920
 Gonna stick to it.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:28.240
 Yeah, it sounds like it sort of just took over, well, let's say,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.440
 London even.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.520
 Just every theatre suddenly became

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.000
 packed with it.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.040
 The orchestra pits, they just used to just turn it into

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.640
 basically a botanical garden.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.040
 It was just the orchestra would just cover it in ferns as they were playing.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.480
 But people loved it because they were there for the ferns more than the music even.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.240
 Yeah, I think that was the Prince of Wales theatre

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.880
 was where they did that turn it into a fernery.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.400
 And it was, we should say, it was all because of this thing called the Wardian case,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.320
 which is, which Andy looks really excited about already.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.960
 But this was invented in 1829 by Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.800
 and it was basically, he accidentally discovered that in a glass

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.560
 airtight jar ferns could survive and it meant that ferns, which wouldn't have been

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.560
 able to cope with the British climate until then, when they've been imported from China

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.600
 or Australia or whatever, could suddenly survive in these jars.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.400
 And these Wardian cases became really fashionable.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.600
 So if you were anyone in high society, you had to have this big,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.120
 beautiful, Wardian case full of ferns sitting on your dining room table.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.400
 Can you still get them, do you think?

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.560
 Ooh, maybe antique ones.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.000
 I don't know if you could buy new ones.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.600
 Or maybe you can because I'm looking at kind of decorating my spare room

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.080
 with curiosities and stuff.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.560
 So I thought, like a Wardian case would be really good.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.160
 Ferns with ferns, yeah.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.440
 Because they're really lovely looking.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.880
 I think that's a great idea.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.000
 They do look gorgeous.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.440
 I think Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward might be the man who won the Second World War.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.400
 Oh god, here we go.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.360
 This is a nice spot.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.800
 So ferns got a suffrage man winning the Second World War.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.600
 Pretty much.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.440
 Okay, so basically...

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.880
 Could he also invent Facebook?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.160
 Yes, he did.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.680
 So his whole innovation, he's covered it kind of a little bit by mistake.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.480
 But when he realized that these hermetically sealed things

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.400
 you could keep a fern alive in them,

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.800
 he built two custom made cases,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.600
 He had a carpenter and he sent them to Sydney full of ferns.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.440
 Okay, so they were on the boat for six months.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.240
 They got there.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.960
 They were alive.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.600
 They were all fine.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.560
 So that was incredible.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.440
 So then he filled his case up with Australian ferns,

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.240
 which previously they'd never been able to get to the UK.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.440
 And they returned.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.280
 So they arrived about 18 months later.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.960
 Very, very long journey.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.400
 And it completely changed the entire world history of botany, basically.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.200
 So it meant that tea plants could be transplanted to India from China.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.560
 So that created the British Empire in a no small way.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.040
 Wow.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.760
 It contributed to the British Empire's rise.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.840
 Smash the Chinese tea monopoly.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.080
 And it meant that rubber trees could be brought from Brazil to Q Gardens in the UK

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.160
 and then to Malaya and Sri Lanka.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.880
 And that created the British colonial rubber industry

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.600
 which was very significant in the Second World War.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.440
 But then I think it also sounds like you're saying he invented colonialism.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.720
 It massively changed the imperial project.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.680
 That's true.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.240
 That's the diplomat's response to that.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.520
 Well, it's just like huge unintended consequences.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.000
 I guess of this, of this hermetically sealed case

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.720
 which just meant suddenly you could move plants around the world like ever before.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.280
 Also, Russia and America played a big part in winning the Second World War

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.160
 and I should make that clear.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.560
 Wasn't just, it wasn't just this one guy.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.480
 No, but, you know, yeah.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.240
 That's pretty, no, that's pretty cool.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.720
 It's often very amazing and mind blowing to hear how a tiny

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.240
 invention somehow impacts a world in a way that you previously thought it was just flirting.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.360
 I don't know, okay, that's all it was.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.640
 All of your notes on Tinder, Dan.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.920
 Yeah, it's amazing that Tinder helps us win World War 3.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.640
 Do you know how ferns have sex?

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.280
 So they're really spores, which is known.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.840
 But then they sprout into a specific sexual generation which looks nothing like a fern.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.520
 So it's a specific organism called a prothalus

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.160
 and that grows independently for several weeks and then that grows its own sex organs

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.920
 and they produce the eggs on the sperm and then that sporo fight it produces grows into a new fern.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.200
 But it's like if we had sex and then gave birth to something that wasn't a person

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.280
 and then that person then produced a person.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.960
 Yeah, that is weird.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.160
 The double stage. You don't want to be, I don't think, in the crap generation that's only got half

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.480
 the right number of chromosomes and that just its job is to make this sperm and the egg

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.160
 which then create the real one.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.200
 It's like if we get birth to penis this.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.440
 No, it's like if we gave birth to testis and ovaries.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.480
 Yeah, it is, yeah.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.920
 And then the human grows off of it.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.320
 Well, then the testis and the ovaries would hang out together

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.640
 and then they'd bump into some more testis and ovaries and then they'd create humans again.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.600
 Wow, that is weird.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.280
 Every analogy breaks down eventually.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.840
 That one was pre-broken down, I think.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.640
 But that helped me understand that more.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.960
 But what I find amazing is in this, the crappy stage where they're the thing that creates

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.200
 the sperm and the egg, the sperm swim.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.560
 So this is why ferns only survive in damp environments

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.520
 because they need to swim through water to find themselves an egg.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.440
 So you've got little ferns sperm, something around everywhere looking for eggs.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.960
 That's very cool.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.520
 Yeah, but they didn't know how it worked for ages, did they?

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.960
 And they thought it must be seeds, but they couldn't find these seeds.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.400
 So they thought the seeds were invisible.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.000
 And what they thought was, if you could find a fern seed and carry it on you,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.120
 it would make you invisible.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.480
 Because they thought we had shit in the old days, didn't they?

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.200
 But that was, it was the idea that if you, you know,

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.560
 if you eat a walnuts, it looks like a brain, then it will help your brain.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.360
 And in the same way, if you managed to find an invisible fern seed,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.240
 it would make you invisible.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.280
 And how do you find an invisible?

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.880
 Well, they don't exist, the seeds.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.760
 No, I know, but like, if you were peddling that as an idea.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.680
 Do you think people ever thought they'd found one?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.720
 That's what I mean.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.520
 Would you sell, would there be a guy in the, you know, the alleys going?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.320
 I've got, yeah, some side-matchy beans, isn't it?

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.800
 Just a bag of invisible fern seeds.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.360
 And then, I think it would be really fun, if it, in like a medieval Truman show way,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.120
 to have an entire village persuade someone that they were invisible.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.960
 So if you let someone sink, you've got some fern seeds,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.920
 and then he buys them, and then everyone just pretends they can't see him for the rest of his life.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.040
 Yeah.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.520
 In 2015, there was a fern found in the French mountains,

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.920
 which was the offspring of two groups of ferns,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.520
 which haven't interbred in 60 million years.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.160
 They split into separate lines of descent that long ago,

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.200
 and one of the authors of the paper on this is called Kathleen Pryor.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.160
 She said, "Reproducing after such long evolutionary breakup

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.640
 is akin to an elephant hybridising with a manatee or a human with a lemur."

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.280
 Wow.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.120
 But she did, she did also say,

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.600
 although to most people, they just look like two ferns.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.160
 And that is incredible.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.320
 And it also implies that we're all going to start

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.400
 interbreeding with other species until we go back to being a single-celled organiser.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.280
 Oh, wow.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.600
 Yeah.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.880
 Wow.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.520
 That's such an interesting idea, is it?

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.680
 So it really feels like that's the obvious conclusion to her all.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.720
 Isn't the problem that a lot of the people who we'd have to

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.400
 interbreed with have died out?

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.760
 So really, we'd have to breed with some of the underthales first,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.120
 and then the homo erectus, and then the monkeys, and then the lemurs,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.000
 and then some of the old fish eventually.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.600
 And then some of them aren't there anymore.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.160
 So soup.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.520
 This shit, the theory is falling apart.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.560
 Yeah, does this work?

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.840
 It's such a cool theory.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.960
 It's like the big crunch comparison to the big bang.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.520
 Yes.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.040
 Imagine that's how it all goes back.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.240
 What, sorry, what's the benefit?

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.720
 It's the benefit, Andy.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.840
 It's just kind of happened.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.800
 Just life.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.000
 It's just the way...

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.160
 Oh, you just think this is how evolution's going to do?

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.680
 Ah, it's just a great sci-fi idea.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.960
 It's just inevitable.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.080
 Started with the ferns.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.440
 And it ends with you having sex with the sealer kind of.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.400
 I'm not sure.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.320
 They'll be saying, as we de-evolve.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.880
 I can't believe they didn't spot this with those ferns.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.320
 All the players were there.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.280
 They should have known.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.640
 Fernmania.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.080
 There was also tulip mania, wasn't there?

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.880
 Mm-hmm.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.880
 I didn't know there was also rosmania.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.160
 Hyacinthmania.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.120
 Dalia mania.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.240
 And cactus mania.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.720
 Really?

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.280
 Yeah.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.960
 And carnation mania.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.120
 When were these around the same time?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.560
 No, cactus mania in the USA in the 1830s.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.080
 Rosmania in ancient Rome.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.200
 Hyacinth mania in Holland in the 1730s.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.320
 Dalia mania in England in the 1820s.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.640
 It just seemed to be a thing where every now and then,

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.680
 everyone would just love a plant and just go crazy for that plant.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.560
 And then stop.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.880
 And we haven't had a mania for ages for plants.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.720
 Well, no, but we have manias, don't we?

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.720
 I think maybe they just had less stuff back then.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.920
 They didn't have Bitcoin, did they?

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.320
 Exactly.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.280
 They didn't have tamagotches.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.800
 They didn't have Pokemon Go.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.760
 But they did have an abundance of rare plants.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.400
 Have you heard of orchid delirium?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.840
 Yes, so that still exists.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.400
 As good?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.920
 Well, as in everyone's still into orchids.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.600
 I would say that's the longest-lasting mania.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.480
 You could still, if you find the rare orchid,

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.440
 the police will look after it to make sure no one steals it and stuff.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:55.840
 Really?

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.560
 Yeah, wow.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.480
 That happened on the golf course that I used to play on.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.320
 As in, the orchid was found in nature in the golf course?

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.320
 Yes, so the orchid was just by the side of the golf course.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:06.560
 Yeah.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.880
 And then they had a policeman there kind of looking after it.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.080
 Wow.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.040
 That's so weird.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.760
 Why?

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.120
 Because otherwise, if you damage it, then you've destroyed an entire species.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.800
 Because it was extremely rare.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.320
 Oh, but couldn't you can dig it up and just cultivate it somewhere else?

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.600
 Well, they were quite difficult to.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.560
 Yeah, exactly that.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.360
 They died, basically.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.240
 If you try and do anything with an orchid, it just goes no, man.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:28.480
 Okay.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.200
 It's just going to die.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.240
 It's almost drawing attention to it to have a policeman standing next to it, though.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:32.640
 Yeah, you know what?

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.320
 I did play golf a lot on that golf course.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.480
 I was a member and I never saw the policeman.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.440
 Oh, he was very good.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.680
 Yeah, it's some of those fern seeds.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.320
 On a really rare plant, and how mad we go over them in 2010,

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.080
 a group of botanists were doing this routine plant survey on Ascension Island.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.240
 You know, it's the tiny island in the South Atlantic.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:01.760
 And they saw what looked like a tiny mini parsley sprig on a sheer cliff face,

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.360
 like sticking out of a rock.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.320
 And apparently, they, both of them, two of them saw it.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.200
 They instantly recognized it as a fern that had been described first in 1876.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.960
 Only seen two more times in history at the last time in 1958.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.040
 So instantly, both of them were like, oh my god, check that out.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.240
 So it'd been just declared extinct in 2003.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.720
 So obviously, they ab sailed down to it to check it out.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.120
 And then they thought we've got to preserve this fern.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.160
 This is really precious.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.440
 So they ab sailed down every day or a couple of times a week to water it,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.440
 and to weed it, and to care for it,

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.680
 and to let produce spores, because it was so valuable.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.080
 Yeah.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.960
 And then when it finally produced spores,

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.080
 that was obviously an incredibly exciting day, because they could collect them.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.120
 So two of them went down, and they have only 24 hours before the spores

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.160
 weren't used for anymore.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.480
 Yeah.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.040
 And they had 24 hours to get them to queue gardens.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.600
 And so...

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.640
 From Ascension Island.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.760
 From Ascension Island.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.240
 Yeah.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.240
 I'm not sure I could get to queue gardens from here.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.600
 I'm talking about three hours.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.200
 Well, they had some extra help put on.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.240
 So they rushed them to this airfield where they were flown immediately

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.400
 to RAF Brysnorton in Oxfordshire.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.640
 And a car was specifically waiting for them there

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.800
 to drive them straight to New Gardens.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.040
 And then they got on the district line.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.080
 Saturday else caught for four hours.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.880
 Wow, at least it there, no?

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.720
 Still there, and it's produced a few offspring.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.680
 And yeah, hang on.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.880
 That's so cool.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.160
 That's the census I've been.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.480
 I've seen films in the last week that were as long as good as that.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:35.440
 Okay, that's it.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.480
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.840
