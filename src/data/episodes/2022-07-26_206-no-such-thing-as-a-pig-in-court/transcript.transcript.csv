00:00:00,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:25,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting
00:00:25,00:00:31,"here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntermari and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered"
00:00:31,00:00:36,"around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,"
00:00:36,00:00:41,here we go. Starting with you Chazinski. My fact this week is that the dome of the Taj Mahal is
00:00:41,00:00:48,"held together with sugar, fruit juice and egg white. It's actually just a pudding recipe that they"
00:00:48,00:00:54,accidentally turned into muslim. This is also with bricks. There are conventional building materials
00:00:54,00:00:59,"in there as well, so it's actually a mixture of lime, which is probably delicious. Yeah, I'm"
00:00:59,00:01:04,"sounding more and more like a kaipere in here. Yeah, sorry, it's the other kind of lime,"
00:01:04,00:01:10,"you know, the one they build buildings with. Lime stone. Quick lime. Lime and it's mixed together"
00:01:10,00:01:16,"with fruit juice and sugar and egg and it's called tuna. C-H-U-N-A, it's all very food stuffy,"
00:01:16,00:01:22,"I know, with some shells, bits of shells and some gum and yeah, this was the plaster that's used"
00:01:22,00:01:26,on the inside of the dome of the Taj Mahal to hold it all together and it actually turns out that
00:01:26,00:01:30,"egg white especially was quite a common building material. But this is used in lots of places? Yeah,"
00:01:30,00:01:34,I think so. So I heard something in passing on the radio and I ended up looking into egg whites
00:01:34,00:01:39,"in buildings and there's quite a lot on it in like vaguely obscure books, so there's an essay"
00:01:39,00:01:45,"by a Filipino food researcher who has an essay called ""Eggs in Philippine Church Architecture"""
00:01:45,00:01:50,"and it's cuisine, as if cuisine is just a leftover. I reckon that you're the only person who's"
00:01:50,00:01:58,ever read that book. It's gotta be right. It's about Filipino churches. What's her name? Give her a
00:01:58,00:02:04,"shout out. She's called ""Peer Lim Castillo."" It's not obscure however if you're a devout chef"
00:02:04,00:02:10,"in the Philippines, it's like a massive seller in that community maybe. And also if you are"
00:02:10,00:02:15,"Filipino and you know about traditional Filipino recipes, this is really interesting. A lot of them"
00:02:15,00:02:19,contain just egg yolks. So in a lot of traditional Filipino food it's just egg yolk and that's
00:02:19,00:02:25,because they had so much leftover egg yolks. Millions and millions of egg whites were big used to
00:02:25,00:02:30,"build their churches. This is for centuries, absolutely true. So there's traditional food like"
00:02:30,00:02:35,"Briosh, a thing called Yema which is egg yolk sweets and it's just because there's loads of egg yolk"
00:02:35,00:02:41,"lying around. That sounds extremely untrue, doesn't it? That's amazing. Take it out with ""Peer Lim Castillo."""
00:02:41,00:02:49,"So here's a fact. The Taj Mahal was built by 22,000 workers and it took 17 years to complete."
00:02:49,00:02:55,"And 22,000 workers is the same number of workers as Facebook has and they've been going for 14 years."
00:02:55,00:03:01,Wow. That is very good. They also had a thousand elephants working in construction. I don't know if
00:03:01,00:03:08,"they're sorry I'm talking about the Taj Mahal now, not Facebook. Yeah they did, didn't they?"
00:03:08,00:03:12,Dragging all the building materials and I think they had some elephants operating pulleys.
00:03:12,00:03:17,Those are the especially trusted elephants that were working the pulley system.
00:03:17,00:03:23,"Because I don't fully understand pulleys. Pulleys are a really simple concept. God, if you don't"
00:03:23,00:03:29,"understand pulleys, I do worry about what else you're missing. And there was a story wasn't there that"
00:03:29,00:03:35,they cut off all the sculptors' hands after they built it. And so they couldn't build anything else.
00:03:35,00:03:42,"Really? Yeah. Do they tell you that? The start of the gig? Probably not. Ironically, they do ask"
00:03:42,00:03:46,you to sign something at the beginning and then there's no room for us. But what if they made a mistake
00:03:46,00:03:49,"and of course they said, ""Oh dear, we're going to have to get the second gallery redone."" Can you"
00:03:49,00:03:53,"get the guys who made the second gallery in? They turn up. Sorry. Yeah, I don't think they actually did"
00:03:53,00:03:58,do that. There's also a theory that they blinded them so they wouldn't be able to build anything
00:03:58,00:04:03,"as beautiful. But that kind of myth is for lots of different buildings like St. Basil's in Moscow,"
00:04:03,00:04:08,"has the same myth. I have my place, I have my flat repainted recently. I did the same thing at the end"
00:04:08,00:04:13,"of it. You know, I cut my bike's hands off and I blinded him and yeah. There was also a tale that"
00:04:13,00:04:18,"they use brick scaffolding, that's not a tale, that's true, which was quite unusual. They usually would"
00:04:18,00:04:21,use like bamboo or something. But it was said that they did it to conceal what was happening as they
00:04:21,00:04:27,built it. So it would be a big surprise when it came down. And then there was another thing. The
00:04:27,00:04:32,"brick scaffolding, Shah Jahan, who was the Emperor, who commissioned the whole thing and it was a"
00:04:32,00:04:37,Muslim for his favourite wife. He was told that the brick scaffolding would take five years to
00:04:37,00:04:41,dismantle. And so he had the bright idea of telling the workers that if they dismantled it as
00:04:41,00:04:45,"fast as they could, they could keep whatever bricks they removed. And it came down overnight."
00:04:45,00:04:49,"Supposedly, he tried to tell me that it was like made of delicious chocolate."
00:04:49,00:04:56,Is it true? Have you guys heard about the architecture being angled at such a case and built
00:04:56,00:05:00,"in such a way that should it topple over, it would fall perfectly away from the tomb itself?"
00:05:00,00:05:05,"Well, supposedly the minarets, there are four minarets around the outside and supposedly they"
00:05:05,00:05:10,are angled to fall outward rather than inwards. But I would presume that they're just built not to
00:05:10,00:05:17,fall over. I think we're building in a structural floor that meant that they only fall over in one
00:05:17,00:05:21,"direction. Yeah, I know. But at the same time, you've made half your building with eggs and flour"
00:05:21,00:05:27,and fruit juice. So you know how we were saying that it was built for his favourite wife?
00:05:27,00:05:32,"So it was what's his name again? Shah Jahan, it was his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal,"
00:05:32,00:05:38,"that it was built for. But there is a Muslim for his first wife on the other side of the river,"
00:05:38,00:05:42,which I've seen a picture of it and it's currently covered in black mold and cats.
00:05:42,00:05:48,"Black mold and cats? Yeah, just cats everywhere. Oh, just they're there, not covered in cats."
00:05:48,00:05:52,"It's just full of cats. Was she a cat person? Well, that's what they say now."
00:05:52,00:05:56,"The locals say, well, the whole of the cats are here because she was such a lover of cats."
00:05:56,00:06:04,"She's also a black mold person. That's quite cool though, just I read about how they clean"
00:06:04,00:06:10,"the Taj Mahal. So that one's covered in black mold. That one needs a cleaning. But the Taj Mahal,"
00:06:10,00:06:15,"in order to clean it, they don't do a classic sort of water-based clean. They give it a mud bath,"
00:06:15,00:06:20,"effectively. It's like a spa treatment, and that gives it the glistening white. Wow, and then"
00:06:20,00:06:28,I was asked to follow. You have put some cucumber on it. That's why there are no lights allowed
00:06:28,00:06:32,on it at night. You're not allowed to have big spotlights lighting it up because it would look
00:06:32,00:06:36,"beautiful at night, but they don't do that because that would attract insects, which would then poo"
00:06:36,00:06:41,"all over it. And these particular insects, poo green. And that's partly why it's been looking"
00:06:41,00:06:46,"a bit grubby in recent years. Oh, yeah. It's just constantly battling against excretion from insects."
00:06:46,00:06:51,"What an error. Yeah, an error pollution is getting so bad now that they think the mud bath is not"
00:06:51,00:06:57,enough now. They're going to have a shower post mud bath. I was looking to some stuff about building
00:06:57,00:07:04,"materials. I thought this was really interesting. So first of all, hair is added to plaster to make it"
00:07:04,00:07:11,"stronger. And actually, you will have seen this. So it genuinely adds proper extra strength. It's"
00:07:11,00:07:15,added to lime plaster. So any bit of lime plaster has got lots of hair running for it. You can order
00:07:15,00:07:21,"horse or goat or cow hair from just construction suppliers companies. And actually, if you imagine"
00:07:21,00:07:25,"like a broken off bit of plaster, you know, because I don't see little threads coming out, that I always"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"thought, I don't know, it's a dust that it all got together. That's just actual hair. Yeah,"
00:07:30,00:07:36,"looking like broken off plaster. And then there's, you'll see the goat hair. Isn't that weird?"
00:07:36,00:07:43,"That's very weird. Yeah. Also, sugar is used as a concrete retarder, which is a thing that stops"
00:07:43,00:07:49,"concrete from solidifying too fast. So if you need to properly shape concrete, you pour it down. And"
00:07:49,00:07:54,"maybe it's like a particularly hot day. So it will bake really fast. If you add lots of sugar to it,"
00:07:54,00:08:00,"which a lot of builders do, then that slows down the setting process. That is why builders always want"
00:08:00,00:08:05,lots of sugar in their tea. They then whip it out so they can stick it in the concrete. Have you
00:08:05,00:08:10,heard of the English equivalent of the Taj Mahal? It's a memorial to a wife by a grieving husband.
00:08:10,00:08:14,"And it's this thing called the Eleanor Crosses. Oh, yeah. So there's, yeah? Oh, yeah. There's one"
00:08:14,00:08:20,"just down the road. Yes, exactly. So they were built by Edward I in 1290. Queen Eleanor died,"
00:08:20,00:08:25,"and he wanted to commemorate her, and she died up in Nottinghamshire, and he commissioned a huge"
00:08:25,00:08:30,"spire cross. Everywhere her funeral procession stopped on the way from Nottinghamshire to London,"
00:08:30,00:08:35,he commissioned one of these huge crosses. So there were 12 of them. There are only three remaining.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"And outside Charing Cross, there's a restored Victorian replica. And it looks very cool, like a"
00:08:39,00:08:44,"little space needle. It's got three statues of a woman. And it was Eleanor of Castile, wasn't it?"
00:08:44,00:08:51,Yes. That's why. Yeah. And she had a triple burial. There's a rare. So her heart was buried at Black
00:08:51,00:08:55,Friars Station. I think it was something else before it was Black Friars Station. Why?
00:08:55,00:09:02,"They've just renovated Black Friars Station, haven't they? Oh, yeah. I wonder if they found"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"the heart when they were doing that. Maybe. Yeah. You probably missed that, wouldn't you,"
00:09:05,00:09:10,"with your big truck. I don't think you'd spot a shriveled 1,000-year-old heart."
00:09:10,00:09:14,But maybe it helps the concrete to set. It does. That's why it has to put a heart in every crack.
00:09:14,00:09:20,And her organs went to Lincoln Cathedral and her body went to Westminster Robbie.
00:09:20,00:09:24,"So where would you go to grieve at her grave site? Where was closest, I guess."
00:09:24,00:09:31,Guess that's not the true convenience of it. A good point. I think you would go to Black Friars
00:09:31,00:09:33,because of the heart. And easy train connection.
00:09:38,00:09:43,"OK, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that there is an ice"
00:09:43,00:09:50,"golf championship held each year in Greenland, 600 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. However,"
00:09:50,00:09:55,"because of the constantly shifting ice shelf, no players hold any records on that course"
00:09:55,00:10:01,because it changes on a daily basis. It's not nuts. So there must be no guide as to how to play the
00:10:01,00:10:06,course well. Is that right? There's a lot of guidance on how to play it well because it's you're
00:10:06,00:10:10,playing on icy terrain. You're allowed things that you're not allowed in a normal game of golf.
00:10:10,00:10:16,"For example, you're allowed to clear the path. Like in curling. Yes, exactly. You can, yeah, you can"
00:10:16,00:10:22,sort of just make it nice and a bit softer. The par is much higher. I don't really play golf or
00:10:22,00:10:27,"understand the rules. So it's a par of 36 per hole. Wow. OK. So in normal golf, you wouldn't go"
00:10:27,00:10:35,"above five. Right. Wow. You sure it's 36. Sorry. It's it's maximum handicap of 36. Ah, OK. It's"
00:10:35,00:10:41,"different. That basically means that you get more shots taken off. Right. Basically. Oh, OK."
00:10:41,00:10:45,All right. Otherwise the par of 36 will just be so tediously long. Golf's tedious enough anyway.
00:10:45,00:10:50,"Imagine if it was 36 shots per hole. I mean, is that what we're going to say that golf's tedious?"
00:10:50,00:11:00,I've got some stuff about that. So just a bit of explanation about this. This is played in a town called
00:11:00,00:11:08,"a set up by a man called Arnie Nyman. He's a hotel manager. And it's this tiny, tiny town. It's got"
00:11:08,00:11:13,"it's got, you know, just over a thousand residents. There's more dogs there than there are people by"
00:11:13,00:11:18,factor of three to one at least because you get everywhere by dog sledding. That's the motor
00:11:18,00:11:24,"transport. So yeah. And so he set this up in 1997. It's an annual event, except for when it's"
00:11:24,00:11:29,too cold and the course has to be closed because it's just too icy and impossible and you'd get frostbite
00:11:29,00:11:34,"the moment you step out. Maybe if it got too hot, they'd have to cancel it as well. Yeah, that's true."
00:11:34,00:11:40,"Yeah. And the ball is red, isn't it? The ball is red so that they can see it. The the hole that"
00:11:40,00:11:46,you hit the ball into is twice the size. So there's lots of different rules that get played. But
00:11:46,00:11:51,it's seen by golfers. I know you're a golfer and you probably didn't know about it necessarily
00:11:51,00:11:55,beforehand. But a lot of golfers talk about it as the craziest course you could ever play. So
00:11:55,00:12:03,"they actively fly out to this remote place to yeah, to be a part of this odd game. And it has"
00:12:03,00:12:08,all the holes are a bit closer together because the cold air is more dense and so there's more drag.
00:12:08,00:12:12,So I didn't realize this and the golf balls move a bit slower through cold air. That does happen.
00:12:12,00:12:16,"If you play golf, you know that when the cold weather's on, it just doesn't go as far."
00:12:16,00:12:22,I play golf once in the Himalayas where the air is really thin and it just goes miles really.
00:12:22,00:12:27,That's the best place to play golf. Is it not having to tussle its way through a load of air molecules?
00:12:27,00:12:30,"All the molecules. That's it. The molecules get in the way. Well, this is what's confusing because"
00:12:30,00:12:36,cold air is more dense because the molecules aren't moving as fast. So there's more drag. But you
00:12:36,00:12:39,"would have thought as you say, want to get an altitude and it's cold because there are just fewer"
00:12:39,00:12:43,air molecules. It must move faster because they get in the way. So it moves slower through some
00:12:43,00:12:48,"cold air, but then faster altitude sounds like. This is why golf is such an interesting game."
00:12:48,00:12:54,Is this what the commentary's like? I'm a bother to turn it on.
00:12:54,00:12:59,"You know the, I was reading about the dimples inside the golf balls. That doesn't really have"
00:12:59,00:13:04,"a proper science to it. It's just, what do you mean by that? What do you mean it works outside the"
00:13:04,00:13:11,"laws of physics? No, I guess you would look at any sort of sporting equipment and you would assume"
00:13:11,00:13:17,that the design and the shape was for a specific purpose and tests. And it sounds like original
00:13:17,00:13:21,"golf balls didn't have any of these dimples, but golf players prefer to play with ones that had"
00:13:21,00:13:26,"little indentations on them. But as far as I know, but you might know better, there's no exact"
00:13:26,00:13:31,"reason why it's that many dimples. No, I don't know why it is. It's easier to pick up a golf ball"
00:13:31,00:13:35,"with dimples than it is to pick up a golf ball without dimples. Yeah, they're like finger holes."
00:13:35,00:13:41,"If you're a little appucian. But then ping pong balls are easy to pick up. Yeah, I don't find that"
00:13:41,00:13:48,actually. I find ping pong balls almost impossible. You should play with sticky gloves. That's good idea.
00:13:48,00:13:53,But then you'd never let it go for the serve. What would it be a problem? What I do is I put the ball
00:13:53,00:14:01,"on a bit of string. Actually, this is all the problem. I think you would get my grip on the balls"
00:14:01,00:14:07,"to get spin on it. Yeah. And there might be a thing about bortices, but I just, you know, I don't know"
00:14:07,00:14:12,"what that is. Okay, James, here's a question. Have you found that golf has been getting harder?"
00:14:12,00:14:15,Because you've been playing for some years. How many years would you say you've been playing?
00:14:15,00:14:23,"30. Wow. Okay, so supposedly development. You've been playing since you were 32. It's just a"
00:14:23,00:14:34,"joke about your being old. Sorry. Yeah, I actually got the hurtful comment. Sorry. So supposedly"
00:14:34,00:14:38,developers have been building at longer and harder courses because professionals were getting
00:14:38,00:14:42,really good in the 90s and 2000s. And I think there was a conflation between pros playing on courses
00:14:42,00:14:48,"and amateurs. The equipment's a lot better though. Right. Just to be. Yeah, so apparently they're"
00:14:48,00:14:51,allowed with quite hard courses now these days. And people who might not want a very hard game of
00:14:51,00:14:55,"golf are saying, oh, I can't be bothered with that. Is that right? I don't know. There's a theory."
00:14:55,00:15:03,"It's hard for me to remember back so long. Well, I started playing. It was just sticks of wood"
00:15:03,00:15:10,"and golf ball stuff with duck feathers. And I remember on the first round, they said to"
00:15:10,00:15:17,Mary Queen of Scots. We should put dimples into these balls. Do you guys know about the most
00:15:17,00:15:22,"southerly golf club in the world? No, of course. So this is called Scott Based Country Club and it's"
00:15:22,00:15:28,"13 degrees above the South Pole. And if so, there are a lot of scuba birds around. So if you have your"
00:15:28,00:15:34,"ball stolen by a scuba, you get a one shot penalty, which seems harsh. They're always stealing the balls."
00:15:34,00:15:39,"It does seem hard. Yeah. But if you hit one, it counts as a birdie. So it's the one instance where"
00:15:39,00:15:45,"if you hit a bird, you get a birdie. I think that sounds cruel though. Do you mean hit it while it's"
00:15:45,00:15:49,"trying to steal your ball or you hit it as part of a hit and it's in the sky? No, it's part of a hit"
00:15:49,00:15:53,"in the sky. I don't think you see it trying to steal your ball, then you attack it with your golf."
00:15:53,00:15:56,"What happens when you do that? Because you don't want the penalty? No, you get arrested, I don't know."
00:15:56,00:16:02,"Ah, okay. This is a confusing game. I mean, you could just try and hit the skewer bird into the golf"
00:16:02,00:16:07,"ball hole, but it's probably too big. It's a ball hole. We really don't know the sport too,"
00:16:07,00:16:14,what's the name of it? It's called a hole. Interesting. It's good for the expert for once.
00:16:14,00:16:19,"I heard tell, James, of a thing about golf. I read that until January this year,"
00:16:19,00:16:24,you were allowed to ring up a tournament if you were watching at home and report a rule violation.
00:16:24,00:16:30,"I know that that happened last year. Yeah, and they've just brought it to an end. Have they?"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Lots of the tours have come together and said,"
00:16:32,00:16:36,"guys, stop phoning in. We'll just have some officials watching you know. But this used to be a major"
00:16:36,00:16:42,"thing. And also, if you committed a mistake and someone phoned it in, and you didn't know,"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"you would then, at the end of the day or the end of the round, you fill in a scorecard, don't you?"
00:16:46,00:16:50,And there's a penalty for filling in a scorecard incorrectly. Yeah. So you get the penalty for
00:16:50,00:16:53,"making a mistake, which you didn't know you made. Yeah. And then you get a double penalty for"
00:16:53,00:16:57,filling in your scorecard role. Exactly. There's so much. It's just qualified from tournaments.
00:16:57,00:17:02,I think Lexi Thompson had that done to her. Yes. Yeah. I read that too. That's not fair as the skewer bird
00:17:02,00:17:08,"thing. Yeah. Could you imagine if someone ragged in and goes, I'm pretty sure you hit that skewer bird."
00:17:08,00:17:15,"Do you, James, as a former accountant, do you prefer golf for the admin side of things or for"
00:17:15,00:17:21,the sport itself? Or does it combine the two loves? It's my two loves. Yeah. Sparta and admin. Wow.
00:17:21,00:17:26,"Filling in that form. Yeah. What's crunching numbers a lot of the time? Well, it's mostly just"
00:17:26,00:17:32,"adding one every time you hit a ball. Apparently, apparently a lot of high-end professionals can't even"
00:17:32,00:17:40,"manage to do that. Yeah. Ormanak, this place, just wanted to tiny little facts about this very,"
00:17:40,00:17:46,"very small place. They have notable people. With for such a tiny little town, you would think that"
00:17:46,00:17:54,"wouldn't be the case, but Miss Greenland was from from that place. Ormanak, she's married to an actor"
00:17:54,00:18:01,"called Nicola Costa Waldo, who you would know better as Jamie Lannister from the Game of Thrones."
00:18:01,00:18:07,"Yeah. TV shows. So, yeah, Jamie Lannister's wife is from this very tiny town where ice golf has played."
00:18:07,00:18:14,"Yeah. That's my fact. That's a good fact. Yeah. Well, you know, it's a very tiny, tiny place. Lots of ice"
00:18:14,00:18:20,"and game of thrones. Lots of ice, yes. Yeah. Winter is always there. It has come. Not much golf."
00:18:20,00:18:26,"Well, we haven't seen the last series yet. Very true. They're going to have to put a lot of golf to"
00:18:26,00:18:30,make up for the deficit the last year series. Wouldn't it be great if the last series is just golf by
00:18:30,00:18:35,all the characters? It would be amazing. I might start watching. And then whoever wins a golf
00:18:35,00:18:42,"ton of it gets the throw. Yeah, it'd be brilliant. Perfect. Did I money's on Brianna of Taf? Oh, good"
00:18:42,00:18:48,for the Game of Thrones. But then Cersei Lannister gets penalised because she illegally moved the ball when
00:18:48,00:19:01,"no was looking. A scuba bird dies. That's a grand finale. Okay, it's time for fact number three,"
00:19:01,00:19:07,"and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century, you could be executed in"
00:19:07,00:19:15,France for wearing stripes because they were the clothing of the devil. There was a cobbler in
00:19:15,00:19:20,"the town of Ruan, and he was also part of the local clergy, and apparently he got caught in"
00:19:20,00:19:26,"stripe clothes and he got condemned to death. It's such an easy condemned to death to avoid,"
00:19:26,00:19:32,"isn't it? I'd have to really, really like stripes. You are wearing stripes today. That's true,"
00:19:32,00:19:37,"but that's only because I'm not in 14th century France. Yeah, I'd just wear something plain. So I read"
00:19:37,00:19:42,"this in a review in the New York Times of a book called The Devil's Cloth, A History of Stripes and"
00:19:42,00:19:49,"Striped Fabric by Michelle Pastaro, and it looks like an amazing book from the review, I gotta say."
00:19:49,00:19:54,"And they think that maybe it was from the Bible. In the Bible, it says, you will not wear upon yourself"
00:19:54,00:19:59,"a garment that is made from two, and maybe in medieval France, they thought that meant you"
00:19:59,00:20:06,"can't wear stripes, and so they would send you to death if you did. It's such an extreme reaction"
00:20:06,00:20:11,"against something relatively, what we think is innocuous. Supposedly that even Zebra's,"
00:20:11,00:20:16,"I also read the same review that Zebra's were included in Satan's Bestiary, as they were thought"
00:20:16,00:20:22,to be a satanic animal. So was all Zebra's were put to death? That's right. That's why we don't
00:20:22,00:20:27,"have any Zebra's anymore. That's correct, they used to be huge in France. No, they would make"
00:20:27,00:20:33,"bestories, wouldn't they? And they put the animals in different places in the books, and the Zebra's"
00:20:33,00:20:39,"would be in the evil part. Such a, it's so mean to animal to just call them evil for their reason."
00:20:39,00:20:44,I guess we still do it a bit. But it seems like 14th century France was just you would be executed
00:20:44,00:20:49,for a lot of things that would seem ridiculous. You would be executed if you were a naughty pig.
00:20:49,00:20:54,"For example, like pigs were taken to court, actual animal pigs, and tried in court,"
00:20:54,00:21:01,"although we do execute pigs now. Yeah, even the nice ones. Yeah, but we don't take them to court."
00:21:01,00:21:04,No. To charge them. We don't have lawyers. They deserve a trial.
00:21:04,00:21:11,"You're right. Actually, we've gone worse. That's true. Bacon's going to get a lot rarer if every"
00:21:11,00:21:14,pig has to go through a full judicial process. The appeals process is much like that.
00:21:14,00:21:21,"It's weird that stripes have often been negative associations though, because stripes"
00:21:21,00:21:28,obviously were the attire of prisoners for since the 19th century. That was seen as a badge of shame.
00:21:28,00:21:33,"In fact, it was so much so that by the mid-20th century, prisoners would stop wearing stripes,"
00:21:33,00:21:38,"and that's where the jumpsuit came on the all-one colour jumpsuit, because it was kind of unfair,"
00:21:38,00:21:43,"because it was so associated with this shameful thing. And weirdly, they are coming back in."
00:21:43,00:21:47,"I think maybe it's a sign of the direction that America is going in, but because it shows"
00:21:47,00:21:51,"you're tough on crime, if you introduce stripes, because it's a proper badge of ""I'm a prisoner."""
00:21:51,00:21:57,"So it's like stripes of the new orange, which is a new black stripe of the orange, absolutely right?"
00:21:57,00:22:01,"Supposedly, the stripes in prison's thing is not connected to this 14th-century France thing,"
00:22:01,00:22:07,"as in the author of this book, Mr. Pasteurot, just has found no direct link, so there's no guarantee."
00:22:07,00:22:12,But prostitutes used to wear stripes. And jugglers?
00:22:12,00:22:17,Prostitutes and jugglers. Prostitutes. Too much dangerous groups in society.
00:22:17,00:22:22,"Clowns, hangmen, lepers. It's a mixed face, isn't it? Hangmen and clowns."
00:22:22,00:22:27,"Is this breadin or is this France? This is going to be Europe, you should think."
00:22:27,00:22:32,"So you've got prostitutes, jugglers, clowns, hangmen, lepers, cripples, heretics,"
00:22:32,00:22:38,"Jews, Africans, bastards and the condemned. Wow. Did you book the clown for a random party?"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"No, but I got a condemned man, a leper, and a bastard."
00:22:43,00:22:49,"Yeah, it's all people who have outside society, wasn't it? That was kind of..."
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Jugglers, come on."
00:22:50,00:22:54,Juggling is not a normal social profession.
00:22:54,00:22:59,"Imagine that. I tell you what, if you've got condemned to death for juggling,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,then that's an easier thing not to do than wearing stripes.
00:23:02,00:23:03,It is very easy not to do.
00:23:04,00:23:11,"Oh, my God. If you accidentally dropped something, and then you caught it just as it was falling."
00:23:11,00:23:21,"Death. I like that in France, in the 14th century, they tried to band those long-toed shoes"
00:23:21,00:23:26,that you see almost as parodies. This is my favourite fact ever.
00:23:26,00:23:31,Because they band specifically band shoes shaped like penises.
00:23:34,00:23:38,"Because they got bigger and bigger and bigger, and more pointy and pointy and pointy."
00:23:38,00:23:41,"And then someone thought, ""I'm going to make mine look like a penis."""
00:23:41,00:23:46,"And then they were like, ""We're going to have to put a stop to this."""
00:23:46,00:23:48,I think it's so good.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"You don't get shoes shaped like penises now, do you?"
00:23:50,00:23:52,No. So they did. It worked.
00:23:52,00:23:58,"So the long-pointy shoe thing, they tried to band that in France."
00:23:58,00:24:03,"And in England, you could get them in the 14th century as long as two feet"
00:24:03,00:24:06,"in length, that sort of long point."
00:24:06,00:24:10,"And they were very fashionable and cool, but they were never practical if you had to"
00:24:10,00:24:15,"suddenly make a dash, you know, if someone was chasing you or whatever."
00:24:15,00:24:18,"So what they used to do is if they knew that they were in trouble,"
00:24:18,00:24:22,"they would cut off the fronts of them, and then they would dash off."
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Nice, like a lizard."
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Yeah, exactly."
00:24:24,00:24:25,So cool.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:24:27,00:24:30,You couldn't have a mullet either in the 13th century.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"You couldn't have an Irish hairstyle, which it turns out Irish hairstyles were having"
00:24:33,00:24:36,the top of your head shaved and then a long head down at the bottom.
00:24:36,00:24:37,Wow. Like a mullet.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Like a bullet.
00:24:38,00:24:39,Like a bullet.
00:24:39,00:24:41,A bold mullet.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Like a bold mullet.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"Oh, yeah, I thought that a mullet, that was a name for the bold head."
00:24:45,00:24:49,"No, a mullet was more like shot on top and long at the back."
00:24:49,00:24:51,Whereas a completely bold on top.
00:24:51,00:24:53,Like the Bill Bailey style.
00:24:53,00:24:56,Why weren't you allowed an Irish hairstyle?
00:24:56,00:25:00,"It was a classic kind of racism, you know, they thought the Irish were a bit barbaric,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,and then they had this weird hairstyle.
00:25:02,00:25:04,So don't do the hairstyle otherwise you're a barbarian.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"They had something this week where there's a school that's banned them,"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"meet me at McDonald's haircut, which is the opposite of that."
00:25:11,00:25:16,A mullet is like kind of curly and long on top and then shaved on the sides.
00:25:16,00:25:17,That all the kids have.
00:25:17,00:25:19,Why is it called meet me at McDonald's?
00:25:19,00:25:20,I don't think anyone knows.
00:25:20,00:25:22,I think actually people under the age of 20 know.
00:25:22,00:25:26,"And then people of our age are just like, why do they call it that?"
00:25:26,00:25:27,And they're refusing to tell us.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"In the Elizabethan era, only royalty could wear leopard."
00:25:30,00:25:32,Leopard skin.
00:25:32,00:25:34,Completely limited to royalty.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"Yeah, I mean, there weren't many, there weren't thousands of leopards around,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"which, you know, depends on the availability of leopards."
00:25:38,00:25:39,That's really good.
00:25:39,00:25:44,"Yeah, and Yomans wives, there was, there were, due to these summary laws,"
00:25:44,00:25:50,"Yomans wives were only allowed to wear lamb, rabbit, fox, or cat for nothing else."
00:25:50,00:25:51,The leopard is a type of cat.
00:25:51,00:25:53,Oh yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:57,"I'm just saying, if I was a Yoman and my wife wanted to wear leopard,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,I'd let her wear leopard and then just argue.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"Well, she'd be arrested and put in prison and she'd blame you."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Because she said, are you sure I'm okay to wear this outside?"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"And you said, yeah, it's officially a cat."
00:26:07,00:26:07,Yeah.
00:26:07,00:26:09,They'll find that out in 500 years.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Maybe.
00:26:10,00:26:15,How terrible husband.
00:26:15,00:26:16,(laughs)
00:26:16,00:26:27,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:26:27,00:26:31,My fact is that Victorian Britain had such a fern mania for so many years
00:26:31,00:26:34,that some species were almost completely wiped out.
00:26:34,00:26:35,Yeah.
00:26:35,00:26:40,There was this massive fern craze and it lasted 50 years.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"Victorian Britain, all the other stuff they did,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,they were basically just killing time in between collecting more ferns.
00:26:46,00:26:49,So people would go on these huge collecting parties into the countryside
00:26:49,00:26:53,and they collect ferns for their homes and there were so many collectors going out
00:26:53,00:26:56,that there's one species called the Kilani fern
00:26:56,00:27:01,which was almost wiped out in the UK and it's barely clung on to survival.
00:27:01,00:27:03,So it was a huge problem.
00:27:03,00:27:05,"Well, it was a problem but on the other hand,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,they were doing lots of crossbreeding.
00:27:07,00:27:10,So they invented a whole load of new species.
00:27:10,00:27:13,So actually by the end there were more species than where you started.
00:27:13,00:27:14,That's cool.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Yeah.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"So for example,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,"custard creams, the biscuits."
00:27:19,00:27:20,Yeah.
00:27:20,00:27:21,They have ferns on them.
00:27:21,00:27:23,You know that curly design on a custard cream.
00:27:23,00:27:23,Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:24,That's a fern.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"Yeah, it's so good."
00:27:25,00:27:26,From fern mania days.
00:27:26,00:27:27,From fern mania days.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Is that...
00:27:28,00:27:30,This isn't actually that useful for a podcast
00:27:30,00:27:33,but I think we've got a fern in this very room haven't we?
00:27:33,00:27:33,Is that a fern?
00:27:33,00:27:34,Is that a fern?
00:27:34,00:27:35,I don't think it is a fern.
00:27:35,00:27:36,I don't think it is a fern.
00:27:36,00:27:38,It looks like just a pot plant for me.
00:27:38,00:27:43,Because ferns have got these kind of fractal biscuits coming off.
00:27:43,00:27:44,"No, they're more intricate, aren't they?"
00:27:44,00:27:46,"Sorry, Andy's giving me a look like literally."
00:27:46,00:27:48,"I just saw a dog and said, look at that lovely horse."
00:27:48,00:27:49,Okay.
00:27:49,00:27:53,They're coming from a guy who doesn't know how polys work.
00:27:53,00:27:55,It's literally named after the thing you do.
00:27:55,00:27:56,You just pull it.
00:27:56,00:27:59,Andy turns up in the poly and just pushes it.
00:27:59,00:28:00,What's going on?
00:28:00,00:28:04,"And with fern mania,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,they marketed it as something that only appealed to intelligent people.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"They said that's really good bit of marketing, isn't it?"
00:28:11,00:28:12,So clever.
00:28:12,00:28:12,Yeah.
00:28:12,00:28:17,And the other nice thing about it was railways were spreading across the country
00:28:17,00:28:20,so you could go on more expeditions than you could before.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Literally travel was easier
00:28:21,00:28:24,and you got to maybe talk to the opposite sex without a chaperone.
00:28:24,00:28:25,So that was a big draw.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Well, that seemed to be the big thing"
00:28:27,00:28:29,from the bits of reading that I did about it.
00:28:29,00:28:30,The big thing was ferns.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"No, no."
00:28:32,00:28:34,Ferns was tinder.
00:28:34,00:28:37,"Ferns allowed you, as Andy says, to talk to the opposite of sex"
00:28:37,00:28:38,and go on adventure.
00:28:38,00:28:39,You always say this.
00:28:39,00:28:40,I like to have sex.
00:28:40,00:28:42,Opposite sex.
00:28:42,00:28:45,Yes.
00:28:45,00:28:47,Opposite sex is marriage.
00:28:47,00:28:47,Yes.
00:28:47,00:28:52,"Just on the flirting thing,"
00:28:52,00:28:55,I think it was also kind of liberating for women.
00:28:55,00:28:58,So it was quite an important phenomenon for women's liberation
00:28:58,00:29:02,because it was something that was deemed acceptable for them to do on their own.
00:29:02,00:29:04,So it wasn't really acceptable for women to go out without a chaperone
00:29:04,00:29:06,for many reasons at all.
00:29:06,00:29:06,Right.
00:29:06,00:29:09,Fernmania was particularly attractive to the ladies
00:29:09,00:29:10,because whatever they like collecting plants
00:29:10,00:29:13,and so they could all go out on their own and collect them.
00:29:13,00:29:16,So it gave them all this independence and this adventure
00:29:16,00:29:17,and really caused suffrage.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Wow.
00:29:18,00:29:20,Made a big leap.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Big leap.
00:29:21,00:29:21,Gonna stick to it.
00:29:21,00:29:28,"Yeah, it sounds like it sort of just took over, well, let's say,"
00:29:28,00:29:29,London even.
00:29:29,00:29:31,Just every theatre suddenly became
00:29:31,00:29:32,packed with it.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"The orchestra pits, they just used to just turn it into"
00:29:35,00:29:36,basically a botanical garden.
00:29:36,00:29:41,It was just the orchestra would just cover it in ferns as they were playing.
00:29:41,00:29:44,But people loved it because they were there for the ferns more than the music even.
00:29:44,00:29:46,"Yeah, I think that was the Prince of Wales theatre"
00:29:46,00:29:48,was where they did that turn it into a fernery.
00:29:48,00:29:52,"And it was, we should say, it was all because of this thing called the Wardian case,"
00:29:52,00:29:56,"which is, which Andy looks really excited about already."
00:29:56,00:30:00,But this was invented in 1829 by Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward
00:30:00,00:30:04,"and it was basically, he accidentally discovered that in a glass"
00:30:04,00:30:08,"airtight jar ferns could survive and it meant that ferns, which wouldn't have been"
00:30:08,00:30:12,"able to cope with the British climate until then, when they've been imported from China"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"or Australia or whatever, could suddenly survive in these jars."
00:30:15,00:30:18,And these Wardian cases became really fashionable.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"So if you were anyone in high society, you had to have this big,"
00:30:21,00:30:25,"beautiful, Wardian case full of ferns sitting on your dining room table."
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Can you still get them, do you think?"
00:30:26,00:30:28,"Ooh, maybe antique ones."
00:30:28,00:30:30,I don't know if you could buy new ones.
00:30:30,00:30:33,Or maybe you can because I'm looking at kind of decorating my spare room
00:30:34,00:30:36,with curiosities and stuff.
00:30:36,00:30:38,"So I thought, like a Wardian case would be really good."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"Ferns with ferns, yeah."
00:30:40,00:30:41,Because they're really lovely looking.
00:30:41,00:30:42,I think that's a great idea.
00:30:42,00:30:44,They do look gorgeous.
00:30:44,00:30:49,I think Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward might be the man who won the Second World War.
00:30:49,00:30:50,"Oh god, here we go."
00:30:50,00:30:51,This is a nice spot.
00:30:51,00:30:54,So ferns got a suffrage man winning the Second World War.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Pretty much.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"Okay, so basically..."
00:30:57,00:30:58,Could he also invent Facebook?
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Yes, he did."
00:31:01,00:31:05,"So his whole innovation, he's covered it kind of a little bit by mistake."
00:31:05,00:31:08,But when he realized that these hermetically sealed things
00:31:08,00:31:10,"you could keep a fern alive in them,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"he built two custom made cases,"
00:31:12,00:31:15,He had a carpenter and he sent them to Sydney full of ferns.
00:31:15,00:31:17,"Okay, so they were on the boat for six months."
00:31:17,00:31:18,They got there.
00:31:18,00:31:18,They were alive.
00:31:18,00:31:19,They were all fine.
00:31:19,00:31:20,So that was incredible.
00:31:20,00:31:23,"So then he filled his case up with Australian ferns,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,which previously they'd never been able to get to the UK.
00:31:26,00:31:27,And they returned.
00:31:27,00:31:29,So they arrived about 18 months later.
00:31:29,00:31:30,"Very, very long journey."
00:31:30,00:31:36,"And it completely changed the entire world history of botany, basically."
00:31:36,00:31:41,So it meant that tea plants could be transplanted to India from China.
00:31:41,00:31:44,So that created the British Empire in a no small way.
00:31:44,00:31:45,Wow.
00:31:45,00:31:47,It contributed to the British Empire's rise.
00:31:47,00:31:49,Smash the Chinese tea monopoly.
00:31:49,00:31:54,And it meant that rubber trees could be brought from Brazil to Q Gardens in the UK
00:31:54,00:31:56,and then to Malaya and Sri Lanka.
00:31:56,00:31:58,And that created the British colonial rubber industry
00:31:58,00:32:01,which was very significant in the Second World War.
00:32:01,00:32:05,But then I think it also sounds like you're saying he invented colonialism.
00:32:05,00:32:08,It massively changed the imperial project.
00:32:08,00:32:09,That's true.
00:32:09,00:32:12,That's the diplomat's response to that.
00:32:12,00:32:17,"Well, it's just like huge unintended consequences."
00:32:17,00:32:20,"I guess of this, of this hermetically sealed case"
00:32:20,00:32:22,which just meant suddenly you could move plants around the world like ever before.
00:32:22,00:32:25,"Also, Russia and America played a big part in winning the Second World War"
00:32:25,00:32:26,and I should make that clear.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"Wasn't just, it wasn't just this one guy."
00:32:28,00:32:30,"No, but, you know, yeah."
00:32:30,00:32:32,"That's pretty, no, that's pretty cool."
00:32:32,00:32:36,It's often very amazing and mind blowing to hear how a tiny
00:32:36,00:32:42,invention somehow impacts a world in a way that you previously thought it was just flirting.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"I don't know, okay, that's all it was."
00:32:45,00:32:46,"All of your notes on Tinder, Dan."
00:32:46,00:32:49,"Yeah, it's amazing that Tinder helps us win World War 3."
00:32:49,00:32:54,Do you know how ferns have sex?
00:32:54,00:32:57,"So they're really spores, which is known."
00:32:57,00:33:01,But then they sprout into a specific sexual generation which looks nothing like a fern.
00:33:01,00:33:05,So it's a specific organism called a prothalus
00:33:05,00:33:10,and that grows independently for several weeks and then that grows its own sex organs
00:33:10,00:33:15,and they produce the eggs on the sperm and then that sporo fight it produces grows into a new fern.
00:33:15,00:33:21,But it's like if we had sex and then gave birth to something that wasn't a person
00:33:21,00:33:23,and then that person then produced a person.
00:33:23,00:33:24,"Yeah, that is weird."
00:33:24,00:33:30,"The double stage. You don't want to be, I don't think, in the crap generation that's only got half"
00:33:30,00:33:34,the right number of chromosomes and that just its job is to make this sperm and the egg
00:33:34,00:33:36,which then create the real one.
00:33:36,00:33:39,It's like if we get birth to penis this.
00:33:39,00:33:43,"No, it's like if we gave birth to testis and ovaries."
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Yeah, it is, yeah."
00:33:44,00:33:47,And then the human grows off of it.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"Well, then the testis and the ovaries would hang out together"
00:33:50,00:33:54,and then they'd bump into some more testis and ovaries and then they'd create humans again.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"Wow, that is weird."
00:33:55,00:33:57,Every analogy breaks down eventually.
00:33:57,00:33:59,"That one was pre-broken down, I think."
00:33:59,00:34:02,But that helped me understand that more.
00:34:02,00:34:06,"But what I find amazing is in this, the crappy stage where they're the thing that creates"
00:34:06,00:34:09,"the sperm and the egg, the sperm swim."
00:34:09,00:34:12,So this is why ferns only survive in damp environments
00:34:12,00:34:15,because they need to swim through water to find themselves an egg.
00:34:15,00:34:19,"So you've got little ferns sperm, something around everywhere looking for eggs."
00:34:19,00:34:20,That's very cool.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"Yeah, but they didn't know how it worked for ages, did they?"
00:34:23,00:34:26,"And they thought it must be seeds, but they couldn't find these seeds."
00:34:26,00:34:28,So they thought the seeds were invisible.
00:34:28,00:34:34,"And what they thought was, if you could find a fern seed and carry it on you,"
00:34:34,00:34:35,it would make you invisible.
00:34:35,00:34:38,"Because they thought we had shit in the old days, didn't they?"
00:34:38,00:34:41,"But that was, it was the idea that if you, you know,"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"if you eat a walnuts, it looks like a brain, then it will help your brain."
00:34:44,00:34:47,"And in the same way, if you managed to find an invisible fern seed,"
00:34:47,00:34:48,it would make you invisible.
00:34:48,00:34:51,And how do you find an invisible?
00:34:51,00:34:52,"Well, they don't exist, the seeds."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"No, I know, but like, if you were peddling that as an idea."
00:34:55,00:34:57,Do you think people ever thought they'd found one?
00:34:57,00:34:58,That's what I mean.
00:34:58,00:35:01,"Would you sell, would there be a guy in the, you know, the alleys going?"
00:35:01,00:35:04,"I've got, yeah, some side-matchy beans, isn't it?"
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:05,00:35:06,Just a bag of invisible fern seeds.
00:35:06,00:35:11,"And then, I think it would be really fun, if it, in like a medieval Truman show way,"
00:35:11,00:35:15,to have an entire village persuade someone that they were invisible.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"So if you let someone sink, you've got some fern seeds,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,"and then he buys them, and then everyone just pretends they can't see him for the rest of his life."
00:35:21,00:35:23,Yeah.
00:35:23,00:35:25,"In 2015, there was a fern found in the French mountains,"
00:35:25,00:35:27,"which was the offspring of two groups of ferns,"
00:35:27,00:35:31,which haven't interbred in 60 million years.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"They split into separate lines of descent that long ago,"
00:35:34,00:35:37,and one of the authors of the paper on this is called Kathleen Pryor.
00:35:37,00:35:40,"She said, ""Reproducing after such long evolutionary breakup"
00:35:40,00:35:44,"is akin to an elephant hybridising with a manatee or a human with a lemur."""
00:35:44,00:35:45,Wow.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"But she did, she did also say,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"although to most people, they just look like two ferns."
00:35:50,00:35:52,And that is incredible.
00:35:52,00:35:54,And it also implies that we're all going to start
00:35:54,00:35:58,interbreeding with other species until we go back to being a single-celled organiser.
00:35:58,00:35:59,"Oh, wow."
00:35:59,00:35:59,Yeah.
00:35:59,00:36:00,Wow.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"That's such an interesting idea, is it?"
00:36:03,00:36:05,So it really feels like that's the obvious conclusion to her all.
00:36:05,00:36:08,Isn't the problem that a lot of the people who we'd have to
00:36:08,00:36:10,interbreed with have died out?
00:36:10,00:36:13,"So really, we'd have to breed with some of the underthales first,"
00:36:13,00:36:17,"and then the homo erectus, and then the monkeys, and then the lemurs,"
00:36:17,00:36:20,and then some of the old fish eventually.
00:36:20,00:36:21,And then some of them aren't there anymore.
00:36:21,00:36:22,So soup.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"This shit, the theory is falling apart."
00:36:23,00:36:24,"Yeah, does this work?"
00:36:24,00:36:25,It's such a cool theory.
00:36:25,00:36:28,It's like the big crunch comparison to the big bang.
00:36:28,00:36:29,Yes.
00:36:29,00:36:31,Imagine that's how it all goes back.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"What, sorry, what's the benefit?"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"It's the benefit, Andy."
00:36:34,00:36:35,It's just kind of happened.
00:36:35,00:36:36,Just life.
00:36:36,00:36:38,It's just the way...
00:36:38,00:36:40,"Oh, you just think this is how evolution's going to do?"
00:36:40,00:36:41,"Ah, it's just a great sci-fi idea."
00:36:41,00:36:42,It's just inevitable.
00:36:42,00:36:44,Started with the ferns.
00:36:44,00:36:47,And it ends with you having sex with the sealer kind of.
00:36:47,00:36:48,I'm not sure.
00:36:48,00:36:50,"They'll be saying, as we de-evolve."
00:36:50,00:36:52,I can't believe they didn't spot this with those ferns.
00:36:52,00:36:54,All the players were there.
00:36:54,00:36:55,They should have known.
00:36:55,00:36:58,Fernmania.
00:36:58,00:37:00,"There was also tulip mania, wasn't there?"
00:37:00,00:37:00,Mm-hmm.
00:37:00,00:37:02,I didn't know there was also rosmania.
00:37:02,00:37:04,Hyacinthmania.
00:37:04,00:37:05,Dalia mania.
00:37:05,00:37:06,And cactus mania.
00:37:06,00:37:06,Really?
00:37:06,00:37:07,Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:08,And carnation mania.
00:37:08,00:37:11,When were these around the same time?
00:37:11,00:37:14,"No, cactus mania in the USA in the 1830s."
00:37:14,00:37:16,Rosmania in ancient Rome.
00:37:16,00:37:19,Hyacinth mania in Holland in the 1730s.
00:37:19,00:37:22,Dalia mania in England in the 1820s.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"It just seemed to be a thing where every now and then,"
00:37:24,00:37:27,everyone would just love a plant and just go crazy for that plant.
00:37:27,00:37:28,And then stop.
00:37:28,00:37:30,And we haven't had a mania for ages for plants.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"Well, no, but we have manias, don't we?"
00:37:32,00:37:34,I think maybe they just had less stuff back then.
00:37:34,00:37:35,"They didn't have Bitcoin, did they?"
00:37:35,00:37:36,Exactly.
00:37:36,00:37:37,They didn't have tamagotches.
00:37:37,00:37:38,They didn't have Pokemon Go.
00:37:38,00:37:41,But they did have an abundance of rare plants.
00:37:41,00:37:44,Have you heard of orchid delirium?
00:37:44,00:37:45,"Yes, so that still exists."
00:37:45,00:37:46,As good?
00:37:46,00:37:47,"Well, as in everyone's still into orchids."
00:37:47,00:37:49,I would say that's the longest-lasting mania.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"You could still, if you find the rare orchid,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,the police will look after it to make sure no one steals it and stuff.
00:37:55,00:37:55,Really?
00:37:55,00:37:56,"Yeah, wow."
00:37:56,00:37:58,That happened on the golf course that I used to play on.
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:59,00:38:02,"As in, the orchid was found in nature in the golf course?"
00:38:02,00:38:06,"Yes, so the orchid was just by the side of the golf course."
00:38:06,00:38:06,Yeah.
00:38:06,00:38:08,And then they had a policeman there kind of looking after it.
00:38:08,00:38:10,Wow.
00:38:10,00:38:13,That's so weird.
00:38:13,00:38:13,Why?
00:38:13,00:38:17,"Because otherwise, if you damage it, then you've destroyed an entire species."
00:38:17,00:38:18,Because it was extremely rare.
00:38:18,00:38:22,"Oh, but couldn't you can dig it up and just cultivate it somewhere else?"
00:38:22,00:38:23,"Well, they were quite difficult to."
00:38:23,00:38:24,"Yeah, exactly that."
00:38:24,00:38:25,"They died, basically."
00:38:25,00:38:28,"If you try and do anything with an orchid, it just goes no, man."
00:38:28,00:38:28,Okay.
00:38:28,00:38:29,It's just going to die.
00:38:29,00:38:32,"It's almost drawing attention to it to have a policeman standing next to it, though."
00:38:32,00:38:32,"Yeah, you know what?"
00:38:32,00:38:34,I did play golf a lot on that golf course.
00:38:34,00:38:36,I was a member and I never saw the policeman.
00:38:36,00:38:37,"Oh, he was very good."
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Yeah, it's some of those fern seeds."
00:38:42,00:38:48,"On a really rare plant, and how mad we go over them in 2010,"
00:38:48,00:38:52,a group of botanists were doing this routine plant survey on Ascension Island.
00:38:52,00:38:54,"You know, it's the tiny island in the South Atlantic."
00:38:54,00:39:01,"And they saw what looked like a tiny mini parsley sprig on a sheer cliff face,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,like sticking out of a rock.
00:39:03,00:39:06,"And apparently, they, both of them, two of them saw it."
00:39:06,00:39:11,They instantly recognized it as a fern that had been described first in 1876.
00:39:11,00:39:14,Only seen two more times in history at the last time in 1958.
00:39:14,00:39:19,"So instantly, both of them were like, oh my god, check that out."
00:39:19,00:39:22,So it'd been just declared extinct in 2003.
00:39:22,00:39:24,"So obviously, they ab sailed down to it to check it out."
00:39:24,00:39:27,And then they thought we've got to preserve this fern.
00:39:27,00:39:28,This is really precious.
00:39:28,00:39:31,"So they ab sailed down every day or a couple of times a week to water it,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,"and to weed it, and to care for it,"
00:39:33,00:39:35,"and to let produce spores, because it was so valuable."
00:39:35,00:39:36,Yeah.
00:39:36,00:39:40,"And then when it finally produced spores,"
00:39:40,00:39:44,"that was obviously an incredibly exciting day, because they could collect them."
00:39:44,00:39:47,"So two of them went down, and they have only 24 hours before the spores"
00:39:47,00:39:48,weren't used for anymore.
00:39:48,00:39:48,Yeah.
00:39:48,00:39:53,And they had 24 hours to get them to queue gardens.
00:39:53,00:39:53,And so...
00:39:53,00:39:54,From Ascension Island.
00:39:54,00:39:55,From Ascension Island.
00:39:55,00:39:56,Yeah.
00:39:56,00:39:58,I'm not sure I could get to queue gardens from here.
00:39:58,00:39:59,I'm talking about three hours.
00:39:59,00:40:03,"Well, they had some extra help put on."
00:40:03,00:40:06,So they rushed them to this airfield where they were flown immediately
00:40:06,00:40:08,to RAF Brysnorton in Oxfordshire.
00:40:08,00:40:10,And a car was specifically waiting for them there
00:40:10,00:40:12,to drive them straight to New Gardens.
00:40:12,00:40:15,And then they got on the district line.
00:40:15,00:40:18,Saturday else caught for four hours.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"Wow, at least it there, no?"
00:40:20,00:40:22,"Still there, and it's produced a few offspring."
00:40:22,00:40:23,"And yeah, hang on."
00:40:23,00:40:24,That's so cool.
00:40:24,00:40:26,That's the census I've been.
00:40:26,00:40:28,I've seen films in the last week that were as long as good as that.
