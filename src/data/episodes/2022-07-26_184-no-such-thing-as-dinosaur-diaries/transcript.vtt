00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
 *tongue bell*

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:23.920
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntamari and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.160
 Okay, my fact this week is that Avril Lavigne is the celebrity most likely to give you a virus.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 That's rude. That's rude. Why? You can get viruses in lots of different ways, not always in rude ways.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 Oh, okay, well in the ways I'm thinking of it's rude. You could be stood next to her on a tube, and she's got her cold, and she touches one of the poles, and then you touch it just afterwards, and then you touch your face, and then you might catch a virus that way.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.480
 Does she use the tube very much these days?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:26.960
 That's why she's the most likely. She's an obsessive public transport person. Of course I'm talking about computer viruses, and this is a study by McAfee, and it's the most dangerous celebrities, TM, study.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 Hang on, is it McAfee? I thought it was McAfee. I always had McAfee. I said McAfee as well.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.320
 Okay, well that sounds like you three are all right, and I'm wrong. No, not necessarily.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.080
 No, it's too nice. I don't think anyone's said it before now. Have they? You'll always see it written down. Don't you? Why would he speak it out loud?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.240
 Yeah, it's like Microsoft.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.560
 So the problem with this right is that if you start googling Avrilovine, it leads you to websites where you can get viruses.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280
 It can do. Apparently 14.5%.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.680
 Yeah, well I googled her seven times in the course of research of this podcast, and my computer is now riddled with this virus.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.240
 I've got no research on Avrilovine. I just stopped. I closed my computer. I have got a stalking case of Stuxnet.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.440
 It's weird because McAfee speculated about why it could be, and they said that viruses you'd normally put a virus in

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.640
 from the most popular searches, and so they think that the reason she's become the most virus-laden person

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 is because interest in her is suddenly peaked, because she's working on a new album and has an internet

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.960
 conspiracy that she's been replaced by an imposter. That's right. I would still say that she is not the most

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.360
 popularly googled person on the internet in 2017. I can think of one more. Oh yeah, Christine Aguilar.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.040
 That's right, yeah. Her husband Chad from Nickelback. Did they not split up? What?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.760
 They reunited. Did they? Yeah. God, James, do not do that to me. I know Daniel, you're a big fan.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.720
 No, I'm just worried that Chad will get sad, build up more material and release another Nickelback album onto the world.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.320
 Keep them happy, he's got nothing to say. So they do these charts every year, don't they? So in previous years

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.880
 they've had other celebrities. I think maybe in 2015 it was Ellie Goulding, who was the most popular?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.720
 Sir. And there's a men's and a women's chart as well, just because I don't think we couldn't possibly

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.680
 be expected to compute people of different sexes, both giving you a compute of viruses.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.640
 Well, I think women are susceptible to different viruses, maybe. Is that it? Is it? I don't know.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.200
 Who are some of the male ones? So Bruno Mars. I'm reading this list of celebrities and trying

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320
 to work out which ones have been and which ones are women, such as my pop culture knowledge. Just in

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.520
 Bieber, I'm pretty sure he's a man, Sean Diddy Cooms and Zane Malek, I think, are the only men in the top 10.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.000
 Is that Paf Daddy? Sean Diddy Cooms. It is indeed. Yeah. And Celine Dion's on there. Nice to see

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 Celine making an appearance. Another Canadian pop star. Yeah. So according to actually just in Bieber's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 Canadian as well. Just in Bieber. In fact, this is a very heavy Canadian list. Yeah. So supposedly,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.040
 Celine Dion is the top-selling Canadian artist of all time and apparently Avril Lavigne is number two.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.520
 James and I were trying to work out. Surely she can't be in it too, Avril Lavigne. I have bought

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.800
 Chanel Twain because she's got a lot of country fans. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know she was Canadian though.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.760
 Have you checked up? I didn't. No. Well, you brought her up. I didn't bring her up.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.160
 Oh, I did. I said she's number two and you went, "What about Chanel Twain?" No. I said, "What about

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.560
 Alana Smoreset?" Oh, yeah, he said Alana Smoreset and then I said, "Nope, beat her, and Chanel Twain."

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.600
 Yeah, that was me. Until now, I have been laboring under the Miss Avril Lavigne and Alana Smoreset

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.440
 are the same person. Oh, really? I realized now they're not. They're very different people.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.760
 Yes. Cool. That's awesome. Some others in the top 50. Anna Kendrick, number 13. I don't know who she is.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.920
 Oh, come on. She's very famous actress. Haley Steinfield, number 23. I don't know who that is.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.560
 I don't know who that is. Hey, Anna Taylor, number 45. I don't know who that is.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.680
 No. And Zendaya, number 50. I don't know who that is. Is it an impression you know all the others?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.160
 Well, the others were Will Smith, Jackie Chan. No. So I heard of them.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.320
 Doesn't ring any bells. Ashdenbrook? Is Ashdenbrook anywhere?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.720
 Which one? David. No. Actually, neither.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.440
 Any dimple bees make the list? No. Your computer safe, Andy, okay?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.640
 It's the idea that you are downloading things related to these people. So you're downloading

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.880
 wallpapers or ringtones or whatever. I think that's it. Yeah. So if you were to search for Avril Lavigne

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.560
 and try and find a little knockoff MP3 of one of her hits, then that might give you a virus.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.360
 I understand. Which I think explains why a few of them are pop stars. Yes, of course.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.960
 Yes. Because dimple bee didn't release an album. Well, he releases 45 minutes of absolutely blazing

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.920
 comment and analysis every week. So anyway, I was looking up computer viruses because as we

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.480
 got detained, I didn't know research whatsoever on Avril Lavigne. And the first ever human to get a

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.000
 computer virus got one in 2010. Is this like a cyborg? Yes. So his guy called Dr. Mark Gasson

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.840
 from the University of Redding and he had a chip in his hand, which he used to go through.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.560
 Should have put it on his shoulder. He used it to go through security doors and unlock his phone

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.560
 and stuff like that. The BBC described it quite sniffly, I thought, as a sophisticated version

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:32.800
 of ID chips used to tag pets. And he gave himself a virus as an experiment to see whether people could,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.360
 for example, hack into pacemakers in future. Yeah. And this is now one of the big worries.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.920
 And what happened when he gave himself a virus? Did he come down with a cold? What? I think he couldn't

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.360
 get into his phone. Wow. That's worse than a cold. Yeah. The future looks bleak. The first computer virus

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.160
 ever was the cookie monster virus, right? I think, well, I mean, I think there may be there are various

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.440
 claims of what constitutes a virus. But in the late 1960s, there was this cookie monster virus,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.240
 which was malware that froze your computer until you typed the word cookie at it. And then it kept

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.000
 freezing your computer until you typed the word cookie and you had to incessively feed it cookies.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.040
 And it was just created at Brown University to piss off their fellow students. But if you type

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:21.440
 the word Oreo, it cured it. Oh, that's very good. It is good. And there was one version of it which

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.360
 would demand that you type cookie incessently until you literally couldn't do anything because you

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.640
 just had to type the word cookie over and over and over again. And then eventually it would crash

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.280
 and the message would come up saying, I didn't want to cookie anyway. It was good in the olden days

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.560
 when computer virus makers were just having fun. Yeah. Yes. There was like a golden age of computer

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.560
 piracy. There was one called Casino, which would, you know, well, actually it would remove all the files

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.480
 from your computer. So it was quite bad. But it would also swear at you, you know, it would say,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:58.000
 you asshole, say, bite your balls. And then it would give you a jackpot slot machine. You got five

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.800
 chances to spin the wheels and get three matching icons like that for a machine. And if you didn't,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.840
 then it swore at you and then deleted all your stuff. So it was bad. But at least it was a bit personal.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.600
 Yeah. At least you had a bit of fun before you lost all of your life. Yeah.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.880
 But you still have a sense of humour, didn't they? Before the PC brigade. Do you know what the

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:24.480
 PC brigade does? Do you know what the American government has stopped worrying about this year?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:31.360
 Nazis. No, this is definitely about computer viruses. Right. Stuck's net. No.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.560
 Being hacked into by other countries. It's no. Yeah, they stopped worrying about that a while ago. I guess

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.960
 the thing that they've stopped this year is they've stopped providing updates on how they're going

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:49.600
 to deal with the Millennium Bug with Y2K. And this is thanks to Trump. Basically, there's an obscure

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.960
 rule that means that federal agencies are required to keep providing updates on how they would deal with

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:01.040
 the Y2K bug. And basically they've noticed that it was just costing a lot of money in terms of time

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.320
 because it was all this paper work constantly being having to be filed. So they finally have had

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.240
 it stopped. The Americans are no longer looking at how to prepare for the Millennium Bug.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.400
 That's quite sensible of Trump, actually. And I know you don't hear that very often. But if he was the

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.000
 only person who realized that the Millennium had passed and nothing had happened, then good on him.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.760
 I bet he was, because he made that a big feature of the campaign, didn't he? Do you remember? Stop that bug.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:33.040
 Do you remember the crowds chanting? Have you heard of Defcon? Not Defcon, the security setting,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.160
 where you say we're a Defcon 5 or whatever. This is a hacking convention, which happens in Las Vegas

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.720
 every year. So they converted on this hotel in Las Vegas. And one of the things they did this year

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.280
 was they hacked into U.S. voting machines and they rickrolled them. They got them to play rick-assly

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.000
 songs instead of making them... Well, they got the voting machines to play rick-assly songs.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.560
 Yeah, but why have they got microphones and speakers on them? Well, I presumably say things like

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.760
 thank you for voting. What do you mean presumably? I've never voted. You've never voted.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.640
 Not in America, no. That's weird though, isn't it? In America, what we're saying here is that if

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.080
 you vote in America, it gives you a little chewed afterwards. Well, it's not one saying, but it's

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.680
 what I presume. I presume they have microphones somehow. Guys, if you're in America, can you

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.600
 write in another saying that your voting machines talk to you as you vote? But there's a terrible thing

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.080
 about when you're a normal guest staying at this hotel during Defcon. You're just being constantly

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.280
 hacked into at all times. So there's an account of a journalist who went there and he basically had to

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.880
 turn off everything. He had to turn his iPhone into a brick, turn off Wi-Fi, turn off 3G, not use anything.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.400
 And the local UPS store, you know, they do printing and stuff, they said we are not accepting any

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:49.680
 printing of our hotel guests from links, in emails. We're not accepting USB sticks, we're only accepting

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.840
 very particular kinds of things because people just kept on hacking into the UPS store as well.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.800
 It's not having a bunch of kind of hardened criminals, even if they're not actually committing

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.640
 crime in this case, staying in your hotel and you would lock up all the minibars. It's like a

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.080
 pickpocket's convention. And all the people in the hotel who don't know about the convention

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.000
 is constantly having their pockets picked. Do you know who claims to be the most popular hacking

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:22.160
 target in the world? Oh, it is indeed. Mr. McAfee himself says he's the badge of honour for any hacker

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.680
 because he's Mr. Anti-Hacking software. But he tricks people by changing the pronunciation

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:35.840
 of his son Willie Nilly from McAfee, which it clearly is. So another celebrity whose name is

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:45.200
 associated with hacking is Britney Spears. And Britney Spears has an Instagram account and there

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.360
 is a thing with malware called command and control system. It's quite complicated, but basically if you're

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.080
 a virus, you need to keep getting updates, so you keep needing to go to different websites to get

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.360
 your updates. But the websites always move so that people can't catch them, but you need to know where

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.720
 the websites are. And so what these hackers are doing is they're using comments in Britney Spears'

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:13.920
 Instagram accounts to hide the addresses where these CNC systems are held. So if you were to read

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.120
 all the comments in Britney Spears' Instagram, you'd be able to go, "I do." Have you noticed any

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.920
 URLs hidden in the, I mean, the quite well hidden in code and stuff? Oh, well, then I haven't.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:33.120
 You read them all on face value, don't you? Yeah, I do. Keeping great Britney. So all they have to do is

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.800
 delete and these comments and the ones that are left are going to be CNC system. Wow. Does this

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.920
 mean that hackers have to have this massive knowledge of Britney Spears filling their brains now,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.920
 because they've had to plow through these series of comments about her in order to find their code?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.640
 My feeling is that the computer probably does it automatically, because the one thing that

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.720
 computers are best at probably is going through large amounts of data and sifting out the

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.320
 important bits. So they don't get to read the "I prefer to when she was bald" kind of comments below.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.800
 But they might see the photos, right? If it's people doing it. They might see the, I mean,

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.800
 when you're on the internet, you often see pictures of Britney Spears when you want to or not.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.560
 It's quite nice, though, that even though they are doing this illegal activity that if they

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.640
 did meet up, they will have all got a good knowledge of what she's up to in life and there's

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.600
 a common thing they can talk about. Yeah, yeah. So you reckon when all of the hackers kind of meet up

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.080
 once a year, they probably chat about Britney? They're probably like 45 minutes on the malware stuff.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.400
 Let's leave a good 15 for Britney.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:41.760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is there is a type of dinosaur which

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:50.720
 is almost always found on its back. Sexy. Sexy. So it's like lie back and think of Gondwanaland.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:58.160
 They didn't die having sex. Okay, because then you'd have to find an equal number on top of those

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.320
 angular soruses. So there's been a new study into them and basically 70% of them are found

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.960
 upside down, which is a lot more than other dinosaurs. And there were loads of theories about why

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.040
 they got turned upside down by predators because they have really have big shell on their back.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.720
 So you'd be able to eat the soft underbell? Exactly. Or after they die, their bodies fill up with gas

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.920
 and then they rolled over onto their back because of that and none of these theories are right.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.400
 And it's really obvious in the end the conclusion is that they got swept out to sea and then they

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.480
 turned upside down because the gas in their bellies was lighter and then they sank to the sea bed

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.120
 that way and they stayed upside down and then they became fossilized and other animals don't do that.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.200
 So that's the difference. And the way they bloated another animal stand is it because of their heavy

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.400
 shell. I think they all bloat but I think it's the shell which make a difference. And this is the

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.680
 cool thing to study this. The scientists from the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ontario, they studied

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.680
 Armadillo's because that was I guess a close equivalent in the real world. So they had a proper

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.120
 hardened shell like thing on their back. Yeah, and we said the name of the dinosaur. Yes.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.320
 Anclusaurus. Is that, do you know what that means? Anclusaurus, is that anything to do with?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:18.240
 Fused ancule means. So like fused together plates. Oh, okay. Yeah. So these guys just to give you

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.080
 a picture of what they look like. They look a bit like Armadillo's, don't they? They've got this

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.680
 big heavy shell. They look a bit like a tank but then they've got a massive tail with a big knob

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.080
 on the end. Yeah. Okay. And have we known about them for a long time and now we've just worked out

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.880
 why they're upside down? Yes, right. There's not like the new dinosaurs that we thought

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.640
 honestly were different upside down. Because we couldn't recognise them upside down.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:50.480
 Yeah. We thought they were tables. It would still be an upside down table. It would,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.480
 but a table is more easy to identify when it's upside down whereas a dinosaur is completely

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.120
 impossible to recognise. I try to think of something else with the legs in the air.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.600
 Fantasy power station. That's what we thought they were.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.720
 Thought they were many power stations. And they've got, I think they've got a very thick skin and

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.560
 this is part of the reason why this happens because their skin is so thick it can take the gas pressure,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.680
 the pressure of all those decomposing gases building up. And so that means they float for a while

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.960
 on their backs before thinking. Okay. And scientists call it bloat and float, I don't understand

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.960
 I run at least seen as they sink. Yeah. Well, they float at first. Sure. Sink doesn't rhyme.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.880
 Well, exactly. It's have to be then shrink and sink. Blows and float, shrink and sink. What

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:40.800
 rhymes with fossil ice? So this massive knob at the end of their tail, you would think that they

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.600
 would kind of swing it round to better people with, which they probably did, but it's, that's

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.560
 tail. There weren't people though. I guess, yeah. That's probably why they didn't. But they weren't

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.320
 kind of whippy their tails. They were fused. So they were kind of straight hard tails that they

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.280
 would bash people with the nubbly bit. Do you mean it was like effectively like a javelin then

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.760
 in that it was a sturdy, it's like a javelin, but with a shot putt on the end of it. Yes.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.120
 But then it's fused to your spine. Yes. It's like a javelin, but if you threw it, you would fly with

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.200
 the javelin because it didn't throw its tail off every time it was under its eye. It would be

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.160
 ineffective if it's like a javelin. I mean, I'm trying to picture the sort of shape and length of it.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.640
 It's like, you know, you know tails that animals have. Yeah. It's like that. Yeah. But it's solid.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.880
 Like a javelin? Well, like a javelin, yeah. It's a really strong simile. I don't know why I'm

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.720
 doing it. I don't know where it came up with it. Here's an interesting thing that that combines

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.400
 James's javelin tail with Andy's upside down table dinosaur. They've worked out recently

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:53.280
 polisia sores, which had the longest neck of any of the dinosaurs, I believe, 23 foot long.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.560
 What they couldn't work out, and this has been another dinosaur underwater mystery,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.600
 is how they could swim at speeds with that neck because the pressure of the water pushing the

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.560
 neck around just wouldn't work. And what they think now is that they actually extended their neck

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:13.520
 and held it like a rod, like a firm javelin, as they swam through the waters. Did you accidentally

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.280
 research javelins for this? So one thing about Diplodocus necks, originally it was thought they held

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.440
 them straight and upright at about 60 degrees, like a giraffe neck, which obviously was wrong.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.440
 But then it was thought they held them level in front of them and count about as their tail.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.080
 But that also has fallen under favour. And the latest theory is that they had a sort of

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.360
 swan-like curve to their neck. Wow, really? Yes, because almost all land vertebrates

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.760
 were just studied, like birds, for example, hold their necks in that sort of upright-ish curve,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.160
 like a pelican. Like a pelican, exactly. Like a bent javelin. Like a bent javelin.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:02.160
 Although there are some calculations, say that if it had held its head completely upright

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:08.720
 or at a rigid upright angle, using traditional methods, it would have had to use half its energy

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.760
 pumping blood to its brain. Using traditional methods. Maybe it had untraditional methods. Maybe

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:21.600
 it had some birds supporting it on either side. Using the old ways. Whichever way a dinosaur does it

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.640
 must be more traditional, whatever way we do. On animals lying on their backs with their legs in

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.040
 the air. I was looking for examples of animals doing this. It's actually quite rare and quite

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.520
 hard to look into. But there was a new scientist forum where someone posted a question which was,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.840
 "When I was younger, my mum used to drive us past a field with a horse in it. There was a sign

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.440
 that read, 'This horse is not dead. He sleeps that way.' And the horse was always lying on its back

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.880
 with its legs locked straight up in the air. Does anyone know what was going on? Is this common?"

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.560
 "I know you sure it wasn't the table." "Whether answer on the floor?"

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.360
 "There are lots of answers. Most people said the legs in the air make sense because horses have a

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.080
 locking mechanism which makes their legs, so when horses go to sleep, which they usually do standing

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.440
 up, then their legs lock so they don't fall over. But no one could quite answer the question of why

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.880
 it was sleeping on its back with its legs in the air. They all said that it's quite unusual.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.240
 Maybe it's just a special horse." "A special?" "I love having to put a sign up. This horse isn't dead.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.600
 Don't knock on our door." "I think I would put that sign up if I had a dead

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.880
 horse that didn't want anyone to know about it. It's just a sleep." "To save you having to go and bury it,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:41.440
 just put a sign up." "So we've talked about T-Rex arms before, I think, or everyone knows that

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:48.320
 they have these tiny arms, which look really impractical. So there was a theory that they would use

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.000
 them to stand up because the T-Rex is lying down to sleep. I guess they can afford to, but then

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.080
 how do they get up again? Or do they sleep like a special horse on their back with the legs in the air?"

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:04.800
 But the latest theory suggests that they did not use their arms to get up because they sometimes

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.840
 went a month without using their arms for anything. "We're not amazing. How do we do that?"

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.720
 "You know what that sounds like? Sounds like one of those charity months that you do for something?"

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:26.160
 "No umber, yeah, no umber. We can set that up." "How do we know that? That is a really fair question."

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.840
 "I don't know how we know that." "It's good that Diaries are something." "But then how do you write a

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.640
 diary if you're not using your arms?" "It's just an empty mug for the diary." "It's straight from

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:43.200
 first gen to second fab." "Sorry for not writing." "I've been raising money from different

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.320
 tokens around the corner." "Successful, no umber."

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:59.120
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact this week is that snakes that eat

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:08.480
 snakes can eat snakes that are 139% of their body length. So that is the equivalent of me as a

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:16.160
 six foot one person eating an eight foot four inch tall hot dog in one bite. But the hot dog is also

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.040
 as broad as you. "Yeah, it's a massive hot dog." "It's a big hot dog. It's yeah, I mean we should really

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:29.200
 be talking about where I got this hot dog from." "Hot dog is like one of those um it's like a mascot

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.160
 in a in a sport. They'll be about eight foot tall." "Yeah, that's all right." "And they'll be about

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.720
 human size." "They'll be one of those guys." "Yeah, so um I found this on a website called snakes

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:48.160
 along. Theflogspot.co.uk. And the reason I found it was I saw a video earlier this week of a snake

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.120
 eating a snake and what I didn't ever stop to think was when they eat snakes they do actually start

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:59.280
 with the head and they just eat it as a snake. They just like the equivalent of like a train going

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.480
 into a tunnel like it just disappears." "Yeah, but if you're a snake one you're not going to eat it

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.640
 bum first at you because that's disgusting." "Yeah." "And then two you're not going to eat it sideways

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.320
 like a car on the car bus or something." "So it's the only obvious way to eat that." "That's

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.840
 slightly what I thought though. I thought they don't necessarily I thought they would eat chunks

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.320
 of it. I didn't know that you just like I didn't know they swallow everything." "Oh yeah, I think I

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.800
 would eat a snake bum first if I was a snake." "Well for a start you get the bit you don't want to

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.120
 eat really very much out of the way first." "It's like saving your roast potatoes at the end

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.680
 of a roast dinner." "It's exactly like that." "Yeah and I do see that." "I don't have a second

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.840
 there." "The good thing is that it fits into you more neatly because you fit the body of the snake

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.560
 exactly into you like the length of a snake. So you're much more like a Russian doll of snakes."

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.640
 "Yes, that's true. So here's the issue though and which is what the headlight factors meant to be

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.840
 highlighting is that they can eat snakes that are longer than themselves. So that would seem like

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.880
 a bizarre move because they do have to eat it in one go otherwise if they take a break halfway

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.320
 through a snake. The rest of the snake can start rotting which is really bad for them in the digestive

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.960
 system or they have to haul another snake with them if they're escaping a predator so they've doubled

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.840
 their body size and their weight in order to escape." "Because obviously they can eat like

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.000
 huge like deer and stuff that stretch out their skin so presumably they just fold the snake up inside

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.560
 themselves." "No so that's the issue because of the length of the snake. Their stomachs don't go

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.160
 all the way to their tails. They have actually a lot of muscle down near the bottom so obviously it

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.240
 can only go as far as deep as their stomach goes. So that's the issue they need to work out when

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.920
 they're eating the snake. How can they fit that entire snake into their body?" "Yeah but don't they

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:43.360
 just fold it?" "They sort of concertina it." "Yes, they concertina their ribs and then the dead

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.080
 snake inside them is squished up and then the living snake outside can stretch out." "It's like an

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.920
 accordion. It's like an accordion." "Yeah so there is a myth that snakes which are owned domestically

00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.400
 stretch themselves out next to their owners or next to family pets so they're measuring them to see

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.840
 how long they are. This is not true. Another website about this. An amazing snake website which

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.680
 said "false snakes have no sense of measurement. They are not rulers. They do not know how long they

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.600
 are versus how tall or long anything else is." "I think that can't be true can it?" "But it's true

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.760
 that they don't in the wild measure out the deer that they're planning to eat because it would run

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:30.560
 away." "They must know how long they are though. It's so you know if you're escaping from something you

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.680
 know that your tail's out of its reach and stuff." "Do they have a sense of self I think is the

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.080
 question we're asking?" "Do they even know they're a snake?" "That's true." "But I think they

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.640
 must have a basic idea of how long they are must do." "Otherwise they'd keep thinking they were

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.840
 hidden well but actually their entire body." "It'd be like the four-year-old played hide-and-seek."

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:58.400
 "They just put their tail over their eyes. They can't see me." "They do sometimes eat their

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.360
 on tail don't they?" "Yes they do eat themselves when they get stressed I think." "Oh so that's not by accident.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.760
 They haven't." "Sometimes by accident?" "It is by accident." "I'm not that long

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.880
 that this tail could be here. It must be someone else." "They don't ever pray on themselves

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.640
 they get up to about a half way along themselves they think oh hang on." "They do do that." "Yeah."

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.800
 "Never eat bum first. Always happens when you do that." "Yeah they sometimes eat their

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.120
 on tail and it might be if a predator has been on their tail and it's got the smell of it

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.360
 and they just see a lot of them just work by movement and if the tail's winging around

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.560
 and it smells like prey." "But it isn't they're not supposed to as in it's not useful to them to

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:45.520
 eat themselves." "I was reading about an Australian guy called Tony Barton who saw a snake eat

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:53.520
 another snake so he saw a red belly black snake eat an eastern brown snake in his garden he took

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.360
 a picture of it and the snake as snakes do then went for a sleep because they can't chew they

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.280
 always go away and have to have a sleep so there's stomach and digest what they've actually eaten

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.760
 and he went back a bit later to check on it and he said the black snake had his mouth a bit open

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.680
 and he saw a pair of eyes inside the mouth and then he photographed the snake hauling itself back out

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.840
 of the other snake's body so it latched onto the snake that had eaten its jaw and pulled itself out

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.640
 and then slithered away covered in mucus." "That's interesting I wonder if that means he was eaten bum

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.600
 first though." "No he was eaten head first it's what he kept interesting. He turned round inside

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.440
 something." "That was very impressive." "Very clever yeah." "I don't think I'd have the way

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.080
 with all to do that." "Do you think you'd back up?" "I think I'd just lie down and die."

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.080
 "It might be completely swallowed by a snake I don't think I'm going anywhere." "Yeah really?"

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.160
 "I think I'll think of it." "Is that kind of defeatist attitude?" "It's going to make Brexit

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.800
 a failure." "One thing about when snakes eat animals they completely change they almost become

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.640
 another animal not quite but okay so for example when a python eats a whole deer right yeah it's

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:03.520
 metabolism gets 40 times faster and blood goes milky because it suddenly has all these fatty

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:10.480
 acids. It's heart increases by 40% in size it completely changes and this is so cool okay so when

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:16.480
 humans eat we increase our oxygen consumption by about a quarter because we need to speed up our

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.120
 metabolism we need to get more oxygen into our body to digest the food right after a python eats

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:28.480
 an animal let's say 65% of his weight it increases its oxygen consumption 36 fold wow huge

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.480
 amounts of humans when we're sprinting we increase 10 fold snakes do 36 fold and if a snake was

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.960
 to eat prey that was bigger than it was let's say one and a half times it was like you said down

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.400
 it might be taking it a hundred times as much oxygen that's amazing so when I was I don't know if I

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.440
 mentioned this but I was in Peru a few weeks ago and when you're in an altitude and you're eating

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.600
 you're always out of breath you have to keep stopping you can't really talk and eat at the same time

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.680
 because and now I know it like you say it's because you're taking it more oxygen he shouldn't

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.280
 talk with your mouth for the anyway James something mean say that prays for you but for snakes it must

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.000
 be 10 times worse right yeah that's what they lie in the sun is to speed up their metabolism

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 it's what they have to lie in the sun after they've had a big meal and it takes so much energy

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.640
 to digest the meal that when a python has had a big meal half the energy it gets from the meal

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:22.960
 goes on digesting the meal oh what a waste that's like you know when we say it takes up more energy to

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.760
 eat a stick of celery than if you get from it they say do you know it takes more energy to eat one

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:39.200
 of those baby deers than you'll actually get it completely pointless okay it is time for our

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:45.200
 final fact of the show and that is Anna my fact is that medieval street performers

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.880
 multiplied numbers together in public for entertainment it's great amazing and presumably

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.160
 they were quite hard numbers there weren't things like six times nine what they weren't not

00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:03.920
 54 chocolate some change here somewhere hang on James where's your hat um this is something

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:09.120
 I found in a book online a book called Lost Discoveries the Ancient Roots of Modern Science

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.120
 and it's basically the fact that in sort of late medieval times Arabic numbers were coming over

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.240
 from India so the numbers that we use today I come over here they count our sheep migrant refugee

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.520
 Arabic numbers were coming over from India and they were better than Roman numerals and you could

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.160
 do things like long multiplication and non division with them but the authorities in Europe didn't

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.960
 trust them so they sort of banned them so it meant that there were these street performers who kind

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.800
 of had this secret knowledge of Arabic numbers and so they could do what seemed like incredible

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.800
 multiplication I mean it was quite simple you know be like twelve times sixteen which obviously

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.440
 we can edit out the huge pause while we all work that out four times four times four times three

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.600
 it's hundred eight oh well it's not that then yeah that's it's 64 threes

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:03.520
 who would who would be there to sort of fact check them yeah that's a really good point that's

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.240
 such a good question I guess they just took on face value like yeah you come back you say I've

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.480
 got some multiplication it's correct trust me and they put money in yeah well when do we get

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:19.040
 Arabic numbers in the west in western Europe was it Roman numerals and today suds times I think

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.640
 yeah serious we just get them until after this is because this is what's so fascinating about them

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.440
 they were known to exist from like the sixth century and they started coming over there was a

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.560
 Pope who tried to introduce them in the tenth century into Europe and the authorities hated them

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.120
 they hated zero for instance can I just ask sorry to interrupt but which Pope was it because

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.880
 like popes famously don't use Arabic numbers do they it's always Pope Pius the X

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.960
 yeah you're right so they're the ones who are sticking with it you're absolutely right it was

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:57.840
 Pope Sylvester the two he actually he got in a lot of trouble because his real name was Gerbert

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:05.200
 of Aria which I like so Gerbert went to Spain and so he got from Africa some knowledge of these

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.520
 Arabic numbers and he went back to Italy became Pope and tried to spread this knowledge and people

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.000
 just thought it was black magic that he could actually add numbers together and do division and so

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.200
 they labeled him as a sorcerer and this dog Simp throughout his papacy the fact that he could perform

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.680
 this weird black magic I find that absolutely amazing I would have thought in the doomsday book you

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.960
 would have said there are six cheap here and you know you'd have the number six I guess not and

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.720
 what we're saying that is not the case no not as incredible didn't a doctor still as James said

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:39.120
 sort of early Renaissance Wow mid Renaissance and I was reading quite a lot about zero which was

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.280
 seen as like the pinnacle of the evil of Arabic numbers because it represented nothing

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:49.440
 nurse and that was seen as really ungodly but merchants in Europe kind of picked up on this

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.160
 underbelly of Arabic numbers and realized it's much easier to use them so they had to use them in

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.560
 secrets and so they'd flush zeros at each other which meant I use Arabic numbers we can use Arabic

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:06.160
 numbers in this translation What is the gesture with the hands? They do a ring with the hands

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.840
 you know that game when you're at school and you do a ring and if they see it below your waist

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.320
 you're allowed to punch them in the air unless you get your finger inside it unless you put a one

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.120
 in there yeah do you reckon that's an ancient kind of it's that's definitely I think where that

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:26.640
 traces back to yeah yeah this is actually why so the word zero comes from a word cipher which is

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.720
 also where the word cipher comes from because zero was used as a secret cipher thing and the person

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:41.040
 who named zero was a guy called Muhammad al-Quraizimi who also invented based on his name the algorithm

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:49.760
 so the algorithm is a corruption of the name al-Quraizimi cool there was a guy called Johann Martin

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:57.360
 Zacharias Deza he was German and he once multiplied 220 digit numbers together in six minutes

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.520
 okay which was considered extremely good at the time and I think now was that in his head in his

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:10.480
 head yeah it depends on what if it was just a billion time you know or a thousand billion time

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.280
 to thousand billion that's not actually that difficult it's true although a thousand billion is still

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.720
 a long way off 20 digits you're right but anyway he managed to do it and then he managed to

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:29.520
 multiply two one hundred digit numbers in eight and three quarter hours who was sticking around

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.400
 to watch that for sure I think you'd stay for the first hour and a half when you you'd want to come

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.160
 back for the ending though you wouldn't want to miss it yeah yeah and you don't know when the ending

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:44.480
 is going to be exactly so it's mostly attention thing yeah wow sorry we think he did this in his head

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.640
 or he did this in his head because the famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said that someone

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.400
 skilled in calculation could have done the calculation in half that time with pencil and paper

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.680
 okay which I think is a bit harsh really for someone who's multiplying hundred digit numbers

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.520
 yeah I think it is yeah I think it's a bit sniffy actually and I'm in the book God Lesha Bach which

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.640
 we have downstairs they talk about this guide days and they say that he had an uncanny sense of

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:21.680
 quantity he could just tell without counting how many sheep were in a field wow I mean again it all

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.600
 depends how many sheep there are in the field because I like to think that below a certain threshold

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.880
 of sheep I could just tell how many sheep there are in a field yeah well this is interesting so

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.800
 what is that number like how many would you you could definitely tell if they were four I could

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.280
 definitely tell if there were 12 by just looking would you know there were 12 no I wouldn't no

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.520
 what's the level um yeah standing in a three by four grid oh yeah I mean I could tell there were

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.560
 12 how often does that help I seldom from my studies because all you've really worked out there is

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.360
 that there's a three and a four you calculated the 12 I would instantly say there are 12 there

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.760
 sure that's because your multiplication tables are so good thank you you should be a street

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:08.240
 performer really low rent give me any number between one and four this guy could do his sheep thing up

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.440
 to 30 up to around 30 this is he would literally just 20 quick look and just see right he must have

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.840
 been a real scream at party this must be no we don't want to go out of the field again no come on

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.840
 just once more take me out of the field I'll show you or do you think you'd walk into a party and

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.360
 immediately go oh there are only 42 people here yeah if you were in a party and you could tell how

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.320
 many people were there and you could look at a place of canapes and know exactly how many canapes

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.400
 are on the plate yeah you would know whether you had to quickly go for the canapes in my experience

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:46.320
 there are very few people at the party and I never have to go for more canapes but the the Arabic

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:53.920
 zero numeral has come in very handy indeed you know in musco as a street as a busker you have to go

00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:00.000
 through a really rigorous process now to be able to busk and so this is to be able to play on the

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.240
 musco subway musicians have to actually go through this proper selection process where they are

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.640
 selected by a jury so they go in and they have to do this full performance to a jury of professional

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:18.800
 musicians and to a bunch of people from the TV talent show Voice of Russia imagine it's like

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:25.280
 so very high bars are clear imagine going in as a busker Simon Cowell is there yeah but also

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.880
 imagine that your Tom Jones on the voice in the UK and then as part of your job you have to go

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.600
 and watch a load of buses how to imagine that happening but isn't it true on the tube that

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.040
 they need to be a certain standard on the London underground they think there are rules I

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.840
 can't have people who are completely crap yeah because you need to you need to bid for the slots as well

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:49.760
 and also London has a code of conduct which advises buskers on one of the tips that it gave out was

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.000
 if you only know a few songs move to a new location when you've played them yeah very good advice

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.280
 yeah in Russia you have to perform two hours of original material two hours yeah before you can

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.000
 busk they're actually original material because people tend to want the hits don't they

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.040
 you know what kind of buskers new stuff i don't want to help home a cart these new stuff

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:24.640
 okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in
