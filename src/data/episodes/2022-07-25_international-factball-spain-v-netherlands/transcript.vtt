00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello, and welcome to no such thing as a fish presents the World Cup of Facts

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 This is the only football podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of the sport whatsoever brought to you by the QILs in

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:21.660
 Association with Visitingland.com. My name is Dan Traurer. Joining me today is Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Annie Chazinski, and today's match is Spain versus Netherlands, okay?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.540
 Let's kick off. What's quite interesting about Spain?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 I want to mention the most brilliant festival in Spain. Baby Jumping, it's a traditional Spanish holiday. The date is back to 1620, and you lay out babies on the street, and people jump over them as far as they can, and it's supposed to rid the babies of sin.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.820
 It's pretty damn cool, unless it's your baby.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:54.500
 I have a matching festival which involves goat tossing. It's celebrated in manganese, still a polvorosa, and a bit of the ceremonies where a group of young men throw a live goat from the top of a church,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 and then a crowd catches it in a big sheet. So it, and all rights groups got very annoyed about this. The safety got mad. The practice was banned, but they did throw one in the 2014 celebration.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.940
 They have rat tossing as well, a rat tossing festival. It's in El Puyg in Spain, I don't know if that's how you pronounce it. They love to toss animals.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.060
 I have a fact about Spain, yeah. When did the Spanish Armada end? 1588. No, no, no, no, it's still going. What?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 Yep, the Spanish Navy is still called the Armada Española. Well Spain produces more wine than France. It has the largest area of vineyards in the world, and last year for the first time it overtook France in wine production.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:42.020
 Wow, yeah. Also, they produced a lot of rabbits, more they farm rabbits, more than 30 million a year. That'll be why the word Spain means land of rabbits, doesn't it?

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:52.460
 It comes from a Phoenician word, meaning land of rabbits. That's one of two theories. The other is that it just means Western land, which is a bit more boring, but it's nicer to think it means less. Let's go with the rabbit one. Yeah, I like the rabbit one.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:01.660
 On Spanish rodents, Spain doesn't have a tooth fairy. It has a tooth mouth, and you leave your tooth under a pillow and rat on Cheeto takes away your tooth and brings your present in return.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.460
 That's fantastic. That's a fantastic name. Is it true that the Spanish have the longest life expectancy?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.420
 I'm not sure they beat Japan, but they are the world's largest exporter of olive oil. Yeah, so that's got to help. Well, not if you're exporting it all.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.500
 It's a good time drinking all the olive oil, maybe. That's surprising, right? They beat France in wine and Italy in olive oil. Yeah, that is surprising, yeah.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:36.140
 And they invented the mop. The Spanish man invented the mop. He just stuck a stick on a rabbit to give the guy credit who invented it, he also invented the two-piece disposable syringe.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.700
 How can you invent a mop? He was an aeronautical engineer, so I don't really know how. I think people have been popping before they've been aeronautical engineers.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:52.580
 I want them to put a stick on it. What else did they invent? Have they fainted out of the Spanish? Well, in the ninth century, Spain was by far and away the most forward-thinking place in the world.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:03.060
 In Codoba, they had hospitals with running water, they had baths, they had specialist departments for different ailments, the hospitals had to stay open for 24 hours for anyone who was sick.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:13.740
 They had the world's first municipal bins and waste disposal, and they had Europe's first street lights in Codoba, so it was like a proper, awesome place to be. It was during the Arab-Spain time, more or less.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.700
 We're not saying it's an awesome place to be now, because it is, but it's not as well lit.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.100
 Can I give you guys my favorite Spanish fact? Yes, please. I think it's probably the best Spanish fact.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:36.740
 They have the longest person serving a jail sentence in the world. Sorry, let me say that again. Longest by minutes or inches. Really high prison cell.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.900
 They have to keep them in the exercise, yeah. The longest jail sentence ever given.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:52.780
 This was in March of 1972. It was to a 22-year-old guy called Gabriel, and he got a sentence because he failed to deliver 42,768 letters, so he was accused of fraud.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.420
 He got given a sentence of 384,911 years.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:14.020
 So the laws in Spain are quite strange. There's a new child protection bill that means that children under 18 have a joint responsibility to help at home, and in accordance with their age, and regardless of their gender, they have to do housework by law.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.700
 What happens if they don't? Extremely long prison sentence. Very extremely long.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:35.180
 Okay, this is called the King Alfonso, the 13th of Spain. It was completely tone deaf, and wherever he went, he was accompanied by an advisor called the Anthem Man, whose job was to advise the King if any team was the National Anthem, so he could stand up during it.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.740
 What a sweet job to audition for. Can you imagine the interview for that job?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:49.100
 Yeah, but you could just any old music. Oh, it was a National Anthem again. It was a nice scream button going by. Oh no, it's a National Anthem.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.340
 Okay, that was the halftime whistle there, which means it's time for our halftime show, which is brought to you by visitinglin.com, and that comes in the form of a QI quiz.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.140
 We've got three questions for you to ponder over as we make our way to the second half. So the first question is from James.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.740
 Yes, my first question is, where in England do they make delicious brown ale?

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 Okay, question number two from Andy.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.740
 My question is, what historical event completely ruined William Shakespeare's 52nd birthday?

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.740
 And question number three from Anna.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.740
 My question is, which English city has more trees per person than any other European city?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.740
 Okay, well, if you want to find out the answers to those questions, stay tuned till the end of the match where we will reveal them then.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.740
 But until then, it's time for the second half, and it's the Netherlands. What have we got?

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.740
 And so storming their way to victory is pain.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:50.740
 Okay, the all-time vest QI fact about the Netherlands has got to be the fact that in 1672, an angry mob of Dutchman killed and ate their prime minister.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.740
 Wow!

00:05:51.740 --> 00:06:00.740
 He was called Johann David, and he was the prime minister, and they ended up lynching him, ripped his body apart, and then some people apparently ate bits of it.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 But it's not just prime ministers. There was a TV show in the Netherlands.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.740
 It was called Proof Konningen.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 That is absolutely not how to pronounce that word.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.740
 And the two presenters underwent surgery to remove small pieces of flesh from their bodies and eat each other.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.740
 Well, that was broadcast.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.740
 It was broadcast, and one of the presenters says, "It was just a few centimeters of meat, and now I have a good story about that scar."

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.740
 It's like come down with me, but it's just come down with me.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.740
 So if you want to insult someone in Dutch, you accuse them of having an illness, and loads of their swear words and insults are things like,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.740
 I won't be able to pronounce any of these.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.740
 Claire Elysia is a slang word, meaning "collar a sufferer."

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.740
 Cree's deterring is "catch the tuberculosis."

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.740
 Or "plurren" is literally "tut tuberculosis off."

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.740
 "Tut tuberculosis off."

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.740
 Get the tuberculosis out of here.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.740
 "Cancare" the word for "cancer," you just shout "cancare" at people, or "get cancer" at people.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.740
 Get cancer.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.740
 Oh, tuberculosis yourself.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740
 I want to hear those.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.740
 I know.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.740
 There must be mild ones as well.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.740
 Oh, X-mer.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.740
 X-mer itself.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.740
 Snotty nose.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.740
 Yeah.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.740
 I have some other sayings.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.740
 So a lot of them seem to be monkey-related.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.740
 So an urban legend is known as a monkey sandwich story, which is great.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.740
 If someone's given away something about themselves by mistake,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.740
 you say, "Ah, the monkey comes out of the sleeve."

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.740
 And if you want to say, "Just do it," or, you know, "Hey, let's go on with it. Let's go."

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.740
 You say, "Go with that banana."

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.740
 The Dutch claim that they have the tallest people in the world.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.740
 They do.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.740
 Yeah, so are they.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:44.740
 I think they have the tallest people because 25% of the Netherlands is below sea level.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.740
 So I've decided that they have the tallest people as like a survival thing,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.740
 so that they can keep their heads above water.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.740
 When the water rises, that's a very sound thing.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.740
 I think it is.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.740
 They change the rules so that doors have to be higher now.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.740
 They have to be seven foot six and a half inches high because Dutch people are so tall.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.740
 In 1848, one man in four was rejected by the Dutch military because he was shorter than five foot two.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.740
 But today it's fewer than one in 1,000 people at that size.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740
 Wow.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.740
 So they've grown massively in the last, like, 100 years, actually.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.740
 You know, they have the person who always accompanies Santa Claus in the Netherlands.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.740
 And in Black Peter, is it?

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.740
 Black Peter.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.740
 People in the Netherlands do black up to celebrate.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.740
 It's an old tradition, but it is controversial now.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.740
 Yeah, there's a BBC News report here saying that they're calling time on Black Pete Fun in the Netherlands.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.740
 Well, there's a big campaign to stop it, but there's also a big campaign to keep it because they think it's part of their tradition.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.740
 One bad thing about the Netherlands is the National Anthem,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.740
 where one of the lines is to the King of Spain, I've granted a lifelong loyalty,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.740
 which if the rocket gets Spain.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.740
 That's copy and paste gone badly wrong, isn't it?

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.740
 Why does it say that?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.740
 Just for historical reasons from when they were, they should have rewritten that.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.740
 Come on, they've had, like, 400 years.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.740
 They have the ultimate James Bond.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.740
 He was a Dutch MI6 agent called Peter Tazelar.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.740
 And he was sent to the Hague as a spy undercover.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740
 And he was in a wetsuit.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.740
 And he washed up on the beach and unzipped his wetsuit.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.740
 This is in the second world war. I think unzipped his wetsuit was wearing a tux underneath swand into a casino.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.740
 And it is by work.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.740
 How do we know that?

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.740
 There was only revealed about three years ago.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.740
 Was it him saying?

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.740
 No, he never.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.740
 There's how cool I was right there.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.740
 I used to do this thing.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.740
 Yeah.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.740
 He then lost £100,000 in the casino.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.740
 So they love their royal family.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.740
 They spend more money on their royal family than we do.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.740
 And their crown jewels are made partly of fish scales.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.740
 Oh, wow.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.740
 I think it was in the 19th century they remade the crown jewels.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.740
 And yeah, they're made of glue-paste and tiny copper balls and gelatin and fish scales.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.740
 They're made from the version of Blue Peter.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.740
 Yeah, it was basically a DIY black Peter.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.740
 It's called Black Peter.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.740
 Okay, that's the final whistle.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.740
 And before we decide who's won today's match,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.740
 we're very quickly going to reveal the answers to the half-time show brought to you by Visitingland.com.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.740
 And they are, James.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.740
 Okay, my question was, were in the UK do they make brown ale?

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.740
 It's called Newcastle brown ale, but it's made in Tadcaster and has been done there since 2010.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.740
 It's a trick question.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740
 Yeah.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.740
 Okay, Andy, Shakespeare.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.740
 The historical event which ruined Shakespeare's 52nd birthday was the death of William Shakespeare.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.740
 He died on the day that we think he was born.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.740
 We're not absolutely certain the day, but we think it was there.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.740
 Who said George's day, wasn't it?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.740
 Yeah.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.740
 Okay, Anada.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:44.740
 Yes, the city in England that has more trees per person than any other European city is the lovely, verdant Sheffield.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.740
 Sheffield, nice.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.740
 Okay, well, they're the answers, but now it's time to decide who has won today's match.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.740
 Is it Spain or is it Netherlands?

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.740
 And I'm going to Andy for today's decision.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.740
 Ah, I like the idea of the two-thirty being a mouse.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.740
 Yeah.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.740
 So I'm going to say Spain.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.740
 Okay, that's, yeah, good call.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.740
 I like it.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.740
 All right, so Spain make it through to the next round. That's the end of our match.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:11.740
 If you fancy winning some QI goodies, you can head on over to VisitingGland.com where they're going to be running another competition.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.740
 There's going to be books and so on.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.740
 And if you want to get in contact with us in the meantime, just about today's show, you can get us all on our Twitter handles.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.740
 I'm on @Sriberland, James.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.740
 Ah, I shaped.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.740
 Andy.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.740
 I'm Drew Hunter M.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.740
 And Anna.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.740
 You can get me at quickipedia.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.740
 Yeah.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.740
 Okay, well, we'll be back again tomorrow with the next match in our World Cup of Facts, and that is James.
