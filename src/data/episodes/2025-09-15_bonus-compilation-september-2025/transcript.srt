 [music]

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,160
 Hey there Clubfish members, Dan here.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 Hope you're all doing well.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,400
 Welcome to a bonus compilation episode.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,600
 These are all the bits that didn't make it to the main show either because I just didn't fit the narrative,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,880
 or they were on a tangent, they just didn't fit the shape.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,400
 So we bang them all together here so that you can hear the stuff that didn't make it.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,120
 Quite excitingly, for this particular compilation, it's not just the voice of us for fishers,

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,880
 but we have a bunch of guests.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,840
 So you'll remember we did some Edinburgh shows recently, and a bunch of the offcuts from those recordings have made their way here.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,680
 So you're going to hear, and you'll be hearing them in this order, Ian Smith, Elf Lions,

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,680
 you're going to get a couple of sentences from Ahir Shah, there's Andrew Neal, and then finally, Nish Kumar.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
 And you're also going to hear a couple of audience submitted facts that we riff on as well.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
 So that's the show for today.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
 Thank you everyone who came to our live shows, by the way.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,960
 We had two live shows very recently at the London Podcast Festival, Jamie Morton from my dad wrote a porno was there.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,080
 We had a really great night with him, and then the following night we had Richard Osmanon.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
 And again, just a wild, brilliant live show.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
 We love our live shows so much.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,760
 And if you missed out on it, they're obviously going to be coming out as edited episodes.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,120
 But if you want to see the full thing, like from the moment that we walk on stage,

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,120
 all the way through to the quiz that we play at the end, you can still get access to the live stream video.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,840
 If you go to no such thing as a fish.com/live, you're going to find a link that will take you to the King's Place website,

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,400
 where you can buy the live stream video.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,800
 That's going to be up for the next week.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,280
 We're trying to see if we can get an extension on it.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,840
 So if you want to check that out, do that.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,920
 And you'll notice, if you have headed to our website, that there is another link there for the Cheltenham Literary Festival.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,040
 That's happening on the 16th of October.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,680
 So we're doing another live show.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,160
 It's part of this brilliant literature festival.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,840
 And we're going to be joined on stage by one of our favorite people, Rachel Paris.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,440
 So if you happen to be in the area, come and say hi.

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
 Okay, let's get on to this compilation.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,680
 And we begin with Ian Smith, who, by the way, was nominated for the best show at the Edinburgh Fringe this year for his show Foot Spa Half Empty.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
 So that's very cool.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
 But let's get into it.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 Here we go.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,120
 On with the compilation.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:31,960
 I found a story that happened in 2008 of a real-life jigsaw problem.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,680
 And I wonder, because I can't find an update on it, whether or not this person is still trying to solve it.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:49,200
 So this is a bin man who was called Graham Hill, and he found, in a bunch of bags, 10,000 pounds worth of 10 pound and 20 pound notes.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,960
 And he handed it over to the police.

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,120
 He said, I found this.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,760
 And after the amount of time that's required for them to keep it and wait for someone to claim it had passed, they gave it back to him.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:08,000
 So he was 10,000 quid richer, except for some reason, every single one of the bills had been cut into tiny small pieces.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,800
 And the Bank of England had said, if you can put them all back together, absolutely, they're legal tender, and you've got 10,000 pounds.

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,840
 But right now, you just have shreds of 10,000 pounds.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
 And so that's what he has in his house.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,640
 So he apparently was going to make an attempt to try and jigsaw piece it back together.

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,600
 Where was this done?

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120
 2008.

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,880
 Wow. It's a different type. Like these days, you get bankers who have lost their Bitcoin and put it in a dump.

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,640
 And that's they're trying to get that back.

55
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,480
 But in those days, it was just bin men with bags of shred of money, wasn't it?

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,200
 Because that's like, if your money rips, you can like put it together with sell it to it.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,320
 Like I've seen that before where I've got to know that it's stuck.

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,080
 And that's fine.

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
 Yeah, I think what you need is the, there's a serial number and everybody knows.

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,440
 And that needs to be exactly correct, because they'll check it.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,400
 And so if it's in two pieces, that's easy. You just sell it, type it.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,960
 But if it's in a thousand pieces, how did he know it was worth 10,000 pounds?

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,400
 Like if you presented me with a bin bag full of shredded money, how would you...

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
 I don't know, assess.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
 I think that's about 10,000 pounds worth of that.

66
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
 I can do that with complete nose.

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
 I have no idea.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
 So you can weigh them.

69
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,600
 So you can weigh and you know how much paper there is.

70
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
 And you know how much one note weighs.

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
 And you just divide them.

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,920
 Yes.

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,600
 That's clever. That's clever.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,240
 I'm just being reminded my first, one of my first ever paid gigs that I ever got in stand-up

75
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
 was up the creek.

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,920
 And I was handed an envelope of money.

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,880
 And I think it was something like 200 quid that I'd made.

78
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
 And I was very excitedly saved to my friends.

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
 Let's go to the pub, walking down the street.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,920
 And I ripped open the envelope and hadn't...

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,120
 I ripped it over on the side and I tore all the money.

82
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
 This was before it went to plastic.

83
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,640
 I tore all the money and a gust of wind came, a blew off.

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,080
 The top third of all my notes.

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
 And yet you continued with your comedy career.

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
 Despite that very obvious side from the universe that it wasn't for you.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
 Wait, it's over. They gave me five minutes from my next set.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,600
 One of the, this is only like vaguely related.

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
 But it's one of the funniest things I've seen.

90
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
 And it does involve wind.

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,240
 But I was in New Zealand with Fin Taylor and I think Phil Wang.

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,640
 And Fin Taylor was talking about how he had a small part

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,680
 in the new Tomb Raider film.

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
 And I think it was cut from the final edit.

95
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,360
 I'm not sure if it was on like special features or anything.

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,640
 But he basically said, this cast and crew cap

97
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,520
 is the only memento that I have from the film.

98
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,920
 And then almost immediately like a sitcom,

99
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,160
 a gust of wind blew the hat into the waters.

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,280
 The boat's going away.

101
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,560
 And was just sort of like almost didn't laugh but just remember saying

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
 that's the funniest thing.

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,520
 That's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,640
 The timing of it.

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,080
 But I still felt like, but I can't laugh because I think it's sad as well.

106
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
 But yeah, it was so perfect.

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
 It's lost all proof using that movie.

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,160
 Would you like some beat slang?

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
 Oh yeah.

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,760
 Right.

111
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
 I'm feeling hairy.

112
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,760
 What's that?

113
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,880
 I'm a tender profile.

114
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
 No good is good feeling hairy.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
 Feeling good feeling.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 My rod.

117
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
 My rod.

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,640
 Hey.

119
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,360
 Car.

120
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,920
 Car.

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,720
 Like a hot rod.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,280
 Hot rod.

123
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,000
 Exactly.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
 Let's stable the iron.

125
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
 Put it back in your trousers mate.

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
 It's parked the car.

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
 What's a kickstick?

128
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
 Kickstick.

129
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
 Kickstick.

130
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,120
 It's not on your bike, is it?

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
 It's not the...

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
 No, that's a kickstand.

133
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,440
 Nice.

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,080
 It's a cigarette.

135
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,920
 Kickstick.

136
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,880
 To give you a kick, right?

137
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,440
 Yes, sir.

138
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,320
 But they were very quickly taking the piss out of the beats.

139
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,800
 Yeah.

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
 And the Village Voice magazine in New York,

141
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,720
 they ran a rent-a-beatenic competition.

142
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,200
 Right.

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
 Where you could hire a beatenic for your party.

144
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,520
 They did it as a joke.

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,400
 And then they actually, I think,

146
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,320
 started getting beat poets in...

147
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,080
 Who said, "Yeah, I could do with $40."

148
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,960
 All right.

149
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
 Yeah.

150
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,440
 Bongo's optional.

151
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,640
 Yeah, I don't know how they earned any money,

152
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
 because most of them didn't actually publish anything.

153
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,080
 Or like a lot of the...

154
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,920
 One of the main members, Neil Cassidy.

155
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
 I don't think he published anything.

156
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,440
 Oh, he did.

157
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
 Well, maybe posthumously.

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,120
 Posthumously.

159
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,760
 Yeah, yeah.

160
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,240
 It's not...

161
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,880
 Yeah, yeah.

162
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,200
 Can you just put this beer on my tab?

163
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,760
 I'm going to publish some stuff posthumously.

164
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
 And I'll make sure you get it.

165
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,360
 Posthumous to have is a great idea.

166
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
 I'm going to be massive, I promise.

167
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,480
 One of my favorite clowns from history is Lulu Adams, UK clown.

168
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,800
 And she was known as one of the first ever women circus clowns.

169
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
 She was born in 1900.

170
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,720
 And she was like the first ever female clown to appear at Olympia.

171
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
 And I just think she was incredible.

172
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,440
 She played the bagpipe.

173
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,200
 She could ride a horse at the same time.

174
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,960
 Her whole family were in the circus.

175
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,680
 Like just a proper old-fashioned showwoman show family.

176
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,800
 And she did a double act with her husband, Albatino.

177
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
 And they got hired by the Bertram Mill Circus,

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
 which was such a big deal.

179
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,040
 And they got offered a contract, which was like, I think $35 or £35 a week,

180
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,240
 which was the equivalent of like £2000 a week now,

181
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
 which was massive to go to New York to do this amazing tour of their act.

182
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
 And then they went on air, this was in 1948.

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
 And they were being interviewed on the New York radio in April,

184
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
 on the day the opening night.

185
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
 And they asked Albatino what's it like to perform.

186
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
 And as he answered, he died on air of a heart attack.

187
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,960
 And that evening, Lulu Adams went on stage and continued to do the double act.

188
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
 And she completed the entire nine-month contract on her own.

189
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,960
 And the newspaper article was like the first female clown is smiling even though her heart is breaking.

190
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,920
 But it's just, and then she continued performing for the rest of her life.

191
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
 And then moved to Brighton and made costumes for performers.

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
 On a professional, that's professionalism.

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,200
 And I want to say that if all the three of you guys who do the podcast with me died,

194
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,520
 I would continue to do it as if nothing had happened.

195
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,680
 Quite right. And we know.

196
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,320
 We know. You say that every week, Anna.

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,400
 And it's starting to pull.

198
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,600
 Yeah, my booby traps keep failing.

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,920
 I really miss what sounds like the golden age of non-imperson dating,

200
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
 which is the video dating thing.

201
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,480
 Oh, yeah.

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
 So this was on TV as a kind of joke when I was growing up.

203
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,120
 Like you sit in a studio, you record a video of yourself.

204
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
 Oh, yeah.

205
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,120
 Yeah, there was a guy called Jeffrey Almond.

206
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
 He set it up. He was a young videographer.

207
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
 And so you had this huge library of videos.

208
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,800
 And then you just watch like a five minute tape of any potential person.

209
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 And you say, right, I'm interested in Jennifer.

210
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,520
 Can you?

211
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,160
 And then Jennifer gets a phone call saying Greg is interested in you.

212
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
 Can you go in and view Greg's video?

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,960
 Right.

214
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
 And literally a VHS.

215
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
 Yes.

216
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
 And so like it's laborious.

217
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
 But the thing is the way the interviews were conducted.

218
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
 This guy, Jeffrey Almond, did the interviews himself, right?

219
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
 You'd fill out a form of your preferences.

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,320
 And then he would do a little interview with you.

221
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,720
 Yeah.

222
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
 But he would also kind of interrogate you.

223
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,760
 So listen to this.

224
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,240
 Almond recollected, I'd say to you, you've got five kids

225
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
 and you live way out in the suburbs.

226
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
 Now I don't mean to insult you, Ethel.

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
 But how dateable are you?

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
 And then Ethel's on the spot having to answer it.

229
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,160
 Like, well, I can send the kids off to their auntie or whatever.

230
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,800
 Like, as in, she's having to answer for herself.

231
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,160
 Yeah, that's a bit probing.

232
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,200
 But it's kind of, I suppose, the reasoning was she's proving.

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
 Oh, no, look, this is how great I am as a match.

234
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
 They must give Ethel the questions beforehand.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
 I don't know.

236
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,080
 I quite like the idea of the Jeremy Paxman kind of dating service.

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,840
 Well, it's like, if you answer on a play, it's just the same question.

238
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,640
 Yeah.

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,840
 But do you like films?

240
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,400
 Well, I've seen them.

241
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,760
 It had 17 franchises by the mid '80s.

242
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,640
 And there was even, there was one specifically for people

243
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,400
 in Washington DC with herpes.

244
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,840
 That's how successful it was.

245
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
 Wow.

246
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,520
 I don't know why.

247
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
 I don't know why.

248
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
 I suppose if you have herpes, then you

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
 should only shack people with herpes.

250
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,520
 Is that the thinking?

251
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,120
 That is the thinking, clearly.

252
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,840
 Yeah.

253
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,560
 And that's, we've mentioned this before, but that's basically

254
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
 one of the reasons the YouTube guys gave for setting up YouTube

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
 at all was that video dating.

256
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
 So you would put up a video of yourself in this exact same way,

257
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
 but you're knocking out VHS and you just click to the next link.

258
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,400
 That was largely part of the, the creation of it.

259
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
 I watch everything on two-time speed with stuff like that to get through it.

260
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
 So everyone would be disappointed when they turned up with normal,

261
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,720
 bassy voices.

262
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,560
 If we gave dinosaurs to every country in the world,

263
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
 it wouldn't help because dinosaurs couldn't live today.

264
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,200
 And that is because in the Cretaceous era,

265
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
 they had about 35% oxygen.

266
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
 And today we have about 21% oxygen.

267
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,800
 So there wouldn't be enough oxygen for them to live.

268
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,280
 They'd all be sort of gasping for air the whole time.

269
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,040
 Well, you're telling me that this series of documentaries I watch

270
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,440
 set on island Nuba.

271
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
 I don't know, I haven't seen it, but they all have like gas masks

272
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,280
 and yeah equipment.

273
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,240
 Pretty upset.

274
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,080
 You haven't seen Jurassic Park.

275
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
 I'm afraid I haven't.

276
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,800
 Not any of them.

277
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
 No, but there's a new one out, isn't there?

278
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,040
 So I think I might have to catch up.

279
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,960
 Just start with the new one and work backwards.

280
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
 That's how you're meant to do it.

281
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,200
 Like the Star Wars films.

282
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
 Here's the thing on diplomacy.

283
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,320
 So we talked about dinosaur diplomacy.

284
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,960
 There's other things like ping pong diplomacy

285
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,760
 where China and America play ping pong against each other.

286
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
 There is panda diplomacy where China gave out pandas

287
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,200
 to different countries.

288
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,920
 And they found one called xylophone diplomacy.

289
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
 Does anyone know what that is?

290
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
 It feels like we can guess.

291
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,160
 Try to do dinosaur thing.

292
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,960
 You play the ribs of the dinosaur like a xylophone

293
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,600
 and that lightens the mood at tricky summits.

294
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
 You send everyone's islephones and that gives the prime school children

295
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,400
 something to do and parents very grateful.

296
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,040
 No, I read this in the economist and it says

297
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
 xylophone diplomacy.

298
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
 A made-up turn created in order to have an entry for the letter x

299
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,280
 in the economist A to Z of international relations.

300
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
 All right, thanks a lot.

301
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,040
 The way all these things worked I guess is you

302
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
 you sent in a bit of money and you filled out a questionnaire

303
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
 which could be very long.

304
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,800
 So the operation match was 75 questions.

305
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,920
 And then they took your questionnaire and they tried to match it up

306
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,760
 with others using a computer algorithm which is why it was computerized.

307
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,480
 I think a good way of doing it would be to have like 10,000 questions

308
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
 that you have to go through and you're matched by

309
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,520
 how far you go through before you give up.

310
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,320
 That's very good.

311
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
 Because I think I would be well matched to someone

312
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,080
 who had the same level of getting bored quickly as I do.

313
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,920
 I think you'd answer them all because you're a completist.

314
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
 Do you like long list of information?

315
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,160
 That's a thing.

316
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
 And probably the person who dated me would need to be

317
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,280
 similar to put up with that.

318
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
 I do have a dating app for you, James.

319
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,400
 I know you're off the market but there is a new one in the USA

320
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
 called SCORE which is a dating app for people

321
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
 who have a good to excellent credit rating.

322
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,080
 Oh, and it's...

323
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,840
 I do have a good credit rating.

324
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,960
 I mean, sorry, excellent.

325
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,280
 I just think that's so...

326
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,960
 I think that's quite good, actually, like...

327
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,760
 It's very sensible.

328
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,640
 I disagree.

329
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,120
 I think that's a good case of opposites attract.

330
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
 Actually, you're so right.

331
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,640
 But much more responsible to pay yourself up with someone with a bad one

332
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,840
 so you can raise them up to your left.

333
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,240
 Absolutely.

334
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,040
 That's not how it works.

335
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,680
 They drag you down.

336
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,160
 Anna.

337
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
 That's what happens in love.

338
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,400
 You're right.

339
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,040
 You're right.

340
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 You're right.

341
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
 You're right.

342
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,200
 I've got one here from Geoffrey Partica,

343
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,480
 which is a fishy stretch.

344
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,280
 It's been said.

345
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,040
 Disgusting.

346
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,480
 It is a stretch of effect.

347
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 But I'm reading it because I know Tom Cruise is a huge,

348
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
 huge deal in Andy's life.

349
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
 So, Tom Cruise took up race car driving and got married

350
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
 because of the Russian Revolution.

351
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,800
 Okay.

352
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
 That was a long journey.

353
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
 There's a long journey to get to what this is.

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
 1917.

355
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
 Ruben Maumullian

356
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,400
 was studying at a stage production

357
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,520
 at the Imperial Moscow University in the hopes of directing.

358
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,280
 And he was from a Saras family.

359
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,360
 So he fled America when the revolution broke out.

360
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
 He became a director of fled to America.

361
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,160
 Sorry.

362
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,400
 Very few people fled America when the Russian Revolution

363
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,360
 broke out.

364
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
 That's too cautious.

365
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,440
 Yeah, he fled to America.

366
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,280
 And years later, he becomes the initial director of Cleopatra

367
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,800
 with Lisbeth Taylor.

368
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,160
 There was lots of problems.

369
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,040
 Constant script changes, creative differences.

370
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,760
 So he was eventually replaced as the director.

371
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,320
 So then Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor

372
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,080
 were scheduled to be in the movie together.

373
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,440
 But because of the shooting delays,

374
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
 because of this,

375
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
 Taylor was prevented from joining the film.

376
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,240
 So both roles were recast.

377
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,400
 With Robert Mitchell and Shirley McClain,

378
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,680
 which freed up Paul Newman to be in the hustler

379
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,800
 with Jackie Gleason.

380
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
 The hustler is credited with popularizing pool in America,

381
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,200
 giving Paul Newman a lifelong love of the game.

382
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,040
 It also allowed him to reprise his role as fast Eddie Felsen,

383
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,920
 25 years later in the Scorsese sequel,

384
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
 The Color of Money.

385
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
 James has started eating biscuits.

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
 He's roughly performative.

387
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,960
 He could be more far away from the microphone right now.

388
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,120
 That's what happens when he gets interested.

389
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,200
 I don't think I've got to be needed for a few longer.

390
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,560
 It was in this movie, as far as Eddie Felsen,

391
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
 that Paul Newman introduced Tom Cruise

392
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
 to the thrill of driving too fast.

393
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
 Thanks to his new love,

394
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,760
 Cruise was cast in the NASCAR movie Days of Thunder.

395
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,360
 He met Nicole Kidman.

396
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
 Oh, that's not anyone, isn't it?

397
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
 Yeah, and then it just ends.

398
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,600
 There might have been a few other consequences

399
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
 due to the Russian Revolution,

400
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,320
 but I think it'd be difficult

401
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,400
 to find something more inane.

402
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,000
 Certainly the worst consequence.

403
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
 No, that's terrific.

404
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
 Tom Cruise could have had a career as a kind of sensitive

405
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,520
 character actor.

406
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,240
 Yeah.

407
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,400
 But were it not for the Russian Revolution?

408
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,120
 There you go.

409
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,600
 Great.

410
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,000
 Nice.

411
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,320
 Love it.

412
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,880
 Just on guitars,

413
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,600
 can I give everyone a guitar song recommendation?

414
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,640
 It's called "It's Really Good."

415
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,200
 It's called "United Breaks Guitars"

416
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,840
 and it was a hit in 2009.

417
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
 Have you heard everything, Andrew?

418
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,880
 He's nodding along.

419
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
 He's a musician called Dave Carroll,

420
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,000
 who was, and I guess it must be the bane of a lot of guitar players' lives.

421
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
 He was on a plane and he watched the baggage handlers

422
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
 throw his $3,500 guitar all over the shop.

423
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,320
 So my golf clubs.

424
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,920
 You could sing an equally popular

425
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
 relatable song about that.

426
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,440
 And it's really good if he wrote this song

427
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,040
 about how they've broken his guitar.

428
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,080
 I think it's great,

429
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
 but they're nice, tragedy-like country.

430
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
 It's wonderful, isn't it?

431
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,160
 It's also...

432
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,280
 It's that thing where this incredibly precious thing...

433
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,360
 Obviously, there's a hand-like-a-jams race, isn't there?

434
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
 And there's recently a story about...

435
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
 People employed in airports are...

436
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,120
 They're rewarded like a few quid for each bag

437
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
 that sort of refused to put on.

438
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,760
 Because imagine how difficult that job actually is.

439
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,800
 You've got a massive stagdo who haven't read the terms in conditions.

440
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
 They've all got bags too big to go on.

441
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
 You've got to tell everyone...

442
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,640
 It's, you know, you can't take it on and it's 60 extra quid

443
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
 to put it on the whole age.

444
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
 But with guitars, yeah, just...

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,280
 You know, this incredibly precious thing.

446
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
 And what you have to do is down-tune them.

447
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,800
 So if you're going to put them in the luggage role,

448
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,200
 put it in a hard case, down-tune it.

449
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,040
 So you haven't got the tension on the strings.

450
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,480
 Because if it gets dropped or smashed,

451
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,800
 that tension can make the neck cave in.

452
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,440
 Yeah, right.

453
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,080
 Wow.

454
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
 Interesting.

455
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,040
 Doing that, taking the tuning down, is actually an entire style of guitaring in Hawaii.

456
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,320
 And I'd never heard of this.

457
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
 Slack Key Guitar.

458
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,440
 Oh, wow.

459
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,080
 Slack Key Guitar is where you basically are detuning at least three strings of your guitar

460
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,880
 in order to create an open chord that you can play.

461
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,360
 And then you can use the top notes as your bass line.

462
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
 And then you can play with the open chord for the rest.

463
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
 The thing about it is, like I was talking earlier about hiding your fingers

464
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,800
 behind a handkerchief, Slack Key Guitar in Hawaii was also something

465
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 where you would hand down the tunings of each of those six strings

466
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,440
 to your family and not let anyone else know.

467
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
 So it became like the family style of playing this particular guitar.

468
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
 And we know a bunch of them now.

469
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
 Yeah, it's become more open now.

470
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,680
 But it was handed down as the family secret for how you would play guitar.

471
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,280
 And so everyone would have their own specific open chord.

472
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,360
 Well, these secret guitar chords.

473
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
 I had no idea that it was such an exciting secretive world,

474
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
 the world of guitar playing.

475
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,320
 And we're sure it's not just because people always have to fly to Hawaii

476
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
 on a plane and then their guitars aren't strong.

477
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,840
 Oh, fuck, I better make this a thing.

478
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,680
 The first album I ever bought was the Jimmy Hendrix album, which was great.

479
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,920
 Because he does sound like nobody else.

480
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
 Like it does, it is an unbelievable sound he has.

481
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,720
 And it was partly thanks to his sound engineer guy who was called Roger Mayer.

482
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,800
 And this is where the other weird military link comes in.

483
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,200
 Because Roger Mayer sort of qualified did all his early work in acoustics

484
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,440
 in the Royal Naval Scientific Service working on underwater warfare.

485
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,040
 He was on submarines.

486
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,520
 He was working on the stuff of keeping submarines silent.

487
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
 You know, that was his whole project when he was in the Navy.

488
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
 So I just love this quote.

489
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
 When a steel hulled sub is running silent, you know,

490
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
 the whole point about submarines is you stay completely quiet

491
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
 and no one knows that you're there.

492
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,160
 When it's running silent, the sound of a dropped spanner can be picked up

493
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,640
 and the sub's position located from up to 160 kilometers away.

494
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,200
 What?

495
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,240
 What?

496
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,200
 What?

497
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,240
 Imagine that.

498
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
 Can that be true?

499
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,880
 I think he, like, I know it sounds like I'm talking about, I guess.

500
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,480
 He exactly, like, I can't believe it.

501
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
 So basically, all of, he realised all of his work also applied to guitars

502
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
 and he made this amazing sound effects device for Hendrix,

503
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,160
 which creates an amazing trippy harmonic sound

504
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,520
 the octave above your playing.

505
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,160
 Yeah.

506
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
 And he showed it to Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin

507
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,080
 and Jimmy Page said, "Well, it's too much for me.

508
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
 Yeah, it's too far out for me."

509
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,000
 Right.

510
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,960
 But Hendrix was into it.

511
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
 Roger Mayer is still alive.

512
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,720
 He's still.

513
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,200
 Hey.

514
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
 He's still around, yeah.

515
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,280
 So the question is,

516
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
 if you put Jimmy Hendrix on a submarine

517
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
 and got him to play Purple H.

518
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 Apple far away.

519
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
 The whole world could listen.

520
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
 [LAUGHTER]

521
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,680
 That period of time is one that I'm endlessly fascinated with.

522
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,360
 The kind of, you know, the mid-60s,

523
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,480
 a lot of those bands, a lot of the movies that came out around that time

524
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,960
 are a source of perennial fascination to me.

525
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
 And one of the things that is so strange about it all is,

526
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,680
 it's obviously, it's so close to the Second World War.

527
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,840
 You know, like the, yeah.

528
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,920
 And the whole cultural landscape,

529
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
 it's like when you see photos of Bob Dylan

530
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
 touring the mid-60s and he's occasionally just walking around

531
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,680
 just sort of rubble in Liverpool or something

532
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,280
 because the whole idea of like the free-loved 60s

533
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,800
 is so close to the end of the Second World War

534
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,520
 and there's all these people who were sort of just called,

535
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
 like, just doing military service.

536
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,920
 And then, suddenly, are now trying to work out

537
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,120
 how to make Jimmy Hendrix's guitar successfully

538
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
 and be like the noise that runs through his head

539
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,160
 when he takes LSD.

540
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
 You know what I'm saying?

541
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,960
 [LAUGHTER]

542
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
 I think it's such an interesting point.

543
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,360
 I think it's something that will never certainly

544
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,600
 with the world of rock music experience again,

545
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
 where I was listening to Ozzy Osborne talk

546
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
 the other day about the Beatles.

547
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,120
 And he said, you just, you will never understand

548
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,680
 what the Beatles meant to us, not just the music,

549
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
 what they meant to us.

550
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
 We were in a black and white world and it went technicolor.

551
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
 We suddenly believe that life was fun again

552
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,280
 and it was through that.

553
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,560
 And all that period is what that was.

554
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,080
 They were building off the back of trying

555
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,720
 to get back into technicolor off the back of war.

556
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,080
 It's fascinating stuff.

557
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
 I agree, I'm obsessed with that period.

558
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,320
 If you're in a yellow submarine, don't inquire.

559
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
 [LAUGHTER]

560
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
 And you drop a spanner.

561
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,960
 Yeah.

562
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,760
 [LAUGHTER]

563
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
 Here's one.

564
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,880
 Dolphins says Andrew Heldenbrand can use ultrasound

565
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,480
 to detect pregnancies and will pay special attention

566
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
 to pregnant women, nuzzling them while scanning them

567
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,760
 with ultrasonic frequencies.

568
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,480
 That's pretty cool.

569
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,520
 It's like that, yeah.

570
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,160
 Walker and they tell you things like what sex it is.

571
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,880
 Yeah, they'll say.

572
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
 Does it have the right number of things in toes?

573
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
 It's very annoying sometimes, because they'll say,

574
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,040
 you must have been hoping for a boy or whatever.

575
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,520
 Yeah.

576
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,200
 And you might not want him wanting to know that yet.

577
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
 What level of detail could they turn to the Dan

578
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,840
 and go, it's bad news.

579
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
 I think I might have been the neighbor.

580
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
 You know, like, are they--

581
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,000
 [LAUGHTER]

582
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,640
 Is that what are they fighting out?

583
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
 What's your milkman's nose like?

584
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,360
 [LAUGHTER]

585
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
 It's, I don't think it's huge detail,

586
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,920
 but I think they could probably detect the heartbeat.

587
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,040
 I think they can do a very, very narrow beam of echolocation.

588
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
 It's called buzzing.

589
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,040
 And it sounds like a squeaky door to us when they're doing it.

590
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,080
 That is cool, isn't it?

591
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,360
 So why don't they use--

592
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
 When you go to have your first scan,

593
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
 why don't they use dolphins instead of machines?

594
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
 The natural way.

595
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
 When you're having a water birth.

596
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
 Yeah, the literal wet nurse.

597
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,840
 Flipper.

598
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,000
 [LAUGHTER]

599
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
 Have you guys heard of kitten fishing?

600
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,880
 No.

601
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,680
 No.

602
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,920
 Can you guess what it is?

603
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
 It's not pretending to be a kitten.

604
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,280
 So cat fishing is where you pretend to be

605
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,600
 someone you're completely not.

606
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,760
 And then they think that they're dating you,

607
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,640
 but you're not doing it.

608
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
 And eventually you might get some money off the mouse.

609
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
 So kitten fishing, I reckon,

610
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 is you pretending to be yourself as a child?

611
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
 [LAUGHTER]

612
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,360
 I see, to catch pedophiles, isn't it?

613
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
 Yes.

614
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,880
 No, it's not that.

615
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,520
 It is just embellishing or misrepresenting

616
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,880
 yourself online to make you more desirable.

617
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,400
 OK.

618
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,120
 We'll do that.

619
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,600
 Well, they need a special web for that.

620
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
 So according to Hinge, the web site,

621
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
 the trouble is that when you do that,

622
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,880
 it kind of defeats the whole purpose of online dating,

623
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,680
 which is to find the right match.

624
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,040
 So you really have to be kind of as close to real as possible.

625
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,320
 Wait, but your right match is definitely lying as well.

626
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,640
 I think that's how everyone's doing, right?

627
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
 They're all banking on everyone.

628
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,920
 And he's trying to raise it.

629
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
 That's what the first day is all about.

630
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,680
 Working out what the lies were, seemingly.

631
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,240
 OK, what about woke fishing?

632
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
 Oh, my god.

633
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,760
 Oh, pretending to be woke.

634
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,920
 Yeah, pretending to be.

635
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
 That's what you mean.

636
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,440
 That's the course I support the cause on red.

637
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,000
 Actually, until you're in the pants,

638
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,840
 then turns out you're shameful in your bedside draw.

639
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,160
 You've got a Tory rosette.

640
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
 [LAUGHTER]

641
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,520
 That's not it.

642
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,200
 It's too late.

643
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,920
 She's in love.

644
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,400
 Pretty much that.

645
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
 Orbitink.

646
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,760
 Orbitink is what that's a term.

647
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,560
 It's another term that's in modern dating slang.

648
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,320
 So that's circling around someone not approaching?

649
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
 Yeah, pretty much, but in an online setting.

650
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,760
 So staying occasionally liking the photos,

651
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,960
 leaving the odd, very, very innocuous comments

652
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,840
 so that you're kind of in the Orbit,

653
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,920
 but you're not really engaging with the Orbitink.

654
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,400
 And then zombieing.

655
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,600
 Coming back from the dead.

656
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,440
 Yeah.

657
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
 And offering a date.

658
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
 Pretty much.

659
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,560
 And so you know what ghosting is, where you just stop

660
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,200
 and reply to someone completely at the time they don't exist.

661
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,880
 I know, but someone who's previously--

662
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,400
 My wife's been doing it to me since yesterday.

663
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
 It's when someone who's previously ghosted you suddenly

664
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 reappears and acts as if nothing ever happened.

665
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
 Oh.

666
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,480
 That's very good.

667
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 Very good.

668
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,200
 Very, very good.

669
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,320
 Jack Harrelack, we said he's American.

670
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,200
 And he was American.

671
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,280
 But his parents were quibber-quibber-quibber-quibber.

672
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,400
 He was-- they were from Quebec.

673
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,440
 But that meant that until he was six years old,

674
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,640
 he only spoke dual.

675
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,560
 Dual is a--

676
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,200
 Dual is a--

677
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,600
 It's sort of a dialect from Quebec.

678
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,360
 It's kind of half French, half English, all very, very weird.

679
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,920
 So the name comes from how they say the word chaval.

680
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,760
 So chaval is French for horse.

681
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,080
 And there's a phrase to speak French like a horse.

682
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,840
 It means to speak French very, very badly.

683
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
 And so they call it dual.

684
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,120
 And they have lots of English words in there.

685
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,720
 So dumpe in dual means to throw out the trash.

686
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,600
 Like, it comes from the dump in English.

687
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
 And they turn it into a French thing.

688
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,880
 That's great.

689
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,960
 The word from Peanut is Peanut, just slightly French.

690
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,760
 And the word poutine, you know, which is like chips

691
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,600
 with cheese, gravy on it, it's absolutely delicious.

692
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,480
 But we think it might be dual for pudding.

693
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,920
 So as in, they took the English word pudding

694
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,360
 and then it became poutine and then it became that right.

695
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,640
 That's-- but it's often called a G-Generate language.

696
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,200
 He's both, obviously, so I've just born speaking it.

697
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,000
 And I think maybe we don't know to what extent

698
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,320
 he was speaking standard French Canadian to what extent

699
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,840
 it was dual.

700
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,880
 But even age 18, he still had quite a strong French accent,

701
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,680
 which I think is quite cocky, given that age 17

702
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,280
 was when he decided to write a great American novel in English.

703
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,080
 Well, you know, yeah.

704
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,480
 You got to set your sights high.

705
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
 But when you're not fluent in English, yeah.

706
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,600
 Oh, I think that's pretty cool.

707
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
 Like, how Napoleon was from Corsica, isn't it?

708
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,880
 Exactly.

709
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
 A lot of the most famous people from a place

710
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,120
 were actually from the borders or the fringes

711
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,640
 or the outline region Austria.

712
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,960
 Yeah.

713
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,760
 Right, Stalin was from Georgia.

714
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
 Yeah.

715
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,800
 And we don't want to compare Kerry Wack

716
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,160
 to Hitler and Stalin and Napoleon.

717
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,840
 Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh.

718
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,040
 Oh, don't, the inbox.

719
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,360
 Oh, my god.

720
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
 Sometimes I just look forward.

721
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
 Oh.

722
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,280
 OK, that is it.

723
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,840
 That is all of our outtakes.

724
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,600
 Thanks, everyone.

725
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,120
 If you want to send in any thoughts about what you heard,

726
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,360
 if it made you think of a random extra fact,

727
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,560
 why not send that in to podcast@QI.com?

728
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,160
 All the people that were on the show today

729
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,960
 are all online.

730
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,800
 If you want to message them directly somewhere

731
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,160
 on Instagram or Twitter, go find their ads.

732
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
 Otherwise, come back in two weeks.

733
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,440
 We're going to have a drop us a line waiting for you.

734
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,960
 And we will see you all then.

735
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,440
 Good bye.
