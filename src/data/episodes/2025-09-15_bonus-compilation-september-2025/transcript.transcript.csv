00:00:01,00:00:04,"Hey there Clubfish members, Dan here."
00:00:04,00:00:05,Hope you're all doing well.
00:00:05,00:00:08,Welcome to a bonus compilation episode.
00:00:08,00:00:12,"These are all the bits that didn't make it to the main show either because I just didn't fit the narrative,"
00:00:12,00:00:15,"or they were on a tangent, they just didn't fit the shape."
00:00:15,00:00:20,So we bang them all together here so that you can hear the stuff that didn't make it.
00:00:20,00:00:25,"Quite excitingly, for this particular compilation, it's not just the voice of us for fishers,"
00:00:25,00:00:26,but we have a bunch of guests.
00:00:26,00:00:33,"So you'll remember we did some Edinburgh shows recently, and a bunch of the offcuts from those recordings have made their way here."
00:00:33,00:00:39,"So you're going to hear, and you'll be hearing them in this order, Ian Smith, Elf Lions,"
00:00:39,00:00:45,"you're going to get a couple of sentences from Ahir Shah, there's Andrew Neal, and then finally, Nish Kumar."
00:00:45,00:00:50,And you're also going to hear a couple of audience submitted facts that we riff on as well.
00:00:50,00:00:51,So that's the show for today.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"Thank you everyone who came to our live shows, by the way."
00:00:54,00:00:59,"We had two live shows very recently at the London Podcast Festival, Jamie Morton from my dad wrote a porno was there."
00:00:59,00:01:04,"We had a really great night with him, and then the following night we had Richard Osmanon."
00:01:04,00:01:06,"And again, just a wild, brilliant live show."
00:01:06,00:01:08,We love our live shows so much.
00:01:08,00:01:12,"And if you missed out on it, they're obviously going to be coming out as edited episodes."
00:01:12,00:01:16,"But if you want to see the full thing, like from the moment that we walk on stage,"
00:01:16,00:01:22,"all the way through to the quiz that we play at the end, you can still get access to the live stream video."
00:01:22,00:01:28,"If you go to no such thing as a fish.com/live, you're going to find a link that will take you to the King's Place website,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,where you can buy the live stream video.
00:01:31,00:01:32,That's going to be up for the next week.
00:01:32,00:01:35,We're trying to see if we can get an extension on it.
00:01:35,00:01:37,"So if you want to check that out, do that."
00:01:37,00:01:43,"And you'll notice, if you have headed to our website, that there is another link there for the Cheltenham Literary Festival."
00:01:43,00:01:46,That's happening on the 16th of October.
00:01:46,00:01:47,So we're doing another live show.
00:01:47,00:01:50,It's part of this brilliant literature festival.
00:01:50,00:01:54,"And we're going to be joined on stage by one of our favorite people, Rachel Paris."
00:01:54,00:01:57,"So if you happen to be in the area, come and say hi."
00:01:57,00:01:59,"Okay, let's get on to this compilation."
00:01:59,00:02:06,"And we begin with Ian Smith, who, by the way, was nominated for the best show at the Edinburgh Fringe this year for his show Foot Spa Half Empty."
00:02:06,00:02:08,So that's very cool.
00:02:08,00:02:08,But let's get into it.
00:02:08,00:02:09,Here we go.
00:02:09,00:02:11,On with the compilation.
00:02:11,00:02:31,I found a story that happened in 2008 of a real-life jigsaw problem.
00:02:31,00:02:37,"And I wonder, because I can't find an update on it, whether or not this person is still trying to solve it."
00:02:37,00:02:49,"So this is a bin man who was called Graham Hill, and he found, in a bunch of bags, 10,000 pounds worth of 10 pound and 20 pound notes."
00:02:49,00:02:50,And he handed it over to the police.
00:02:50,00:02:53,"He said, I found this."
00:02:53,00:02:59,"And after the amount of time that's required for them to keep it and wait for someone to claim it had passed, they gave it back to him."
00:02:59,00:03:08,"So he was 10,000 quid richer, except for some reason, every single one of the bills had been cut into tiny small pieces."
00:03:08,00:03:14,"And the Bank of England had said, if you can put them all back together, absolutely, they're legal tender, and you've got 10,000 pounds."
00:03:14,00:03:17,"But right now, you just have shreds of 10,000 pounds."
00:03:17,00:03:20,And so that's what he has in his house.
00:03:20,00:03:24,So he apparently was going to make an attempt to try and jigsaw piece it back together.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Where was this done?
00:03:25,00:03:27,2008.
00:03:27,00:03:32,"Wow. It's a different type. Like these days, you get bankers who have lost their Bitcoin and put it in a dump."
00:03:32,00:03:34,And that's they're trying to get that back.
00:03:34,00:03:38,"But in those days, it was just bin men with bags of shred of money, wasn't it?"
00:03:38,00:03:43,"Because that's like, if your money rips, you can like put it together with sell it to it."
00:03:43,00:03:46,Like I've seen that before where I've got to know that it's stuck.
00:03:46,00:03:48,And that's fine.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"Yeah, I think what you need is the, there's a serial number and everybody knows."
00:03:51,00:03:55,"And that needs to be exactly correct, because they'll check it."
00:03:55,00:03:58,"And so if it's in two pieces, that's easy. You just sell it, type it."
00:03:58,00:04:02,"But if it's in a thousand pieces, how did he know it was worth 10,000 pounds?"
00:04:02,00:04:08,"Like if you presented me with a bin bag full of shredded money, how would you..."
00:04:08,00:04:09,"I don't know, assess."
00:04:09,00:04:11,"I think that's about 10,000 pounds worth of that."
00:04:11,00:04:13,I can do that with complete nose.
00:04:13,00:04:14,I have no idea.
00:04:14,00:04:15,So you can weigh them.
00:04:15,00:04:17,So you can weigh and you know how much paper there is.
00:04:17,00:04:19,And you know how much one note weighs.
00:04:19,00:04:21,And you just divide them.
00:04:21,00:04:21,Yes.
00:04:21,00:04:23,That's clever. That's clever.
00:04:23,00:04:28,"I'm just being reminded my first, one of my first ever paid gigs that I ever got in stand-up"
00:04:28,00:04:29,was up the creek.
00:04:29,00:04:31,And I was handed an envelope of money.
00:04:31,00:04:34,And I think it was something like 200 quid that I'd made.
00:04:34,00:04:37,And I was very excitedly saved to my friends.
00:04:37,00:04:40,"Let's go to the pub, walking down the street."
00:04:40,00:04:43,And I ripped open the envelope and hadn't...
00:04:43,00:04:49,I ripped it over on the side and I tore all the money.
00:04:49,00:04:50,This was before it went to plastic.
00:04:50,00:04:54,"I tore all the money and a gust of wind came, a blew off."
00:04:54,00:04:58,The top third of all my notes.
00:04:58,00:05:00,And yet you continued with your comedy career.
00:05:00,00:05:04,Despite that very obvious side from the universe that it wasn't for you.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"Wait, it's over. They gave me five minutes from my next set."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"One of the, this is only like vaguely related."
00:05:11,00:05:13,But it's one of the funniest things I've seen.
00:05:13,00:05:15,And it does involve wind.
00:05:15,00:05:20,But I was in New Zealand with Fin Taylor and I think Phil Wang.
00:05:20,00:05:24,And Fin Taylor was talking about how he had a small part
00:05:24,00:05:27,in the new Tomb Raider film.
00:05:27,00:05:30,And I think it was cut from the final edit.
00:05:30,00:05:33,I'm not sure if it was on like special features or anything.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"But he basically said, this cast and crew cap"
00:05:36,00:05:39,is the only memento that I have from the film.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"And then almost immediately like a sitcom,"
00:05:41,00:05:46,a gust of wind blew the hat into the waters.
00:05:46,00:05:47,The boat's going away.
00:05:47,00:05:52,And was just sort of like almost didn't laugh but just remember saying
00:05:52,00:05:53,that's the funniest thing.
00:05:53,00:05:55,That's the funniest thing I've ever seen.
00:05:55,00:05:56,The timing of it.
00:05:56,00:06:00,"But I still felt like, but I can't laugh because I think it's sad as well."
00:06:00,00:06:02,"But yeah, it was so perfect."
00:06:02,00:06:05,It's lost all proof using that movie.
00:06:05,00:06:10,Would you like some beat slang?
00:06:10,00:06:11,Oh yeah.
00:06:11,00:06:11,Right.
00:06:11,00:06:12,I'm feeling hairy.
00:06:12,00:06:13,What's that?
00:06:13,00:06:14,I'm a tender profile.
00:06:16,00:06:18,No good is good feeling hairy.
00:06:18,00:06:18,Feeling good feeling.
00:06:18,00:06:20,My rod.
00:06:20,00:06:21,My rod.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Hey.
00:06:22,00:06:23,Car.
00:06:23,00:06:23,Car.
00:06:23,00:06:24,Like a hot rod.
00:06:24,00:06:25,Hot rod.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Exactly.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Let's stable the iron.
00:06:27,00:06:29,Put it back in your trousers mate.
00:06:29,00:06:30,It's parked the car.
00:06:30,00:06:31,What's a kickstick?
00:06:31,00:06:32,Kickstick.
00:06:32,00:06:34,Kickstick.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"It's not on your bike, is it?"
00:06:35,00:06:35,It's not the...
00:06:35,00:06:36,"No, that's a kickstand."
00:06:36,00:06:37,Nice.
00:06:37,00:06:38,It's a cigarette.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Kickstick.
00:06:39,00:06:40,"To give you a kick, right?"
00:06:40,00:06:41,"Yes, sir."
00:06:41,00:06:44,But they were very quickly taking the piss out of the beats.
00:06:44,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"And the Village Voice magazine in New York,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,they ran a rent-a-beatenic competition.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Right.
00:06:49,00:06:50,Where you could hire a beatenic for your party.
00:06:50,00:06:51,They did it as a joke.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"And then they actually, I think,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,started getting beat poets in...
00:06:54,00:06:56,"Who said, ""Yeah, I could do with $40."""
00:06:56,00:06:56,All right.
00:06:56,00:06:58,Yeah.
00:06:58,00:06:59,Bongo's optional.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"Yeah, I don't know how they earned any money,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,because most of them didn't actually publish anything.
00:07:02,00:07:04,Or like a lot of the...
00:07:04,00:07:05,"One of the main members, Neil Cassidy."
00:07:05,00:07:06,I don't think he published anything.
00:07:06,00:07:07,"Oh, he did."
00:07:07,00:07:08,"Well, maybe posthumously."
00:07:08,00:07:09,Posthumously.
00:07:09,00:07:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:09,00:07:10,It's not...
00:07:10,00:07:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:10,00:07:13,Can you just put this beer on my tab?
00:07:13,00:07:15,I'm going to publish some stuff posthumously.
00:07:15,00:07:17,And I'll make sure you get it.
00:07:17,00:07:19,Posthumous to have is a great idea.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"I'm going to be massive, I promise."
00:07:20,00:07:28,"One of my favorite clowns from history is Lulu Adams, UK clown."
00:07:28,00:07:32,And she was known as one of the first ever women circus clowns.
00:07:32,00:07:34,She was born in 1900.
00:07:34,00:07:38,And she was like the first ever female clown to appear at Olympia.
00:07:38,00:07:40,And I just think she was incredible.
00:07:40,00:07:41,She played the bagpipe.
00:07:41,00:07:43,She could ride a horse at the same time.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Her whole family were in the circus.
00:07:44,00:07:49,Like just a proper old-fashioned showwoman show family.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"And she did a double act with her husband, Albatino."
00:07:52,00:07:56,"And they got hired by the Bertram Mill Circus,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,which was such a big deal.
00:07:58,00:08:03,"And they got offered a contract, which was like, I think $35 or £35 a week,"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"which was the equivalent of like £2000 a week now,"
00:08:06,00:08:11,which was massive to go to New York to do this amazing tour of their act.
00:08:11,00:08:14,"And then they went on air, this was in 1948."
00:08:14,00:08:17,"And they were being interviewed on the New York radio in April,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,on the day the opening night.
00:08:19,00:08:22,And they asked Albatino what's it like to perform.
00:08:22,00:08:26,"And as he answered, he died on air of a heart attack."
00:08:26,00:08:32,"And that evening, Lulu Adams went on stage and continued to do the double act."
00:08:32,00:08:36,And she completed the entire nine-month contract on her own.
00:08:37,00:08:42,And the newspaper article was like the first female clown is smiling even though her heart is breaking.
00:08:42,00:08:45,"But it's just, and then she continued performing for the rest of her life."
00:08:45,00:08:49,And then moved to Brighton and made costumes for performers.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"On a professional, that's professionalism."
00:08:52,00:08:57,"And I want to say that if all the three of you guys who do the podcast with me died,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,I would continue to do it as if nothing had happened.
00:08:59,00:09:01,Quite right. And we know.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"We know. You say that every week, Anna."
00:09:04,00:09:06,And it's starting to pull.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"Yeah, my booby traps keep failing."
00:09:09,00:09:17,"I really miss what sounds like the golden age of non-imperson dating,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,which is the video dating thing.
00:09:19,00:09:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:20,00:09:23,So this was on TV as a kind of joke when I was growing up.
00:09:23,00:09:27,"Like you sit in a studio, you record a video of yourself."
00:09:27,00:09:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:28,00:09:31,"Yeah, there was a guy called Jeffrey Almond."
00:09:31,00:09:33,He set it up. He was a young videographer.
00:09:33,00:09:35,And so you had this huge library of videos.
00:09:35,00:09:38,And then you just watch like a five minute tape of any potential person.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"And you say, right, I'm interested in Jennifer."
00:09:40,00:09:41,Can you?
00:09:41,00:09:46,And then Jennifer gets a phone call saying Greg is interested in you.
00:09:46,00:09:48,Can you go in and view Greg's video?
00:09:48,00:09:48,Right.
00:09:48,00:09:50,And literally a VHS.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Yes.
00:09:51,00:09:52,And so like it's laborious.
00:09:52,00:09:54,But the thing is the way the interviews were conducted.
00:09:54,00:09:57,"This guy, Jeffrey Almond, did the interviews himself, right?"
00:09:57,00:09:58,You'd fill out a form of your preferences.
00:09:58,00:10:00,And then he would do a little interview with you.
00:10:00,00:10:00,Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:02,But he would also kind of interrogate you.
00:10:02,00:10:03,So listen to this.
00:10:04,00:10:08,"Almond recollected, I'd say to you, you've got five kids"
00:10:08,00:10:09,and you live way out in the suburbs.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Now I don't mean to insult you, Ethel."
00:10:11,00:10:12,But how dateable are you?
00:10:12,00:10:15,And then Ethel's on the spot having to answer it.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"Like, well, I can send the kids off to their auntie or whatever."
00:10:18,00:10:20,"Like, as in, she's having to answer for herself."
00:10:20,00:10:22,"Yeah, that's a bit probing."
00:10:22,00:10:25,"But it's kind of, I suppose, the reasoning was she's proving."
00:10:25,00:10:27,"Oh, no, look, this is how great I am as a match."
00:10:27,00:10:30,They must give Ethel the questions beforehand.
00:10:30,00:10:31,I don't know.
00:10:31,00:10:34,I quite like the idea of the Jeremy Paxman kind of dating service.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"Well, it's like, if you answer on a play, it's just the same question."
00:10:37,00:10:38,Yeah.
00:10:38,00:10:39,But do you like films?
00:10:39,00:10:42,"Well, I've seen them."
00:10:42,00:10:45,It had 17 franchises by the mid '80s.
00:10:45,00:10:48,"And there was even, there was one specifically for people"
00:10:48,00:10:50,in Washington DC with herpes.
00:10:50,00:10:51,That's how successful it was.
00:10:51,00:10:52,Wow.
00:10:52,00:10:53,I don't know why.
00:10:53,00:10:55,I don't know why.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"I suppose if you have herpes, then you"
00:10:56,00:10:58,should only shack people with herpes.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Is that the thinking?
00:10:59,00:11:01,"That is the thinking, clearly."
00:11:01,00:11:01,Yeah.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"And that's, we've mentioned this before, but that's basically"
00:11:04,00:11:07,one of the reasons the YouTube guys gave for setting up YouTube
00:11:07,00:11:09,at all was that video dating.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"So you would put up a video of yourself in this exact same way,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,but you're knocking out VHS and you just click to the next link.
00:11:15,00:11:18,"That was largely part of the, the creation of it."
00:11:18,00:11:21,I watch everything on two-time speed with stuff like that to get through it.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"So everyone would be disappointed when they turned up with normal,"
00:11:23,00:11:24,bassy voices.
00:11:29,00:11:32,"If we gave dinosaurs to every country in the world,"
00:11:32,00:11:36,it wouldn't help because dinosaurs couldn't live today.
00:11:36,00:11:41,"And that is because in the Cretaceous era,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,they had about 35% oxygen.
00:11:43,00:11:46,And today we have about 21% oxygen.
00:11:46,00:11:48,So there wouldn't be enough oxygen for them to live.
00:11:48,00:11:51,They'd all be sort of gasping for air the whole time.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"Well, you're telling me that this series of documentaries I watch"
00:11:55,00:11:59,set on island Nuba.
00:11:59,00:12:02,"I don't know, I haven't seen it, but they all have like gas masks"
00:12:02,00:12:05,and yeah equipment.
00:12:05,00:12:06,Pretty upset.
00:12:06,00:12:08,You haven't seen Jurassic Park.
00:12:08,00:12:09,I'm afraid I haven't.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Not any of them.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"No, but there's a new one out, isn't there?"
00:12:12,00:12:15,So I think I might have to catch up.
00:12:15,00:12:16,Just start with the new one and work backwards.
00:12:16,00:12:18,That's how you're meant to do it.
00:12:18,00:12:19,Like the Star Wars films.
00:12:19,00:12:23,Here's the thing on diplomacy.
00:12:23,00:12:26,So we talked about dinosaur diplomacy.
00:12:26,00:12:28,There's other things like ping pong diplomacy
00:12:28,00:12:31,where China and America play ping pong against each other.
00:12:31,00:12:35,There is panda diplomacy where China gave out pandas
00:12:35,00:12:37,to different countries.
00:12:37,00:12:39,And they found one called xylophone diplomacy.
00:12:39,00:12:41,Does anyone know what that is?
00:12:41,00:12:43,It feels like we can guess.
00:12:43,00:12:44,Try to do dinosaur thing.
00:12:44,00:12:46,You play the ribs of the dinosaur like a xylophone
00:12:46,00:12:49,and that lightens the mood at tricky summits.
00:12:50,00:12:53,You send everyone's islephones and that gives the prime school children
00:12:53,00:12:56,something to do and parents very grateful.
00:12:56,00:12:59,"No, I read this in the economist and it says"
00:12:59,00:13:00,xylophone diplomacy.
00:13:00,00:13:04,A made-up turn created in order to have an entry for the letter x
00:13:04,00:13:07,in the economist A to Z of international relations.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"All right, thanks a lot."
00:13:08,00:13:13,The way all these things worked I guess is you
00:13:13,00:13:15,you sent in a bit of money and you filled out a questionnaire
00:13:15,00:13:16,which could be very long.
00:13:16,00:13:18,So the operation match was 75 questions.
00:13:18,00:13:21,And then they took your questionnaire and they tried to match it up
00:13:21,00:13:25,with others using a computer algorithm which is why it was computerized.
00:13:25,00:13:30,"I think a good way of doing it would be to have like 10,000 questions"
00:13:30,00:13:33,that you have to go through and you're matched by
00:13:33,00:13:35,how far you go through before you give up.
00:13:35,00:13:36,That's very good.
00:13:36,00:13:38,Because I think I would be well matched to someone
00:13:38,00:13:42,who had the same level of getting bored quickly as I do.
00:13:42,00:13:43,I think you'd answer them all because you're a completist.
00:13:43,00:13:45,Do you like long list of information?
00:13:45,00:13:46,That's a thing.
00:13:46,00:13:49,And probably the person who dated me would need to be
00:13:49,00:13:51,similar to put up with that.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"I do have a dating app for you, James."
00:13:53,00:13:56,I know you're off the market but there is a new one in the USA
00:13:56,00:13:58,called SCORE which is a dating app for people
00:13:58,00:14:00,who have a good to excellent credit rating.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"Oh, and it's..."
00:14:02,00:14:03,I do have a good credit rating.
00:14:03,00:14:04,"I mean, sorry, excellent."
00:14:04,00:14:07,I just think that's so...
00:14:07,00:14:08,"I think that's quite good, actually, like..."
00:14:08,00:14:09,It's very sensible.
00:14:09,00:14:10,I disagree.
00:14:10,00:14:13,I think that's a good case of opposites attract.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Actually, you're so right."
00:14:14,00:14:16,But much more responsible to pay yourself up with someone with a bad one
00:14:16,00:14:17,so you can raise them up to your left.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Absolutely.
00:14:18,00:14:19,That's not how it works.
00:14:19,00:14:19,They drag you down.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Anna.
00:14:20,00:14:23,That's what happens in love.
00:14:23,00:14:24,You're right.
00:14:24,00:14:25,You're right.
00:14:25,00:14:25,You're right.
00:14:25,00:14:26,You're right.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"I've got one here from Geoffrey Partica,"
00:14:29,00:14:32,which is a fishy stretch.
00:14:32,00:14:33,It's been said.
00:14:33,00:14:35,Disgusting.
00:14:35,00:14:38,It is a stretch of effect.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"But I'm reading it because I know Tom Cruise is a huge,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,huge deal in Andy's life.
00:14:44,00:14:48,"So, Tom Cruise took up race car driving and got married"
00:14:48,00:14:50,because of the Russian Revolution.
00:14:50,00:14:50,Okay.
00:14:50,00:14:52,That was a long journey.
00:14:52,00:14:54,There's a long journey to get to what this is.
00:14:54,00:14:55,1917.
00:14:55,00:14:58,Ruben Maumullian
00:14:58,00:15:00,was studying at a stage production
00:15:00,00:15:03,at the Imperial Moscow University in the hopes of directing.
00:15:03,00:15:05,And he was from a Saras family.
00:15:05,00:15:07,So he fled America when the revolution broke out.
00:15:07,00:15:09,He became a director of fled to America.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Sorry.
00:15:10,00:15:12,Very few people fled America when the Russian Revolution
00:15:12,00:15:13,broke out.
00:15:13,00:15:14,That's too cautious.
00:15:14,00:15:19,"Yeah, he fled to America."
00:15:19,00:15:23,"And years later, he becomes the initial director of Cleopatra"
00:15:23,00:15:24,with Lisbeth Taylor.
00:15:24,00:15:26,There was lots of problems.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"Constant script changes, creative differences."
00:15:29,00:15:31,So he was eventually replaced as the director.
00:15:31,00:15:34,So then Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor
00:15:34,00:15:36,were scheduled to be in the movie together.
00:15:36,00:15:37,"But because of the shooting delays,"
00:15:37,00:15:38,"because of this,"
00:15:38,00:15:40,Taylor was prevented from joining the film.
00:15:40,00:15:42,So both roles were recast.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"With Robert Mitchell and Shirley McClain,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,which freed up Paul Newman to be in the hustler
00:15:47,00:15:48,with Jackie Gleason.
00:15:48,00:15:53,"The hustler is credited with popularizing pool in America,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,giving Paul Newman a lifelong love of the game.
00:15:55,00:15:59,"It also allowed him to reprise his role as fast Eddie Felsen,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,"25 years later in the Scorsese sequel,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,The Color of Money.
00:16:03,00:16:04,James has started eating biscuits.
00:16:04,00:16:06,He's roughly performative.
00:16:06,00:16:08,He could be more far away from the microphone right now.
00:16:08,00:16:11,That's what happens when he gets interested.
00:16:11,00:16:13,I don't think I've got to be needed for a few longer.
00:16:13,00:16:16,"It was in this movie, as far as Eddie Felsen,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,that Paul Newman introduced Tom Cruise
00:16:18,00:16:20,to the thrill of driving too fast.
00:16:20,00:16:23,"Thanks to his new love,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,Cruise was cast in the NASCAR movie Days of Thunder.
00:16:25,00:16:27,He met Nicole Kidman.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"Oh, that's not anyone, isn't it?"
00:16:29,00:16:30,"Yeah, and then it just ends."
00:16:30,00:16:31,There might have been a few other consequences
00:16:31,00:16:32,"due to the Russian Revolution,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,but I think it'd be difficult
00:16:34,00:16:36,to find something more inane.
00:16:36,00:16:38,Certainly the worst consequence.
00:16:40,00:16:41,"No, that's terrific."
00:16:41,00:16:44,Tom Cruise could have had a career as a kind of sensitive
00:16:44,00:16:45,character actor.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:48,But were it not for the Russian Revolution?
00:16:48,00:16:49,There you go.
00:16:49,00:16:49,Great.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Nice.
00:16:50,00:16:50,Love it.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"Just on guitars,"
00:16:52,00:16:55,can I give everyone a guitar song recommendation?
00:16:55,00:16:58,"It's called ""It's Really Good."""
00:16:58,00:17:01,"It's called ""United Breaks Guitars"""
00:17:01,00:17:03,and it was a hit in 2009.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"Have you heard everything, Andrew?"
00:17:05,00:17:06,He's nodding along.
00:17:06,00:17:08,"He's a musician called Dave Carroll,"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"who was, and I guess it must be the bane of a lot of guitar players' lives."
00:17:12,00:17:15,He was on a plane and he watched the baggage handlers
00:17:15,00:17:19,"throw his $3,500 guitar all over the shop."
00:17:19,00:17:20,So my golf clubs.
00:17:20,00:17:23,You could sing an equally popular
00:17:23,00:17:26,relatable song about that.
00:17:26,00:17:29,And it's really good if he wrote this song
00:17:29,00:17:31,about how they've broken his guitar.
00:17:31,00:17:32,"I think it's great,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,"but they're nice, tragedy-like country."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"It's wonderful, isn't it?"
00:17:35,00:17:36,It's also...
00:17:36,00:17:39,It's that thing where this incredibly precious thing...
00:17:39,00:17:43,"Obviously, there's a hand-like-a-jams race, isn't there?"
00:17:43,00:17:45,And there's recently a story about...
00:17:45,00:17:48,People employed in airports are...
00:17:48,00:17:51,They're rewarded like a few quid for each bag
00:17:51,00:17:53,that sort of refused to put on.
00:17:53,00:17:57,Because imagine how difficult that job actually is.
00:17:57,00:18:00,You've got a massive stagdo who haven't read the terms in conditions.
00:18:00,00:18:02,They've all got bags too big to go on.
00:18:02,00:18:03,You've got to tell everyone...
00:18:03,00:18:06,"It's, you know, you can't take it on and it's 60 extra quid"
00:18:06,00:18:07,to put it on the whole age.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"But with guitars, yeah, just..."
00:18:10,00:18:13,"You know, this incredibly precious thing."
00:18:13,00:18:15,And what you have to do is down-tune them.
00:18:15,00:18:18,"So if you're going to put them in the luggage role,"
00:18:18,00:18:21,"put it in a hard case, down-tune it."
00:18:21,00:18:23,So you haven't got the tension on the strings.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"Because if it gets dropped or smashed,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,that tension can make the neck cave in.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"Yeah, right."
00:18:29,00:18:30,Wow.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Interesting.
00:18:31,00:18:37,"Doing that, taking the tuning down, is actually an entire style of guitaring in Hawaii."
00:18:37,00:18:38,And I'd never heard of this.
00:18:38,00:18:40,Slack Key Guitar.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Oh, wow."
00:18:41,00:18:48,Slack Key Guitar is where you basically are detuning at least three strings of your guitar
00:18:48,00:18:50,in order to create an open chord that you can play.
00:18:50,00:18:53,And then you can use the top notes as your bass line.
00:18:53,00:18:55,And then you can play with the open chord for the rest.
00:18:55,00:18:59,"The thing about it is, like I was talking earlier about hiding your fingers"
00:18:59,00:19:02,"behind a handkerchief, Slack Key Guitar in Hawaii was also something"
00:19:02,00:19:06,where you would hand down the tunings of each of those six strings
00:19:06,00:19:09,to your family and not let anyone else know.
00:19:09,00:19:12,So it became like the family style of playing this particular guitar.
00:19:12,00:19:14,And we know a bunch of them now.
00:19:14,00:19:15,"Yeah, it's become more open now."
00:19:15,00:19:19,But it was handed down as the family secret for how you would play guitar.
00:19:19,00:19:23,And so everyone would have their own specific open chord.
00:19:23,00:19:25,"Well, these secret guitar chords."
00:19:25,00:19:28,"I had no idea that it was such an exciting secretive world,"
00:19:28,00:19:29,the world of guitar playing.
00:19:29,00:19:32,And we're sure it's not just because people always have to fly to Hawaii
00:19:32,00:19:35,on a plane and then their guitars aren't strong.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"Oh, fuck, I better make this a thing."
00:19:37,00:19:43,"The first album I ever bought was the Jimmy Hendrix album, which was great."
00:19:43,00:19:45,Because he does sound like nobody else.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"Like it does, it is an unbelievable sound he has."
00:19:47,00:19:52,And it was partly thanks to his sound engineer guy who was called Roger Mayer.
00:19:52,00:19:54,And this is where the other weird military link comes in.
00:19:54,00:19:59,Because Roger Mayer sort of qualified did all his early work in acoustics
00:19:59,00:20:03,in the Royal Naval Scientific Service working on underwater warfare.
00:20:03,00:20:05,He was on submarines.
00:20:05,00:20:07,He was working on the stuff of keeping submarines silent.
00:20:07,00:20:10,"You know, that was his whole project when he was in the Navy."
00:20:10,00:20:12,So I just love this quote.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"When a steel hulled sub is running silent, you know,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,the whole point about submarines is you stay completely quiet
00:20:17,00:20:18,and no one knows that you're there.
00:20:18,00:20:22,"When it's running silent, the sound of a dropped spanner can be picked up"
00:20:22,00:20:26,and the sub's position located from up to 160 kilometers away.
00:20:26,00:20:27,What?
00:20:27,00:20:28,What?
00:20:28,00:20:29,What?
00:20:29,00:20:30,Imagine that.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Can that be true?
00:20:31,00:20:34,"I think he, like, I know it sounds like I'm talking about, I guess."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"He exactly, like, I can't believe it."
00:20:36,00:20:40,"So basically, all of, he realised all of his work also applied to guitars"
00:20:40,00:20:42,"and he made this amazing sound effects device for Hendrix,"
00:20:42,00:20:46,which creates an amazing trippy harmonic sound
00:20:46,00:20:47,the octave above your playing.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Yeah.
00:20:48,00:20:50,And he showed it to Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin
00:20:50,00:20:52,"and Jimmy Page said, ""Well, it's too much for me."
00:20:52,00:20:53,"Yeah, it's too far out for me."""
00:20:53,00:20:54,Right.
00:20:54,00:20:54,But Hendrix was into it.
00:20:54,00:20:56,Roger Mayer is still alive.
00:20:56,00:20:56,He's still.
00:20:56,00:20:57,Hey.
00:20:57,00:20:58,"He's still around, yeah."
00:20:58,00:20:59,"So the question is,"
00:20:59,00:21:00,if you put Jimmy Hendrix on a submarine
00:21:00,00:21:02,and got him to play Purple H.
00:21:02,00:21:04,Apple far away.
00:21:04,00:21:06,The whole world could listen.
00:21:06,00:21:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:09,00:21:13,That period of time is one that I'm endlessly fascinated with.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"The kind of, you know, the mid-60s,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"a lot of those bands, a lot of the movies that came out around that time"
00:21:18,00:21:20,are a source of perennial fascination to me.
00:21:20,00:21:24,"And one of the things that is so strange about it all is,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,"it's obviously, it's so close to the Second World War."
00:21:27,00:21:29,"You know, like the, yeah."
00:21:29,00:21:31,"And the whole cultural landscape,"
00:21:31,00:21:33,it's like when you see photos of Bob Dylan
00:21:33,00:21:36,touring the mid-60s and he's occasionally just walking around
00:21:36,00:21:39,just sort of rubble in Liverpool or something
00:21:39,00:21:43,because the whole idea of like the free-loved 60s
00:21:43,00:21:46,is so close to the end of the Second World War
00:21:46,00:21:49,"and there's all these people who were sort of just called,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"like, just doing military service."
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And then, suddenly, are now trying to work out"
00:21:53,00:21:57,how to make Jimmy Hendrix's guitar successfully
00:21:57,00:21:59,and be like the noise that runs through his head
00:21:59,00:22:00,when he takes LSD.
00:22:00,00:22:01,You know what I'm saying?
00:22:01,00:22:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:02,00:22:04,I think it's such an interesting point.
00:22:04,00:22:07,I think it's something that will never certainly
00:22:07,00:22:09,"with the world of rock music experience again,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,where I was listening to Ozzy Osborne talk
00:22:12,00:22:13,the other day about the Beatles.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"And he said, you just, you will never understand"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"what the Beatles meant to us, not just the music,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,what they meant to us.
00:22:18,00:22:22,We were in a black and white world and it went technicolor.
00:22:22,00:22:24,We suddenly believe that life was fun again
00:22:24,00:22:25,and it was through that.
00:22:25,00:22:28,And all that period is what that was.
00:22:28,00:22:30,They were building off the back of trying
00:22:30,00:22:32,to get back into technicolor off the back of war.
00:22:32,00:22:34,It's fascinating stuff.
00:22:34,00:22:35,"I agree, I'm obsessed with that period."
00:22:35,00:22:38,"If you're in a yellow submarine, don't inquire."
00:22:38,00:22:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:39,00:22:40,And you drop a spanner.
00:22:40,00:22:40,Yeah.
00:22:40,00:22:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:43,00:22:44,Here's one.
00:22:44,00:22:48,Dolphins says Andrew Heldenbrand can use ultrasound
00:22:48,00:22:52,to detect pregnancies and will pay special attention
00:22:52,00:22:55,"to pregnant women, nuzzling them while scanning them"
00:22:55,00:22:57,with ultrasonic frequencies.
00:22:57,00:22:58,That's pretty cool.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"It's like that, yeah."
00:22:59,00:23:02,Walker and they tell you things like what sex it is.
00:23:02,00:23:02,"Yeah, they'll say."
00:23:02,00:23:04,Does it have the right number of things in toes?
00:23:04,00:23:06,"It's very annoying sometimes, because they'll say,"
00:23:06,00:23:09,you must have been hoping for a boy or whatever.
00:23:09,00:23:09,Yeah.
00:23:09,00:23:11,And you might not want him wanting to know that yet.
00:23:11,00:23:12,What level of detail could they turn to the Dan
00:23:12,00:23:13,"and go, it's bad news."
00:23:13,00:23:15,I think I might have been the neighbor.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"You know, like, are they--"
00:23:16,00:23:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:18,00:23:20,Is that what are they fighting out?
00:23:20,00:23:22,What's your milkman's nose like?
00:23:22,00:23:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:23,00:23:25,"It's, I don't think it's huge detail,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,but I think they could probably detect the heartbeat.
00:23:27,00:23:31,"I think they can do a very, very narrow beam of echolocation."
00:23:31,00:23:31,It's called buzzing.
00:23:31,00:23:35,And it sounds like a squeaky door to us when they're doing it.
00:23:35,00:23:36,"That is cool, isn't it?"
00:23:36,00:23:37,So why don't they use--
00:23:37,00:23:38,"When you go to have your first scan,"
00:23:38,00:23:42,why don't they use dolphins instead of machines?
00:23:42,00:23:43,The natural way.
00:23:43,00:23:44,When you're having a water birth.
00:23:44,00:23:47,"Yeah, the literal wet nurse."
00:23:47,00:23:47,Flipper.
00:23:47,00:23:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:50,00:23:52,Have you guys heard of kitten fishing?
00:23:52,00:23:52,No.
00:23:52,00:23:53,No.
00:23:53,00:23:55,Can you guess what it is?
00:23:55,00:23:57,It's not pretending to be a kitten.
00:23:57,00:23:59,So cat fishing is where you pretend to be
00:23:59,00:24:01,someone you're completely not.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"And then they think that they're dating you,"
00:24:03,00:24:04,but you're not doing it.
00:24:04,00:24:06,And eventually you might get some money off the mouse.
00:24:06,00:24:08,"So kitten fishing, I reckon,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,is you pretending to be yourself as a child?
00:24:10,00:24:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:11,00:24:13,"I see, to catch pedophiles, isn't it?"
00:24:13,00:24:14,Yes.
00:24:14,00:24:14,"No, it's not that."
00:24:14,00:24:17,It is just embellishing or misrepresenting
00:24:17,00:24:20,yourself online to make you more desirable.
00:24:20,00:24:21,OK.
00:24:21,00:24:22,We'll do that.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Well, they need a special web for that."
00:24:23,00:24:25,"So according to Hinge, the web site,"
00:24:25,00:24:27,"the trouble is that when you do that,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,"it kind of defeats the whole purpose of online dating,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,which is to find the right match.
00:24:31,00:24:35,So you really have to be kind of as close to real as possible.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"Wait, but your right match is definitely lying as well."
00:24:37,00:24:38,"I think that's how everyone's doing, right?"
00:24:38,00:24:40,They're all banking on everyone.
00:24:40,00:24:40,And he's trying to raise it.
00:24:40,00:24:42,That's what the first day is all about.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"Working out what the lies were, seemingly."
00:24:44,00:24:46,"OK, what about woke fishing?"
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Oh, my god."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"Oh, pretending to be woke."
00:24:48,00:24:49,"Yeah, pretending to be."
00:24:49,00:24:50,That's what you mean.
00:24:50,00:24:53,That's the course I support the cause on red.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"Actually, until you're in the pants,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,then turns out you're shameful in your bedside draw.
00:24:58,00:25:00,You've got a Tory rosette.
00:25:00,00:25:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:01,00:25:02,That's not it.
00:25:02,00:25:03,It's too late.
00:25:03,00:25:03,She's in love.
00:25:03,00:25:05,Pretty much that.
00:25:05,00:25:06,Orbitink.
00:25:06,00:25:09,Orbitink is what that's a term.
00:25:09,00:25:13,It's another term that's in modern dating slang.
00:25:13,00:25:16,So that's circling around someone not approaching?
00:25:16,00:25:18,"Yeah, pretty much, but in an online setting."
00:25:18,00:25:21,"So staying occasionally liking the photos,"
00:25:21,00:25:23,"leaving the odd, very, very innocuous comments"
00:25:23,00:25:25,"so that you're kind of in the Orbit,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,but you're not really engaging with the Orbitink.
00:25:27,00:25:29,And then zombieing.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Coming back from the dead.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Yeah.
00:25:31,00:25:33,And offering a date.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Pretty much.
00:25:34,00:25:37,"And so you know what ghosting is, where you just stop"
00:25:37,00:25:40,and reply to someone completely at the time they don't exist.
00:25:40,00:25:41,"I know, but someone who's previously--"
00:25:41,00:25:44,My wife's been doing it to me since yesterday.
00:25:44,00:25:47,It's when someone who's previously ghosted you suddenly
00:25:47,00:25:49,reappears and acts as if nothing ever happened.
00:25:49,00:25:50,Oh.
00:25:50,00:25:51,That's very good.
00:25:51,00:25:52,Very good.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"Very, very good."
00:25:55,00:25:57,"Jack Harrelack, we said he's American."
00:25:57,00:25:58,And he was American.
00:25:58,00:26:03,But his parents were quibber-quibber-quibber-quibber.
00:26:03,00:26:08,He was-- they were from Quebec.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"But that meant that until he was six years old,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,he only spoke dual.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Dual is a--
00:26:13,00:26:16,Dual is a--
00:26:16,00:26:18,It's sort of a dialect from Quebec.
00:26:18,00:26:23,"It's kind of half French, half English, all very, very weird."
00:26:23,00:26:26,So the name comes from how they say the word chaval.
00:26:26,00:26:28,So chaval is French for horse.
00:26:28,00:26:31,And there's a phrase to speak French like a horse.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"It means to speak French very, very badly."
00:26:33,00:26:35,And so they call it dual.
00:26:35,00:26:39,And they have lots of English words in there.
00:26:39,00:26:43,So dumpe in dual means to throw out the trash.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"Like, it comes from the dump in English."
00:26:45,00:26:47,And they turn it into a French thing.
00:26:47,00:26:47,That's great.
00:26:47,00:26:52,"The word from Peanut is Peanut, just slightly French."
00:26:52,00:26:57,"And the word poutine, you know, which is like chips"
00:26:57,00:27:01,"with cheese, gravy on it, it's absolutely delicious."
00:27:01,00:27:04,But we think it might be dual for pudding.
00:27:04,00:27:06,"So as in, they took the English word pudding"
00:27:06,00:27:10,and then it became poutine and then it became that right.
00:27:10,00:27:13,That's-- but it's often called a G-Generate language.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"He's both, obviously, so I've just born speaking it."
00:27:16,00:27:18,And I think maybe we don't know to what extent
00:27:18,00:27:20,he was speaking standard French Canadian to what extent
00:27:20,00:27:20,it was dual.
00:27:20,00:27:24,"But even age 18, he still had quite a strong French accent,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"which I think is quite cocky, given that age 17"
00:27:27,00:27:31,was when he decided to write a great American novel in English.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"Well, you know, yeah."
00:27:33,00:27:34,You got to set your sights high.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"But when you're not fluent in English, yeah."
00:27:36,00:27:37,"Oh, I think that's pretty cool."
00:27:37,00:27:40,"Like, how Napoleon was from Corsica, isn't it?"
00:27:40,00:27:40,Exactly.
00:27:40,00:27:42,A lot of the most famous people from a place
00:27:42,00:27:44,were actually from the borders or the fringes
00:27:44,00:27:45,or the outline region Austria.
00:27:45,00:27:45,Yeah.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"Right, Stalin was from Georgia."
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:50,And we don't want to compare Kerry Wack
00:27:50,00:27:53,to Hitler and Stalin and Napoleon.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"Oh, don't, the inbox."
00:27:56,00:27:57,"Oh, my god."
00:27:57,00:27:59,Sometimes I just look forward.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Oh.
00:28:00,00:28:05,"OK, that is it."
00:28:05,00:28:06,That is all of our outtakes.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Thanks, everyone."
00:28:07,00:28:10,"If you want to send in any thoughts about what you heard,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,"if it made you think of a random extra fact,"
00:28:12,00:28:15,why not send that in to podcast@QI.com?
00:28:15,00:28:17,All the people that were on the show today
00:28:17,00:28:17,are all online.
00:28:17,00:28:19,If you want to message them directly somewhere
00:28:19,00:28:22,"on Instagram or Twitter, go find their ads."
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Otherwise, come back in two weeks."
00:28:23,00:28:25,We're going to have a drop us a line waiting for you.
00:28:25,00:28:26,And we will see you all then.
00:28:26,00:28:28,Good bye.
