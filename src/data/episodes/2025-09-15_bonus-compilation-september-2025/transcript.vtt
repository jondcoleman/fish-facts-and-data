00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 [music]

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.160
 Hey there Clubfish members, Dan here.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 Hope you're all doing well.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.400
 Welcome to a bonus compilation episode.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.600
 These are all the bits that didn't make it to the main show either because I just didn't fit the narrative,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.880
 or they were on a tangent, they just didn't fit the shape.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 So we bang them all together here so that you can hear the stuff that didn't make it.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.120
 Quite excitingly, for this particular compilation, it's not just the voice of us for fishers,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.880
 but we have a bunch of guests.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 So you'll remember we did some Edinburgh shows recently, and a bunch of the offcuts from those recordings have made their way here.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 So you're going to hear, and you'll be hearing them in this order, Ian Smith, Elf Lions,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 you're going to get a couple of sentences from Ahir Shah, there's Andrew Neal, and then finally, Nish Kumar.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.320
 And you're also going to hear a couple of audience submitted facts that we riff on as well.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 So that's the show for today.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.320
 Thank you everyone who came to our live shows, by the way.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.960
 We had two live shows very recently at the London Podcast Festival, Jamie Morton from my dad wrote a porno was there.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.080
 We had a really great night with him, and then the following night we had Richard Osmanon.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560
 And again, just a wild, brilliant live show.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.880
 We love our live shows so much.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.760
 And if you missed out on it, they're obviously going to be coming out as edited episodes.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.120
 But if you want to see the full thing, like from the moment that we walk on stage,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.120
 all the way through to the quiz that we play at the end, you can still get access to the live stream video.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.840
 If you go to no such thing as a fish.com/live, you're going to find a link that will take you to the King's Place website,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.400
 where you can buy the live stream video.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.800
 That's going to be up for the next week.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 We're trying to see if we can get an extension on it.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 So if you want to check that out, do that.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 And you'll notice, if you have headed to our website, that there is another link there for the Cheltenham Literary Festival.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.040
 That's happening on the 16th of October.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.680
 So we're doing another live show.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.160
 It's part of this brilliant literature festival.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.840
 And we're going to be joined on stage by one of our favorite people, Rachel Paris.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440
 So if you happen to be in the area, come and say hi.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 Okay, let's get on to this compilation.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.680
 And we begin with Ian Smith, who, by the way, was nominated for the best show at the Edinburgh Fringe this year for his show Foot Spa Half Empty.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.080
 So that's very cool.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 But let's get into it.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 Here we go.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.120
 On with the compilation.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:31.960
 I found a story that happened in 2008 of a real-life jigsaw problem.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.680
 And I wonder, because I can't find an update on it, whether or not this person is still trying to solve it.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:49.200
 So this is a bin man who was called Graham Hill, and he found, in a bunch of bags, 10,000 pounds worth of 10 pound and 20 pound notes.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.960
 And he handed it over to the police.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.120
 He said, I found this.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.760
 And after the amount of time that's required for them to keep it and wait for someone to claim it had passed, they gave it back to him.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.000
 So he was 10,000 quid richer, except for some reason, every single one of the bills had been cut into tiny small pieces.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.800
 And the Bank of England had said, if you can put them all back together, absolutely, they're legal tender, and you've got 10,000 pounds.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.840
 But right now, you just have shreds of 10,000 pounds.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.400
 And so that's what he has in his house.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.640
 So he apparently was going to make an attempt to try and jigsaw piece it back together.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.600
 Where was this done?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.120
 2008.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.880
 Wow. It's a different type. Like these days, you get bankers who have lost their Bitcoin and put it in a dump.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.640
 And that's they're trying to get that back.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.480
 But in those days, it was just bin men with bags of shred of money, wasn't it?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.200
 Because that's like, if your money rips, you can like put it together with sell it to it.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.320
 Like I've seen that before where I've got to know that it's stuck.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.080
 And that's fine.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.920
 Yeah, I think what you need is the, there's a serial number and everybody knows.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.440
 And that needs to be exactly correct, because they'll check it.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.400
 And so if it's in two pieces, that's easy. You just sell it, type it.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.960
 But if it's in a thousand pieces, how did he know it was worth 10,000 pounds?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.400
 Like if you presented me with a bin bag full of shredded money, how would you...

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.360
 I don't know, assess.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.280
 I think that's about 10,000 pounds worth of that.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.040
 I can do that with complete nose.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.080
 I have no idea.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.440
 So you can weigh them.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.600
 So you can weigh and you know how much paper there is.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.680
 And you know how much one note weighs.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.120
 And you just divide them.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.920
 Yes.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.600
 That's clever. That's clever.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.240
 I'm just being reminded my first, one of my first ever paid gigs that I ever got in stand-up

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 was up the creek.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.920
 And I was handed an envelope of money.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.880
 And I think it was something like 200 quid that I'd made.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.840
 And I was very excitedly saved to my friends.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.000
 Let's go to the pub, walking down the street.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.920
 And I ripped open the envelope and hadn't...

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.120
 I ripped it over on the side and I tore all the money.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.720
 This was before it went to plastic.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.640
 I tore all the money and a gust of wind came, a blew off.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.080
 The top third of all my notes.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.720
 And yet you continued with your comedy career.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.240
 Despite that very obvious side from the universe that it wasn't for you.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.160
 Wait, it's over. They gave me five minutes from my next set.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.600
 One of the, this is only like vaguely related.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.840
 But it's one of the funniest things I've seen.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.040
 And it does involve wind.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.240
 But I was in New Zealand with Fin Taylor and I think Phil Wang.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.640
 And Fin Taylor was talking about how he had a small part

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.680
 in the new Tomb Raider film.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.320
 And I think it was cut from the final edit.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.360
 I'm not sure if it was on like special features or anything.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.640
 But he basically said, this cast and crew cap

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.520
 is the only memento that I have from the film.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.920
 And then almost immediately like a sitcom,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.160
 a gust of wind blew the hat into the waters.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.280
 The boat's going away.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.560
 And was just sort of like almost didn't laugh but just remember saying

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.840
 that's the funniest thing.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.520
 That's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.640
 The timing of it.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.080
 But I still felt like, but I can't laugh because I think it's sad as well.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.720
 But yeah, it was so perfect.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.520
 It's lost all proof using that movie.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.160
 Would you like some beat slang?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.120
 Oh yeah.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.760
 Right.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.960
 I'm feeling hairy.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.760
 What's that?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.880
 I'm a tender profile.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.000
 No good is good feeling hairy.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.800
 Feeling good feeling.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800
 My rod.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.600
 My rod.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.640
 Hey.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.360
 Car.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.920
 Car.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.720
 Like a hot rod.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.280
 Hot rod.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.000
 Exactly.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.360
 Let's stable the iron.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.280
 Put it back in your trousers mate.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.640
 It's parked the car.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.440
 What's a kickstick?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.960
 Kickstick.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.160
 Kickstick.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.120
 It's not on your bike, is it?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.920
 It's not the...

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.960
 No, that's a kickstand.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.440
 Nice.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.080
 It's a cigarette.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.920
 Kickstick.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.880
 To give you a kick, right?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.440
 Yes, sir.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.320
 But they were very quickly taking the piss out of the beats.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.800
 Yeah.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.640
 And the Village Voice magazine in New York,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.720
 they ran a rent-a-beatenic competition.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.200
 Right.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.640
 Where you could hire a beatenic for your party.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.520
 They did it as a joke.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.400
 And then they actually, I think,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.320
 started getting beat poets in...

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.080
 Who said, "Yeah, I could do with $40."

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.960
 All right.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.080
 Yeah.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.440
 Bongo's optional.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.640
 Yeah, I don't know how they earned any money,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.640
 because most of them didn't actually publish anything.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.080
 Or like a lot of the...

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.920
 One of the main members, Neil Cassidy.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.960
 I don't think he published anything.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.440
 Oh, he did.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.560
 Well, maybe posthumously.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.120
 Posthumously.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.240
 It's not...

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.200
 Can you just put this beer on my tab?

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.760
 I'm going to publish some stuff posthumously.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.200
 And I'll make sure you get it.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.360
 Posthumous to have is a great idea.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.880
 I'm going to be massive, I promise.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:28.480
 One of my favorite clowns from history is Lulu Adams, UK clown.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.800
 And she was known as one of the first ever women circus clowns.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.320
 She was born in 1900.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.720
 And she was like the first ever female clown to appear at Olympia.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.400
 And I just think she was incredible.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.440
 She played the bagpipe.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.200
 She could ride a horse at the same time.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.960
 Her whole family were in the circus.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.680
 Like just a proper old-fashioned showwoman show family.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.800
 And she did a double act with her husband, Albatino.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.000
 And they got hired by the Bertram Mill Circus,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.080
 which was such a big deal.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.040
 And they got offered a contract, which was like, I think $35 or £35 a week,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.240
 which was the equivalent of like £2000 a week now,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.120
 which was massive to go to New York to do this amazing tour of their act.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.080
 And then they went on air, this was in 1948.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.280
 And they were being interviewed on the New York radio in April,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.440
 on the day the opening night.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.560
 And they asked Albatino what's it like to perform.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.080
 And as he answered, he died on air of a heart attack.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.960
 And that evening, Lulu Adams went on stage and continued to do the double act.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.800
 And she completed the entire nine-month contract on her own.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.960
 And the newspaper article was like the first female clown is smiling even though her heart is breaking.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.920
 But it's just, and then she continued performing for the rest of her life.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.040
 And then moved to Brighton and made costumes for performers.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.240
 On a professional, that's professionalism.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.200
 And I want to say that if all the three of you guys who do the podcast with me died,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.520
 I would continue to do it as if nothing had happened.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.680
 Quite right. And we know.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.320
 We know. You say that every week, Anna.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.400
 And it's starting to pull.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.600
 Yeah, my booby traps keep failing.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:17.920
 I really miss what sounds like the golden age of non-imperson dating,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.760
 which is the video dating thing.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.920
 So this was on TV as a kind of joke when I was growing up.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.120
 Like you sit in a studio, you record a video of yourself.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.120
 Yeah, there was a guy called Jeffrey Almond.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.200
 He set it up. He was a young videographer.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.360
 And so you had this huge library of videos.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.800
 And then you just watch like a five minute tape of any potential person.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800
 And you say, right, I'm interested in Jennifer.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.520
 Can you?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.160
 And then Jennifer gets a phone call saying Greg is interested in you.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.000
 Can you go in and view Greg's video?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.960
 Right.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.320
 And literally a VHS.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.120
 Yes.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.720
 And so like it's laborious.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.880
 But the thing is the way the interviews were conducted.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.200
 This guy, Jeffrey Almond, did the interviews himself, right?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.720
 You'd fill out a form of your preferences.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.320
 And then he would do a little interview with you.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.720
 Yeah.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.880
 But he would also kind of interrogate you.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.760
 So listen to this.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.240
 Almond recollected, I'd say to you, you've got five kids

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.760
 and you live way out in the suburbs.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.360
 Now I don't mean to insult you, Ethel.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.720
 But how dateable are you?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.200
 And then Ethel's on the spot having to answer it.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.160
 Like, well, I can send the kids off to their auntie or whatever.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.800
 Like, as in, she's having to answer for herself.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.160
 Yeah, that's a bit probing.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.200
 But it's kind of, I suppose, the reasoning was she's proving.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.680
 Oh, no, look, this is how great I am as a match.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.000
 They must give Ethel the questions beforehand.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.040
 I don't know.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.080
 I quite like the idea of the Jeremy Paxman kind of dating service.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.840
 Well, it's like, if you answer on a play, it's just the same question.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.640
 Yeah.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.840
 But do you like films?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.400
 Well, I've seen them.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.760
 It had 17 franchises by the mid '80s.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.640
 And there was even, there was one specifically for people

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.400
 in Washington DC with herpes.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.840
 That's how successful it was.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.720
 Wow.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.520
 I don't know why.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.120
 I don't know why.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.880
 I suppose if you have herpes, then you

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.560
 should only shack people with herpes.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.520
 Is that the thinking?

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.120
 That is the thinking, clearly.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.840
 Yeah.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.560
 And that's, we've mentioned this before, but that's basically

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.600
 one of the reasons the YouTube guys gave for setting up YouTube

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.920
 at all was that video dating.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.560
 So you would put up a video of yourself in this exact same way,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.120
 but you're knocking out VHS and you just click to the next link.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.400
 That was largely part of the, the creation of it.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.200
 I watch everything on two-time speed with stuff like that to get through it.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.760
 So everyone would be disappointed when they turned up with normal,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.720
 bassy voices.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.560
 If we gave dinosaurs to every country in the world,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.160
 it wouldn't help because dinosaurs couldn't live today.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.200
 And that is because in the Cretaceous era,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.920
 they had about 35% oxygen.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.560
 And today we have about 21% oxygen.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.800
 So there wouldn't be enough oxygen for them to live.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.280
 They'd all be sort of gasping for air the whole time.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.040
 Well, you're telling me that this series of documentaries I watch

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.440
 set on island Nuba.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.720
 I don't know, I haven't seen it, but they all have like gas masks

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.280
 and yeah equipment.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.240
 Pretty upset.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.080
 You haven't seen Jurassic Park.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.760
 I'm afraid I haven't.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.800
 Not any of them.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.720
 No, but there's a new one out, isn't there?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.040
 So I think I might have to catch up.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.960
 Just start with the new one and work backwards.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.080
 That's how you're meant to do it.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.200
 Like the Star Wars films.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.680
 Here's the thing on diplomacy.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.320
 So we talked about dinosaur diplomacy.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.960
 There's other things like ping pong diplomacy

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.760
 where China and America play ping pong against each other.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.920
 There is panda diplomacy where China gave out pandas

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.200
 to different countries.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.920
 And they found one called xylophone diplomacy.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.040
 Does anyone know what that is?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.200
 It feels like we can guess.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.160
 Try to do dinosaur thing.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.960
 You play the ribs of the dinosaur like a xylophone

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.600
 and that lightens the mood at tricky summits.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.920
 You send everyone's islephones and that gives the prime school children

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.400
 something to do and parents very grateful.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.040
 No, I read this in the economist and it says

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.160
 xylophone diplomacy.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.240
 A made-up turn created in order to have an entry for the letter x

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.280
 in the economist A to Z of international relations.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.560
 All right, thanks a lot.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.040
 The way all these things worked I guess is you

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.600
 you sent in a bit of money and you filled out a questionnaire

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.400
 which could be very long.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.800
 So the operation match was 75 questions.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.920
 And then they took your questionnaire and they tried to match it up

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.760
 with others using a computer algorithm which is why it was computerized.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.480
 I think a good way of doing it would be to have like 10,000 questions

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.680
 that you have to go through and you're matched by

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.520
 how far you go through before you give up.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.320
 That's very good.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.560
 Because I think I would be well matched to someone

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.080
 who had the same level of getting bored quickly as I do.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.920
 I think you'd answer them all because you're a completist.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.440
 Do you like long list of information?

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.160
 That's a thing.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.600
 And probably the person who dated me would need to be

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.280
 similar to put up with that.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.040
 I do have a dating app for you, James.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.400
 I know you're off the market but there is a new one in the USA

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.400
 called SCORE which is a dating app for people

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.800
 who have a good to excellent credit rating.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.080
 Oh, and it's...

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.840
 I do have a good credit rating.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.960
 I mean, sorry, excellent.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.280
 I just think that's so...

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.960
 I think that's quite good, actually, like...

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.760
 It's very sensible.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.640
 I disagree.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.120
 I think that's a good case of opposites attract.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.160
 Actually, you're so right.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.640
 But much more responsible to pay yourself up with someone with a bad one

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.840
 so you can raise them up to your left.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.240
 Absolutely.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.040
 That's not how it works.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.680
 They drag you down.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.160
 Anna.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.440
 That's what happens in love.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.400
 You're right.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.040
 You're right.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.040
 You're right.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.240
 You're right.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.200
 I've got one here from Geoffrey Partica,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.480
 which is a fishy stretch.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.280
 It's been said.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.040
 Disgusting.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.480
 It is a stretch of effect.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.480
 But I'm reading it because I know Tom Cruise is a huge,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.160
 huge deal in Andy's life.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
 So, Tom Cruise took up race car driving and got married

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.160
 because of the Russian Revolution.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.800
 Okay.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.000
 That was a long journey.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.160
 There's a long journey to get to what this is.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.120
 1917.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.160
 Ruben Maumullian

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.400
 was studying at a stage production

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.520
 at the Imperial Moscow University in the hopes of directing.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.280
 And he was from a Saras family.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.360
 So he fled America when the revolution broke out.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.680
 He became a director of fled to America.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.160
 Sorry.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.400
 Very few people fled America when the Russian Revolution

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.360
 broke out.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.640
 That's too cautious.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.440
 Yeah, he fled to America.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.280
 And years later, he becomes the initial director of Cleopatra

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.800
 with Lisbeth Taylor.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.160
 There was lots of problems.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.040
 Constant script changes, creative differences.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.760
 So he was eventually replaced as the director.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.320
 So then Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.080
 were scheduled to be in the movie together.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.440
 But because of the shooting delays,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.480
 because of this,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.720
 Taylor was prevented from joining the film.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.240
 So both roles were recast.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.400
 With Robert Mitchell and Shirley McClain,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.680
 which freed up Paul Newman to be in the hustler

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.800
 with Jackie Gleason.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.120
 The hustler is credited with popularizing pool in America,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.200
 giving Paul Newman a lifelong love of the game.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.040
 It also allowed him to reprise his role as fast Eddie Felsen,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.920
 25 years later in the Scorsese sequel,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.040
 The Color of Money.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.560
 James has started eating biscuits.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.720
 He's roughly performative.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.960
 He could be more far away from the microphone right now.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.120
 That's what happens when he gets interested.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.200
 I don't think I've got to be needed for a few longer.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.560
 It was in this movie, as far as Eddie Felsen,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.480
 that Paul Newman introduced Tom Cruise

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.720
 to the thrill of driving too fast.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.040
 Thanks to his new love,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.760
 Cruise was cast in the NASCAR movie Days of Thunder.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.360
 He met Nicole Kidman.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.040
 Oh, that's not anyone, isn't it?

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.240
 Yeah, and then it just ends.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.600
 There might have been a few other consequences

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.960
 due to the Russian Revolution,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.320
 but I think it'd be difficult

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.400
 to find something more inane.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.000
 Certainly the worst consequence.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.600
 No, that's terrific.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.240
 Tom Cruise could have had a career as a kind of sensitive

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.520
 character actor.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.240
 Yeah.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.400
 But were it not for the Russian Revolution?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.120
 There you go.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.600
 Great.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.000
 Nice.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.320
 Love it.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.880
 Just on guitars,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.600
 can I give everyone a guitar song recommendation?

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.640
 It's called "It's Really Good."

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.200
 It's called "United Breaks Guitars"

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.840
 and it was a hit in 2009.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.680
 Have you heard everything, Andrew?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.880
 He's nodding along.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.640
 He's a musician called Dave Carroll,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.000
 who was, and I guess it must be the bane of a lot of guitar players' lives.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.360
 He was on a plane and he watched the baggage handlers

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.120
 throw his $3,500 guitar all over the shop.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.320
 So my golf clubs.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.920
 You could sing an equally popular

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.880
 relatable song about that.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.440
 And it's really good if he wrote this song

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.040
 about how they've broken his guitar.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.080
 I think it's great,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.760
 but they're nice, tragedy-like country.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.440
 It's wonderful, isn't it?

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.160
 It's also...

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.280
 It's that thing where this incredibly precious thing...

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.360
 Obviously, there's a hand-like-a-jams race, isn't there?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.440
 And there's recently a story about...

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.000
 People employed in airports are...

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.120
 They're rewarded like a few quid for each bag

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.440
 that sort of refused to put on.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.760
 Because imagine how difficult that job actually is.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.800
 You've got a massive stagdo who haven't read the terms in conditions.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.640
 They've all got bags too big to go on.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.920
 You've got to tell everyone...

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.640
 It's, you know, you can't take it on and it's 60 extra quid

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.600
 to put it on the whole age.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.000
 But with guitars, yeah, just...

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.280
 You know, this incredibly precious thing.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.280
 And what you have to do is down-tune them.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.800
 So if you're going to put them in the luggage role,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.200
 put it in a hard case, down-tune it.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.040
 So you haven't got the tension on the strings.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.480
 Because if it gets dropped or smashed,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.800
 that tension can make the neck cave in.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.440
 Yeah, right.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.080
 Wow.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.200
 Interesting.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.040
 Doing that, taking the tuning down, is actually an entire style of guitaring in Hawaii.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.320
 And I'd never heard of this.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.160
 Slack Key Guitar.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.440
 Oh, wow.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.080
 Slack Key Guitar is where you basically are detuning at least three strings of your guitar

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.880
 in order to create an open chord that you can play.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.360
 And then you can use the top notes as your bass line.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.440
 And then you can play with the open chord for the rest.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.120
 The thing about it is, like I was talking earlier about hiding your fingers

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.800
 behind a handkerchief, Slack Key Guitar in Hawaii was also something

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.800
 where you would hand down the tunings of each of those six strings

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.440
 to your family and not let anyone else know.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.880
 So it became like the family style of playing this particular guitar.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.160
 And we know a bunch of them now.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.440
 Yeah, it's become more open now.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.680
 But it was handed down as the family secret for how you would play guitar.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.280
 And so everyone would have their own specific open chord.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.360
 Well, these secret guitar chords.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.160
 I had no idea that it was such an exciting secretive world,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.360
 the world of guitar playing.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.320
 And we're sure it's not just because people always have to fly to Hawaii

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.760
 on a plane and then their guitars aren't strong.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.840
 Oh, fuck, I better make this a thing.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.680
 The first album I ever bought was the Jimmy Hendrix album, which was great.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.920
 Because he does sound like nobody else.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.920
 Like it does, it is an unbelievable sound he has.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.720
 And it was partly thanks to his sound engineer guy who was called Roger Mayer.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.800
 And this is where the other weird military link comes in.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.200
 Because Roger Mayer sort of qualified did all his early work in acoustics

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.440
 in the Royal Naval Scientific Service working on underwater warfare.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.040
 He was on submarines.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.520
 He was working on the stuff of keeping submarines silent.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.720
 You know, that was his whole project when he was in the Navy.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.720
 So I just love this quote.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.360
 When a steel hulled sub is running silent, you know,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.280
 the whole point about submarines is you stay completely quiet

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.800
 and no one knows that you're there.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.160
 When it's running silent, the sound of a dropped spanner can be picked up

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.640
 and the sub's position located from up to 160 kilometers away.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.200
 What?

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.240
 What?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.200
 What?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.240
 Imagine that.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.760
 Can that be true?

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.880
 I think he, like, I know it sounds like I'm talking about, I guess.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.480
 He exactly, like, I can't believe it.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.400
 So basically, all of, he realised all of his work also applied to guitars

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.640
 and he made this amazing sound effects device for Hendrix,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.160
 which creates an amazing trippy harmonic sound

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.520
 the octave above your playing.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.160
 Yeah.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.160
 And he showed it to Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.080
 and Jimmy Page said, "Well, it's too much for me.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.520
 Yeah, it's too far out for me."

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.000
 Right.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.960
 But Hendrix was into it.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.160
 Roger Mayer is still alive.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.720
 He's still.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.200
 Hey.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.320
 He's still around, yeah.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.280
 So the question is,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.960
 if you put Jimmy Hendrix on a submarine

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.320
 and got him to play Purple H.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 Apple far away.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.000
 The whole world could listen.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.680
 That period of time is one that I'm endlessly fascinated with.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.360
 The kind of, you know, the mid-60s,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.480
 a lot of those bands, a lot of the movies that came out around that time

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.960
 are a source of perennial fascination to me.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.720
 And one of the things that is so strange about it all is,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.680
 it's obviously, it's so close to the Second World War.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.840
 You know, like the, yeah.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.920
 And the whole cultural landscape,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.520
 it's like when you see photos of Bob Dylan

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.400
 touring the mid-60s and he's occasionally just walking around

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.680
 just sort of rubble in Liverpool or something

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.280
 because the whole idea of like the free-loved 60s

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.800
 is so close to the end of the Second World War

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.520
 and there's all these people who were sort of just called,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.120
 like, just doing military service.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.920
 And then, suddenly, are now trying to work out

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.120
 how to make Jimmy Hendrix's guitar successfully

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.120
 and be like the noise that runs through his head

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.160
 when he takes LSD.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.920
 You know what I'm saying?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.400
 I think it's such an interesting point.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.360
 I think it's something that will never certainly

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.600
 with the world of rock music experience again,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.080
 where I was listening to Ozzy Osborne talk

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.280
 the other day about the Beatles.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.120
 And he said, you just, you will never understand

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.680
 what the Beatles meant to us, not just the music,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.960
 what they meant to us.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.000
 We were in a black and white world and it went technicolor.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.400
 We suddenly believe that life was fun again

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.280
 and it was through that.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.560
 And all that period is what that was.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.080
 They were building off the back of trying

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.720
 to get back into technicolor off the back of war.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.080
 It's fascinating stuff.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.840
 I agree, I'm obsessed with that period.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.320
 If you're in a yellow submarine, don't inquire.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.480
 And you drop a spanner.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:40.960
 Yeah.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.640
 Here's one.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.880
 Dolphins says Andrew Heldenbrand can use ultrasound

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.480
 to detect pregnancies and will pay special attention

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.360
 to pregnant women, nuzzling them while scanning them

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.760
 with ultrasonic frequencies.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.480
 That's pretty cool.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.520
 It's like that, yeah.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.160
 Walker and they tell you things like what sex it is.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.880
 Yeah, they'll say.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.960
 Does it have the right number of things in toes?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.880
 It's very annoying sometimes, because they'll say,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.040
 you must have been hoping for a boy or whatever.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:09.520
 Yeah.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.200
 And you might not want him wanting to know that yet.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.720
 What level of detail could they turn to the Dan

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.840
 and go, it's bad news.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.200
 I think I might have been the neighbor.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.320
 You know, like, are they--

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.640
 Is that what are they fighting out?

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.160
 What's your milkman's nose like?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.280
 It's, I don't think it's huge detail,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.920
 but I think they could probably detect the heartbeat.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.040
 I think they can do a very, very narrow beam of echolocation.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.920
 It's called buzzing.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.040
 And it sounds like a squeaky door to us when they're doing it.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.080
 That is cool, isn't it?

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.360
 So why don't they use--

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.960
 When you go to have your first scan,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.080
 why don't they use dolphins instead of machines?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.600
 The natural way.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.880
 When you're having a water birth.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.200
 Yeah, the literal wet nurse.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.840
 Flipper.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.320
 Have you guys heard of kitten fishing?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:52.880
 No.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.680
 No.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.920
 Can you guess what it is?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.200
 It's not pretending to be a kitten.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.280
 So cat fishing is where you pretend to be

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.600
 someone you're completely not.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.760
 And then they think that they're dating you,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.640
 but you're not doing it.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.480
 And eventually you might get some money off the mouse.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.000
 So kitten fishing, I reckon,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 is you pretending to be yourself as a child?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.360
 I see, to catch pedophiles, isn't it?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.080
 Yes.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.880
 No, it's not that.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.520
 It is just embellishing or misrepresenting

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.880
 yourself online to make you more desirable.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.400
 OK.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.120
 We'll do that.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.600
 Well, they need a special web for that.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.600
 So according to Hinge, the web site,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.200
 the trouble is that when you do that,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.880
 it kind of defeats the whole purpose of online dating,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.680
 which is to find the right match.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.040
 So you really have to be kind of as close to real as possible.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.320
 Wait, but your right match is definitely lying as well.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.640
 I think that's how everyone's doing, right?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.080
 They're all banking on everyone.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.920
 And he's trying to raise it.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.120
 That's what the first day is all about.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.680
 Working out what the lies were, seemingly.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.240
 OK, what about woke fishing?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.280
 Oh, my god.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.760
 Oh, pretending to be woke.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.920
 Yeah, pretending to be.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.920
 That's what you mean.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.440
 That's the course I support the cause on red.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.000
 Actually, until you're in the pants,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.840
 then turns out you're shameful in your bedside draw.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.160
 You've got a Tory rosette.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.520
 That's not it.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.200
 It's too late.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.920
 She's in love.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.400
 Pretty much that.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.320
 Orbitink.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.760
 Orbitink is what that's a term.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.560
 It's another term that's in modern dating slang.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.320
 So that's circling around someone not approaching?

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.400
 Yeah, pretty much, but in an online setting.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.760
 So staying occasionally liking the photos,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.960
 leaving the odd, very, very innocuous comments

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.840
 so that you're kind of in the Orbit,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.920
 but you're not really engaging with the Orbitink.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.400
 And then zombieing.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.600
 Coming back from the dead.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.440
 Yeah.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.360
 And offering a date.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360
 Pretty much.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.560
 And so you know what ghosting is, where you just stop

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.200
 and reply to someone completely at the time they don't exist.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.880
 I know, but someone who's previously--

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.400
 My wife's been doing it to me since yesterday.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.200
 It's when someone who's previously ghosted you suddenly

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200
 reappears and acts as if nothing ever happened.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.200
 Oh.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.480
 That's very good.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480
 Very good.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.200
 Very, very good.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.320
 Jack Harrelack, we said he's American.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.200
 And he was American.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:03.280
 But his parents were quibber-quibber-quibber-quibber.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.400
 He was-- they were from Quebec.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.440
 But that meant that until he was six years old,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.640
 he only spoke dual.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.560
 Dual is a--

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.200
 Dual is a--

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.600
 It's sort of a dialect from Quebec.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.360
 It's kind of half French, half English, all very, very weird.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.920
 So the name comes from how they say the word chaval.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.760
 So chaval is French for horse.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.080
 And there's a phrase to speak French like a horse.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.840
 It means to speak French very, very badly.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.600
 And so they call it dual.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.120
 And they have lots of English words in there.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.720
 So dumpe in dual means to throw out the trash.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.600
 Like, it comes from the dump in English.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.360
 And they turn it into a French thing.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:47.880
 That's great.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.960
 The word from Peanut is Peanut, just slightly French.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.760
 And the word poutine, you know, which is like chips

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.600
 with cheese, gravy on it, it's absolutely delicious.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.480
 But we think it might be dual for pudding.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.920
 So as in, they took the English word pudding

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.360
 and then it became poutine and then it became that right.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.640
 That's-- but it's often called a G-Generate language.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.200
 He's both, obviously, so I've just born speaking it.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.000
 And I think maybe we don't know to what extent

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.320
 he was speaking standard French Canadian to what extent

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:20.840
 it was dual.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.880
 But even age 18, he still had quite a strong French accent,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.680
 which I think is quite cocky, given that age 17

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.280
 was when he decided to write a great American novel in English.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.080
 Well, you know, yeah.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.480
 You got to set your sights high.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.480
 But when you're not fluent in English, yeah.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.600
 Oh, I think that's pretty cool.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.080
 Like, how Napoleon was from Corsica, isn't it?

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.880
 Exactly.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.480
 A lot of the most famous people from a place

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.120
 were actually from the borders or the fringes

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.640
 or the outline region Austria.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:45.960
 Yeah.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.760
 Right, Stalin was from Georgia.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.760
 Yeah.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.800
 And we don't want to compare Kerry Wack

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.160
 to Hitler and Stalin and Napoleon.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.840
 Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.040
 Oh, don't, the inbox.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.360
 Oh, my god.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.360
 Sometimes I just look forward.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.360
 Oh.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.280
 OK, that is it.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.840
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.600
 Thanks, everyone.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.120
 If you want to send in any thoughts about what you heard,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.360
 if it made you think of a random extra fact,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.560
 why not send that in to podcast@QI.com?

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.160
 All the people that were on the show today

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.960
 are all online.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.800
 If you want to message them directly somewhere

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.160
 on Instagram or Twitter, go find their ads.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.400
 Otherwise, come back in two weeks.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.440
 We're going to have a drop us a line waiting for you.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.960
 And we will see you all then.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.440
 Good bye.
