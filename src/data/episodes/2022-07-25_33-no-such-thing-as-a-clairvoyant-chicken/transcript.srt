1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,760
 It is not such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,000
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,800
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:22,960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
 from the QI offices in Covered Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
 Harkin, Andy, Marie and Anna Chazinski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphone

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,000
 with our four favorite Spooky facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 For this, our Halloween special and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:54,320
 Okay, fact number one, Andy. My fact is that until the year 635 AD, Halloween was on the 12th of May.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,560
 Why was it on the 12th of May and why did we change it?

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 Well, it's only really on the 12th of May because it's Halloween is the day before All Saints Day.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,960
 Yeah, I was under the impression that that was the first of November.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
 Yes, well, basically Halloween is part of the All-Hallowed Tide Festival.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,960
 It's three days, which is All-Hallowed Zeeve, which we've got Halloween, All-Hallowed Day or All Saints Day

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,600
 and All-Souls Day. It was introduced in 609 AD, but it was on the 13th of May and everyone

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,440
 would travel to Rome and do pilgrimages there. But in 835, Gregory IV, who was then the Pope,

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,880
 said that it should become the first of November and we're not really sure why.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,480
 There is a theory that it was because it was sort of a way of adopting other religions

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,840
 or other traditional rights and folding them into the church.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
 Because there already was a kind of a middle of autumn.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
 Yeah, that's called 'Sawin' and it was the festival of the beginning of winter

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,480
 and there was a lot of death around in the air and that's what people saw.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,240
 Also, autumn is just a spookier time. Spring isn't a spookier time,

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
 that's when life starts to happen and the sun's coming out.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
 Except that. Autumn is spookier.

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,240
 Well, when people used to visit Rome, there is a theory that it was moved to autumn

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
 because when so many people visited Rome, everyone got malaria,

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,760
 which is itself quite a spooky zombie-like thing to happen to.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,600
 Yeah, chords of pilgrim so.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,480
 But it used to be because obviously we've transformed it into a time of the undead

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
 and all that stuff.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,880
 Like, wasn't really about that.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
 Was it as spookier back then?

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
 Yeah, so that might be why it might have been nice in May.

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 Yeah, there are amazing Halloween traditions which sort of evolved from

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
 the whole 'Remember the Dead' thing.

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,240
 So, trickle-treating came from solving.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,360
 It was originally not just children, it was poor people and children.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,200
 You would go door to door praying for people, dead people in exchange for cake.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,800
 I've heard some other ideas about where trickle-treat came from.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
 Yeah, me too. That's a bit.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
 So here's one. For instance, they had mischief night in Leeds and Bradford in Yorkshire

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
 and the children would go around causing trouble and the authorities would just let them off

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
 and they say, "It's nub-but-but-mischief-nate."

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
 Oh, okay.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,640
 There was also a thing called 'Hop Tuna' in the Isle of Man.

49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,440
 And that had people wandering around armed with bits of turnip,

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,760
 singing in 'manks' and demanding 'cash'.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,680
 And the idea is that these guys from like Yorkshire or Isle of Man or

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
 Island or Scotland had all gone over to America during the, you know,

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
 whenever that was.

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
 And they brought it there and then it's come back over here.

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
 Yeah, that's one theory behind trickle-treat.

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
 Well, I thought it was a, I think it was originally a German tradition,

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,200
 but it was popular in Pennsylvania and Dutch communities in America up until the early 20th century.

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
 They're first-hand accounts of it and it's called 'Belsnickling',

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
 which I think it should be because it's just a good name.

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,240
 But it was a Christmas tradition and it happened on Christmas Eve,

61
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
 but it's so similar.

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,640
 So basically the teenagers of the community were dressed up as various different characters,

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,800
 fictional characters and they go around kids' houses and they'd scare the kids

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,680
 and the kids would have to guess what they were dressed up as and if they guess right,

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
 they got a suite.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
 So basically there's lots of different theories to trickle-treats.

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
 It's probably just something that builds up all over the world.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,080
 Yeah.

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
 It's an obvious thing, isn't it?

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
 One night a year, you go a bit crazy.

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
 Yeah, like the, like the purge, that movie.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
 And do you like the movie the purge?

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,000
 So 'Borbing for Apples' is Halloween tradition now, obviously.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
 It seems like it should be more of a Valentine's Day tradition.

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,480
 So it was a way of people selecting a future husband.

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,520
 So each apple would be dropped in water and assigned a man's name.

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,360
 And then a bunch of women would rock up,

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,320
 plunge their faces into the water and the apple that they bit.

79
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,680
 If they bit the apple the first time, then they'd marry the man and live happily ever after.

80
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,000
 If they bit the apples successfully the second time, then he would court her,

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,440
 but their love would fade.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,480
 And if they but the apple the third time, the relationship was doomed.

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,080
 Oh, but it used to be that.

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,840
 Is it called 'Borbing for Apples' because the name of the man you might marry would be Bob?

85
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
 It was always Bob, yeah.

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
 Only people could Bob get it.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
 It sounds like swinging, you know, when you throw your car keys into a hat,

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,080
 but with more commitment.

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,480
 Yeah, yeah, it doesn't feel like that.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,760
 It's weird because Halloween has turned in these days into a scaremongering time

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,960
 where everyone thinks 'Borbing for Apples' were filled with razor blades.

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,000
 And...

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
 Oh, yeah.

94
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
 And big scare, wasn't it?

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
 It was a big scare, yeah, yeah.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,840
 And just general, you know, like, you've got to watch out now and it's not safe to be on the streets.

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
 That portends badly for the relationship, doesn't it?

98
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,840
 If the apple you've bobbed into, the man's name is full of razor blades.

99
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
 It appears your mouth.

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,800
 But I've got it first time, so I'm sure the marriage will be successful.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
 Have you guys heard of a singer called Keisha?

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,440
 Yes.

103
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
 Spelt with a dollar sign in her name.

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,640
 Okay, cool, because I read something about her,

105
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,240
 but I just wanted to check people have heard of her.

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,880
 I hadn't.

107
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,480
 She has a song called 'Supernatural'.

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,520
 Do you know what that's about?

109
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
 I'm ghosts.

110
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
 It's about her having sex with a ghost.

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
 Her experience having sex with ghosts,

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
 which she does on a semi-regular basis apparently.

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,120
 She wants to go to a hypnotherapist who told her that she had dead people living in her body

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,920
 and specifically in her 'Nether Regions'.

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,880
 And so she had to have her vagina exercised.

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
 And the song 'Supernatural'.

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
 Sorry, that's actual exorcised.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
 Exorcised, yeah.

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
 Not real.

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,520
 So Keisha's new DVD.

121
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
 Oh, and the footsteps have been in McCall.

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,600
 There's a word for the ghost that has sex with people.

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
 I can't remember what it is.

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,920
 Succubus.

125
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,640
 Succubus, yeah.

126
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
 Or an incubus.

127
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,320
 Yeah.

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
 Are they the female male versions?

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,560
 Yeah.

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,440
 Yeah.

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
 That happens in ghost busters.

132
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,680
 Yes, that's it.

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,320
 Yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,840
 I saw a bus yesterday which had ghost bus tours written on it,

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
 which I think is an amazingly good way of doing it,

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,920
 because they do ghost bus tours.

137
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,600
 It's better than calling it 'succubus'.

138
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,480
 Just quickly on the night terrors and being assaulted by ghosts in your sleep,

139
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,120
 there's a folklorist David Huffer to estimate that 15% of people will experience that.

140
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
 At some point in their lives.

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,720
 So don't genuinely, don't feel bad if you've had it.

142
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
 There's one thing where you're kind of just kind of on the verge of waking up or on the

143
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,240
 verge of going to sleep.

144
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,880
 And your consciousness comes back, but your body's still asleep and so you can't really

145
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,000
 sit up and you kind of get a bit of a terror that you can't sit up.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
 I think that's quite a common thing.

147
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,840
 Yeah, it is.

148
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,320
 And people believe that it's like people believe it's dead.

149
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,000
 So that they're being held down by ghosts because the consciousness has come back

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
 before the body is woken up properly.

151
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
 That's right, wow.

152
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,600
 I had that uni, it's absolutely terrifying, yeah.

153
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
 So do you know what the number one Halloween costume is?

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
 What is the most popular?

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
 A witch still.

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
 Yeah, what I thought was going to be something really surprising, like it's actually

157
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
 pretty terrible.

158
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,600
 It's not surprising, yeah, but I thought it would be like, I don't know, a super hero costume

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,320
 like Spider-Man.

160
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,000
 Well, I find where there's a list online of the most popular ones, isn't there in America this is?

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
 And there are seven million children dresses witches in America this year, they think.

162
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,920
 And there's going to be 5.8 million princesses, which is a second most, but how's that scary?

163
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,240
 Yeah, so what there's a theory that the costumes comes from this tradition, which was in the

164
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
 Middle Ages, where churches would display their relics for all Hallows Eve and all Hallows Day.

165
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
 But if they didn't have any, they would let the parishioners dress up as the saints instead.

166
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,800
 Oh, how cool is that?

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
 Which saint would you dress up as, Andy?

168
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
 I don't know, Saint Jerome.

169
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
 Oh yeah, what did he look like to know?

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,760
 If I dress up as Saint Martin of Tor, would I be allowed to do what he did, which was he went

171
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,120
 around exercising people in one of the ways he did that was to push his hand down their

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,040
 throat and push the spirit out of their anus.

173
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,960
 He's going the wrong way about it if he's trying to exercise Keisha, isn't he?

174
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:23,520
 Apparently there's a quote, which is something like the spirit left a muddy, filthy trail behind

175
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,160
 it as it left.

176
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:32,960
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

177
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,160
 My fact this week is that witches used broomsticks to put hallucinogenic drugs up their

178
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,600
 bums. What?

179
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,080
 Turns out that a lot of historians suggest that the imagery itself is actually representative

180
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
 of what they were going through, which is that they used to do hallucinogenic drugs.

181
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
 And the tripping and the flying that they used to do was actually flight to the mind.

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
 It was stuff going on inside their head.

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,960
 And it was all just one big drug trip, which is insane.

184
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,440
 A drug called datura, a European drug that you could get, which was a hallucinogenic,

185
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
 and they just used to go through their mental landscape.

186
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,040
 And the flying bit of it is just representative of what they were going through in their heads.

187
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,160
 I suppose that's more logical than the match we're flying.

188
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,480
 Yeah.

189
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,760
 What about the broom?

190
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,400
 Well, okay.

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:26,400
 The broom was a way of applying the datura drug, which it was an application device for the bum.

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,360
 Oh, wow.

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
 A suppository.

194
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
 A suppository.

195
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
 So all the imagery that you see is not them flying on a broom.

196
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
 It is using the broom as a suppository for the drug.

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,840
 A guy called Jordan De Bergamo in the 15th century who was one of the guys who were

198
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,560
 made up.

199
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,160
 He raised about it, said they anointed the staff and then anointed themselves under the arms

200
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,400
 or in other hairy places, which is another way one could refer to.

201
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,040
 The head, yeah.

202
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,080
 Exactly what do you meant?

203
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
 Um, yeah, so I just like that.

204
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
 I like that because everyone dresses up as a witch and they have an impression of why they're

205
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,960
 dressing up as it and it turns out there's a whole different connotation to what they're.

206
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,720
 So do we think this is definitely true about the broomstick or because there must be some other

207
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
 theories about why they're dressed?

208
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,960
 Yeah, I so I found this out via a ethnobiologist called Wade Davis.

209
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
 Oh, yeah.

210
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
 He's a guy who's who's made extraordinary adventures.

211
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
 He's written great books and this was just a passage inside this book.

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
 The book is actually about zombies on a trip that he did to Haiti.

213
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,280
 He went to five separate villages and in those villages they all used the same combinations

214
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,080
 of thing to create this thing where people were sighted as being supposedly being zombies.

215
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,280
 So his idea is that he did discover what makes zombies in Haiti and it's this potion.

216
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,440
 I like the idea on potions that um so I was reading about six in 16th century Spain this

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,400
 physician.

218
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,880
 He raided a house basically which was occupied by what they thought was witches and he confiscated

219
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,000
 from it a pot full of a certain green ointment composed of herbs such as hemlock and nightshade,

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,040
 henbane and mandrake from home of a couple of keys of witchcraft.

221
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
 And I just like the idea that that's the 16th century drugs raid.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,280
 Is he said well I've got some mandrake as I'm a hemlock under the bed.

223
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,160
 The first woman in Germany to run a post office was burned as a witch.

224
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,520
 Oh, was she?

225
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,760
 Was it for running a post office?

226
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,520
 No, it was for raising the price of them.

227
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:25,440
 No, she was called Katarina Henot or Henot and no, she was she was just a big member of the community

228
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,640
 and then she got accused of being a witch as they often did and then she was burned unfortunately.

229
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,400
 You have an extraordinary number of witches or alleged witches who were killed in Europe in the

230
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,440
 15th to 18th century.

231
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,400
 Is it 50,000?

232
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,440
 Yeah, some wow.

233
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,400
 Some wow.

234
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,440
 But like the Salem witch trials that basically came as just someone accusing someone else and then

235
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
 it went bigger and bigger and bigger.

236
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,040
 But it ended when the wife of the mayor or something like that got accused of being a witch and then

237
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
 suddenly the mayor went oh this is all rubbish.

238
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,280
 You guys stop it but until then the authorities are kind of agreed to it all.

239
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,600
 And then as soon as like one of the wives of the main guys in the town was accused,

240
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,480
 then suddenly they were like nope, no, yep, definitely not true.

241
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
 Bloody politicians.

242
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:05,920
 I know.

243
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,960
 They still in Papua New Guinea there's still a tradition of kind of hunting down,

244
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,080
 which isn't accusing people of witchcraft and that's mainly focused on men at the moment

245
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
 apparently or quite so.

246
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,640
 That's quite a heavy focus on men.

247
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,120
 Yeah.

248
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
 And also when I was reading about this I learned the difference between witchcraft and sorcery,

249
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
 which does make total sense.

250
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,760
 But what would you guess it was?

251
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
 Men and women.

252
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,720
 No, it's witchcraft is something that you are born with that you have a gift inside you and sorcery

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,360
 you can learn.

254
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
 So we could all be sorcerers but only I am a witch.

255
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,040
 One way of finding out if someone was a witch in Africa was administering poison to a chicken.

256
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,600
 They're mentioning the name of a suspected witch.

257
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
 If the chicken dies then the suspects is a witch.

258
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,640
 Which it might be because the suspects is a witch or it might be because you've just poisoned it.

259
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,440
 Wow.

260
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 That's a stacked legal system you've got there.

261
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,240
 It's said, yeah.

262
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,880
 In the 19th century there was a chicken that kept on laying eggs saying that Christ was coming

263
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,400
 in the end of the world was nigh and everyone got really panicked by this for a while.

264
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,480
 It was written on the eggs and eventually a guy went to investigate it and it turned out

265
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,280
 that it was being written on the eggs and then they were being shoved back up inside.

266
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
 Oh my god, reverse accesses them.

267
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,840
 It was to leave them again.

268
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,720
 Insus isn't.

269
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,840
 Have you heard of witch bottles?

270
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,880
 You would bury them.

271
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 This was in the 16th and 17th centuries.

272
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,200
 You would bury them to ward off witches basically and you would fill up an ordinary bottle

273
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,640
 with hair and urine and pins and that was the person you wanted to protect.

274
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,920
 You would put their urine in and it would throw any spell they cast back on you

275
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
 and they keep finding these things buried all over the place.

276
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,680
 That's weird isn't it because that's almost like a spell in its stealth isn't it?

277
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,840
 Yeah, because you're almost doing your own little bit of witchcraft to get rid of the witch

278
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,680
 which kind of makes you a witch as well.

279
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
 I don't know, it's a never-ending cycle.

280
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
 Eventually we'll all be witches.

281
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,280
 Yeah, the pins are quite important to witches.

282
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,680
 They use them a lot in their spells.

283
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,600
 The Pendle Witches who are from my neck of the woods, they were found to be witches

284
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,960
 because one of them went to town to try and procure some pins because they needed them for the

285
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,760
 spells. Asked this guy for some pins.

286
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,760
 He said no, he walked away, she swore at him or something, he then had a stroke or a heart attack

287
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,880
 and they thought that she'd caused it and then that's why they all got caught and then

288
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
 hanged for being a witch.

289
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,960
 Really?

290
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,760
 Yeah.

291
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,320
 Brums traditionally use the marriage ceremonies in a lot of cultures because one end represents

292
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 the phallic kind of male end and one end is the bristly female end but also the youngest

293
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
 person to get a patent on something is a little boy who's got a patent on a double-headed

294
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
 brimstick and it's Sam Hoffton of Bucsley and Darbyshire.

295
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,240
 He was three years old when he came up with it and by chance his father was a patent lawyer.

296
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,440
 Okay, so in fact number three and that is Chazinski.

297
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,960
 Yeah, my fact is that the woman who played the voice of Reagan in the exorcist only agreed

298
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,440
 to play the part on the grounds that she have two priests in her sound booth at all times

299
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
 could be constantly drinking whiskey, chain-smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs.

300
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,720
 Who is it only very similar to Anna's rider?

301
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
 Oh my gosh, thing is official putting buttons.

302
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,920
 We just haven't mentioned Grigori and Samuel.

303
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,120
 He didn't buy his priests.

304
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,920
 Obviously she had a majorly raspy angry voice in there but why the priests?

305
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,280
 Well, because so she decided that yeah, as you say, she wanted to do the whiskey and the

306
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,800
 cigarettes and the raw eggs because she thought that would give her the right voice but she was an

307
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,280
 alcoholic and she was dry. So she also addicted to raw eggs and priests.

308
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:46,080
 So she thought the priest had monitored her because to make sure that she wasn't falling

309
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,760
 off the wagon in the process of drinking the whiskey.

310
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,440
 Oh, they weren't there to kind of exercise any demons as well.

311
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,080
 Well, I thought presumably it was because of spiritual.

312
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,760
 So I've read both but either the director or the producer, I can't remember who did

313
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,040
 it. It's had an interview where he said that it was because she was an alcoholic but then I have

314
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,640
 also read that it might be because she wanted to make sure no evil spirits got into while

315
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,680
 she was playing the part.

316
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,120
 But yeah, Warner Brothers, we were talking about last week, failed to credit her for voicing

317
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,080
 her in the exercise.

318
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,920
 Well, it sounded like from what I read, she didn't want to be credited initially because

319
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,400
 she just saw I'm just doing a voicing and it was such a popular movie.

320
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,240
 In fact, I think still to this day it was the highest-grossing film of the time that that

321
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,280
 Warner Brothers had.

322
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
 I think adjusted for inflation.

323
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
 Yeah, adjusted for inflation that was the highest-grossing film that they had.

324
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,360
 So I think as soon as that happened she suddenly wanted to be credited.

325
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,160
 Oh, yeah.

326
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
 You know the scene where the girl's neck spins round and that's back into place.

327
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,720
 Yeah.

328
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,920
 You know that sort of sound of her neck and the creaking around.

329
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
 It was actually made by the director's wallet.

330
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
 Leather wallet.

331
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,840
 And he just sort of twisted it around near the microphone and that made this...

332
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,560
 I just grew up the idea that he's such a cheap skate that whenever he opens his wallet it makes his creaking sound.

333
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,880
 And the shot of the cobwebs closed, that was inside there.

334
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,360
 He used to, the director used to, in order to achieve the requisite levels of fear on the

335
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
 faces of the actors used to fire guns during filming at certain points.

336
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,200
 I just find it blank.

337
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,040
 I could never tell if this stuff is true.

338
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,320
 What do you read this about movies?

339
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,520
 He was interviewed.

340
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,040
 Yeah, I know, but he said he did it.

341
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,720
 Okay, in Scream, Drew Barrymore is the opening scene in Scream.

342
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,360
 If you remember the movie where she's chased and she becomes the first victim of the villain.

343
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
 Apparently, in order to keep her scared on set,

344
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,160
 Wes Craven would go around telling her stories of animals being harmed because she loved her.

345
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,640
 And that would put the fear into her and bring, it's like no, she's an actor.

346
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,320
 She knows how to act scared.

347
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 It's kind of insulting to the actors a little bit.

348
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,160
 It's like, oh, you can't do a scared face.

349
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
 I'm going to have to pretend to shoot you.

350
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,480
 Yeah, yeah.

351
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,680
 So in Alien, the famous spoiler alert,

352
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,040
 chest bursting scene.

353
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,560
 The actors weren't told about it beforehand.

354
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,960
 And I think I've read a bit more, I think they were told, but not in detail.

355
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,280
 They weren't told exactly how horrible it was going to be.

356
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,880
 And they did use four cameras for the take.

357
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,560
 So they got to see the real sort of horror on the face of the actors reacting.

358
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,120
 Well, there's another one at the Alien movie,

359
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,480
 which is that they needed a shot of a cat looking scared.

360
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,560
 Apparently, it wasn't scary enough for someone in an alien costume to be there.

361
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,320
 So what they had was they had a screen down with the cat sitting there as the camera's filming it.

362
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
 Lifted the screen and there was a dog sitting there.

363
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
 And they didn't tell the cat that it was going to be a dog.

364
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
 That's kind of insulting to the cat saying that he can't act properly.

365
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,640
 Yeah, it's true.

366
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
 The exorcist wouldn't have been written if he weren't for Groucho Marx.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,640
 Really?

368
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,680
 Who wrote it?

369
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,840
 Yeah, in a little in fact.

370
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
 Actually, the guy who did write it only ever written comedy before.

371
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,120
 And then wrote the artist.

372
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,080
 But he's so he's called William Blassie.

373
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,240
 And he went on this show called You Bet Your Life,

374
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
 which was hosted by Groucho Marx.

375
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
 And he won $10,000, which allowed him to take some time off.

376
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
 More grueling work on right now.

377
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
 Oh, that's cool.

378
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,120
 That's great.

379
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,680
 Yeah.

380
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,160
 Harper Lee, who wrote to Kill a Mockingbird,

381
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,520
 worked on an airline booking desk.

382
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,360
 Maybe she was sort of managing an airline booking outfit.

383
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
 And then she was given a sabbatical by her employers.

384
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
 And that's when she wrote to Kill a Mockingbird.

385
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,040
 Wasn't Kafka just a clerk and then he just used to go home and write and stuff like that?

386
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,360
 I always love that idea of these great writers actually doing other normal jobs.

387
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
 You're writing an expert time.

388
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,680
 There's a thing in the latest fact book we've just done,

389
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,880
 which is that there are 500 references to Geoffrey Chaucer in his lifetime,

390
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
 which is a huge number for someone living in that time.

391
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,200
 Yeah.

392
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
 Not one of them says that he's a writer.

393
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,840
 It's always other stuff.

394
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,040
 He was a spy, wasn't he, or something?

395
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,160
 What do you think, sir?

396
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
 Oh, he's a good one, then.

397
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
 I did not get.

398
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
 You haven't read the spies tale.

399
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,280
 Jack Nicholson was a firefighter and in the shining,

400
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,680
 when there's that really famous scene in the shining if you've seen it,

401
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,840
 where he has to hack down the door with an axe.

402
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,360
 The prop skies originally made a prop door that was really easy to hack down

403
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,680
 and because even a firefighter, he hacked it down too easily.

404
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,800
 So they had to get an actual door put in for him to hack down.

405
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,000
 Oh, because he was too--

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,720
 Because he was too good.

407
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,440
 Supermanly and strong.

408
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,240
 Wow.

409
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,880
 And that's cool.

410
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,760
 What a cool guy.

411
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
 I have a thing about ET.

412
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
 ET was originally conceived of as a horror movie.

413
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,240
 What's it?

414
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,800
 Yeah.

415
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,960
 It was after Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

416
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,400
 Spielberg wanted to do more alien stuff.

417
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
 But he wanted to do something darker and more threatening than Close Encounters.

418
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
 And so he commissioned a script and it featured aliens who could kill you

419
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
 just with one long, bony finger.

420
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
 Remember ET's finger.

421
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,160
 And they made a load of prototypes of the models of it.

422
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,800
 And they basically look like evil ET's.

423
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,880
 You know how in Gremlins, the bad Marguerite look a bit like the good one.

424
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's basically--

425
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
 And then did they realize that Drew Bimel was incapable of doing the requisite scared face?

426
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,360
 So they had to change it.

427
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,000
 So Steven Spielberg came in and said animals are being attacked every time.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
 Yeah.

429
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
 Can I tell you one quick thing about exorcisms?

430
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,880
 Please do.

431
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,680
 I know we're going to move on shortly.

432
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,320
 But so this is the thing, the Catholic Church still has 5 or 600 exorcists, official ones.

433
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,920
 One of them, Gabrielle Amorth, is the kingpin of them.

434
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,400
 He's supposedly done 100,000, used to do 20 a day.

435
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,880
 Wow.

436
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
 20 a day.

437
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,640
 Yeah, but they--

438
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,680
 That's a lot, isn't it?

439
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,880
 Yeah, but you can rattle through them quite a lot.

440
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,840
 They're easier than you think.

441
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,320
 Yeah.

442
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,040
 No.

443
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,840
 They are.

444
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
 Katie Brand, the comedian.

445
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
 She used to do them.

446
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,720
 Really?

447
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,200
 Yeah.

448
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
 Yeah, Katie Brand used to be a part of a church.

449
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
 And one of the things that she used to do was demon exercising.

450
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
 She used to do the hand down the throat version.

451
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,320
 Oh, is it?

452
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,200
 I think it was more--

453
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,240
 Is it the book and the--

454
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,800
 What do you have?

455
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,360
 I think you just--

456
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,640
 The bell and the bell, book and candle.

457
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
 Yeah, I think also it's a lot of yelling.

458
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,680
 Like the power of Christ compels you.

459
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,640
 It's that sort of stuff.

460
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,160
 And people are talking in tongues.

461
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,640
 And yeah.

462
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,160
 Saint Hilarion could exercise up to 400 people at the same time.

463
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,600
 So I think you can do them ensemble.

464
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
 If you're very good, she also wants exercise to camel.

465
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
 It's amazing.

466
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
 So I just wanted to tell you one thing I found

467
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,880
 from an article about these exorcism conferences the church has.

468
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,440
 During the conference, the reverences are Tricui.

469
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,920
 An exorcist based in Switzerland recounted one experience

470
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,600
 he had aboard a Swiss air flight.

471
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,880
 Two lesbians, he said, had sat behind him on the plane.

472
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,600
 Soon afterwards, he said he felt Satan's presence.

473
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,960
 As he silently sought to repel the evil spirit through prayer,

474
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,520
 one of the women, he said, began growling demonically

475
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,800
 and threw chocolate at his head.

476
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,560
 [LAUGHTER]

477
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,640
 I'll be called demon, though.

478
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
 Asked how he knew the woman was possessed.

479
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,160
 He said, once you hear a satanic grow, you never forget it.

480
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,040
 It's like smelling margarita pizza for the first time.

481
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
 It's something you never forget.

482
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,400
 [LAUGHTER]

483
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
 Margarita pizza.

484
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,040
 Do you know what the first ever horror film was?

485
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,520
 Oh, yeah, it was in 1892.

486
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,080
 No, it wasn't.

487
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,880
 It was before that.

488
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
 It was a George Melias movie.

489
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,680
 It was like two minutes long, wasn't it?

490
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,800
 Yeah, it was about two minutes long.

491
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,840
 And he followed it up with another movie.

492
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,560
 So I think the first one was called The Haunted Castle.

493
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,320
 Second one was three minutes long.

494
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
 And everyone said, no, they've gone overboard this time.

495
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,600
 Yeah, there's--

496
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,680
 I thought I can't take it.

497
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,000
 So the second movie, this was The Plot.

498
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 A man tries to go to sleep, but is disturbed

499
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,560
 by a giant bug climbing up the bed onto his wall.

500
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,600
 He attacks the bug with the broom and disposes of it

501
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,560
 in a chamber pot in a compartment of his bedside table.

502
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,640
 That was it.

503
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,280
 That's the second horror movie ever made.

504
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
 Third horror movie ever made was a remaking of the haunted hotel

505
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,280
 by George Raleigh and by another group of people.

506
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,080
 That's amazing.

507
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,840
 Yeah.

508
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,240
 And Nosferatu, that was the first version of Dracula.

509
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,920
 But the first movie to have the name Dracula on it

510
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,200
 was in the-- I believe in the '20s.

511
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,360
 They did this really interesting thing

512
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,440
 where they made Dracula in the daytime, the English version,

513
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,200
 and a Spanish film crew came in at night,

514
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,520
 used all the same sets and made a Spanish version of Dracula.

515
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,720
 So they made it in tandem, which seems like a really great idea.

516
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
 They were using the same sets, but they were using totally different.

517
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,880
 But also, it means that the whole of the British one

518
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,600
 has to be set during the daytime, which is probably

519
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,640
 not when Dracula or me came out at night.

520
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
 It doesn't get out much.

521
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,240
 So yeah, it's just a guy.

522
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
 He keeps intimating that he has a secret at night,

523
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,680
 but we never see him.

524
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,360
 The actor who played him, Bella Logosi.

525
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 But he was buried in the cape that he wore in the Dracula movie.

526
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,840
 Let's see.

527
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 Yeah.

528
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,360
 Yeah.

529
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,640
 It's just a nice little was the first time anyway.

530
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,040
 OK, time for the final facts of the show.

531
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,080
 James.

532
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,800
 OK, my fact is that the secret of youth

533
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,080
 is drinking youngsters blood.

534
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,160
 Great thing to be condoning on our podcast.

535
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,920
 We should also mention that Anna's two priests

536
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,360
 are some youngsters for James, but you're worried.

537
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
 Open brackets, if you're a mouse, close brackets.

538
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,560
 And they're also mice, so I should have said that.

539
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,000
 So these are some studies done quite recently

540
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
 where they've transplanted young mice blood into older mice.

541
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,360
 And they've reversed some of the signs of aging in these mice.

542
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,520
 What signs?

543
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
 They stop being racist and stuff.

544
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,760
 That's amazing.

545
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,720
 Yes, no, it is amazing.

546
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,800
 They're not quite sure why.

547
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,120
 They think this might be some compounds in there which help you.

548
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,440
 But it's like muscle mass.

549
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,680
 It's the brain tissue.

550
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,160
 It's all sorts of things.

551
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,200
 Wow.

552
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,160
 Probably what work in humans, just for a disclaimer.

553
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,400
 But worth a try.

554
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,240
 Because of the ethics committee or--

555
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,680
 Well, I mean, you couldn't really do it, could you?

556
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,280
 But I don't think there's any evidence that it works in humans.

557
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,760
 Very good.

558
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,640
 I'll do it.

559
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,920
 Yeah, you're younger than me.

560
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,440
 Yep.

561
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,880
 Oh, no, don't.

562
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,560
 Remember, there was the theory that the queen mother

563
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,720
 was constantly having--

564
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,120
 No, I've not heard that theory.

565
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,520
 Get out.

566
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,360
 Of course you've heard that.

567
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,120
 No, I really haven't.

568
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,080
 And remember, we move in different circles too.

569
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,840
 No, there was the big--

570
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,560
 Dan moves in different crop circles to us.

571
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,200
 It was the big thing that the queen--

572
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,960
 the queen mother, the reason she was able to stay old

573
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,640
 and alive, alive being the main one,

574
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,400
 was that she used to have blood of the young.

575
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
 I don't know.

576
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,320
 I genuinely never heard that.

577
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,120
 I don't know.

578
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,600
 I don't think any normal people have.

579
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,560
 Well, the queen mother, there is a headline from the telegraph.

580
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,560
 Queen mother is given eight hour blood transfusion,

581
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,760
 which is when she was 101.

582
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,480
 But it was to help her recover from anemia, which she had.

583
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,840
 She wasn't personally biting into the necks of youngsters.

584
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,480
 Yeah, it was a medical procedure.

585
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,640
 You're looking on the wrong site mate,

586
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,280
 because DavidIke.com literally says--

587
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,600
 People did used to try blood transfusions.

588
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,960
 Doctors didn't know before.

589
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
 It was in any way a safer sense of what

590
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,600
 they were doing for weird stuff.

591
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,280
 I think Louis the 14th personal physician.

592
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,160
 Jean-Baptiste Dene used to do blood transfusions

593
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,560
 to various people for various things.

594
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,680
 Infuse the same guy with coughs blood twice,

595
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,720
 because he was suffering from a mental illness.

596
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
 And he had various symptoms after this,

597
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,880
 like vomiting, passing, black urine, et cetera.

598
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,960
 But for some reason, he agreed to a third attempt,

599
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,240
 at which point he died from the blood transfusion,

600
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,480
 because obviously it was incredibly unsafe in those days.

601
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
 And he didn't know about blood types and stuff.

602
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,600
 No, no.

603
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,720
 But it turned out-- so then he was accused of killing the guy.

604
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,800
 And then they've tested his blood since the guy who died.

605
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,720
 And it's turned out that he was poisoned by arsenic,

606
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
 probably murdered by his wife, who obviously

607
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,800
 saw an opportunity.

608
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,600
 Oh, yeah.

609
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,880
 Before we get this blamed on that doctor, man.

610
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,320
 The first documented case of any kind of transfusion

612
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,520
 was by Pope Innocent the 8th.

613
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,960
 He was a 15th century pope.

614
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,480
 He was supposedly given the board of three 10-year-old boys.

615
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,920
 But he took it by mouth.

616
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,720
 He didn't transfuse it into his blood.

617
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,560
 Wrang the blood.

618
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,040
 Yeah.

619
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,160
 And also, it's not that maybe it's not true.

620
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,800
 And it's just like empty papal hysteria.

621
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
 But that's the first written evidence

622
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,280
 we have of anyone taking someone else's blood.

623
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,960
 Pope's name, Pope Innocent, making a suggestion.

624
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,280
 That's not an anti-papal name, is it?

625
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,240
 Pope guilty, they call them Pope guilty.

626
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,440
 In really witty circles.

627
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,000
 I do mix in those witty circles.

628
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,440
 James is a joke writer for the Protestant society.

629
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,320
 I've read a bit more about this mouse experiment.

630
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,160
 So the young mice that they did the experiment

631
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,120
 with were three months old.

632
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,320
 The elderly mice were 18 months old.

633
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,240
 I don't think that's quite a sweet.

634
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,920
 Completely to crap it.

635
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,480
 But they did it partly by stitching together

636
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,160
 their circulatory systems, which is an extraordinary idea.

637
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,440
 And then after the experiment, the mice who had been treated,

638
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,800
 the elderly mice who had been treated,

639
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,200
 remembered how to find a hidden resting platform

640
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,440
 in a water maze better than the control group.

641
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,400
 And this is the maze they'll use for mice these days.

642
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 I don't know if you know this.

643
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,520
 It's not like the Hampton Court maze anymore.

644
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,320
 It's basically a lot smaller these days.

645
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,480
 It's just way too big.

646
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,160
 No, but the standard mouse test these days

647
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,840
 is either a T-shape or a Y-shape,

648
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,280
 or it's a tub of milky water with a platform hidden

649
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,680
 somewhere under the surface.

650
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,880
 And they put the mouse in it, and it has to swim desperately

651
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,760
 around until it can find the platform.

652
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
 That's easy.

653
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,520
 Well, it remembers it.

654
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,400
 It sounds easy to you.

655
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,080
 Much easier than Hampton Court.

656
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
 It's much easier than Hampton Court.

657
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
 It's smaller.

658
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
 Yeah.

659
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,840
 Anyway, animals that drink blood, a tick can drink 600 times

660
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,600
 its own body weight in blood in one sitting.

661
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,440
 Oh, really?

662
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,200
 And so it's back blows up to, it looked like a balloon.

663
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,280
 It's great.

664
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,320
 Oh, yeah.

665
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,360
 There's also a bird that drinks blood.

666
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,000
 Vampire finches have evolved in the Galapagos Islands

667
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,960
 because it's quite tough climate out there for them to survive.

668
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,400
 And they've worked out that they can

669
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
 pick the backs of other birds, of booby birds,

670
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,920
 apparently, and they can get this a blood out of their eyes.

671
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,440
 But the interesting thing is, is that they don't mind.

672
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
 Yeah, they don't.

673
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,040
 The booby birds just sit there, and they're kind of just

674
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,400
 mine.

675
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,680
 They think that either they don't react

676
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,760
 because there are a lot of the finches,

677
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
 so they might be swarmed by the finches.

678
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,720
 So they've worked out that they're going to be killed by the marfict.

679
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,240
 Oh, yeah, they're sitting there hating it.

680
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,640
 And they're just saying to each other, just leave it.

681
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
 Just leave it.

682
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
 It's not worth it, Gary.

683
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
 It's not worth it.

684
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,400
 So this is cool.

685
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,240
 So while we're on vampire animals, vampire bats, obviously.

686
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,760
 Well, there's the common vampire bat.

687
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,680
 Then there's the hairy-legged vampire bat

688
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,320
 and the white-winged vampire bat.

689
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,000
 And the white-winged one, they feed on birds and mammals.

690
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,600
 The trick for getting chickens is, they will approach a hen,

691
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,240
 and they'll mimic a chick by nuzzling up to her brood patch,

692
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,840
 which is a bit of a skin on her underside,

693
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,240
 which she uses to transfer heat to the eggs, as she nests.

694
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,600
 And the hen sometimes thinks it's her baby cuddling up to her.

695
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,240
 And so she'll just sit on the bat, which then has all you can eat,

696
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,040
 boofay, because it's managed to trick the hen into thinking

697
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,120
 that it's a--

698
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,280
 Oh, gosh, yeah, maybe.

699
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,720
 It's a little freaky.

700
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,520
 That is.

701
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,880
 Bedbugs also drink blood, and young bedbugs are transparent.

702
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,760
 So the first meal they have turns them red.

703
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,200
 Oh, it's quite cool, isn't it?

704
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,920
 I really love that image.

705
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,800
 Headlouse mouth parts are transparent, as well.

706
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,720
 So you can see a little vein of blood going from a scalp

707
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,760
 into the headlouse.

708
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
 Oh, that's cool.

709
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,560
 Yeah, well, I remember in Australia, headlice,

710
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,440
 you'd always get headlice, because you were always

711
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
 in the bush and stuff.

712
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,400
 The school I went to, at least, we're constantly

713
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,240
 having to face that.

714
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
 Yeah, we always had headlice in school.

715
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,480
 That's because of schools and kids, not the bush.

716
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,360
 But yeah, they are quite see-through.

717
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,880
 You can see, yeah, you can see, I remember one falling

718
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,560
 out of my head once, and being like, wow, that's a donation.

719
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,320
 They just walk as well.

720
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,000
 They don't jump.

721
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,640
 There's normally children playing.

722
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,720
 And it has to be one head touching another.

723
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,040
 So if you have a group photo, obviously,

724
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,920
 it's spread like wildfire.

725
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,000
 But it's--

726
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,920
 Also, the idea that they prefer clean hair to dirty hair

727
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,560
 is just they just like hair.

728
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,080
 How do they?

729
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
 Yeah, they're just like a place where

730
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,400
 they can grab on some hair and drink some blood.

731
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,760
 They don't care if it's dirty or--

732
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,240
 Right.

733
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,440
 It sounds like a room that was propagated by nine-year-olds.

734
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,080
 Recalcitrant nine-year-olds.

735
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,840
 What's weird, though, is that they just stay exclusively here.

736
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
 They stay in your head hair.

737
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,840
 Whereas pubic louse travel all over the body.

738
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,280
 You can get them in your eyebrows.

739
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
 You can get them in your eyelashes,

740
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,520
 but you don't get them in your hair.

741
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,800
 And they're two separate species,

742
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,040
 and they don't actually cross over--

743
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,840
 Yeah.

744
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,360
 --very odd.

745
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
 I've been reading a book.

746
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,520
 It's a book about parasites.

747
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,640
 And it says, if you have pubic lice in your eyelashes,

748
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,400
 you've probably done something to deserve that.

749
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,840
 It's probably been in the bush.

750
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 [LAUGHTER]

751
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,600
 OK, that's it.
