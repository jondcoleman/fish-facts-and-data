00:00:00,00:00:02,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It is not such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:10,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:10,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:22,00:00:27,from the QI offices in Covered Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James
00:00:27,00:00:32,"Harkin, Andy, Marie and Anna Chazinski. And once again, we have gathered around the microphone"
00:00:32,00:00:38,with our four favorite Spooky facts from the last seven days.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"For this, our Halloween special and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:54,"Okay, fact number one, Andy. My fact is that until the year 635 AD, Halloween was on the 12th of May."
00:00:56,00:00:58,Why was it on the 12th of May and why did we change it?
00:00:58,00:01:03,"Well, it's only really on the 12th of May because it's Halloween is the day before All Saints Day."
00:01:03,00:01:06,"Yeah, I was under the impression that that was the first of November."
00:01:06,00:01:10,"Yes, well, basically Halloween is part of the All-Hallowed Tide Festival."
00:01:10,00:01:14,"It's three days, which is All-Hallowed Zeeve, which we've got Halloween, All-Hallowed Day or All Saints Day"
00:01:14,00:01:19,"and All-Souls Day. It was introduced in 609 AD, but it was on the 13th of May and everyone"
00:01:19,00:01:25,"would travel to Rome and do pilgrimages there. But in 835, Gregory IV, who was then the Pope,"
00:01:25,00:01:28,said that it should become the first of November and we're not really sure why.
00:01:28,00:01:34,There is a theory that it was because it was sort of a way of adopting other religions
00:01:34,00:01:37,or other traditional rights and folding them into the church.
00:01:37,00:01:41,Because there already was a kind of a middle of autumn.
00:01:41,00:01:45,"Yeah, that's called 'Sawin' and it was the festival of the beginning of winter"
00:01:45,00:01:48,and there was a lot of death around in the air and that's what people saw.
00:01:48,00:01:52,"Also, autumn is just a spookier time. Spring isn't a spookier time,"
00:01:52,00:01:55,that's when life starts to happen and the sun's coming out.
00:01:55,00:01:57,Except that. Autumn is spookier.
00:01:57,00:02:00,"Well, when people used to visit Rome, there is a theory that it was moved to autumn"
00:02:00,00:02:03,"because when so many people visited Rome, everyone got malaria,"
00:02:03,00:02:07,which is itself quite a spooky zombie-like thing to happen to.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"Yeah, chords of pilgrim so."
00:02:09,00:02:14,But it used to be because obviously we've transformed it into a time of the undead
00:02:14,00:02:16,and all that stuff.
00:02:16,00:02:16,"Like, wasn't really about that."
00:02:16,00:02:18,Was it as spookier back then?
00:02:18,00:02:21,"Yeah, so that might be why it might have been nice in May."
00:02:21,00:02:25,"Yeah, there are amazing Halloween traditions which sort of evolved from"
00:02:25,00:02:26,the whole 'Remember the Dead' thing.
00:02:26,00:02:28,"So, trickle-treating came from solving."
00:02:28,00:02:31,"It was originally not just children, it was poor people and children."
00:02:31,00:02:35,"You would go door to door praying for people, dead people in exchange for cake."
00:02:35,00:02:38,I've heard some other ideas about where trickle-treat came from.
00:02:38,00:02:40,"Yeah, me too. That's a bit."
00:02:40,00:02:46,"So here's one. For instance, they had mischief night in Leeds and Bradford in Yorkshire"
00:02:46,00:02:50,and the children would go around causing trouble and the authorities would just let them off
00:02:50,00:02:53,"and they say, ""It's nub-but-but-mischief-nate."""
00:02:53,00:02:54,"Oh, okay."
00:02:54,00:02:58,There was also a thing called 'Hop Tuna' in the Isle of Man.
00:02:58,00:03:03,"And that had people wandering around armed with bits of turnip,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,singing in 'manks' and demanding 'cash'.
00:03:05,00:03:11,And the idea is that these guys from like Yorkshire or Isle of Man or
00:03:11,00:03:15,"Island or Scotland had all gone over to America during the, you know,"
00:03:15,00:03:16,whenever that was.
00:03:16,00:03:19,And they brought it there and then it's come back over here.
00:03:19,00:03:21,"Yeah, that's one theory behind trickle-treat."
00:03:21,00:03:25,"Well, I thought it was a, I think it was originally a German tradition,"
00:03:25,00:03:31,but it was popular in Pennsylvania and Dutch communities in America up until the early 20th century.
00:03:31,00:03:33,"They're first-hand accounts of it and it's called 'Belsnickling',"
00:03:33,00:03:35,which I think it should be because it's just a good name.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"But it was a Christmas tradition and it happened on Christmas Eve,"
00:03:38,00:03:39,but it's so similar.
00:03:39,00:03:44,"So basically the teenagers of the community were dressed up as various different characters,"
00:03:44,00:03:48,fictional characters and they go around kids' houses and they'd scare the kids
00:03:48,00:03:51,"and the kids would have to guess what they were dressed up as and if they guess right,"
00:03:51,00:03:52,they got a suite.
00:03:52,00:03:55,So basically there's lots of different theories to trickle-treats.
00:03:55,00:03:57,It's probably just something that builds up all over the world.
00:03:57,00:03:58,Yeah.
00:03:58,00:03:59,"It's an obvious thing, isn't it?"
00:03:59,00:04:01,"One night a year, you go a bit crazy."
00:04:01,00:04:04,"Yeah, like the, like the purge, that movie."
00:04:04,00:04:05,And do you like the movie the purge?
00:04:05,00:04:10,"So 'Borbing for Apples' is Halloween tradition now, obviously."
00:04:10,00:04:12,It seems like it should be more of a Valentine's Day tradition.
00:04:12,00:04:16,So it was a way of people selecting a future husband.
00:04:16,00:04:19,So each apple would be dropped in water and assigned a man's name.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And then a bunch of women would rock up,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,plunge their faces into the water and the apple that they bit.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"If they bit the apple the first time, then they'd marry the man and live happily ever after."
00:04:27,00:04:32,"If they bit the apples successfully the second time, then he would court her,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,but their love would fade.
00:04:33,00:04:36,"And if they but the apple the third time, the relationship was doomed."
00:04:36,00:04:38,"Oh, but it used to be that."
00:04:38,00:04:41,Is it called 'Borbing for Apples' because the name of the man you might marry would be Bob?
00:04:41,00:04:43,"It was always Bob, yeah."
00:04:43,00:04:44,Only people could Bob get it.
00:04:44,00:04:49,"It sounds like swinging, you know, when you throw your car keys into a hat,"
00:04:49,00:04:50,but with more commitment.
00:04:50,00:04:52,"Yeah, yeah, it doesn't feel like that."
00:04:52,00:04:57,It's weird because Halloween has turned in these days into a scaremongering time
00:04:57,00:05:00,where everyone thinks 'Borbing for Apples' were filled with razor blades.
00:05:00,00:05:02,And...
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:03,00:05:04,"And big scare, wasn't it?"
00:05:04,00:05:05,"It was a big scare, yeah, yeah."
00:05:05,00:05:09,"And just general, you know, like, you've got to watch out now and it's not safe to be on the streets."
00:05:09,00:05:12,"That portends badly for the relationship, doesn't it?"
00:05:12,00:05:15,"If the apple you've bobbed into, the man's name is full of razor blades."
00:05:15,00:05:17,It appears your mouth.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"But I've got it first time, so I'm sure the marriage will be successful."
00:05:20,00:05:24,Have you guys heard of a singer called Keisha?
00:05:24,00:05:25,Yes.
00:05:25,00:05:27,Spelt with a dollar sign in her name.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"Okay, cool, because I read something about her,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,but I just wanted to check people have heard of her.
00:05:30,00:05:30,I hadn't.
00:05:30,00:05:32,She has a song called 'Supernatural'.
00:05:32,00:05:33,Do you know what that's about?
00:05:33,00:05:35,I'm ghosts.
00:05:35,00:05:36,It's about her having sex with a ghost.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"Her experience having sex with ghosts,"
00:05:38,00:05:41,which she does on a semi-regular basis apparently.
00:05:41,00:05:47,She wants to go to a hypnotherapist who told her that she had dead people living in her body
00:05:47,00:05:49,and specifically in her 'Nether Regions'.
00:05:49,00:05:52,And so she had to have her vagina exercised.
00:05:52,00:05:54,And the song 'Supernatural'.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Sorry, that's actual exorcised."
00:05:56,00:05:56,"Exorcised, yeah."
00:05:56,00:05:57,Not real.
00:05:57,00:05:59,So Keisha's new DVD.
00:05:59,00:06:02,"Oh, and the footsteps have been in McCall."
00:06:02,00:06:05,There's a word for the ghost that has sex with people.
00:06:05,00:06:06,I can't remember what it is.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Succubus.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Succubus, yeah."
00:06:08,00:06:09,Or an incubus.
00:06:09,00:06:10,Yeah.
00:06:10,00:06:12,Are they the female male versions?
00:06:12,00:06:12,Yeah.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yeah.
00:06:13,00:06:15,That happens in ghost busters.
00:06:15,00:06:15,"Yes, that's it."
00:06:15,00:06:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:06:16,00:06:19,"I saw a bus yesterday which had ghost bus tours written on it,"
00:06:19,00:06:22,"which I think is an amazingly good way of doing it,"
00:06:22,00:06:23,because they do ghost bus tours.
00:06:23,00:06:25,It's better than calling it 'succubus'.
00:06:25,00:06:34,"Just quickly on the night terrors and being assaulted by ghosts in your sleep,"
00:06:34,00:06:39,there's a folklorist David Huffer to estimate that 15% of people will experience that.
00:06:39,00:06:40,At some point in their lives.
00:06:40,00:06:44,"So don't genuinely, don't feel bad if you've had it."
00:06:44,00:06:49,There's one thing where you're kind of just kind of on the verge of waking up or on the
00:06:49,00:06:50,verge of going to sleep.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"And your consciousness comes back, but your body's still asleep and so you can't really"
00:06:54,00:06:58,sit up and you kind of get a bit of a terror that you can't sit up.
00:06:58,00:06:59,I think that's quite a common thing.
00:06:59,00:06:59,"Yeah, it is."
00:06:59,00:07:02,And people believe that it's like people believe it's dead.
00:07:02,00:07:06,So that they're being held down by ghosts because the consciousness has come back
00:07:06,00:07:07,before the body is woken up properly.
00:07:07,00:07:08,"That's right, wow."
00:07:08,00:07:11,"I had that uni, it's absolutely terrifying, yeah."
00:07:11,00:07:14,So do you know what the number one Halloween costume is?
00:07:14,00:07:15,What is the most popular?
00:07:15,00:07:16,A witch still.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"Yeah, what I thought was going to be something really surprising, like it's actually"
00:07:19,00:07:20,pretty terrible.
00:07:20,00:07:23,"It's not surprising, yeah, but I thought it would be like, I don't know, a super hero costume"
00:07:23,00:07:24,like Spider-Man.
00:07:24,00:07:28,"Well, I find where there's a list online of the most popular ones, isn't there in America this is?"
00:07:28,00:07:32,"And there are seven million children dresses witches in America this year, they think."
00:07:32,00:07:37,"And there's going to be 5.8 million princesses, which is a second most, but how's that scary?"
00:07:37,00:07:42,"Yeah, so what there's a theory that the costumes comes from this tradition, which was in the"
00:07:42,00:07:47,"Middle Ages, where churches would display their relics for all Hallows Eve and all Hallows Day."
00:07:47,00:07:51,"But if they didn't have any, they would let the parishioners dress up as the saints instead."
00:07:51,00:07:52,"Oh, how cool is that?"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"Which saint would you dress up as, Andy?"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"I don't know, Saint Jerome."
00:07:57,00:07:59,"Oh yeah, what did he look like to know?"
00:07:59,00:08:05,"If I dress up as Saint Martin of Tor, would I be allowed to do what he did, which was he went"
00:08:05,00:08:09,around exercising people in one of the ways he did that was to push his hand down their
00:08:09,00:08:11,throat and push the spirit out of their anus.
00:08:11,00:08:14,"He's going the wrong way about it if he's trying to exercise Keisha, isn't he?"
00:08:14,00:08:23,"Apparently there's a quote, which is something like the spirit left a muddy, filthy trail behind"
00:08:23,00:08:24,it as it left.
00:08:24,00:08:32,"Okay, time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:08:32,00:08:38,My fact this week is that witches used broomsticks to put hallucinogenic drugs up their
00:08:38,00:08:39,bums. What?
00:08:39,00:08:46,Turns out that a lot of historians suggest that the imagery itself is actually representative
00:08:46,00:08:49,"of what they were going through, which is that they used to do hallucinogenic drugs."
00:08:49,00:08:53,And the tripping and the flying that they used to do was actually flight to the mind.
00:08:53,00:08:54,It was stuff going on inside their head.
00:08:54,00:08:58,"And it was all just one big drug trip, which is insane."
00:08:58,00:09:03,"A drug called datura, a European drug that you could get, which was a hallucinogenic,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,and they just used to go through their mental landscape.
00:09:06,00:09:11,And the flying bit of it is just representative of what they were going through in their heads.
00:09:11,00:09:14,I suppose that's more logical than the match we're flying.
00:09:14,00:09:14,Yeah.
00:09:14,00:09:15,What about the broom?
00:09:15,00:09:16,"Well, okay."
00:09:16,00:09:26,"The broom was a way of applying the datura drug, which it was an application device for the bum."
00:09:26,00:09:27,"Oh, wow."
00:09:27,00:09:28,A suppository.
00:09:28,00:09:29,A suppository.
00:09:29,00:09:33,So all the imagery that you see is not them flying on a broom.
00:09:33,00:09:37,It is using the broom as a suppository for the drug.
00:09:37,00:09:41,A guy called Jordan De Bergamo in the 15th century who was one of the guys who were
00:09:41,00:09:42,made up.
00:09:42,00:09:48,"He raised about it, said they anointed the staff and then anointed themselves under the arms"
00:09:48,00:09:52,"or in other hairy places, which is another way one could refer to."
00:09:52,00:09:53,"The head, yeah."
00:09:53,00:09:54,Exactly what do you meant?
00:09:54,00:09:56,"Um, yeah, so I just like that."
00:09:56,00:09:59,I like that because everyone dresses up as a witch and they have an impression of why they're
00:09:59,00:10:02,dressing up as it and it turns out there's a whole different connotation to what they're.
00:10:02,00:10:06,So do we think this is definitely true about the broomstick or because there must be some other
00:10:06,00:10:07,theories about why they're dressed?
00:10:07,00:10:12,"Yeah, I so I found this out via a ethnobiologist called Wade Davis."
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:13,00:10:16,He's a guy who's who's made extraordinary adventures.
00:10:16,00:10:19,He's written great books and this was just a passage inside this book.
00:10:19,00:10:22,The book is actually about zombies on a trip that he did to Haiti.
00:10:22,00:10:27,He went to five separate villages and in those villages they all used the same combinations
00:10:27,00:10:32,of thing to create this thing where people were sighted as being supposedly being zombies.
00:10:32,00:10:37,So his idea is that he did discover what makes zombies in Haiti and it's this potion.
00:10:37,00:10:43,I like the idea on potions that um so I was reading about six in 16th century Spain this
00:10:43,00:10:44,physician.
00:10:44,00:10:50,He raided a house basically which was occupied by what they thought was witches and he confiscated
00:10:50,00:10:56,"from it a pot full of a certain green ointment composed of herbs such as hemlock and nightshade,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,henbane and mandrake from home of a couple of keys of witchcraft.
00:10:59,00:11:02,And I just like the idea that that's the 16th century drugs raid.
00:11:02,00:11:07,Is he said well I've got some mandrake as I'm a hemlock under the bed.
00:11:07,00:11:12,The first woman in Germany to run a post office was burned as a witch.
00:11:12,00:11:13,"Oh, was she?"
00:11:13,00:11:15,Was it for running a post office?
00:11:15,00:11:17,"No, it was for raising the price of them."
00:11:17,00:11:25,"No, she was called Katarina Henot or Henot and no, she was she was just a big member of the community"
00:11:25,00:11:30,and then she got accused of being a witch as they often did and then she was burned unfortunately.
00:11:30,00:11:34,You have an extraordinary number of witches or alleged witches who were killed in Europe in the
00:11:34,00:11:35,15th to 18th century.
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Is it 50,000?"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Yeah, some wow."
00:11:37,00:11:38,Some wow.
00:11:38,00:11:43,But like the Salem witch trials that basically came as just someone accusing someone else and then
00:11:43,00:11:45,it went bigger and bigger and bigger.
00:11:45,00:11:51,But it ended when the wife of the mayor or something like that got accused of being a witch and then
00:11:51,00:11:52,suddenly the mayor went oh this is all rubbish.
00:11:52,00:11:57,You guys stop it but until then the authorities are kind of agreed to it all.
00:11:57,00:12:01,"And then as soon as like one of the wives of the main guys in the town was accused,"
00:12:01,00:12:04,"then suddenly they were like nope, no, yep, definitely not true."
00:12:04,00:12:05,Bloody politicians.
00:12:05,00:12:05,I know.
00:12:05,00:12:10,"They still in Papua New Guinea there's still a tradition of kind of hunting down,"
00:12:10,00:12:14,which isn't accusing people of witchcraft and that's mainly focused on men at the moment
00:12:14,00:12:15,apparently or quite so.
00:12:15,00:12:16,That's quite a heavy focus on men.
00:12:16,00:12:17,Yeah.
00:12:17,00:12:20,"And also when I was reading about this I learned the difference between witchcraft and sorcery,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,which does make total sense.
00:12:22,00:12:23,But what would you guess it was?
00:12:23,00:12:24,Men and women.
00:12:24,00:12:28,"No, it's witchcraft is something that you are born with that you have a gift inside you and sorcery"
00:12:28,00:12:29,you can learn.
00:12:29,00:12:32,So we could all be sorcerers but only I am a witch.
00:12:32,00:12:39,One way of finding out if someone was a witch in Africa was administering poison to a chicken.
00:12:39,00:12:41,They're mentioning the name of a suspected witch.
00:12:41,00:12:44,If the chicken dies then the suspects is a witch.
00:12:44,00:12:48,Which it might be because the suspects is a witch or it might be because you've just poisoned it.
00:12:48,00:12:49,Wow.
00:12:49,00:12:51,That's a stacked legal system you've got there.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"It's said, yeah."
00:12:52,00:12:56,In the 19th century there was a chicken that kept on laying eggs saying that Christ was coming
00:12:56,00:13:00,in the end of the world was nigh and everyone got really panicked by this for a while.
00:13:00,00:13:04,It was written on the eggs and eventually a guy went to investigate it and it turned out
00:13:04,00:13:07,that it was being written on the eggs and then they were being shoved back up inside.
00:13:07,00:13:09,"Oh my god, reverse accesses them."
00:13:09,00:13:11,It was to leave them again.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Insus isn't.
00:13:12,00:13:15,Have you heard of witch bottles?
00:13:15,00:13:16,You would bury them.
00:13:16,00:13:18,This was in the 16th and 17th centuries.
00:13:18,00:13:25,You would bury them to ward off witches basically and you would fill up an ordinary bottle
00:13:25,00:13:32,with hair and urine and pins and that was the person you wanted to protect.
00:13:32,00:13:35,You would put their urine in and it would throw any spell they cast back on you
00:13:35,00:13:37,and they keep finding these things buried all over the place.
00:13:37,00:13:41,That's weird isn't it because that's almost like a spell in its stealth isn't it?
00:13:41,00:13:45,"Yeah, because you're almost doing your own little bit of witchcraft to get rid of the witch"
00:13:45,00:13:47,which kind of makes you a witch as well.
00:13:47,00:13:49,"I don't know, it's a never-ending cycle."
00:13:49,00:13:50,Eventually we'll all be witches.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"Yeah, the pins are quite important to witches."
00:13:53,00:13:55,They use them a lot in their spells.
00:13:55,00:14:01,"The Pendle Witches who are from my neck of the woods, they were found to be witches"
00:14:01,00:14:06,because one of them went to town to try and procure some pins because they needed them for the
00:14:06,00:14:09,spells. Asked this guy for some pins.
00:14:09,00:14:15,"He said no, he walked away, she swore at him or something, he then had a stroke or a heart attack"
00:14:15,00:14:20,and they thought that she'd caused it and then that's why they all got caught and then
00:14:20,00:14:22,hanged for being a witch.
00:14:22,00:14:22,Really?
00:14:22,00:14:23,Yeah.
00:14:23,00:14:28,Brums traditionally use the marriage ceremonies in a lot of cultures because one end represents
00:14:28,00:14:34,the phallic kind of male end and one end is the bristly female end but also the youngest
00:14:34,00:14:38,person to get a patent on something is a little boy who's got a patent on a double-headed
00:14:38,00:14:42,brimstick and it's Sam Hoffton of Bucsley and Darbyshire.
00:14:42,00:14:48,He was three years old when he came up with it and by chance his father was a patent lawyer.
00:14:48,00:14:55,"Okay, so in fact number three and that is Chazinski."
00:14:55,00:15:00,"Yeah, my fact is that the woman who played the voice of Reagan in the exorcist only agreed"
00:15:00,00:15:05,to play the part on the grounds that she have two priests in her sound booth at all times
00:15:05,00:15:09,"could be constantly drinking whiskey, chain-smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs."
00:15:09,00:15:12,Who is it only very similar to Anna's rider?
00:15:12,00:15:15,"Oh my gosh, thing is official putting buttons."
00:15:15,00:15:17,We just haven't mentioned Grigori and Samuel.
00:15:17,00:15:19,He didn't buy his priests.
00:15:19,00:15:25,Obviously she had a majorly raspy angry voice in there but why the priests?
00:15:25,00:15:29,"Well, because so she decided that yeah, as you say, she wanted to do the whiskey and the"
00:15:29,00:15:32,cigarettes and the raw eggs because she thought that would give her the right voice but she was an
00:15:32,00:15:39,alcoholic and she was dry. So she also addicted to raw eggs and priests.
00:15:39,00:15:46,So she thought the priest had monitored her because to make sure that she wasn't falling
00:15:46,00:15:47,off the wagon in the process of drinking the whiskey.
00:15:47,00:15:51,"Oh, they weren't there to kind of exercise any demons as well."
00:15:51,00:15:54,"Well, I thought presumably it was because of spiritual."
00:15:54,00:15:57,"So I've read both but either the director or the producer, I can't remember who did"
00:15:57,00:16:01,it. It's had an interview where he said that it was because she was an alcoholic but then I have
00:16:01,00:16:04,also read that it might be because she wanted to make sure no evil spirits got into while
00:16:04,00:16:05,she was playing the part.
00:16:05,00:16:09,"But yeah, Warner Brothers, we were talking about last week, failed to credit her for voicing"
00:16:09,00:16:10,her in the exercise.
00:16:10,00:16:13,"Well, it sounded like from what I read, she didn't want to be credited initially because"
00:16:13,00:16:16,she just saw I'm just doing a voicing and it was such a popular movie.
00:16:16,00:16:22,"In fact, I think still to this day it was the highest-grossing film of the time that that"
00:16:22,00:16:23,Warner Brothers had.
00:16:23,00:16:24,I think adjusted for inflation.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"Yeah, adjusted for inflation that was the highest-grossing film that they had."
00:16:27,00:16:31,So I think as soon as that happened she suddenly wanted to be credited.
00:16:31,00:16:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:32,00:16:36,You know the scene where the girl's neck spins round and that's back into place.
00:16:36,00:16:36,Yeah.
00:16:36,00:16:39,You know that sort of sound of her neck and the creaking around.
00:16:39,00:16:41,It was actually made by the director's wallet.
00:16:41,00:16:44,Leather wallet.
00:16:44,00:16:47,And he just sort of twisted it around near the microphone and that made this...
00:16:47,00:16:54,I just grew up the idea that he's such a cheap skate that whenever he opens his wallet it makes his creaking sound.
00:16:54,00:16:58,"And the shot of the cobwebs closed, that was inside there."
00:16:58,00:17:03,"He used to, the director used to, in order to achieve the requisite levels of fear on the"
00:17:03,00:17:07,faces of the actors used to fire guns during filming at certain points.
00:17:07,00:17:09,I just find it blank.
00:17:09,00:17:11,I could never tell if this stuff is true.
00:17:11,00:17:12,What do you read this about movies?
00:17:12,00:17:13,He was interviewed.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"Yeah, I know, but he said he did it."
00:17:15,00:17:18,"Okay, in Scream, Drew Barrymore is the opening scene in Scream."
00:17:18,00:17:23,If you remember the movie where she's chased and she becomes the first victim of the villain.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"Apparently, in order to keep her scared on set,"
00:17:27,00:17:32,Wes Craven would go around telling her stories of animals being harmed because she loved her.
00:17:32,00:17:36,"And that would put the fear into her and bring, it's like no, she's an actor."
00:17:36,00:17:38,She knows how to act scared.
00:17:38,00:17:40,It's kind of insulting to the actors a little bit.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"It's like, oh, you can't do a scared face."
00:17:42,00:17:43,I'm going to have to pretend to shoot you.
00:17:43,00:17:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:44,00:17:47,"So in Alien, the famous spoiler alert,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,chest bursting scene.
00:17:49,00:17:50,The actors weren't told about it beforehand.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"And I think I've read a bit more, I think they were told, but not in detail."
00:17:54,00:17:57,They weren't told exactly how horrible it was going to be.
00:17:57,00:17:58,And they did use four cameras for the take.
00:17:58,00:18:02,So they got to see the real sort of horror on the face of the actors reacting.
00:18:02,00:18:05,"Well, there's another one at the Alien movie,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,which is that they needed a shot of a cat looking scared.
00:18:08,00:18:12,"Apparently, it wasn't scary enough for someone in an alien costume to be there."
00:18:12,00:18:16,So what they had was they had a screen down with the cat sitting there as the camera's filming it.
00:18:16,00:18:18,Lifted the screen and there was a dog sitting there.
00:18:18,00:18:20,And they didn't tell the cat that it was going to be a dog.
00:18:20,00:18:23,That's kind of insulting to the cat saying that he can't act properly.
00:18:23,00:18:24,"Yeah, it's true."
00:18:24,00:18:28,The exorcist wouldn't have been written if he weren't for Groucho Marx.
00:18:28,00:18:28,Really?
00:18:28,00:18:29,Who wrote it?
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yeah, in a little in fact."
00:18:31,00:18:34,"Actually, the guy who did write it only ever written comedy before."
00:18:34,00:18:37,And then wrote the artist.
00:18:37,00:18:40,But he's so he's called William Blassie.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"And he went on this show called You Bet Your Life,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,which was hosted by Groucho Marx.
00:18:44,00:18:47,"And he won $10,000, which allowed him to take some time off."
00:18:47,00:18:48,More grueling work on right now.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"Oh, that's cool."
00:18:50,00:18:51,That's great.
00:18:51,00:18:51,Yeah.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"Harper Lee, who wrote to Kill a Mockingbird,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,worked on an airline booking desk.
00:18:57,00:19:01,Maybe she was sort of managing an airline booking outfit.
00:19:01,00:19:03,And then she was given a sabbatical by her employers.
00:19:03,00:19:05,And that's when she wrote to Kill a Mockingbird.
00:19:05,00:19:09,Wasn't Kafka just a clerk and then he just used to go home and write and stuff like that?
00:19:09,00:19:13,I always love that idea of these great writers actually doing other normal jobs.
00:19:13,00:19:14,You're writing an expert time.
00:19:14,00:19:17,"There's a thing in the latest fact book we've just done,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,"which is that there are 500 references to Geoffrey Chaucer in his lifetime,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,which is a huge number for someone living in that time.
00:19:22,00:19:23,Yeah.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Not one of them says that he's a writer.
00:19:24,00:19:25,It's always other stuff.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"He was a spy, wasn't he, or something?"
00:19:27,00:19:28,"What do you think, sir?"
00:19:28,00:19:29,"Oh, he's a good one, then."
00:19:29,00:19:31,I did not get.
00:19:31,00:19:32,You haven't read the spies tale.
00:19:32,00:19:39,"Jack Nicholson was a firefighter and in the shining,"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"when there's that really famous scene in the shining if you've seen it,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,where he has to hack down the door with an axe.
00:19:43,00:19:47,The prop skies originally made a prop door that was really easy to hack down
00:19:47,00:19:49,"and because even a firefighter, he hacked it down too easily."
00:19:49,00:19:52,So they had to get an actual door put in for him to hack down.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"Oh, because he was too--"
00:19:54,00:19:54,Because he was too good.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Supermanly and strong.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Wow.
00:19:56,00:19:56,And that's cool.
00:19:56,00:19:57,What a cool guy.
00:19:57,00:19:59,I have a thing about ET.
00:19:59,00:20:01,ET was originally conceived of as a horror movie.
00:20:01,00:20:02,What's it?
00:20:02,00:20:02,Yeah.
00:20:02,00:20:04,It was after Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
00:20:04,00:20:08,Spielberg wanted to do more alien stuff.
00:20:08,00:20:11,But he wanted to do something darker and more threatening than Close Encounters.
00:20:11,00:20:14,And so he commissioned a script and it featured aliens who could kill you
00:20:14,00:20:15,"just with one long, bony finger."
00:20:15,00:20:17,Remember ET's finger.
00:20:17,00:20:20,And they made a load of prototypes of the models of it.
00:20:20,00:20:22,And they basically look like evil ET's.
00:20:22,00:20:26,"You know how in Gremlins, the bad Marguerite look a bit like the good one."
00:20:26,00:20:28,That's basically--
00:20:28,00:20:32,And then did they realize that Drew Bimel was incapable of doing the requisite scared face?
00:20:32,00:20:33,So they had to change it.
00:20:33,00:20:38,So Steven Spielberg came in and said animals are being attacked every time.
00:20:38,00:20:38,Yeah.
00:20:38,00:20:40,Can I tell you one quick thing about exorcisms?
00:20:40,00:20:40,Please do.
00:20:40,00:20:41,I know we're going to move on shortly.
00:20:41,00:20:48,"But so this is the thing, the Catholic Church still has 5 or 600 exorcists, official ones."
00:20:48,00:20:51,"One of them, Gabrielle Amorth, is the kingpin of them."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"He's supposedly done 100,000, used to do 20 a day."
00:20:54,00:20:54,Wow.
00:20:54,00:20:56,20 a day.
00:20:56,00:20:56,"Yeah, but they--"
00:20:56,00:20:57,"That's a lot, isn't it?"
00:20:57,00:20:58,"Yeah, but you can rattle through them quite a lot."
00:20:58,00:20:59,They're easier than you think.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:01,No.
00:21:01,00:21:01,They are.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"Katie Brand, the comedian."
00:21:03,00:21:04,She used to do them.
00:21:04,00:21:04,Really?
00:21:04,00:21:05,Yeah.
00:21:05,00:21:07,"Yeah, Katie Brand used to be a part of a church."
00:21:07,00:21:11,And one of the things that she used to do was demon exercising.
00:21:11,00:21:13,She used to do the hand down the throat version.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Oh, is it?"
00:21:14,00:21:15,I think it was more--
00:21:15,00:21:16,Is it the book and the--
00:21:16,00:21:16,What do you have?
00:21:16,00:21:17,I think you just--
00:21:17,00:21:18,"The bell and the bell, book and candle."
00:21:18,00:21:20,"Yeah, I think also it's a lot of yelling."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Like the power of Christ compels you.
00:21:21,00:21:22,It's that sort of stuff.
00:21:22,00:21:24,And people are talking in tongues.
00:21:24,00:21:24,And yeah.
00:21:24,00:21:28,Saint Hilarion could exercise up to 400 people at the same time.
00:21:28,00:21:29,So I think you can do them ensemble.
00:21:29,00:21:32,"If you're very good, she also wants exercise to camel."
00:21:32,00:21:33,It's amazing.
00:21:33,00:21:35,So I just wanted to tell you one thing I found
00:21:35,00:21:38,from an article about these exorcism conferences the church has.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"During the conference, the reverences are Tricui."
00:21:41,00:21:43,An exorcist based in Switzerland recounted one experience
00:21:43,00:21:45,he had aboard a Swiss air flight.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"Two lesbians, he said, had sat behind him on the plane."
00:21:48,00:21:51,"Soon afterwards, he said he felt Satan's presence."
00:21:51,00:21:54,"As he silently sought to repel the evil spirit through prayer,"
00:21:54,00:21:57,"one of the women, he said, began growling demonically"
00:21:57,00:21:58,and threw chocolate at his head.
00:21:58,00:22:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:00,00:22:02,"I'll be called demon, though."
00:22:02,00:22:04,Asked how he knew the woman was possessed.
00:22:04,00:22:08,"He said, once you hear a satanic grow, you never forget it."
00:22:08,00:22:11,It's like smelling margarita pizza for the first time.
00:22:11,00:22:13,It's something you never forget.
00:22:13,00:22:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:14,00:22:16,Margarita pizza.
00:22:16,00:22:19,Do you know what the first ever horror film was?
00:22:19,00:22:21,"Oh, yeah, it was in 1892."
00:22:21,00:22:22,"No, it wasn't."
00:22:22,00:22:22,It was before that.
00:22:22,00:22:26,It was a George Melias movie.
00:22:26,00:22:27,"It was like two minutes long, wasn't it?"
00:22:27,00:22:28,"Yeah, it was about two minutes long."
00:22:28,00:22:31,And he followed it up with another movie.
00:22:31,00:22:34,So I think the first one was called The Haunted Castle.
00:22:34,00:22:36,Second one was three minutes long.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"And everyone said, no, they've gone overboard this time."
00:22:38,00:22:39,"Yeah, there's--"
00:22:39,00:22:41,I thought I can't take it.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"So the second movie, this was The Plot."
00:22:44,00:22:46,"A man tries to go to sleep, but is disturbed"
00:22:46,00:22:48,by a giant bug climbing up the bed onto his wall.
00:22:48,00:22:50,He attacks the bug with the broom and disposes of it
00:22:50,00:22:54,in a chamber pot in a compartment of his bedside table.
00:22:54,00:22:55,That was it.
00:22:55,00:22:57,That's the second horror movie ever made.
00:22:57,00:23:00,Third horror movie ever made was a remaking of the haunted hotel
00:23:00,00:23:03,by George Raleigh and by another group of people.
00:23:03,00:23:04,That's amazing.
00:23:04,00:23:04,Yeah.
00:23:04,00:23:08,"And Nosferatu, that was the first version of Dracula."
00:23:08,00:23:10,But the first movie to have the name Dracula on it
00:23:10,00:23:13,was in the-- I believe in the '20s.
00:23:13,00:23:14,They did this really interesting thing
00:23:14,00:23:18,"where they made Dracula in the daytime, the English version,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"and a Spanish film crew came in at night,"
00:23:21,00:23:24,used all the same sets and made a Spanish version of Dracula.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"So they made it in tandem, which seems like a really great idea."
00:23:27,00:23:29,"They were using the same sets, but they were using totally different."
00:23:29,00:23:31,"But also, it means that the whole of the British one"
00:23:31,00:23:34,"has to be set during the daytime, which is probably"
00:23:34,00:23:36,not when Dracula or me came out at night.
00:23:36,00:23:37,It doesn't get out much.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"So yeah, it's just a guy."
00:23:40,00:23:42,"He keeps intimating that he has a secret at night,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,but we never see him.
00:23:45,00:23:48,"The actor who played him, Bella Logosi."
00:23:48,00:23:52,But he was buried in the cape that he wore in the Dracula movie.
00:23:52,00:23:52,Let's see.
00:23:52,00:23:53,Yeah.
00:23:53,00:23:54,Yeah.
00:23:54,00:23:56,It's just a nice little was the first time anyway.
00:23:56,00:24:03,"OK, time for the final facts of the show."
00:24:03,00:24:04,James.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"OK, my fact is that the secret of youth"
00:24:07,00:24:11,is drinking youngsters blood.
00:24:11,00:24:13,Great thing to be condoning on our podcast.
00:24:13,00:24:15,We should also mention that Anna's two priests
00:24:15,00:24:19,"are some youngsters for James, but you're worried."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Open brackets, if you're a mouse, close brackets."
00:24:22,00:24:25,"And they're also mice, so I should have said that."
00:24:25,00:24:28,So these are some studies done quite recently
00:24:28,00:24:32,where they've transplanted young mice blood into older mice.
00:24:32,00:24:36,And they've reversed some of the signs of aging in these mice.
00:24:36,00:24:37,What signs?
00:24:37,00:24:38,They stop being racist and stuff.
00:24:38,00:24:41,That's amazing.
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Yes, no, it is amazing."
00:24:43,00:24:44,They're not quite sure why.
00:24:44,00:24:48,They think this might be some compounds in there which help you.
00:24:48,00:24:51,But it's like muscle mass.
00:24:51,00:24:52,It's the brain tissue.
00:24:52,00:24:55,It's all sorts of things.
00:24:55,00:24:56,Wow.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"Probably what work in humans, just for a disclaimer."
00:24:59,00:25:00,But worth a try.
00:25:00,00:25:03,Because of the ethics committee or--
00:25:03,00:25:05,"Well, I mean, you couldn't really do it, could you?"
00:25:05,00:25:08,But I don't think there's any evidence that it works in humans.
00:25:08,00:25:08,Very good.
00:25:08,00:25:09,I'll do it.
00:25:09,00:25:10,"Yeah, you're younger than me."
00:25:10,00:25:11,Yep.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"Oh, no, don't."
00:25:12,00:25:15,"Remember, there was the theory that the queen mother"
00:25:15,00:25:16,was constantly having--
00:25:16,00:25:18,"No, I've not heard that theory."
00:25:18,00:25:18,Get out.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Of course you've heard that.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"No, I really haven't."
00:25:20,00:25:23,"And remember, we move in different circles too."
00:25:23,00:25:23,"No, there was the big--"
00:25:23,00:25:27,Dan moves in different crop circles to us.
00:25:27,00:25:30,It was the big thing that the queen--
00:25:30,00:25:33,"the queen mother, the reason she was able to stay old"
00:25:33,00:25:36,"and alive, alive being the main one,"
00:25:36,00:25:40,was that she used to have blood of the young.
00:25:40,00:25:41,I don't know.
00:25:41,00:25:42,I genuinely never heard that.
00:25:42,00:25:43,I don't know.
00:25:43,00:25:44,I don't think any normal people have.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"Well, the queen mother, there is a headline from the telegraph."
00:25:46,00:25:49,"Queen mother is given eight hour blood transfusion,"
00:25:49,00:25:50,which is when she was 101.
00:25:50,00:25:55,"But it was to help her recover from anemia, which she had."
00:25:55,00:25:57,She wasn't personally biting into the necks of youngsters.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"Yeah, it was a medical procedure."
00:25:59,00:26:01,"You're looking on the wrong site mate,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,because DavidIke.com literally says--
00:26:04,00:26:07,People did used to try blood transfusions.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Doctors didn't know before.
00:26:08,00:26:10,It was in any way a safer sense of what
00:26:10,00:26:12,they were doing for weird stuff.
00:26:12,00:26:16,I think Louis the 14th personal physician.
00:26:16,00:26:20,Jean-Baptiste Dene used to do blood transfusions
00:26:20,00:26:21,to various people for various things.
00:26:21,00:26:24,"Infuse the same guy with coughs blood twice,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,because he was suffering from a mental illness.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"And he had various symptoms after this,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,"like vomiting, passing, black urine, et cetera."
00:26:32,00:26:34,"But for some reason, he agreed to a third attempt,"
00:26:34,00:26:37,"at which point he died from the blood transfusion,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,because obviously it was incredibly unsafe in those days.
00:26:39,00:26:41,And he didn't know about blood types and stuff.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"No, no."
00:26:42,00:26:45,But it turned out-- so then he was accused of killing the guy.
00:26:45,00:26:48,And then they've tested his blood since the guy who died.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"And it's turned out that he was poisoned by arsenic,"
00:26:50,00:26:52,"probably murdered by his wife, who obviously"
00:26:52,00:26:53,saw an opportunity.
00:26:53,00:26:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:54,00:26:56,"Before we get this blamed on that doctor, man."
00:26:56,00:26:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:57,00:27:01,The first documented case of any kind of transfusion
00:27:01,00:27:04,was by Pope Innocent the 8th.
00:27:04,00:27:06,He was a 15th century pope.
00:27:06,00:27:10,He was supposedly given the board of three 10-year-old boys.
00:27:10,00:27:11,But he took it by mouth.
00:27:11,00:27:13,He didn't transfuse it into his blood.
00:27:13,00:27:14,Wrang the blood.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Yeah.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"And also, it's not that maybe it's not true."
00:27:17,00:27:19,And it's just like empty papal hysteria.
00:27:19,00:27:21,But that's the first written evidence
00:27:21,00:27:23,we have of anyone taking someone else's blood.
00:27:23,00:27:26,"Pope's name, Pope Innocent, making a suggestion."
00:27:26,00:27:29,"That's not an anti-papal name, is it?"
00:27:29,00:27:31,"Pope guilty, they call them Pope guilty."
00:27:31,00:27:34,In really witty circles.
00:27:34,00:27:38,I do mix in those witty circles.
00:27:38,00:27:40,James is a joke writer for the Protestant society.
00:27:40,00:27:46,I've read a bit more about this mouse experiment.
00:27:46,00:27:49,So the young mice that they did the experiment
00:27:49,00:27:50,with were three months old.
00:27:50,00:27:52,The elderly mice were 18 months old.
00:27:52,00:27:54,I don't think that's quite a sweet.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Completely to crap it.
00:27:55,00:27:58,But they did it partly by stitching together
00:27:58,00:28:02,"their circulatory systems, which is an extraordinary idea."
00:28:02,00:28:05,"And then after the experiment, the mice who had been treated,"
00:28:05,00:28:06,"the elderly mice who had been treated,"
00:28:06,00:28:09,remembered how to find a hidden resting platform
00:28:09,00:28:12,in a water maze better than the control group.
00:28:12,00:28:14,And this is the maze they'll use for mice these days.
00:28:14,00:28:15,I don't know if you know this.
00:28:15,00:28:17,It's not like the Hampton Court maze anymore.
00:28:17,00:28:20,It's basically a lot smaller these days.
00:28:20,00:28:21,It's just way too big.
00:28:21,00:28:25,"No, but the standard mouse test these days"
00:28:25,00:28:27,"is either a T-shape or a Y-shape,"
00:28:27,00:28:31,or it's a tub of milky water with a platform hidden
00:28:31,00:28:32,somewhere under the surface.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"And they put the mouse in it, and it has to swim desperately"
00:28:34,00:28:37,around until it can find the platform.
00:28:37,00:28:38,That's easy.
00:28:38,00:28:39,"Well, it remembers it."
00:28:39,00:28:40,It sounds easy to you.
00:28:40,00:28:42,Much easier than Hampton Court.
00:28:42,00:28:43,It's much easier than Hampton Court.
00:28:43,00:28:44,It's smaller.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Yeah.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"Anyway, animals that drink blood, a tick can drink 600 times"
00:28:49,00:28:52,its own body weight in blood in one sitting.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"Oh, really?"
00:28:53,00:28:56,"And so it's back blows up to, it looked like a balloon."
00:28:56,00:28:57,It's great.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:58,00:29:00,There's also a bird that drinks blood.
00:29:00,00:29:03,Vampire finches have evolved in the Galapagos Islands
00:29:03,00:29:05,because it's quite tough climate out there for them to survive.
00:29:05,00:29:07,And they've worked out that they can
00:29:07,00:29:10,"pick the backs of other birds, of booby birds,"
00:29:10,00:29:12,"apparently, and they can get this a blood out of their eyes."
00:29:12,00:29:15,"But the interesting thing is, is that they don't mind."
00:29:15,00:29:16,"Yeah, they don't."
00:29:16,00:29:19,"The booby birds just sit there, and they're kind of just"
00:29:19,00:29:20,mine.
00:29:20,00:29:21,They think that either they don't react
00:29:21,00:29:23,"because there are a lot of the finches,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,so they might be swarmed by the finches.
00:29:25,00:29:27,So they've worked out that they're going to be killed by the marfict.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"Oh, yeah, they're sitting there hating it."
00:29:30,00:29:31,"And they're just saying to each other, just leave it."
00:29:31,00:29:32,Just leave it.
00:29:32,00:29:33,"It's not worth it, Gary."
00:29:33,00:29:35,It's not worth it.
00:29:35,00:29:36,So this is cool.
00:29:36,00:29:40,"So while we're on vampire animals, vampire bats, obviously."
00:29:40,00:29:41,"Well, there's the common vampire bat."
00:29:41,00:29:43,Then there's the hairy-legged vampire bat
00:29:43,00:29:45,and the white-winged vampire bat.
00:29:45,00:29:49,"And the white-winged one, they feed on birds and mammals."
00:29:49,00:29:52,"The trick for getting chickens is, they will approach a hen,"
00:29:52,00:29:56,"and they'll mimic a chick by nuzzling up to her brood patch,"
00:29:56,00:29:57,"which is a bit of a skin on her underside,"
00:29:57,00:30:02,"which she uses to transfer heat to the eggs, as she nests."
00:30:02,00:30:05,And the hen sometimes thinks it's her baby cuddling up to her.
00:30:05,00:30:10,"And so she'll just sit on the bat, which then has all you can eat,"
00:30:10,00:30:13,"boofay, because it's managed to trick the hen into thinking"
00:30:13,00:30:14,that it's a--
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Oh, gosh, yeah, maybe."
00:30:15,00:30:16,It's a little freaky.
00:30:16,00:30:18,That is.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"Bedbugs also drink blood, and young bedbugs are transparent."
00:30:21,00:30:24,So the first meal they have turns them red.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"Oh, it's quite cool, isn't it?"
00:30:26,00:30:27,I really love that image.
00:30:27,00:30:30,"Headlouse mouth parts are transparent, as well."
00:30:30,00:30:34,So you can see a little vein of blood going from a scalp
00:30:34,00:30:35,into the headlouse.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Oh, that's cool."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"Yeah, well, I remember in Australia, headlice,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"you'd always get headlice, because you were always"
00:30:40,00:30:41,in the bush and stuff.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"The school I went to, at least, we're constantly"
00:30:43,00:30:44,having to face that.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Yeah, we always had headlice in school."
00:30:45,00:30:48,"That's because of schools and kids, not the bush."
00:30:48,00:30:50,"But yeah, they are quite see-through."
00:30:50,00:30:52,"You can see, yeah, you can see, I remember one falling"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"out of my head once, and being like, wow, that's a donation."
00:30:56,00:30:57,They just walk as well.
00:30:57,00:30:58,They don't jump.
00:30:58,00:30:59,There's normally children playing.
00:30:59,00:31:01,And it has to be one head touching another.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"So if you have a group photo, obviously,"
00:31:03,00:31:03,it's spread like wildfire.
00:31:03,00:31:05,But it's--
00:31:05,00:31:07,"Also, the idea that they prefer clean hair to dirty hair"
00:31:07,00:31:09,is just they just like hair.
00:31:09,00:31:10,How do they?
00:31:10,00:31:11,"Yeah, they're just like a place where"
00:31:11,00:31:13,they can grab on some hair and drink some blood.
00:31:13,00:31:14,They don't care if it's dirty or--
00:31:14,00:31:15,Right.
00:31:15,00:31:17,It sounds like a room that was propagated by nine-year-olds.
00:31:17,00:31:19,Recalcitrant nine-year-olds.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"What's weird, though, is that they just stay exclusively here."
00:31:21,00:31:23,They stay in your head hair.
00:31:23,00:31:26,Whereas pubic louse travel all over the body.
00:31:26,00:31:28,You can get them in your eyebrows.
00:31:28,00:31:29,"You can get them in your eyelashes,"
00:31:29,00:31:30,but you don't get them in your hair.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"And they're two separate species,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,and they don't actually cross over--
00:31:33,00:31:33,Yeah.
00:31:33,00:31:34,--very odd.
00:31:34,00:31:35,I've been reading a book.
00:31:35,00:31:36,It's a book about parasites.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"And it says, if you have pubic lice in your eyelashes,"
00:31:39,00:31:42,you've probably done something to deserve that.
00:31:42,00:31:43,It's probably been in the bush.
00:31:43,00:31:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:45,00:31:50,"OK, that's it."
00:31:50,00:31:51,That's all our facts.
00:31:51,00:31:53,Thanks so much for listening to our Halloween special.
