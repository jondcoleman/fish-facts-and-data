 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast"

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 this week coming to you live from Copenhagen!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Cheering]

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Bell]

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Annotchaginski, Andrew Huntsomari and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days at in a particular order.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Here we go. Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that when 11 time Grand Slam tennis champion, Bjorn Borg, came out of retirement,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 he returned using a wooden racket and was coached by a 79 year old karate expert from Wales.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 [Laughter]

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Three years later, he retired once again having failed to win a single match.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 [Laughter]

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Amazing.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 This fact was told to me by a friend of ours, the singer of our theme tune, Ash Gardner of Emperies.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Yes, he had found this out and it's absolutely true. It was a huge comeback. He for some bizarre reason didn't get a tennis coach.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 He found this 79 year old karate expert called Ron Thatcher.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Yeah, he was called Ron Thatcher, but he preferred to be known as Tier Honsey.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 [Laughter]

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And Borg called him the professor.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And this guy Ron Thatcher, he would always be accompanied by two ballerinas.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 [Laughter]

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Always.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 He had a massive hearing aid and he would always wear white and he always sat 15 feet away from Borg while he was playing, watching him through binoculars.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Wow.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Was he qualified in any way to be a tennis coach?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 No.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 He was like a life coach to a lot of people in Hollywood at the time and Borg of course, when he did retire, he kind of went into a bit of a play by lifestyle, didn't he?

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So he was 26 when he retired and then he came back age 34 and people said at the time that the wooden racket thing, they said it was like showing up in a rug with a musket.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It was just such a controversial decision to make.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 He was determined that the old boys were the best.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Yeah, that was the old way and then they went to graphite rackets and so he thought let me bring back this.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I mean, basically it looked like he was doing a karate could move.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 He was using the old ways, he had a karate expert.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yeah, it is old to watch because you can watch that one of the first matches that he'd spectacularly lost when he came back.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And it's just, it's a lot slower.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 It's like watching a sort of a five-year-old tap it back over the net and then sort of a professional tennis player smash it in their face.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah, the first game was in the Monte Carlo Open, wasn't it?

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And he lost in straight sets to a guy called Arrazi who then lost in the next round to even Isabic, who lost in the next round to Steve, who lost in the next round to Prippich,

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 who lost in the next round to Becker, who then got to the final in the next game and lost to Sir Guy Bragarium.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So you could definitely argue that Bog was by far the worst player in the whole game.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But he was one of the greats.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I mean, it's worth saying for anyone who follows tennis now or is just aware of famous tennis names like Jokovic and Federer.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Bjorg was, he was huge.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Him and Mackinroy and their rivalry is the great rivalry that is alongside Nadal and Federer, really.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And their big game in 1981, the last big end that Bjorg really played in the US Open was Seminal.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And that was also the last time that two players really used wooden rackets.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So the two of them were two of the very last people on tour to use the wooden rackets.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Everyone was doing the modern stuff by this time.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But he was very upset by it, wasn't he?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So he lost to Mackinroy Wimbledon in 1981, and then at the US Open Final two months later.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And he was so upset that he, and this is like unheard of, he just fled the court.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So the moment he lost that game, he ran off the court, he disappeared.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And there was panic, and there was particularly panic, because there have been death threats against him called into the, you know, to the courts a few hours earlier.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So all the staff were like, where the fuck has he gone?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 A, he needs to be here to accept his silver trophy, and B, is he dead?

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Follow that car, and the man in the white suit, and the ballerinas.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The arrival we was actually made into a Hollywood movie not too long ago,

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 which was called "Borg vs Mackinroy".

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 What a brilliantly weird name.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Well, they renamed the movie for Nordic Country.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So it went from Borg vs Mackinroy to Borg.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Oh, wow!

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 That's brilliant.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 No interest in Mackinroy.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So good.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I was trying to find out about why tenor players have so many records.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You know, because you see them, they turn up a court with a huge number of records, and you think they wouldn't need that many.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So I started googling, why do tennis players have?

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And the options that it fills in automatically. The first one is so many records.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 The second one is skinny arms.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Okay, yeah. Some of them do. Sure.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Big thighs is the third one. Why do they have big thighs?

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And big calves is the next one.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Fifth one, shoes.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Why do they have shoes?

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And what's the answer?

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I don't know.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 You didn't read it?

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 What kind of researcher are you?

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's amazing.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Well, I mean, Borg had a good reason for taking loads of records on tour.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And that's that he just snapped the strings constantly, because he had a mad racket stringing thing.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So his rackets were trying to enormous pressure or 80 pounds of pressure, which was very tight.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So that just means they used to snap constantly.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He once went through 60 records during one French open game.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 What? Yes.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 It's disruptive to the game. That would put you off.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But he wasn't a smasher at once. He didn't smash his own racket.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 No, no, far too boring for that.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 No, it's just because they're too tightly, tightly strong.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But he had this coach that's called Leonard Bergelin, which I'm sure I've missed pronounced apologies.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But Leonard Bergelin was totally devoted to him.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So he'd steep in a room with all of Borg's rackets, so that he could be woken up whenever one of them snapped.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Because if one of them snapped, you had to leap out of bed and cut all the other strings so that you didn't warp the frame.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And so he said like many times on tour, he'd just spend his whole night, you know,

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 having waking up, jumping out of bed quickly, cutting all the strings of a racket, going back to bed.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's amazing.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Some more stuff on bad tennis.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 There was a game in Florida in 2002 on Amelia Island. It was between Anne Kramer and Jennifer Hopkins.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It was a first round match, and there were 29 double faults in the game.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But then they realised the reason was that the groundsmen had put the box in the wrong place.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And made it three feet shorter than it was supposed to be.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 That's incredible.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 But surely tennis players can adjust to where a line is. That's their thing, right?

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Yes, so I suppose they all started at the start, these faults.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And also, you wouldn't adjust because you think it can't be possible that this tennis court is randomly three feet shorter.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It can't be that they've made this three feet shorter. I must have just overheat it, I'll try again.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I've got a fact about tennis balls.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 To get to Wimbledon, the ingredients that go into a tennis ball cumulatively travel 50,000 miles.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 That's the big killer there.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 The clay comes from South Carolina. The silica comes from Greece. The zinc oxide comes from Thailand.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 All these things make their way to the Philippines. The wool has to go from New Zealand to Gloucestershire in England.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And then back to the Philippines.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 They just hit it back over there. It just comes back over there.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And then the other ingredients are bought and the tins are shipped from Indonesia. And then the whole thing has to go over to Wimbledon.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 50,000 miles. I have some a couple of other eccentric tennis players.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Oh, you're interested in that. These guys are from the real tennis days. So it's before modern tennis.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 There was a real great eccentric Frenchman called La Bay. It was his nickname.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And he was, he always played completely topless, but he had a red ribbon around his head and a red ribbon around his belly.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 He once played with a shoehorn, you know, that used to take your shoes off of one against someone else.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 He once played with, for a bet, he played with a man riding on his back and he won.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Did the man, did the man also have a racket?

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 No, okay. That would be better.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That would be great.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And he also once played with a donkey fastened to him.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And again, the donkey didn't have a racket there either.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Oh, I mean, so he was standing beside the donkey. He was tied to a donkey.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And he's still one.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He's still one.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Who was he playing? Was he playing babies?

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I don't know who he was playing. And there was another guy called Charles Delahé,

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 who played in full military uniform with his racket in his right hand and a musket and fixed bayonet in his left.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So I would deliberately lose to him.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And there was another guy called Raymond Masson, who would play anyone who challenged him,

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 but promised to jump in and out of a barrel between every shot.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 A barrel.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 So he had a barrel there.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 He'd play a shot, jump in the barrel, jump out and then play the next shot.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 These are all from a book about those strangest tennis matches in history by Peter Sedan, I should say.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And these were year-olden days, right?

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 It's in the mid to late 19th century.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Wow.

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 There was a, what, the best tennis player in Britain at the turn of the 20th century,

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 one of the best.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Again, a real tennis player was a guy called Eustace Miles.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And so he won an Olympic medal in 1908.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 He was also a squash champion.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He was amazing.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And then he also became sort of the leading health fan promoter, anti sort of popularised vegetarianism.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So he set up the biggest vegetarian restaurant in London.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 All the suffragettes used to go there because they love vegetarianism, overlap there.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And, yeah, so he had this restaurant.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 But what I like about this restaurant is that he was convinced that Eurick acid was really bad for your health.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 This was a fad in 1908 or whatever.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And so he, the first, you know, these days when you have theve of vegetarian, next to an item on a menu.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 The first instance of that was in his restaurant and it was FU, which meant free from Eurick acid.

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Just on the tennis players and food, in 2012, there was an article that came out that said that

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Jockovich had bought the entire world supply of donkey cheese.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Yeah.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Donkey cheese.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 All the donkey cheese in Ireland.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I know.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Oh, gone.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 How much donkey cheese is being made?

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 It's quite big in Serbia.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He's Serbian.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Yeah, he's Serbian.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Yeah, it's quite big of donkey cheese in Serbia.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 It's called Pula Pula, or something like that.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Yeah, that's it.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And he has a restaurant chain and he wanted to have this brilliant, this cheese is very expensive.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And it's made from donkeys.

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It takes 25 litres of fresh donkey milk.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Oh, sorry, it's not made from donkeys, is it?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 No, no.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It takes 25 litres of fresh donkey milk to make a single kilogram of this cheese.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And so they produce a certain amount of year.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And Jockovich just went in, bought it all up.

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And yeah, it was...

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 You knew that donkeys and tennis players had such a interlinked history.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I've got one last thing which was, I was looking into Bjornborg's retirement and then obviously his return to the game.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 But I thought, okay, what did Mac and Rodu when he retired, this big rivalry, where did he go?

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 We all know what he does now.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 He's a commentator and he plays on the scene for the older generations.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But when he retired, his plan was to become a musician.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 He thought he was going to be a massive musician.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 He spent years playing with a band and he pulled out of finishing his first album.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So there was an album that was going to be recorded and released.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And there's not been many reviews that I could find other than a bartender of a bar that he played in who said he couldn't sing to save his life.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And one person who has heard the song was Liam Gallagher of Oasis.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Oasis were playing in America.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And after the show, a very drunk and I think Stone, John McEnroe, came up to them and said,

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 "Do you want to smoke some spliffs? Let's go back to where he was."

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So they said, "Yeah, John McEnroe, amazing."

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Not in that voice, they would never talk like, "Oh, I'm only John McEnroe, yes, please."

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So they went back to where he was.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And apparently, so Liam Gallagher sings the song that he played to them in a totally stone state.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And I don't know if it was Eric or a real guitar, but the way Liam does it is,

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 "Do, do, do, do, do, do. You cannot be serious. Do, do, do, do, do, do. You cannot be serious. Was it in or was it out? That was his song."

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And sorry, you don't know when you listen to this, you couldn't tell if it was air guitar or real guitar.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Because I'm no musician, but I feel like even I can distinguish between those two instruments.

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Look, we need to move on to our next fact.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 My fact is, the trues cope with winter by shrinking their own brains.

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So.

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I don't think anyone believes you.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Yeah.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 They do, trues, common trues we're talking about.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 That's the species.

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 All right, that's no way to talk about them.

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 When you say cope, is it a sort of boredom thing or is it a survival thing?

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 It's a boredom thing.

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Well, cope, sounds like. How interesting is life when you're a shrew, you know. They're not coping with the boredom of winter.

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 They're coping with the cold of winter.

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Just cope is a, you know, I cope with you telling me things are, wow.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And it does shrink our brains, for me.

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 So, why do they do this?

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Why do they do it? Well, because it's cold, as I think I mentioned.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 So, they, this is a thing called the dental phenomenon.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 It was discovered by a Polish scientist called August Dental in the 1940s.

226
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 They have, you know, they run very, very hot trues.

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Their heart goes at 1500 beats per minute.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 So, they are incredibly fast-lived animals.

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And in winter, they need a lot of food all the time.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 But in winter, it just helps them if they reduce their own body size.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 So, sorry, like shrews, most animals would kind of bulk up, wouldn't they, before winter, and then kind of sleep.

232
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 But they can't do it because their metabolism is so high.

233
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 If they tried to eat loads of stuff, they would just burn it all off.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 So, they shrink the, on average, they shrink by 17%.

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And they're about, also, they're quite a lot brain.

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 They're 10% brain by mass, which is more than almost any other mammal.

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And so, their bones and their heart shrink by about 20%.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And it makes them stupider as well.

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So, the scientists have done experiments on them.

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They always do their exams in the summer, like I was doing there.

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Yeah, they used trues in spring, caught in the spring of the summer,

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 and they put them in a box with some food in, and they just went to the food.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Then they tried it on winter trues with small brains, and they just moved around aimlessly, not moving towards the food.

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 No, but it's because in winter, they don't travel very far.

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So, they don't actually need spatial awareness in the winter.

246
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 So, it saves time. That is amazing. That's incredible.

247
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Yeah, they are very small trees.

248
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So, a tree is the smallest mammal.

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 The Etruscan tree, and it's tiny.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 It's 1.8 grams, the weight of a playing card.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And it's like a tiny little, well, they're not rodents, such I don't think are they,

252
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 but it's a tiny little mammal.

253
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And the Etruscan tree, actually, its prey is cricket.

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So, it's main prey is crickets.

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And crickets defend themselves in this really cool way.

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 So, they do like a karate kick.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 So, I think by the description that I read, they sort of crouch to their head,

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 they're almost doing a headstand.

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So, they scrunch up their body, and then they spring one of their back legs out,

260
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 was like a karate kick, to kick the shrew in the face.

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And so, as soon as the shrew interrupts the cricket, it immediately recoils its face,

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 because otherwise it gets kicked.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Wow.

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Well, they've actually been taught that karate move by a 79-year-old tennis instructor from Wales.

265
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Yeah.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 My favourite shrew is Thor's Hero Shrew.

267
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 There was already a hero shrew, but they found another one and they called him Thor's Hero Shrew.

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And according to an article in Nature, it can support the weight of a full-grown man on its back.

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Yeah, wow.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 It doesn't sound true, does it?

271
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 According to the article, this is in 2013, it was in Nature, and it says it's the equivalent of a human holding up a space shuttle.

272
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I would love to see someone, a full-grown man, just moving slowly along the street.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Oh, has he got those wheelie shoes? No, he's got a shrew, actually.

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I have a favourite shrew.

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Oh, do you?

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Yeah, we all do.

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 The elephant shrew.

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Oh, yeah.

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Yeah, elephant shrew.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So, elephant shrews were named elephant shrews, because they have these flexible noses,

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 which sort of resemble an elephant, looks a bit like an elephant.

282
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But then, they're not shrews, are they?

283
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Well, it turns out they did actual analysis on them, discovered that they're not shrews, they're not true shrews.

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And actually, genetically, they're closer to an elephant than they are a shrew.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 By weird coincidence, yeah.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Yeah, so actually, I don't have a favourite shrew.

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You've got a favourite elephant.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Yeah.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Anna, favourite shrew?

290
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Favourite shrew. I like a desert shrew, so a desert shrew has defecation stations.

291
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 That's just a fun name apart from anything else, isn't it?

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 I know, I just like that they know how to rhyme.

293
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 No, they haven't called them that we have, but everyone poo's in the same place,

294
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 and it's away from where everything else happens, so it doesn't sort of contaminate it,

295
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 and their feces is corkscrew shaped.

296
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Wow. So they can open wine with their poo?

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Would you like to taste the light, no?

298
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I've got a favourite shrew.

299
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I've got one further shrew that we haven't talked about yet, which is the short tailed shrew,

300
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 and they have a really cool feeding mechanism, so they like insects, they like to eat insects,

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 and they eat them over the winter, but they want to store them in their nest for weeks on end,

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 because sometimes they might run out, so what they do is they have toxic saliva,

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 and they bite an insect, which then falls into a coma and gets paralysed,

304
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 and the shrew drags it back to its nest, and it just keeps it in there for weeks and weeks,

305
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 and every time one of its bits of food starts moving and waking up,

306
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 it wakes up and goes, "Ah, shrew!"

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 and then the shrew bites it again and just knocks it out again.

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That's horrible. That's your favourite shrew.

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 That's absolutely terrifying.

310
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Life is tough. That is a horror film.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 You've been abducted by a shrew, and you're constantly patterns.

312
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 At the moment you think you're escaping.

313
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You call it shrews day.

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Just on winter survival tactics, so a lot of animals have kind of amazing ways of surviving in the winter.

315
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Head shogs, I didn't know.

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 When they go into winter hibernation, they reduce their heartbeats from 180 beats per minute

317
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 to very low, so sometimes sort of an average of maybe 10 to 20 to very low.

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 An average of 10 to 20, but they can go down to two beats a minute.

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Wow!

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Impressive, right?

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Also, the red-ed slider turtle, which is the most common turtle pet, really, I think.

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It doesn't hibernate. It does a thing called brew mating,

323
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 which is like hibernating, but occasionally it wakes up to have a quick drink,

324
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 and then goes to sleep again.

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 So they'll survive in water, they go under water, and then it'll ice over,

326
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 and they'll survive under the ice without breathing at all, so they can not breathe for weeks.

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 They just extract oxygen from the water with their bottoms, with their co-uckers,

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 and just suck it out.

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So our brain shrink, human brain shrink.

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 When you go past the age of 40, your brain shrinks at the rate of 5% per decade.

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I know, I know.

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 You can tell the relative age of everyone in this audience.

333
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 If you allow noises came from...

334
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 If you saw me in the green room earlier on, there was some food in the corner,

335
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 but I was just wandering around there, no idea where it was.

336
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 There's lots of stuff about whether we could be shrunk.

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So there's a...

338
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Cool.

339
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Do you mean all of us?

340
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Like, as in all of our body, as in our whole body shrunk down?

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Yeah, all of us, whole body.

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 So there's a Dutch historian called Anna Hendrix,

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and he's a proposed that humans shrink themselves down to the size of check-ins,

344
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 because we would consume only 2% of the food and drink that we do now.

345
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Yeah, there was a movie about that, wasn't there last year?

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Downsized, yes.

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And it would really work.

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So this guy...

349
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 What?

350
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 What if it had a bed of science?

351
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It would work.

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 What would it do to our houses?

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 What would it do to ours?

354
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Okay, we don't reach anything.

355
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Fair point.

356
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Fair point.

357
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Okay, so that's a very extreme...

358
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You probably have to have one normal sized human next to you at all times,

359
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 like bringing you things down from the top shelf.

360
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Well, we've got that, that's babies.

361
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Wait.

362
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Does he say how we might do this shrinking?

363
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Look, I think it's more of a thought experiment at the moment,

364
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 but other people are...

365
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So someone else has proposed a similar thing.

366
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Even if...

367
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Let's say we all make ourselves just 15 centimeters long.

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 How are we going to do it?

369
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Just selective breeding, I guess, or...

370
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 No, hang on.

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Okay.

372
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And then what's the great thing that happens?

373
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 We can see much less.

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Like, even if we make ourselves just 15 centimeters shorter,

375
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 we can all just mutually do that, okay?

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 We can all just agree we're just going to be shorter.

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 That would be, men would have 23% less mass and women 25% less.

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That could offset a lot of climate change.

379
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 We could save the planet by just being slightly shorter.

380
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 By chopping our heads off.

381
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Just chopping our heads off.

382
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I feel like I've been duped now, because Andy said yesterday,

383
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 "Oh, I've looked into a bit of how we shrink ourselves stuff."

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And so I spent a lot of time looking at whether honey eyes shrunk the kids

385
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 was a feasible prospect.

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And I went on a website called overthinkingit.com.

387
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Which is really good.

388
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 They debate at length whether this could happen.

389
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Apparently the theory behind it, and honey eyes shrunk the kids,

390
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 if you remember, was that the idea is you reduce the electron cloud size

391
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 of a person, which basically means you reduce all the empty space

392
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 between the atoms.

393
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So, you know, we're mostly empty space.

394
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 But then this, I know this is going to surprise you,

395
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 but this would not be realistic.

396
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Because then you've taken out all the empty space,

397
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 but you've got the same mass.

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So you're a tiny person smaller than an ant with the same mass.

399
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Imagine an ant as heavy as an adult human.

400
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And so you definitely can't walk, you can't talk.

401
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Your vocal cords don't work.

402
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 You're too small to absorb any of the molecules you need to absorb.

403
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And actually, so this is some, you know, nerds online speculating.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And they said, they said, you have very small electron orbitals.

405
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 So I think the electrons are very close to the center of the atom.

406
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So no bonds can properly form between atoms.

407
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 So dense atoms, which, you know, the tiny people have,

408
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 will be replaced or diffused so that the kids would either evaporate

409
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 or just naturally grow back to normal size.

410
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So that's the realistic ending of that film.

411
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 [APPLAUSE]

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

413
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 OK, my fact this week is that according to US intellectual property law,

414
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 you are not allowed to hold any copyrights if you are the Holy Spirit.

415
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 [LAUGHTER]

416
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It's true.

417
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 But, OK.

418
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 This doesn't affect anyone in this room, I don't suppose.

419
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 No.

420
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It's from the Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices, Chapter 300,

421
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 which is online and I've read.

422
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Did you read all the preceding 299 chapters?

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I did not.

424
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Right.

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And it says that the US Copyright Office will not register works produced

426
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 by nature, animals, or plants, or anything created by divine or supernatural beings.

427
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And then it gives specific examples such as a photograph taken by a monkey.

428
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And mural painted by an elephant.

429
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 A piece of driftwood that has been shaped and smooth by the ocean.

430
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And an example, this actually happened.

431
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 An application for a song naming the Holy Spirit as the author of the work.

432
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 So this is a genuine thing.

433
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Someone has tried to do this and they said we're going to have to make a law against that now.

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Right.

435
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 But what's the problem it creates if you say I wrote this with the Holy Spirit?

436
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I suppose the problem is who collects the royalties?

437
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Yeah.

438
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Yeah.

439
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Yeah.

440
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I don't know that.

441
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I think they're just saying, stop saying that the Holy Spirit wrote this song.

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You obviously wrote it.

443
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I'll miss the Mac and Row.

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 [LAUGHTER]

445
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I do love it, though, when a religious thing is treated as sort of a mundane real thing.

446
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I read in 2011 a poll found that 52% of Americans approve of God's job performance.

447
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 [LAUGHTER]

448
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Wow.

449
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 It was a poll that was done.

450
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I mean, percent, did you say?

451
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Sorry?

452
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 52%.

453
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 52%.

454
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Wow.

455
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 That's not much higher than Donald Trump's approval rating.

456
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 No.

457
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Well, there was a thing about another copyright religious thing in 2003.

458
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 US Legal Review Magazine examined whether Jesus had any chance of holding copyright of his revelations.

459
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And it concluded that if Jesus wished to claim copyright protection for himself for all his revelations,

460
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 he would be legally entitled to copyright protection.

461
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 So that's good.

462
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 That is good.

463
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 That's going to be huge news for Jesus.

464
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 [LAUGHTER]

465
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It'll be enormously relieved.

466
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 All right, I'm coming back.

467
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 [LAUGHTER]

468
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 He just went up in a stop because people get nicking his ideas.

469
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 But is this a tool based on that story a couple of years ago where a monkey took a photograph,

470
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and it was the term that they couldn't claim copyright.

471
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Yeah, that's the reference of one of the examples, yeah.

472
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 God it, yeah.

473
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Because that was a macaque, wasn't it, too?

474
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 A photographer called David Slater left his camera in Indonesia, and some macaques came up and found it really interesting,

475
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 and took hundreds of photos, none of them in focus.

476
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And then he, I think, Wikimedia said that they could use them.

477
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And refused to take them down.

478
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 He said, but it belongs to the monkey.

479
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And it doesn't.

480
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 So sorry.

481
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 [LAUGHTER]

482
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 But did you know-- so we always talk about how we deal in facts.

483
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So we often say you can't copyright a fact.

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 So obviously, anyone can use this in any way they like.

485
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 But actually, that's based on the idea that something that you can copyright

486
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 has to be a creation, something that you've created with your imagination that's original.

487
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But there is a tweak to that in copyright law, which says that you can also copyright something

488
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 that's been achieved by sweat of the brow, and it's called the sweat of the brow doctrine.

489
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And this is just-- so this is basically about lists of facts.

490
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 So if you've gone out into the world and you've just collected lots of facts and put them in a list,

491
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 if you've sweated enough from your brow, basically, then you can kind of have a copyright

492
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 as a reward for the hard work you've gone through.

493
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Wow.

494
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 So there we go.

495
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 We should go back over all that.

496
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 I don't know how sweaty you are.

497
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Yeah.

498
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 We can finish all those foreheads after the show, determined.

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And so this is a weird thing.

500
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 So in the USA, it work goes into the public domain once the author's been dead for 70 years.

501
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But you can fulfill of depictions of those things which have been copyrighted.

502
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 So Frankenstein, the Frankenstein's monster, is out of copyright

503
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 because Mary Shelley has been dead for a long time.

504
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 But Universal, the movie company, they invented a look for him.

505
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 So if you describe him as having green skin and a flat head and bolt through his neck,

506
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 you're breaching copyright on their idea of what Frankenstein is like.

507
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Right, okay.

508
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Yeah.

509
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That's crazy.

510
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 The similar thing is the Tarzan call.

511
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 That is a trademark call.

512
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I'm sorry, I don't know that call. How does it go?

513
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Yeah, okay.

514
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I might remember it.

515
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

516
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 I'm afraid you're in breach of copyright.

517
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 You only get half of it though, didn't you?

518
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Well, fortunately, I did it in the voice of Liam Gallagher.

519
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 You only get half of it and it's a palindrome that call.

520
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Yeah, if you turn it around, it's exactly the same the other way around.

521
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Yeah.

522
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 But there's an actual description of what you are legally not allowed to do,

523
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 if you were making that call to make you legally in trouble.

524
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And so they write it down.

525
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So it's a ten step call.

526
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 If you get it to that, then you're going to get sued.

527
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So it's one, a semi long sound in the chest register,

528
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 two, short sound, up and interval of one octave plus a fifth from the preceding sound.

529
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Three, a short sound down a major third from the preceding sound.

530
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Four, a short sound up from major third from the preceding sound.

531
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Five, a long sound down on one octave plus a major third from the preceding sound.

532
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Six, a short sound up one octave from the preceding sound.

533
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Seven, a short sound up major third from the preceding sound.

534
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 It goes on for ten steps.

535
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I can't if you gave up at seven, I mean.

536
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I just, I just thought spoiler alert in case no one's read the legal ramifications.

537
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So there's some new copyright laws about to come in.

538
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I think in the EU, it's either just coming in, it's about to come in.

539
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 It's going to force online companies to immediately take anything down,

540
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 as soon as you say that you've got a copyright against it.

541
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 They don't have to check or anything.

542
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 As soon as you say it, they're going to have to take it down.

543
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 So a lot of people online are a bit worried about it.

544
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 It went through by just five votes, but ten MEPs admitted later that they've been confused

545
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 and pressed the wrong button.

546
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And it turns out, and I didn't know this, if an MEP presses the wrong button in a vote,

547
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 they're allowed to say afterwards and have the record amended saying,

548
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 "I actually shouldn't vote for that, but the law still has to stay as it was."

549
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Yeah, wow.

550
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I have to say I used to work for a politician who did that once on a flagship policy

551
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 of the party that I worked for, and he was the one deciding vote,

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 and he didn't understand how the system worked, and he pressed the wrong button.

553
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 It was awesome.

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And that was Brexit.

555
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 So Mr. T owns the copyright.

556
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And we're very honoured tonight.

557
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 I can't believe he flew all the way over.

558
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Mr. T owns the copyright to I pity the fool, and he makes money from that catchphrase and sells it,

559
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 but he does not own the copyright to the name Mr. T,

560
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 because that is owned by a company in Illinois, which makes a foam T-shaped scrubber.

561
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And one other thing about copyright, though, I think it's quite interesting,

562
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 is this, I think, is a new law, came in in 2014, which is that you can mash up someone else's work,

563
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 to create something new, without permission now.

564
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 So when you get mash-ups like a set boy online where you take David Attenborough's voice

565
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 and you put it over some other hilarious footage, you know what I'm talking about, right?

566
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 But you can reuse the copyrighted material, as long as it's for the purposes of parody,

567
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 caricature, or pastiche.

568
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And so if you do that, and then you're taken to court, then it's up to the judge to decide if it's funny enough.

569
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 So you got to have a judge with a sense of humour.

570
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 That's extraordinary.

571
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 The craziest lawsuit I think I've ever seen in terms of a trademark that continually sues people

572
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 is, you know, the I Heart New York t-shirt, I Heart NY, that is owned by New York City,

573
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 and they were constantly suing people for doing parodies and knock-offs of it,

574
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 because you would think that that's just an open design that can be used.

575
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 In 2005, they had, I think, over 3,000 lawsuits going to sue people.

576
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Yeah, and then there was a coffee shop owner in New York who wrote a tattooed on his fingers,

577
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 "I coffee cup NY," and they sued him.

578
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I mean, it's stuff like this.

579
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 This is how crazy it gets, and this has been reported.

580
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 So I have to say this with a caveat.

581
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 But the guy who actually designed it, who was a very famous designer in America,

582
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 he designed the DC logo as well.

583
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 He tried to do a commemorative version of September the 11th when it happened to reflect it,

584
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 and they told him he couldn't, or he would be sued.

585
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Like, that's how crazy it is, but you cannot be serious.

586
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Is that John McEnroe?

587
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 That's John McEnroe's catchphrase.

588
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Yeah.

589
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 That's going to cost us a lot of money there.

590
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chizinski.

591
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 My fact this week is that in the 18th century, you could hire a professional Canary trainer

592
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 to expand your Canary's singing repertoire.

593
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Sometimes your Canary is just a lot of scratch.

594
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 You've got to get a private tutor in.

595
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And this was the 18th century, 18th century, and 19th century.

596
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Canaries were an incredibly popular common pet across Europe.

597
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And I read this in a book called The Animals Companion, which is a book that's just come out,

598
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 and they were super fashionable, but they were fashionable because they were amazing songs.

599
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So if you got a Canary that was a bit of a dud in the singing department,

600
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 then you could hire what was called a syphler, if you were French.

601
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 And then they'd teach them to sing.

602
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 So it was a human who would...

603
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 It's not another Canary, yeah, it's a human, yeah.

604
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 That would have been nice.

605
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 It was, basically, they had these really little musical instruments, didn't they?

606
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 They had, they were called bird flagealais.

607
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Yeah.

608
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And they're really, really tiny little flutes.

609
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And what you would do is...

610
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 No, you don't give the Canary the instrument.

611
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Yeah, do you?

612
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 No.

613
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 So what happens is you get your Canary, it's just been born.

614
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You wait for a little while, and as soon as he starts to chirp,

615
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 then you realise that that is a male, because it's only the males who chirp.

616
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And then you take him away from all of his mates, put him in a cage,

617
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 and cover it in a canvas, so he doesn't have any other influence from anything else.

618
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 And then you, every day, just go in and play a little...

619
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And then he learns from that, whereas he would have learned from another Canary in the past.

620
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Right.

621
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 They're very good learners.

622
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 The story goes that it was discovered sort of in the early 1700s,

623
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 how brilliant they were when one Canary started mimicking the sound of very distant church bells playing in the distance.

624
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And another Canary, apparently, that belonged to a tax collector,

625
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 started incorporating a clink sound into its songs for the clink of money falling into his sack of cash.

626
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Amazing.

627
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 No, they're good.

628
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 They come from the Canary Islands, Canaries, so that's where they were first imported from,

629
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 by the Spanish, who had the Canary Islands, and that's hence the name.

630
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 So it's so confusing, the Canary Islands are named after canis dogs,

631
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 but then Canaries, the birds are named after the islands.

632
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 But the Spanish would only ever export the mails so they could have a proper monopoly on them.

633
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So they started exporting them in the early 15th century, but you could never breed them.

634
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Well, you couldn't for a long time.

635
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Yeah, no, so it was only the mails who could sing, so they were the only ones people wanted.

636
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 But it's such a good scam, because if you only give mails, then no one else can get them, right?

637
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Yeah, exactly.

638
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 But some rogue females got out there, and people managed to breed.

639
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 The Germans, I think, actually, it was the Germans who undercut the Spanish trade because of their...

640
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Well, they were just very organised about it. They found one female, and they were like,

641
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 "Right, let's turn this into a good business."

642
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And suddenly, the Spanish sailors weren't doing so well.

643
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I'm not sure this is true, but in 1622, there was word that a Spanish vessel

644
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 had been stranded on Elba, the Italian island, with a cargo of male and female Canaries,

645
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 and they had escaped.

646
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And people sailed specifically from Tuscany to Elba just to catch some Canaries,

647
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 because they were worth their weight in gold.

648
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Yeah, they used to be a hangover curer in ancient Rome.

649
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Did they?

650
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Yeah, if you were really hungover, you would have a deep-fried Canary,

651
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 and that can't be yummy.

652
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 What? No.

653
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Deep-fried.

654
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Yeah.

655
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Yeah.

656
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Okay.

657
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 It was the foundations of Scottish food.

658
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 But yeah, no, deep-fried Canary would be what would happen.

659
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But it was thought that they could help lots of illnesses, wasn't it?

660
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 So the famously, they were used in mines, because they could tell when there was gas there,

661
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 because they would kind of faint before humans would.

662
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 But also the miners would use it to almost blot out.

663
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 If you had, like, an illness, you would kind of rub a Canary on yourself,

664
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 and the hope was that it would kind of suck out the illness.

665
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 I don't think it worked.

666
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Pokerberries.

667
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 It's worth a try, I think.

668
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Once in the mines are so interesting.

669
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Do you know the last ones officially in British mines were in 1986?

670
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 That was quite a recent tradition.

671
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Wow.

672
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Yeah.

673
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 And there was a device created, in fact, in 1896, which could revive them,

674
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 and it was a special Canary cage, and on top of it there's this big vial of oxygen.

675
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 And as soon as the Canary collapses and faints, you say, "Okay, what does not say?

676
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 So we better get out."

677
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 But also, let's just turn a little wheel, and it releases the oxygen into the Canary's cage and revives it.

678
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Cool.

679
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 That's sweet.

680
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 So do they keep the Canary in the cage down there, or do you have to save the Canary on your way up?

681
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 You'll pull it back up with you, I guess.

682
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 You pull the Canary back up, and then you put it in the cage, right?

683
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Yeah.

684
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 No.

685
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 The Canary was always in a cage when you went down there.

686
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Yeah.

687
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 It's not loose in a mine.

688
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 That's a recipe for disaster.

689
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Of course.

690
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 I don't know if sweet is the right word for saying they save their lives.

691
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 It's better than the alternative.

692
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Yeah.

693
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 You know, if the Canary dies, you can no longer rub it on your horrible body to cure your disease.

694
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 But you can still eat it deep-fried.

695
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Oh, yeah.

696
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Bad news.

697
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 The mind is dangerous.

698
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Good news.

699
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Lunch.

700
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 They didn't have maybe the best lives when they were being sold.

701
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Because Canary, training in Canary, selling was such a big industry.

702
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And they would literally make these tiny little cages, which would just fit one Canary.

703
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And it was proper industry.

704
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 There were some places like in the hearts mountains in Germany, in the late 18th century, where, you know,

705
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 that the whole industry was about breeding and selling Canaries.

706
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 And children were especially good at making those cages, because they're very intricate, and they've got tiny little hands.

707
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 So they made these sweet little cages, and they had not a nice life.

708
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 But if you were a Canary bird trainer, then you were very worried about the spread of disease amongst your Canaries,

709
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 because if they all died, then your industry is gone.

710
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And so, apparently, every few days, you'd book a room, a few rooms in an inn, and you'd go in with all of your cages,

711
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 and you'd release the Canaries into the few rooms, while you scraped out the cages for a day.

712
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 And so, if you're the Inkeeper, you're just aware that three of your rooms have just got 1,000 Canaries living in them.

713
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 I think you're aware when you're trying to clean it the next day, and you're really...

714
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Wow.

715
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 The region of a bird's brain, which is responsible for song, this is in songbirds, it's four times bigger in males and females,

716
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 and also, like a shrew, it shrinks and grows with the year.

717
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 So when they're doing the breeding season, the brain will get bigger so that it can do the singing,

718
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 and then when they're not doing the breeding season, it'll get smaller.

719
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 That's amazing.

720
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Wow. That's really cool. So you've got to pick the right time of year to go to a Canary gig, because they'll set...

721
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Do you hear the hits?

722
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 No, he doesn't remember the hits.

723
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Just wandering around, bumming into stuff.

724
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Do you want to hear about the most famous British budgie ever?

725
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 No, it's a nice one. No, no, but we're going to have to wrap up shortly.

726
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 He was called Sparky Williams, and he was born in 1954, and according to obitories overhead,

727
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 six years working as a character actor, he was in TV ads, he knew 550 words,

728
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 a disc with his voice on, 20,000 copies were made of it, and he could do two voices,

729
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 he could do Newcastle, and refined.

730
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 [Laughter]

731
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.
