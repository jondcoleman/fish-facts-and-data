00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna"
00:00:26,00:00:30,"Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the"
00:00:30,00:00:35,"microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,"
00:00:35,00:00:42,here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that one in three people
00:00:42,00:00:50,in the UK has seen the Queen in real life. Wow. That's insane. It feels high to me. There are
00:00:50,00:00:55,about 70 million people in the UK. Shouldn't we start off with a survey of the people on this soon?
00:00:55,00:01:00,Yes 100% and I've got some extra data to add actually. I know that Dan has for sure because
00:01:00,00:01:04,"Dan's actually properly met the Queen. I went to Buckingham Palace. You slept with her, haven't you?"
00:01:04,00:01:12,It was Phillip. I slept with Phillip that she came in and served us tea in the morning.
00:01:12,00:01:16,I'm sure you can be arrested for this kind of comment. Definitely. This is now the treason cast.
00:01:16,00:01:24,"Okay, so Dan has to Buckingham Palace Garden Party. Fine. Anna? I don't think so. Okay, data."
00:01:24,00:01:28,"I need a lot of people, you know. We should ask the Queen about if she's that Anna."
00:01:28,00:01:35,"Have you seen her though, Anna? Like have you, with your eyes in public, seen her? That's the"
00:01:35,00:01:38,"other bit of it. No, not in public. The only reason I hesitate is because I know my siblings have"
00:01:38,00:01:45,met her because my brother's called Charlie and my... She meets all the Charlie's. It's a ceremony
00:01:45,00:01:49,every year. Are they like swans? They're like the UK swans. All the Charlie's belong to the Queen.
00:01:49,00:01:52,"He got a golden ticket and some chocolate. They let him meet the Queen, didn't they?"
00:01:52,00:01:58,Yeah. I said that the wrong way round because my dad for his job met the... My parents met her
00:01:58,00:02:02,and my mum was holding my brother Charlie as a baby at the time and the Queen said to my mum
00:02:02,00:02:08,"what's he called and she said Charlie and the Queen said, ""Oh, I've got a little Charlie as well."""
00:02:08,00:02:12,"Wow, that's awesome. Which is weird because he would have been about 30 at that point."
00:02:12,00:02:21,"Okay, so, no, but that's a no. James? Well, I think I have seen her. It's kind of... I was very"
00:02:21,00:02:26,"young when it happened. I think when... When I was 10 years old, she came to Bolton, right?"
00:02:26,00:02:33,Okay. To celebrate Bolton's 150th birthday and I think I stood on the street and saw her go past
00:02:33,00:02:39,and I looked on the Bolton Even News website to see what happened and they said that everyone
00:02:39,00:02:43,"from age nine to 11 was given the morning off to go and see the Queen and I would have been 10,"
00:02:43,00:02:49,"so that makes sense. But I asked my mum and she didn't remember it at all and I'm like,"
00:02:49,00:02:52,"""Yeah, but mum, I have kind of a memory and it's in the Bolton Even News that we were there,"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"so, Charlie, it must have happened."" And she said, ""Well, I had three young children and a full-time"
00:02:56,00:03:02,"job, so how the hell am I supposed to remember stuff like that?"" But I think I might have done."
00:03:02,00:03:08,"Put you down as a half. Yeah. Okay. I'm a yes. Oh, yeah. Consec? Because she was visiting the"
00:03:08,00:03:15,"university I was at and she walked past, but no face time with her, no personal contact."
00:03:16,00:03:23,"But I've also asked Ann Miller and Alex Bell, the other regulars, and they have both seen"
00:03:23,00:03:28,"the Queen, Ann was a child and Alex was, I think, an ascot or something and saw a yellow blur"
00:03:28,00:03:34,"in the distance, which he claims was the Queen. Was she on a horse, a yellow blur?"
00:03:34,00:03:39,"Yeah, she came in third. She did really well. But that's, how many is that? That's one, two,"
00:03:39,00:03:44,"and a half with James. I think I'm a one, Andy. I really do think, honestly, I think I've seen her."
00:03:44,00:03:48,So that's five out of six. Am I one and a half because I've touched her?
00:03:48,00:03:51,"Am I in a different category? You're not allowed to, Dan. That's the main thing."
00:03:51,00:03:54,What are you talking about? You're not allowed to touch the Queen.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"Of course you are. No, you're not. Well, she touched me. She touched me. Oh, that's completely different."
00:03:57,00:03:59,You're rather...
00:03:59,00:04:06,But that's one of the main rules. There's no touching.
00:04:06,00:04:10,"But there aren't really any rules, right? It's just kind of etiquette. In fact, on the Royal"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"Family website, I think maybe they're trying to play it cool, but they strictly say they're"
00:04:14,00:04:18,in no obligatory codes of behaviour at all when you beat the Queen. You can pull your trousers
00:04:18,00:04:24,"down if you like. You will be shocked. Dan, you actually did pull your pants down, didn't you?"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"And said, ""Hey, I've got a little Charlie of my own."" Oh, no."
00:04:28,00:04:35,"Oh, next week's episode coming to you live from the Tower of London."
00:04:35,00:04:41,"It is nerve-wracking, though, all the protocols. So I met her at Buckingham Palace. It was part of"
00:04:41,00:04:46,"a party in celebration of her heading to Australia, and I got sent an invitation,"
00:04:46,00:04:52,"as supposedly a notable Australian, which is so bizarre. And you get with the invitation,"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"you get this extraordinary list of protocol of how you approach the Queen if you meet her,"
00:04:57,00:05:01,"what to say, how to use Mam the first time, and then Her Majesty. I've got the order"
00:05:01,00:05:05,"wrong in that, but it's stuff like that. Sorry, you've also got the pronunciation wrong,"
00:05:05,00:05:09,according to the Royal Family official website. They're very strict. Is it Mam?
00:05:09,00:05:14,"It's Mam. It's the only bit of protocol, they say, is a rule addressed as Mam as in Jam."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"Well, she's from the Northeast, isn't she? So she always calls herself Mam."
00:05:17,00:05:22,"It's never Mum. It's always Mam. But sorry, Dan, go on."
00:05:22,00:05:25,"No, I'm just saying, with all that playing in your head, it's a very nerve-wracking"
00:05:25,00:05:30,experience. You find it very hard to be present in the moment when you're meeting the Queen
00:05:30,00:05:34,"and shaking her hand. Philip, less so, because you're just waiting for him to say something"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"a bit routine, which I was hoping for. He must have been in his element with all those Australians."
00:05:38,00:05:42,"Yeah, exactly. He just had to bite his tongue. He genuinely, when I shook hands with him,"
00:05:42,00:05:46,"he kind of lent in as if he was going to say something and just went, ""Ah, not worth it."""
00:05:46,00:05:49,"This little shake of his head just went, ""Ah, I don't need this today."""
00:05:49,00:05:55,"But he didn't say, ""Not worth it."" His eyes said that."
00:05:55,00:05:58,"No, but you could tell with his look. His eyes said, ""Well, because I got in a fight later on"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"with one of his sons, Prince Edward, who came up."" Who won?"
00:06:02,00:06:07,"He did, because I was in his house. He kind of just sort of won it by default."
00:06:07,00:06:12,"He knows where the weapons are. Yeah. He doesn't like QI, by the way."
00:06:12,00:06:14,So he kind of insulted all of us. It's awkward.
00:06:14,00:06:18,"Yeah. He said, ""Oh, is it that pompous show with the pompous Stephen Frye who pretends to know"
00:06:18,00:06:20,"all these facts?"" Well, at least he has seen it. Yeah."
00:06:20,00:06:25,"Christ, I think the Royal Family wants to talk about pomposity."
00:06:25,00:06:30,"That's true. Stephen Frye never insisted on a gold carriage, not for the first three series,"
00:06:30,00:06:36,"anyway. So, Dan, you're not the only eminent Australian to have met the Queen."
00:06:36,00:06:40,"I mean, it would be insane if you were a part of the party."
00:06:40,00:06:45,"But this sort of ties in with the touching thing and the etiquette about not touching the Queen,"
00:06:45,00:06:49,"unless you're shaking hands with her or whatever. But she visited Australia in 1992,"
00:06:49,00:06:53,"which I guess was the time before Dan, your garden party with her."
00:06:53,00:06:56,"But the PM at the time, Paul Keating, he put his arm around her,"
00:06:56,00:07:04,"not in a kind of cinema-yorn stretch way, but he sort of just put his hand on the small of her"
00:07:04,00:07:10,"back. And the British papers called him the Lizard of Oz as a result. Yeah. One newspaper wrote,"
00:07:10,00:07:14,"""Mr Keating, in placing his hand in the centre of her back, was actually touching that little"
00:07:14,00:07:18,"fastener, which is the miniature linchpin of all women's femininity."""
00:07:18,00:07:24,What? Is that a thing? It is. And how did they get hold of that secret?
00:07:24,00:07:26,We were sworn to keep it under wraps.
00:07:26,00:07:30,"But the Queen, actually, it's not a linchpin. It's one of those strings that you pull out."
00:07:30,00:07:35,"When you pull it out, she goes, ""How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? How do you do?"""
00:07:35,00:07:40,I think it's implying that he was trying to unhook her bra.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"Is it the minute? It says the minute little fastener,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,which is the miniature linchpin of all women's...
00:07:44,00:07:46,Not lower back.
00:07:46,00:07:50,"Oh, no, it wasn't. Sorry, it was just a medium back."
00:07:50,00:07:54,You don't... bras don't descend down your torso as the oppressors do.
00:07:54,00:07:57,It's not like elderly women have got their bras around their waist.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"You know what? We're learning a lot here today, aren't we?"
00:08:00,00:08:01,This is... Yeah.
00:08:01,00:08:03,Real lesson for the lads.
00:08:03,00:08:06,"But you shrink when you're older, so your back gets smaller, doesn't it?"
00:08:06,00:08:09,"It just gets closer... Your shoulders get closer to your bum, naturally."
00:08:09,00:08:11,I guess.
00:08:11,00:08:19,"This thing about one-third of Britain's having seen the Queen was part of a survey by Yougoth,"
00:08:19,00:08:23,wasn't it? And so I looked at some of the other things in that survey.
00:08:23,00:08:28,And so 22% of people have seen Prince Philip. So that's one in five-ish.
00:08:29,00:08:32,The next most commonly seen is Princess Anne on 17%.
00:08:32,00:08:35,Only 1% have seen Meghan Markle.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"She was the least, but she's not been going for as long as she..."
00:08:38,00:08:39,"No, that's true."
00:08:39,00:08:40,She's a new character.
00:08:40,00:08:46,"Prince Harry was the same. It's 3% of 65-year-olds and over have seen him,"
00:08:46,00:08:49,and only 5% of 18 to 24-year-olds.
00:08:49,00:08:51,And it's just because the Queen has been going for so long
00:08:51,00:08:54,and has been doing so many visits all over the place.
00:08:54,00:08:58,"So for people over the age of 65, 49% have either seen or met her,"
00:08:58,00:09:00,which I just find insane.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"Well, it's true. It's like when she came to Bolton,"
00:09:02,00:09:07,"it was just to get her numbers up, really, because she got all the kids along the street,"
00:09:07,00:09:13,"and she's like, ""Well, this is another 200,000 people that can access the list."""
00:09:13,00:09:15,She's playing a long Pokemon game with all of us.
00:09:15,00:09:17,We are the Pokemon.
00:09:17,00:09:19,"It's Pokemon Comuna, isn't it?"
00:09:19,00:09:24,"She's got a list of all the Comunas in the country, and she's just taking them all off."
00:09:24,00:09:28,"The list of people that she's met, I read that she has met over a quarter"
00:09:28,00:09:29,of all the US presidents ever.
00:09:29,00:09:32,She's met something close to it.
00:09:32,00:09:36,"Yeah, she's met something close to 30% of all the presidents that America has ever had."
00:09:36,00:09:37,That is insane.
00:09:37,00:09:43,That is breaking news for me.
00:09:43,00:09:49,"I was trying to find the most famous person the Queen hasn't met,"
00:09:49,00:09:54,"and so I went on to Google and searched for who's the most famous person in the world,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"and then went down the list to see,"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"and Google has the Queen met this person, has the Queen met this person."
00:09:59,00:10:03,"Well, I didn't have to go that far, because as far as I can see, she hasn't met Justin Bieber."
00:10:03,00:10:07,And Google thinks that he's one of the most famous people in the world.
00:10:07,00:10:09,"They've never been seen in the same room at the same time, have they?"
00:10:09,00:10:14,"Well, you see, Justin Bieber is another person whose shoulders are quite close to his bum,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,"isn't he, because he's a very small man."
00:10:17,00:10:20,"Because I was reading about people who have met Justin Bieber,"
00:10:20,00:10:24,"and Freddie Flintoff, a cricketer who is an extremely tall guy,"
00:10:24,00:10:27,"he went to meet him, he got a meet and greet with his kids and his wife,"
00:10:27,00:10:30,"and they went down the queue and they got to the front,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"and the kids got to see Justin Bieber,"
00:10:32,00:10:35,"but the Justin Bieber staff wouldn't let Freddie Flintoff go anywhere near him,"
00:10:35,00:10:38,and they said he doesn't like big guys.
00:10:38,00:10:42,"Because if you have Freddie, who's like six, four, six, five, something like that,"
00:10:42,00:10:46,"standing next to Justin Bieber, he's going to look like a little tiny bloke."
00:10:46,00:10:50,"Yeah, it's like why he only hangs out with Tom Cruise and people like that, Justin Bieber."
00:10:50,00:10:53,"Yeah, yeah, also Justin Bieber is why he wears his trousers so low,"
00:10:53,00:10:57,"is because he's trying to make it look like a distance from his shoulders to his bum,"
00:10:57,00:10:58,is greater than it actually is.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"There are only a few inches apart, actually."
00:11:01,00:11:08,The Royal Family have banned commoners from wearing their official tartan.
00:11:08,00:11:13,"Can you believe this? Prince Albert designed the tartan for the family, for the firm,"
00:11:13,00:11:17,"in 1853, and then several decades later in 1937,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,"there was a tartan manufacturer who wrote to them saying,"
00:11:19,00:11:22,"""Oh, this is a lovely tartan and we'd love to make it."""
00:11:22,00:11:24,"And the keeper of the previous purse wrote back saying,"
00:11:24,00:11:27,"""Absolutely not. You may not make this as exclusively for the royal use."""
00:11:27,00:11:29,"Anyway, you would think that was in 1937."
00:11:29,00:11:31,Things might have changed a bit since then.
00:11:31,00:11:35,"In 2016, the palace confirmed that this remains in place."
00:11:35,00:11:39,"There is one person in the world who is not a member of the Royal Family,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,who is allowed to wear the tartan.
00:11:41,00:11:41,Can we guess?
00:11:41,00:11:43,It's guessable as well.
00:11:43,00:11:44,It's definitely guessable.
00:11:44,00:11:45,Nicola Sturgeon.
00:11:45,00:11:47,It's not Nicola Sturgeon.
00:11:47,00:11:51,"Is it one of the crankies, if any of us are still alive?"
00:11:51,00:11:52,It's Jimmy Cranky.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"No, it's not."
00:11:53,00:11:55,Is it the person who tries on stuff for the queen?
00:11:55,00:11:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"No, brilliant guess."
00:11:58,00:12:02,Is it the winner of the caber toss in every year's Highland Games?
00:12:02,00:12:04,"It's another lovely, lovely guess."
00:12:04,00:12:05,"It's not, it's a bit further away."
00:12:05,00:12:07,"That would be a great prize, wouldn't it?"
00:12:07,00:12:08,Is it someone Scottish?
00:12:08,00:12:10,Does it have to be someone Scottish in this?
00:12:10,00:12:13,It's someone who is almost certainly going to be Scottish due to their job.
00:12:14,00:12:18,It's someone who might be wearing tartan as a matter of course.
00:12:18,00:12:20,The person who paints the fourth rail bridge.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"No, it's not that."
00:12:22,00:12:25,"It's the backpiper on Princess Street,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,who annoys everyone every morning during the festival.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"You were so, you know what?"
00:12:29,00:12:32,"I think just to end this torture competition, I'm going to say yes."
00:12:32,00:12:36,"It's her alarm clock, her backpiping alarm clock man."
00:12:36,00:12:39,"Her backpiping alarm clock man as the official role is, yes."
00:12:39,00:12:41,Wow.
00:12:41,00:12:42,I know.
00:12:42,00:12:43,That's another incredibly long-lasting thing.
00:12:43,00:12:46,"There have only been 15 royal backpipers since 1843,"
00:12:46,00:12:50,"and they have to play for her every weekday morning,"
00:12:50,00:12:51,not every morning of the week.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"She's not a masochist, for 15 minutes they play."
00:12:53,00:12:58,And apparently she doesn't ever want to hear the same tune twice.
00:12:58,00:13:02,So it's a nightmare because there was one called Gordon Webster
00:13:02,00:13:05,who said he had to know about seven or 800 different tunes.
00:13:05,00:13:07,"They must be, yeah, but they must be running out by now."
00:13:07,00:13:09,Like how long has she been queen?
00:13:09,00:13:10,"60 years, what is it?"
00:13:10,00:13:11,Something like that.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"And then every morning, apart from the weekends,"
00:13:14,00:13:15,she's had a different tune.
00:13:15,00:13:18,"They must be getting, they must be kind of getting down to the,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,"""All right, I'm going to do the killers today."""
00:13:20,00:13:22,And she had that one.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"Well, she's had Mr Brightside, but she hasn't."
00:13:24,00:13:30,That's a cool way to inform her of like the latest charts.
00:13:30,00:13:33,You just start playing the latest Ariana Grande.
00:13:33,00:13:36,I don't know if she needs to be informed with the latest charts.
00:13:36,00:13:38,Is that something that she demands?
00:13:39,00:13:41,"Well, maybe, you know, when she meets Bieber one day,"
00:13:41,00:13:42,"she can say, ""Love yourself."""
00:13:42,00:13:47,Can I do one more guessing game?
00:13:47,00:13:48,Because Andy's one went so loud.
00:13:48,00:13:53,"According to Ben Shart, who I think we all kind of trust,"
00:13:53,00:13:57,"writing in the spectator, a brilliant sort of collector of trivia,"
00:13:57,00:14:01,who do you think is the most seen human ever to have lived?
00:14:01,00:14:04,As in the person that most people have seen in real life.
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Oh, wow."
00:14:05,00:14:10,"So someone who's done huge events and rallies and things like that,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,is it Donald Trump?
00:14:13,00:14:15,Nope.
00:14:15,00:14:19,"Is it a politician from a really popular country, like Xi Jinping?"
00:14:19,00:14:20,"Oh, good call."
00:14:20,00:14:21,Narendra Modi.
00:14:21,00:14:23,"Oh, is it Dalai Lama?"
00:14:23,00:14:25,Ben Shart thinks none of those.
00:14:25,00:14:28,Ben Shart thinks it is probably Mick Jagger.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"And that's because he's been going for so long,"
00:14:32,00:14:36,"so long at playing in front of massive, massive audiences,"
00:14:36,00:14:38,"non-stop and non-stop and non-stop, and out of all the..."
00:14:38,00:14:40,Is he from the Rolling Stones?
00:14:40,00:14:41,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:14:41,00:14:43,Of all the Rolling Stones.
00:14:43,00:14:46,He does most of it.
00:14:46,00:14:46,Sorry.
00:14:46,00:14:49,What a slam on the most seen man on earth.
00:14:49,00:14:52,You don't deserve this fact.
00:14:52,00:14:54,You don't deserve to be saying this fact.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"Oh, my God."
00:14:55,00:14:56,Hang on.
00:14:56,00:14:59,Can we just do a little straw poll among us?
00:14:59,00:15:00,Who's seen...
00:15:00,00:15:00,We know James has it.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Who knows who he is?
00:15:02,00:15:03,I might have done for all I know.
00:15:03,00:15:08,"I don't think I have seen the Rolling Stones at any stage,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"any of them, I don't think."
00:15:10,00:15:10,I've seen Jagger.
00:15:10,00:15:12,I've seen all of them because I went to a gig once.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Me too.
00:15:13,00:15:14,I've not.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"Dan, no."
00:15:15,00:15:15,No.
00:15:15,00:15:15,Surprising.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"No, very surprising."
00:15:16,00:15:18,So the Queen in our little straw poll.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"Can you ask Alex Bell at Dan Miller as well, please, Andy?"
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Yeah, I'll draw him a text."
00:15:22,00:15:26,"Yeah, Jagger was on the horse behind the Queen."
00:15:26,00:15:30,"Oh, that's such a good answer."
00:15:30,00:15:31,"While we're just talking of rock stars,"
00:15:31,00:15:34,"I've been reading Elton John's autobiography called Me,"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"which is unbelievably good, very scandalous."
00:15:37,00:15:40,And he meets with the Queen quite a few times in the book.
00:15:40,00:15:42,And he tells a story in it where he was at a party
00:15:42,00:15:46,and he saw the Queen approaching a man called Viscount Lindley.
00:15:46,00:15:51,And she asked him to look on after his sister
00:15:51,00:15:53,who'd been taken ill and retired to her room.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"So he said, ""Go and look after her."""
00:15:55,00:15:57,And he kept just partying.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"And so once he was fobbing the Queen off too many times,"
00:16:00,00:16:03,"she went up to them, and this is what Elton John saw."
00:16:03,00:16:04,You know that thing of saying a single word
00:16:04,00:16:07,and slapping a cheek of someone back and forth
00:16:07,00:16:09,in between the words that you see in movies?
00:16:09,00:16:12,She says that the Queen went up to Viscount Lindley
00:16:12,00:16:16,"and went, ""Don't slap, argue with me."
00:16:16,00:16:17,"I am the Queen."""
00:16:17,00:16:21,And then he went off to look after the daughter.
00:16:21,00:16:24,And then Elton says the Queen then turned to Elton.
00:16:24,00:16:27,She stared at him and gave a little wink and walked off.
00:16:27,00:16:30,That's what he says.
00:16:30,00:16:31,"I mean, it might have happened."
00:16:31,00:16:33,It's in the book.
00:16:33,00:16:35,He's Elton John's a fantasist.
00:16:35,00:16:39,I'm not sure he is.
00:16:39,00:16:40,I think he tells the truth.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Is that... I mean, can that have happened?"
00:16:43,00:16:44,"No, because it's..."
00:16:44,00:16:47,"No, I do remember actually in Prince's biography,"
00:16:47,00:16:51,he says that he saw the Queen slamming Prince Edward's head
00:16:51,00:16:53,in the fridge door repeatedly.
00:16:53,00:16:55,Because he said he didn't like QI.
00:16:55,00:16:58,"She said, ""You should watch QI. It's very funny."""
00:16:58,00:17:08,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:17:08,00:17:11,"My fact this week is that in 1714,"
00:17:11,00:17:15,"when a Dutch ship ran out of ammunition 14 hours into a battle,"
00:17:15,00:17:18,the captain sent a boat over to the enemy asking to borrow
00:17:18,00:17:21,some gunpowder and cannonballs so they could continue the fight.
00:17:22,00:17:24,And did they give them the cannonballs?
00:17:24,00:17:25,No.
00:17:25,00:17:29,Can we borrow them as quite good?
00:17:29,00:17:30,We'll give them back.
00:17:30,00:17:38,"Yeah, no, I think it was seen as a sort of a bit of a cheeky surrender,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,"really, because the captains actually,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"I don't know if it was the humour of it,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,"ended up having a drink and toasting each other,"
00:17:45,00:17:48,"sending some compliments very nicely for it, well done,"
00:17:48,00:17:50,and then off they went on their ways.
00:17:51,00:17:54,So neither ship was sunk in the end and neither was captured.
00:17:54,00:17:56,So quite a good ending.
00:17:56,00:18:02,"So yeah, so this is a story to do more with the captain,"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"whose name was Peter Janssen Vessel, otherwise known as Tordenschild,"
00:18:06,00:18:11,"and he was a Dano-Norwegian nobleman who was,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,he's very famous in sort of the history now of Denmark.
00:18:14,00:18:17,"There's statues of him in Copenhagen,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,"the most popular brand of matches, has his image on it."
00:18:20,00:18:23,"He's mentioned in the Royal National Anthem,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,"he was sort of a big character at the time,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,but this was quite an infamous incident
00:18:27,00:18:28,in what was known as the Great Northern War.
00:18:28,00:18:32,"He was captaining this Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy ship,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"and he ran into what they thought was a British ship,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,"but was actually Swedish,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,and it was a much bigger ship than what he had.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"He never should have engaged in a fight with it,"
00:18:42,00:18:43,"in a battle with it,"
00:18:43,00:18:45,and so he was reprimanded when he got back
00:18:45,00:18:46,"for having done that,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,for risking everyone's life and the ship itself.
00:18:49,00:18:50,"So that he survived,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,but it kind of didn't work out for him for a while.
00:18:52,00:18:55,"Well, although he fought his case"
00:18:55,00:18:56,"and won it in the end, didn't he?"
00:18:56,00:18:58,He was such a brazen man
00:18:58,00:19:01,that it seemed like he just always got away with the stuff.
00:19:01,00:19:03,"He seemed to be always doing things like this,"
00:19:03,00:19:04,"and yeah, like you say, he was reprimanded,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"he was court-martialed,"
00:19:06,00:19:10,and he managed to find an obscure piece of naval law
00:19:10,00:19:11,"which got him off,"
00:19:11,00:19:14,"so he was court-martialed because he persisted much too long,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,but then he found a bit of law that said
00:19:16,00:19:19,"that you have to pursue any ship that's fleeing you,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,"and got off scot-free and was immediately promoted,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,and he was constantly promoted in his life.
00:19:24,00:19:25,"But it was weird, this battle,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"because one of the reasons he was lucky,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,"I guess, was because he was quite,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"I guess he cheated,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"so he often went in disguise as another country,"
00:19:33,00:19:36,so in this battle it would have looked to the outsider
00:19:36,00:19:39,"like it was a Dutch ship fighting a British ship,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,"because like you said, he thought it was the British"
00:19:40,00:19:44,because the Swedes had sent a ship to Britain
00:19:44,00:19:46,to have the Brits fit it out
00:19:46,00:19:48,"with, you know, some good gear,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,"and the Brits were sending their ship back at the time,"
00:19:50,00:19:51,so it looked like it was British
00:19:51,00:19:53,"because it was covered in British regalia,"
00:19:53,00:19:56,and then he himself disguised his ship as a Dutch ship
00:19:56,00:19:58,so that he could sneak up on the enemy
00:19:58,00:20:00,without them realising that he was the enemy.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"So it looked like a Dutch ship and a British ship,"
00:20:02,00:20:04,but it was actually a Dano-Norwegian and a Swedish ship.
00:20:04,00:20:05,That's correct.
00:20:05,00:20:08,It's unbelievable that anyone got anything done in this time.
00:20:08,00:20:10,But what was the difference?
00:20:10,00:20:11,Is it like the flag?
00:20:11,00:20:13,"I guess it's the flag that they're carrying, is it?"
00:20:13,00:20:15,"I think it's mostly flags, yeah."
00:20:15,00:20:18,It's not that everyone on board was like with a cup of tea
00:20:18,00:20:20,and a bowl of hats and stuff and a monocle.
00:20:20,00:20:25,There's Union Jack suits that had to do.
00:20:25,00:20:28,"He died aged about 30, didn't he?"
00:20:28,00:20:29,"He was incredibly young when he died,"
00:20:29,00:20:33,and he died in a duel with a Swedish count
00:20:33,00:20:36,who was over a disagreement about cards.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"It feels like he could have,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,it feels like whatever war it was could have gone the other way.
00:20:40,00:20:42,What did he say? It was Great Northern War.
00:20:42,00:20:42,Great Northern War.
00:20:42,00:20:43,"Well, it's like what Anna says."
00:20:43,00:20:45,He was just incredibly brazen.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"And what happens is you get promoted to captain,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,"then you get promoted to the next thing,"
00:20:49,00:20:50,"then you get promoted to the next thing,"
00:20:50,00:20:53,but eventually your luck runs out and you get killed in a duel.
00:20:53,00:20:56,"But what happened was he was in this duel with this proper,"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"what was he, captain or something like that, colonel."
00:21:00,00:21:03,And the colonel was fully kitted out
00:21:03,00:21:05,"with proper war-like equipment,"
00:21:05,00:21:07,like proper swords and armor and stuff like that.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"Whereas all he had was his ceremonial sword,"
00:21:10,00:21:13,which was like might as well have been made out of plastic
00:21:13,00:21:14,"and come to a fashion price,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,because it didn't really work very well.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"And so as soon as he got in the duel, he had no chance."
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Oh, no."
00:21:19,00:21:20,Yeah.
00:21:20,00:21:20,Yeah.
00:21:20,00:21:23,"His name was given to him quite,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,it was after even this incident
00:21:25,00:21:27,where he asked to borrow some ammunition.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"1716, he was given it."
00:21:29,00:21:33,"And Tordenskild translates as shield of thunder,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,like thunder shield.
00:21:34,00:21:36,Such a such an awesome nickname to have.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"But yeah, it's interesting that that's what he's known as now."
00:21:39,00:21:41,"And it almost has been put as his unofficial,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,"or rather look seemingly official surname,"
00:21:44,00:21:45,even the vessel.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"Well, it was his official title, I think,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,when he was knighted.
00:21:48,00:21:49,That's what they knighted him as.
00:21:49,00:21:51,"Tordenskild shield of thunder,"
00:21:51,00:21:52,which would actually be a really useful shield
00:21:52,00:21:53,if it was made of thunder.
00:21:53,00:21:56,Doesn't work at all.
00:21:56,00:22:00,But you'd only hear him coming like five seconds
00:22:00,00:22:01,after he'd already attacked you.
00:22:01,00:22:04,That's true.
00:22:04,00:22:04,It's a good point.
00:22:04,00:22:08,"Hey, you know the brand of matches you mentioned"
00:22:08,00:22:09,"at the start, Dan?"
00:22:09,00:22:10,Yeah.
00:22:10,00:22:11,That are named after him.
00:22:11,00:22:14,"And they were named after him in 1882,"
00:22:14,00:22:16,when they were founded.
00:22:16,00:22:19,And it was because Sweden had a monopoly on matchmaking
00:22:19,00:22:20,and match exports.
00:22:20,00:22:23,And so the free catchphrase of these matches
00:22:23,00:22:26,was you can use these to once again strike at the Swedish.
00:22:26,00:22:28,The idea was to take down their monopoly.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Yeah.
00:22:29,00:22:31,And they were bought by a Swedish company in 1972.
00:22:31,00:22:35,"In your face, Tordenskild."
00:22:36,00:22:40,So Tordenskild won this war in the end or his side won it.
00:22:40,00:22:42,And it kind of stopped the Swedes from being
00:22:42,00:22:46,like an absolute massive country.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"So at that time, Sweden was huge."
00:22:48,00:22:52,Like they were in charge of most of like Northern Europe.
00:22:52,00:22:57,They even had a colony in North America at the time.
00:22:57,00:22:58,They were kind of spreading out.
00:22:58,00:23:03,And then it was kind of the Russians and the Dano-Norwegians.
00:23:03,00:23:05,And the British were on both sides at various times
00:23:05,00:23:08,"of this conflict, but it was basically the Russians"
00:23:08,00:23:10,who wanted to stop the Swedish from being massive.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"And then when the Swedish lost, that was kind of the rise"
00:23:12,00:23:14,of Russia and Peter the Great and stuff like that.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"But what I found really interesting is in this war,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,there was quite a lot.
00:23:19,00:23:21,I think there are three or four examples of women
00:23:21,00:23:25,who fought on the Swedish side who were dressed as men
00:23:25,00:23:30,and who no one realized until either they got caught
00:23:30,00:23:32,or after the war and stuff like that.
00:23:32,00:23:35,There was one called Elizabeth Olstotter
00:23:35,00:23:38,who was actually executed afterwards on the charges
00:23:38,00:23:41,of having dressed as a man and serving as a soldier.
00:23:41,00:23:45,There was another one called Ulrika Stahlhammer
00:23:45,00:23:48,who was let off because she did such good work for the army.
00:23:48,00:23:50,So they caught her and they arrested her and stuff.
00:23:50,00:23:53,"And she got married to a woman, but they arrested her"
00:23:53,00:23:54,and she got off.
00:23:54,00:23:55,But there was...
00:23:55,00:23:58,"Sorry, James, did she get married to a woman"
00:23:58,00:23:59,with the woman thinking she was a man?
00:23:59,00:24:03,"Well, it's controversial, Dan, you see, because they got caught"
00:24:03,00:24:07,and it went to court and they said that the woman
00:24:07,00:24:10,didn't know anything and she only found out later on.
00:24:10,00:24:12,But we're not sure what happened there.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"But because this was happening, because it was really famous"
00:24:15,00:24:18,"that it was happening, it was used as an excuse"
00:24:18,00:24:21,by homosexual soldiers in the Swedish army
00:24:21,00:24:24,"because obviously that was illegal in Sweden as well,"
00:24:24,00:24:25,especially in the army.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"And whenever they got caught, they would say,"
00:24:27,00:24:30,"""Well, we'd heard all these stories about these women"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"pretending to be men, so we just assumed it was a woman."""
00:24:32,00:24:35,And apparently quite a lot of people got off
00:24:35,00:24:37,because they used that excuse.
00:24:37,00:24:39,That is so slick.
00:24:39,00:24:43,I just assumed that half the people on board this ship
00:24:43,00:24:46,were very realistically women dressed as men.
00:24:46,00:24:48,That's like...
00:24:48,00:24:53,Is it Hannah Snell who was the famous person
00:24:53,00:24:55,"around about the same time, the famous British women"
00:24:55,00:24:58,"who was in the Navy, who was in the Royal Marines, I think,"
00:24:58,00:25:02,"and she was shot in the groin at one point,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,which is really awkward if you're a woman pretending to be a man.
00:25:04,00:25:06,And so she had to extract the bullet
00:25:06,00:25:09,and deal with the word completely herself to keep it secret.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"And she was just like, ""Oh, wow, my balls!"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"My balls! Oh, they're so soft!"""
00:25:13,00:25:16,"I was going to say that would probably help with your secret,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"going, ""Oh, lobbed right off!"""
00:25:24,00:25:27,I was looking into other sort of bizarre moments
00:25:27,00:25:29,in naval wartime history.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"And just sticking with the Dutch for a second,"
00:25:32,00:25:37,"the capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder, this was in 1795."
00:25:37,00:25:41,And basically this was a battle between the Dutch and the French.
00:25:41,00:25:44,And the Dutch were on a boat that was on a body of water
00:25:44,00:25:47,that froze over while they were anchored.
00:25:47,00:25:50,And so the French had the ability to not even need a boat
00:25:50,00:25:52,or a ship to get to them.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"They went out on horseback with cavalry,"
00:25:55,00:25:58,and they fought a ship on horseback.
00:25:58,00:26:01,It was a battle between cannons and men on horses with swords.
00:26:01,00:26:04,And the French cavalry captured them.
00:26:04,00:26:06,"And it's extraordinary, the imagery."
00:26:06,00:26:08,I just want to see the paintings of that.
00:26:08,00:26:08,So good.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"Well, it's surely just by the cannons into the ice,"
00:26:11,00:26:12,"create massive holes,"
00:26:12,00:26:15,and the horse is going to fall right through them.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"See, that's clever."
00:26:16,00:26:16,Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"They needed my kind of leadership,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"because I think they just surrendered straight away, didn't they?"
00:26:20,00:26:21,"Yeah, they couldn't run away."
00:26:22,00:26:26,"You know, Iran owns a fake US aircraft carrier,"
00:26:26,00:26:29,which is exclusively for the purpose of them attacking it.
00:26:29,00:26:32,"But the great thing is, it's reusable."
00:26:32,00:26:35,"This year, they had their third ever attack on it,"
00:26:35,00:26:37,"where they symbolically sink it, basically."
00:26:37,00:26:39,"But unfortunately, this year, they tried it again,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,and it sank by itself.
00:26:41,00:26:43,"And it's now created a shipping hazard,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"blocking a really important naval port, so they can't get to it."
00:26:46,00:26:48,How is it reusable if you sink it?
00:26:48,00:26:50,Can you bring it back up again or not?
00:26:50,00:26:52,"OK, so this is a really tricky thing."
00:26:52,00:26:54,"I think they didn't properly bomb it,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,"as in when they do their displays,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,"they might fly helicopters at it,"
00:26:57,00:26:58,they might fire it at a bit.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"But they're quite careful to,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"I think, fire it above the water line or whatever,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,so they don't properly sink it.
00:27:04,00:27:07,"And this year, it clearly decided it had enough,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,because it just sank.
00:27:08,00:27:09,"And they don't have salvage ships,"
00:27:09,00:27:10,so they now can't get it up either.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"Well, that sounds like good news,"
00:27:12,00:27:13,"because it sounds like, based on that,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,they probably won't be actually attacking the US anytime soon.
00:27:16,00:27:17,What are you on about?
00:27:17,00:27:19,They now know exactly how to sink close these ships.
00:27:20,00:27:23,Just do what all we have to do is try not to sink it.
00:27:23,00:27:27,That's a good point.
00:27:27,00:27:31,Do you know how you sink an ancient Greek trirheam?
00:27:31,00:27:33,What's a trirheam?
00:27:33,00:27:34,Is that a boat?
00:27:34,00:27:36,"With three sets of arms, is it?"
00:27:36,00:27:36,"Yeah, exactly."
00:27:36,00:27:38,"Yeah, one of their boats."
00:27:38,00:27:42,"It sounds like the start of a joke, doesn't it?"
00:27:42,00:27:46,How do you sink a trirheam?
00:27:46,00:27:46,"Well, do you..."
00:27:46,00:27:49,"They've all got holes that they row through,"
00:27:49,00:27:50,so do you just have to tilt it a bit
00:27:50,00:27:53,so that the holes let the water enter?
00:27:53,00:27:54,That's clever.
00:27:54,00:27:55,That is clever.
00:27:55,00:27:57,"It's actually, that's how you don't sink it."
00:27:57,00:28:00,"So they would ram each other, right?"
00:28:00,00:28:01,"They all had toughen prowls,"
00:28:01,00:28:01,and they would ram each other
00:28:01,00:28:04,and try and sink each other that way.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"And the rams are often at the waterline,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"so if you hit them with the ram,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"that hole below the waterline,"
00:28:11,00:28:12,they're going to sink fast.
00:28:12,00:28:15,"So genuinely, if you were being attacked by another ship"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"and you can't get out of the way in time,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,what they would do is everyone on board
00:28:18,00:28:21,"would run to one side of the ship,"
00:28:21,00:28:23,which is about to be hit by the ram.
00:28:23,00:28:24,The ship tilts over into the water.
00:28:24,00:28:28,"Then when the ram hits, it's hitting a much higher bit."
00:28:28,00:28:30,"Then when you tilt back,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,it's hit somewhere that's above the waterline.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Exactly.
00:28:33,00:28:35,Isn't that insane as a defence tactic
00:28:35,00:28:37,to run towards the massive battering ram
00:28:37,00:28:38,that's about to hit your ship?
00:28:38,00:28:39,That's amazing.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"But if you've half tilted your ship one way,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,isn't the battering ram just being given
00:28:44,00:28:45,an easier job to flip you over entirely?
00:28:45,00:28:47,It's not aiming to flip you over.
00:28:48,00:28:49,It's not like a spatula.
00:28:49,00:28:51,You're not flipping a pancake.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"Now, this isn't robot wars."
00:28:53,00:28:58,"Just mean by accident, not intention."
00:28:58,00:29:00,"Yeah, if Sir Killalot is approaching you"
00:29:00,00:29:01,"with the battering ram, what are you…"
00:29:01,00:29:04,I don't think it would.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"If you're coming at that angle,"
00:29:05,00:29:06,I don't think the physics of that
00:29:06,00:29:08,wouldn't cause your boat to capsize.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"Largely speaking, boats are designed"
00:29:10,00:29:13,so that they don't flip over that easily.
00:29:13,00:29:14,"Yeah, true."
00:29:14,00:29:14,That's true.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"Well, although since…"
00:29:17,00:29:19,"I mean, although some boats have flipped over,"
00:29:19,00:29:20,we all know that.
00:29:20,00:29:23,"But famously, we were talking about"
00:29:23,00:29:26,the Swedish Empire and what powerhouse it was.
00:29:26,00:29:28,And when it was this huge naval power
00:29:28,00:29:30,"in the 17th, early 18th centuries,"
00:29:30,00:29:31,"they thought to celebrate this,"
00:29:31,00:29:34,they built the world's best warship.
00:29:34,00:29:35,And this was 1628.
00:29:35,00:29:36,It was called the Vasa.
00:29:36,00:29:38,It was 68 metres long.
00:29:38,00:29:40,It was the most high-tech warship the world had ever known.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"It was painted in really stunning colours,"
00:29:42,00:29:45,scenes from the Swedish military victories
00:29:45,00:29:46,of history all over it.
00:29:46,00:29:49,And so thousands of people flocked to see it launch
00:29:49,00:29:52,from harbour and it set off.
00:29:52,00:29:57,"And 20 minutes later, it tipped over and sunk."
00:29:57,00:29:58,And they just built it too top-heavy
00:29:58,00:30:00,and it keeled right over.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Oh, my God."
00:30:01,00:30:02,It's an amazing story.
00:30:02,00:30:04,Is that the one they have in…
00:30:04,00:30:04,That they have in…
00:30:04,00:30:05,In Stockholm.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"In Stockholm, yeah."
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:07,00:30:08,I just heard about that.
00:30:08,00:30:09,They dredged it
00:30:09,00:30:11,and they have built an entire museum around it.
00:30:11,00:30:12,And you guys are not going to believe this.
00:30:12,00:30:14,Can you see the mug I'm drinking from?
00:30:15,00:30:16,It's got a ship on it.
00:30:16,00:30:18,That ship is the Vasa.
00:30:18,00:30:20,Look at the handle here.
00:30:20,00:30:21,It says Vasa.
00:30:21,00:30:22,How?
00:30:22,00:30:23,"We don't see it, Andy."
00:30:23,00:30:24,Did you go see it when we were there?
00:30:24,00:30:25,It's where I bought this mug.
00:30:25,00:30:26,You should have taken me.
00:30:26,00:30:26,I didn't know about it.
00:30:26,00:30:29,I was busy dancing with holograms of ABBA
00:30:29,00:30:30,at the ABBA Museum.
00:30:30,00:30:32,I'd much rather would have been there.
00:30:32,00:30:34,Some of us are doing long-range research
00:30:34,00:30:36,for an episode of the podcast in two years' time.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"Nice try, mate."
00:30:42,00:30:45,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:30:45,00:30:46,And that is Anna.
00:30:46,00:30:50,My fact this week is that vanilla farmers in Madagascar
00:30:50,00:30:54,stump their names on each individual pod on the vine.
00:30:54,00:30:58,That was very offensive.
00:30:58,00:30:58,That's incredible.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Yeah, it's like when you're at school,"
00:31:00,00:31:03,you have to have your name sewn into all your clothes.
00:31:03,00:31:04,It's the same kind of thing.
00:31:04,00:31:07,Except this is to stop gangs of robbers
00:31:07,00:31:08,from stealing your vanilla.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"No, that's why I have my name stitched into my clothes."
00:31:11,00:31:12,Of course.
00:31:12,00:31:13,To stop the gangs of robbers.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"You went to a pretty scary school didn't you, Eddie?"
00:31:15,00:31:17,"They're really sweet, the little stumps as well."
00:31:17,00:31:20,So this is because Madagascar
00:31:20,00:31:21,"is in the middle of a vanilla boom,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,or actually sort of coming out of a huge vanilla boom.
00:31:23,00:31:26,So it produces 80% of the world's vanilla
00:31:26,00:31:29,and price is just shot up a couple of years ago.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"And there are these vanilla gangs,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,these huge gangs and robbers at night who come
00:31:33,00:31:36,and they strip your vines completely bare
00:31:36,00:31:38,because it's going for so much money.
00:31:38,00:31:40,And so now the farmers literally put that
00:31:40,00:31:42,"either their name or sometimes their serial number,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,a specific serial number on an individual pot.
00:31:44,00:31:46,"So if you see it on eBay later, you could be like,"
00:31:46,00:31:49,"""Oh, that was stolen from my farm."""
00:31:49,00:31:54,"One of the problems is that once your vanilla pot is ripe,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"you kind of need to leave it for quite a long time, don't you?"
00:31:56,00:31:58,You need to leave it for quite a few months
00:31:58,00:32:00,to just get better and better and better.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"And the longer you leave it, the better it is."
00:32:02,00:32:03,But the thieves know this.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"So if they get there early, then they have something"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"which is still good enough to sell,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,but not quite as good enough
00:32:09,00:32:11,"that the farmer would like, it's a trade-off."
00:32:11,00:32:12,Do you wait till the end
00:32:12,00:32:14,so you get really high-quality product
00:32:14,00:32:17,or do you take it early so the thieves don't get it?
00:32:17,00:32:17,Yeah.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"Actually, that makes more sense of something I found out"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"because the government has now banned people,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,the farmers in Madagascar from picking vanilla too early
00:32:25,00:32:29,because they have to be shrink-wrapped
00:32:29,00:32:30,if they're picked early and that can make them moldy
00:32:30,00:32:33,"and it lowers the content of vanilla,"
00:32:33,00:32:34,which is the main flavor chemical.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"And they, in fact, you know how governments"
00:32:36,00:32:39,sometimes burn smuggled or illegal goods in public
00:32:39,00:32:42,"so they'll burn ivory, for example, to destroy the market."
00:32:42,00:32:44,They recently burned half a tonne
00:32:44,00:32:47,of prematurely picked vanilla pods in public
00:32:47,00:32:50,to kind of make an example about this law.
00:32:50,00:32:51,Do you think that would have smelled nice?
00:32:51,00:32:52,I bet it would.
00:32:52,00:32:52,"Ah, what does that mean?"
00:32:52,00:32:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:53,00:32:57,"Like an amazing scented candle, a giant scented candle."
00:32:57,00:33:01,"They ran a huge bath next to it,"
00:33:01,00:33:02,people just relaxing music.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"That's amazing. The prices have leapt up,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"but weirdly, it doesn't seem to have leapt up specifically"
00:33:11,00:33:11,for the growers.
00:33:11,00:33:13,There seems to be this middle group of people
00:33:13,00:33:16,"who distribute it, who are known as ""vanillionaires"""
00:33:16,00:33:20,and they're the ones that are sort of really reaping the money
00:33:20,00:33:22,and building up all these areas in Madagascar now
00:33:22,00:33:25,"from if you were living in a wooden, hutted house,"
00:33:25,00:33:26,they're now brick.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"Like, there's a big change going there as a result."
00:33:28,00:33:31,"Yeah, weirdly, the huge jump in prices"
00:33:31,00:33:33,doesn't seem to have made it back to the original producers.
00:33:33,00:33:34,Yeah.
00:33:34,00:33:35,What a surprise.
00:33:35,00:33:37,Unusual situation in this world we live.
00:33:37,00:33:41,"Yeah, they're trying to write that wrong, aren't they?"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"And actually, I read a very heartening article"
00:33:43,00:33:46,"in, I think it was in the FT, which was saying that"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"this is being clamped down on,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,and the reason it's being clamped down on
00:33:50,00:33:52,"is because buyers, as in us,"
00:33:52,00:33:55,are more discerning than they used to be.
00:33:55,00:33:59,So all the hipster sort of morally sound awareness
00:33:59,00:34:00,of where your goods have come from
00:34:00,00:34:02,means that there's a lot of pressure on big companies
00:34:02,00:34:04,like Mars to actually make sure that you're not exploiting
00:34:04,00:34:06,farms at the other end of the chain.
00:34:06,00:34:07,"And so what that means is, you know,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"the person who owns Mars goes to Madagascar,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"looks at farmers' situations, and tries to sort it out."
00:34:13,00:34:14,And I think there's a project called
00:34:14,00:34:15,"Livelihoods Out There Now,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,which is making sure that the money's making it back
00:34:18,00:34:20,to those original producers.
00:34:20,00:34:23,But some people really did profit from growing them as well.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"There was a woman called Lydia Sower,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,"who was interviewed in one article,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,"who said that her husband was a fisherman a few years ago,"
00:34:29,00:34:31,"and she wanted to plant vanilla,"
00:34:31,00:34:34,"and her husband said, ""No, absolutely not terrible idea."""
00:34:34,00:34:35,And she did it anyway.
00:34:35,00:34:37,And it's now worth about...
00:34:37,00:34:40,"She's got a tiny little garden with a few vanilla pods in it,"
00:34:40,00:34:44,"and it's worth about $8,000, which is massive, massive there."
00:34:44,00:34:46,"Although she was saying this very, very proudly"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"to a woman called Victoria Mars,"
00:34:48,00:34:52,"who was visiting and who does have an 8% stake in Mars,"
00:34:52,00:34:53,"which, as this person pointed out,"
00:34:53,00:34:57,is annual sales are three times the size of Madagascar's GDP.
00:34:57,00:34:58,"But so, you know, it probably didn't..."
00:34:58,00:35:01,"Her jaw didn't drop, but the sound was $8,000"
00:35:01,00:35:04,in the same way that this woman was hoping.
00:35:04,00:35:09,"You know how there are vanilla nerds, as you said, Dan, was it?"
00:35:09,00:35:12,"There are also, I don't think anyone's called them this,"
00:35:12,00:35:13,"""Vanigillantes."""
00:35:13,00:35:16,"""Vanilla vigilantes."""
00:35:16,00:35:17,It's the thing I'm trying to get.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"Because, as Anna was saying, it's so much there."
00:35:20,00:35:22,"So a few years ago, 15% of all the vanilla on the planet"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"was stolen, which is a hard..."
00:35:24,00:35:27,And some vanilla thieves would write ahead in advance.
00:35:27,00:35:28,That's how brazen they got.
00:35:28,00:35:29,"They would write a note saying,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"""We are coming tonight. Prepare what we want."""
00:35:31,00:35:35,"And that has actually led to quite a few deaths,"
00:35:35,00:35:36,"because when these people have been caught,"
00:35:36,00:35:40,there isn't enough sort of justice available on the ground.
00:35:40,00:35:42,So there are vanilla vigilantes now
00:35:42,00:35:44,who are catching and even killing the thieves.
00:35:44,00:35:45,That is brazen.
00:35:45,00:35:47,They sound like they've taken a few leaves
00:35:47,00:35:53,"out of Peter Skulden things, but Thorne Skulde's book."
00:35:53,00:35:57,"But can't you get round the poaching by, you know,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,just changing your name to the name that's on the pod?
00:35:59,00:36:03,"You know, the guy in your article's called Leon."
00:36:03,00:36:05,Couldn't I just arrive in town and change my name to Leon?
00:36:05,00:36:09,"Well, Anna also said, sometimes they put like codes and barcodes on."
00:36:09,00:36:12,You can't change your name to 731-964.
00:36:12,00:36:15,You could.
00:36:15,00:36:17,I bet there's a child of a celebrity who's called that right now.
00:36:17,00:36:20,"Yeah, Elon Musk is up to something."
00:36:20,00:36:21,You don't know what yet.
00:36:21,00:36:25,"And so vanilla grown, like you say,"
00:36:25,00:36:27,80% in Madagascar.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"But it's not originally from there, is it?"
00:36:29,00:36:34,It's originally from South America or South and Central America
00:36:34,00:36:35,"and North America, because Mexico,"
00:36:35,00:36:39,which is neither in South America nor in Central America.
00:36:39,00:36:40,It's in North America.
00:36:40,00:36:41,It's from Mexico.
00:36:41,00:36:43,It's vanilla's from Mexico.
00:36:43,00:36:47,"And it was invented by this woman called Princess Zanat,"
00:36:47,00:36:49,who probably didn't exist.
00:36:49,00:36:54,But she was Princess from the Tottenaco people.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"And she was Goddess, kind of, as well as being a princess."
00:36:58,00:37:01,She was forbidden by her father from marrying a mortal.
00:37:01,00:37:04,"And she ran away to the forest with her lover,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,and they were captured and beheaded.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"And where their blood hit the ground,"
00:37:07,00:37:10,that's where the first vanilla pods grow.
00:37:10,00:37:12,And that's where vanilla comes from.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"It was an arduous way to invent something, isn't it?"
00:37:14,00:37:19,"And then it got taken over to Madagascar,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,"more specifically, Reunion,"
00:37:21,00:37:24,which is where they learned how to grow it.
00:37:24,00:37:29,"And it didn't work for ages, because the pollen is inaccessible."
00:37:29,00:37:30,The flowers are insane.
00:37:30,00:37:33,They're fertile for 12 hours after they bloom.
00:37:33,00:37:35,"So if you're a vanilla farmer, there's big pressure."
00:37:35,00:37:37,"You can't just take the weekend off,"
00:37:37,00:37:38,assuming that it'll be all right when you get back.
00:37:38,00:37:41,"The flowers bloom for one day, yes, for this 12 hours."
00:37:41,00:37:44,"And in Mexico, obviously, there are insects"
00:37:44,00:37:47,which have evolved to fertilize the flowers.
00:37:47,00:37:49,Only one species of bee.
00:37:49,00:37:51,There's only one species of bee called a melipone.
00:37:51,00:37:51,Who can do it?
00:37:51,00:37:53,"Although, actually, they've recently done a study"
00:37:53,00:37:55,and they don't even think it's that.
00:37:55,00:37:55,Really?
00:37:55,00:37:58,They always thought it was this one melipone bee.
00:37:58,00:38:00,And they now can't...
00:38:00,00:38:03,I haven't actually got any evidence that this even pollinates it.
00:38:03,00:38:04,But it's not...
00:38:04,00:38:05,Something's pollinating it.
00:38:05,00:38:06,Something's pollinating it.
00:38:06,00:38:07,Something in Mexico.
00:38:07,00:38:08,That's all it comes.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"Yeah, so for years, they couldn't export it around the world"
00:38:10,00:38:13,because you don't have the bee or the hummingbird or whatever it is.
00:38:13,00:38:15,So the method is hand fertilizing.
00:38:15,00:38:17,You have to get in with a toothpick
00:38:17,00:38:20,"and rub the flowers, genitals together."
00:38:20,00:38:23,And that's what fertilizes it.
00:38:23,00:38:25,And that's what makes it produce the vanilla pods.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"And if you miss your window with a flower, you lose the pods."
00:38:28,00:38:29,Yeah.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"You're sort of trying to make it have sex with itself, aren't you?"
00:38:31,00:38:33,Against its will.
00:38:33,00:38:34,"Yeah, not against its will."
00:38:34,00:38:35,It's against its will.
00:38:35,00:38:36,The reason they're so hard to pollinate
00:38:36,00:38:38,is because they've got this lid
00:38:38,00:38:41,between the male and the female parts of the plant.
00:38:41,00:38:43,And the idea is that you don't really want to self- inseminate
00:38:43,00:38:45,"because, I guess, over many, many generations"
00:38:45,00:38:48,maybe that's bad for an organism.
00:38:48,00:38:49,And so it's against the plant's will
00:38:49,00:38:51,"that you lift the lid very, very carefully"
00:38:51,00:38:54,"and you dip into the answer, the female part,"
00:38:54,00:38:56,and you get the pollen out
00:38:56,00:38:58,and you smear it all over the male part.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Yeah.
00:38:59,00:39:00,This is definitely a side of the #MeToo movement.
00:39:00,00:39:02,I don't think any of us expected it.
00:39:02,00:39:06,So this was first discovered
00:39:06,00:39:10,by an enslaved man in Reunion called Edmund Albius.
00:39:10,00:39:15,And he basically had this guy who was his boss
00:39:15,00:39:19,and he was telling him how they make watermelons
00:39:19,00:39:21,but how they can't do it with vanilla pods.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"And so Edmund Albius decided,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,"""Well, okay, you say you can't, but let's have a go."""
00:39:26,00:39:28,"And he started messing around with it,"
00:39:28,00:39:29,messing around with it.
00:39:29,00:39:30,And he came up with this kind of technique
00:39:30,00:39:33,where you use a little stick or a blade of grass
00:39:33,00:39:35,"and you flip up this little cap,"
00:39:35,00:39:38,"which Anna was talking about called the Rustelum,"
00:39:38,00:39:41,"and you flip it up and then with kind of a flip of the thumb,"
00:39:41,00:39:44,you move some of the male and female parts together
00:39:44,00:39:45,and you smear them over each other
00:39:45,00:39:47,and that's how you pollinate them.
00:39:47,00:39:49,And that technique is still used today
00:39:50,00:39:51,in Reunion for sure.
00:39:51,00:39:53,"And I think actually in Madagascar,"
00:39:53,00:39:55,I think all over they use this exact same thing.
00:39:55,00:39:58,"And then he was given his freedom,"
00:39:58,00:40:02,but he really struggled afterwards
00:40:02,00:40:04,"and ended up dying in poverty,"
00:40:04,00:40:06,especially as there was a French guy
00:40:06,00:40:08,called Jean-Michel Claude Ricard
00:40:08,00:40:09,"who came over and said,"
00:40:09,00:40:12,"""Oh, this was my idea. I came up with this."""
00:40:12,00:40:13,And he went back to Paris
00:40:13,00:40:14,and he told everyone that he'd come up
00:40:14,00:40:17,with this way of creating vanilla in Reunion.
00:40:17,00:40:20,And everyone sort of faded him for being amazing
00:40:20,00:40:22,but then the former owner of Edmund Delbyards
00:40:22,00:40:24,"came to Paris as well and said,"
00:40:24,00:40:27,"""Mate, that's just not what happened."
00:40:27,00:40:30,"Like, it was this guy, Edmund Delbyards,"
00:40:30,00:40:32,"who went round and teaching everyone else how to do it."""
00:40:32,00:40:34,And he's like a hero in Reunion
00:40:34,00:40:36,and there's a statue of him quite near the airport
00:40:36,00:40:37,and he's really famous.
00:40:37,00:40:39,- What year was it? - It's a good lie to make up.
00:40:39,00:40:41,"- Yeah, but quite a Trumpian thing to do."
00:40:41,00:40:43,- It is. - Just sort of wander into a country
00:40:43,00:40:44,"and be like, ""I did that. That was me."""
00:40:44,00:40:47,"- You know that thing which is like 4,000 miles away"
00:40:47,00:40:49,which no one can prove who did it?
00:40:49,00:40:50,"- That was me, yeah."
00:40:50,00:40:52,(all laughing)
00:40:52,00:40:56,- The longest cake ever made was vanilla flavoured.
00:40:56,00:40:56,- What was it?
00:40:56,00:40:59,"- It was baked this year in South India in Kerala,"
00:40:59,00:41:01,state of Kerala and it was 10 centimetres wide
00:41:01,00:41:02,but how long was it?
00:41:02,00:41:06,- 10 centimetres wide is really thin.
00:41:06,00:41:08,- That doesn't help you at all
00:41:08,00:41:09,with knowing how long it is.
00:41:09,00:41:10,- It kind of feels like it.
00:41:10,00:41:13,- But can you tell us the air full area of the cake?
00:41:13,00:41:15,"- At the height, please."
00:41:15,00:41:17,"- Yeah, 2.4 kilometres."
00:41:18,00:41:19,Very strong offer.
00:41:19,00:41:22,- 20 kilometres.
00:41:22,00:41:23,- 20 kilometres.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"- No, that's ridiculous."
00:41:25,00:41:27,I'm 200 yards long.
00:41:27,00:41:28,"- Oh, shut up."
00:41:28,00:41:30,"And you said that it was in Kerala, not Kerala"
00:41:30,00:41:33,and down on Kerala.
00:41:33,00:41:38,- How long was it? Come on.
00:41:38,00:41:39,These interminable guessing games
00:41:39,00:41:41,are completely destroying the experience of our guests.
00:41:41,00:41:42,- It's true.
00:41:42,00:41:45,It was six and a half kilometres.
00:41:45,00:41:47,So James wins because he was close.
00:41:47,00:41:48,It wasn't 20 kilometres down.
00:41:48,00:41:49,- Where did they fit that?
00:41:49,00:41:50,"Because outdoors,"
00:41:50,00:41:52,you'd imagine you'd run into a lot of obstacles.
00:41:52,00:41:54,It's very rare you get a six and a half kilometre run.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- They did it in sections
00:41:55,00:41:57,and it goes up and down a lot.
00:41:57,00:41:58,It's a great deal.
00:41:58,00:42:00,- Hang on. So it's not one?
00:42:00,00:42:04,"- It's not one single cake that's 6,000 metres."
00:42:04,00:42:06,- You can't call that the longest cake.
00:42:06,00:42:08,- That's not the longest cake.
00:42:08,00:42:09,- The longest cake.
00:42:09,00:42:10,- The longest cake is every cake
00:42:10,00:42:13,that's been made on bake-up in the last 10 years.
00:42:13,00:42:15,They may not have to be collected.
00:42:16,00:42:18,- I'm so confused about what's happened here.
00:42:18,00:42:21,- You can clearly see in the photos of the cake
00:42:21,00:42:23,"that there are sections which slot into place,"
00:42:23,00:42:24,but I think they're joined.
00:42:24,00:42:25,They are all joined together.
00:42:25,00:42:27,It's like a big cake snake.
00:42:27,00:42:30,"It weighed 27,000 kilos."
00:42:30,00:42:32,"And as I say, it was vanilla-favourite."
00:42:32,00:42:33,"Hence me, Metronica."
00:42:33,00:42:37,"- So one of the best books about vanilla,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,"I would say the best book,"
00:42:38,00:42:41,"is called ""Travels in Search of the Vanilla Orchid"" by Tim."
00:42:41,00:42:43,"- Sorry, James. Are you claiming to have read"
00:42:43,00:42:44,all the books about vanilla?
00:42:45,00:42:47,Because it sounds a bit like you are.
00:42:47,00:42:48,And then you've ranked them all.
00:42:48,00:42:50,- It's a small field.
00:42:50,00:42:51,It's a very small field.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"- And they're actually all,"
00:42:53,00:42:54,"if you press them up against each other,"
00:42:54,00:42:56,they just make one long book.
00:42:56,00:42:56,- It's just one month.
00:42:56,00:43:03,"- Tim Eckhart, who Andy and I at least know,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,he wrote the book about vanilla.
00:43:05,00:43:06,And it is awesome.
00:43:06,00:43:08,There's lots of stuff about the history of vanilla in there.
00:43:08,00:43:09,"When it came to Europe,"
00:43:09,00:43:11,one of the reasons this guy was showing off about it
00:43:11,00:43:14,is because it was an absolute amazing thing.
00:43:14,00:43:20,So Louis the 15th would have soup made of vanilla.
00:43:20,00:43:21,"Francisco Hernandez,"
00:43:21,00:43:23,"who was a physician to Philip II of Spain,"
00:43:23,00:43:26,"he said that vanilla could soothe the stomach,"
00:43:26,00:43:27,"cure the bite of a venomous snake,"
00:43:27,00:43:31,reduce flatulence and cause the urine to flow admirably.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"- So if you've just, if you've got a bad stomach"
00:43:34,00:43:36,"and you've just farted really loudly,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"attracting the attention of a snake,"
00:43:38,00:43:41,which has then bitten you and you need a piss.
00:43:41,00:43:43,"- No, and your friend has been stung by a jellyfish."
00:43:43,00:43:45,So you need to urinate on them.
00:43:45,00:43:47,- Just one?
00:43:47,00:43:49,- One vanilla part will do that.
00:43:49,00:43:50,"- Just one weird trick, yeah."
00:43:50,00:43:53,"- Also, according to Bizarre Zimmerman,"
00:43:53,00:43:56,"who's a German physician from the 18th century,"
00:43:56,00:44:02,he says that vanilla cured no fewer than 342 impotent men.
00:44:02,00:44:07,So they drank vanilla and it made them able to have sex again.
00:44:07,00:44:10,"So if you were, if you'd farted really loudly"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"because of your bad stomach and a snake came along,"
00:44:13,00:44:18,and a very beautiful person of the sex that you're attracted to
00:44:18,00:44:21,"has been stung by a jellyfish, after you've urinated on them,"
00:44:21,00:44:24,and they're so grateful you can then have sex with them.
00:44:24,00:44:27,- I'm so impressed by the admirable flow of your urine.
00:44:27,00:44:32,"- This is a Bear Grylls episode, I'd love to see."
00:44:32,00:44:42,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:44:42,00:44:43,and that is James.
00:44:43,00:44:46,"- Okay, my fact this week is that Russian football team,"
00:44:46,00:44:50,"FC Sakhalin, are based in such a remote town"
00:44:50,00:44:52,"that to get to their closest away game,"
00:44:52,00:44:55,they have to travel one-sixth of the circumference of the earth.
00:44:55,00:44:58,- That's just amazing.
00:44:58,00:44:59,"- It's incredible, isn't it?"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"Oh my days, like, this is incredible."
00:45:02,00:45:07,"So this is a team based in the town of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,"
00:45:07,00:45:10,"which is in the far, far, far east of Russia,"
00:45:10,00:45:13,"and they're in the third division of Russian football,"
00:45:13,00:45:15,and the way that the third division works in Russia
00:45:15,00:45:16,"is it's such a big country,"
00:45:16,00:45:18,they want all the teams to be kind of close together
00:45:18,00:45:21,because otherwise you have to spend so much money traveling.
00:45:21,00:45:23,So they put all the teams that are next to each other
00:45:23,00:45:24,"playing each other,"
00:45:24,00:45:27,but unfortunately there's no one else around this town
00:45:27,00:45:29,"of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,and so they've been put in with all the teams around the Black Sea
00:45:32,00:45:34,and around Dagestan and stuff like that.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"And so when they play Krasnodar,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"which is one of the teams in their league,"
00:45:39,00:45:41,"they have to, if they want to fly,"
00:45:41,00:45:42,"it would be at least 16 hours,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,just over 16 hours to get to this game.
00:45:45,00:45:49,"You could drive, but it's a 132 hour drive,"
00:45:49,00:45:53,a total of 9781 kilometers
00:45:53,00:45:55,because you have to go a slightly weird way around.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"And I looked at it on Google Maps and it says,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,"""Warning, this route includes a ferry."
00:45:59,00:46:01,This route has tolls.
00:46:01,00:46:04,This route has restricted usage or includes private roads.
00:46:04,00:46:07,"Your destination is in a different time zone."""
00:46:07,00:46:08,So it's not an easy place to get to.
00:46:08,00:46:13,So I'm suspecting stuff like this bit is guarded by a wizard.
00:46:13,00:46:14,This bit is.
00:46:14,00:46:17,"At the time of writing,"
00:46:17,00:46:20,they haven't won any away games this season so far.
00:46:20,00:46:21,"They've won quite a few home games,"
00:46:21,00:46:23,but they've not won any away games.
00:46:23,00:46:26,But they did have a few good seasons a while ago.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"They won the league a couple of times in the last few years,"
00:46:28,00:46:29,but they refused to get promoted
00:46:29,00:46:31,"because if they get promoted,"
00:46:31,00:46:32,they're going to have to start playing lots of teams
00:46:32,00:46:34,"in different parts of Russia,"
00:46:34,00:46:36,"and then they won't be able to do this thing,"
00:46:36,00:46:37,"which they do, which is they go over"
00:46:37,00:46:38,"and they play loads of games at once,"
00:46:38,00:46:39,and then they come back.
00:46:39,00:46:41,"So they don't go every week, if you know what I mean."
00:46:41,00:46:43,That is clever.
00:46:43,00:46:43,Yeah.
00:46:43,00:46:46,Is the time difference between them and their nearest team
00:46:46,00:46:46,is eight hours?
00:46:46,00:46:49,It's so weird.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"Well, the thing is, it's not their nearest team."
00:46:51,00:46:54,"So if they played in the Japanese J League, for instance,"
00:46:54,00:46:57,they're actually quite close to Hokkaido.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"So let's say all the planes stopped,"
00:46:59,00:47:03,and they had to play either against someone like Krasnodar
00:47:03,00:47:05,or someone around there or against Hokkaido.
00:47:06,00:47:09,It would take them two days quicker to get to Hokkaido
00:47:09,00:47:12,than it would take them to get to that part of Russia.
00:47:12,00:47:14,And that's if they were to walk to Hokkaido
00:47:14,00:47:16,and get a cart of Russia.
00:47:16,00:47:18,That's how much closer it is.
00:47:18,00:47:19,"Like they could walk to the ferry,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,get the ferry and walk to the football match
00:47:21,00:47:24,two days quicker than driving all the way across Russia.
00:47:24,00:47:24,Wow.
00:47:24,00:47:25,Yeah.
00:47:25,00:47:27,"And we could, if they were doing that distance"
00:47:27,00:47:29,"and we had to do the equivalent,"
00:47:29,00:47:32,"we could drive to Moscow back again to London,"
00:47:32,00:47:34,"back to Moscow, back again to London,"
00:47:34,00:47:37,and probably one more route before they even got there.
00:47:37,00:47:39,It's what a distance.
00:47:39,00:47:42,They're closer to the Seattle football team
00:47:42,00:47:44,in the American League
00:47:44,00:47:46,than they are to their nearest Russian rivals.
00:47:46,00:47:50,It's insane.
00:47:50,00:47:51,So there's not a lot of sort of
00:47:51,00:47:53,neighbourly antagonism is what you're saying.
00:47:53,00:47:54,"It's not like Man United, Man City,"
00:47:54,00:47:56,where you shag the wife of someone
00:47:56,00:47:58,who's now married the person across the street.
00:47:58,00:47:58,Exactly.
00:47:58,00:48:00,"It's not like Liverpool, Everton,"
00:48:00,00:48:03,where you literally cross one park to get to the other ground.
00:48:03,00:48:04,"It's like, yeah."
00:48:04,00:48:04,Yeah.
00:48:04,00:48:04,It's incredible.
00:48:04,00:48:06,It's more like there are fault lines left over
00:48:06,00:48:09,"from the Russo-Japanese War of 1905,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,which is diplomatically tricky.
00:48:11,00:48:13,"Wasn't James, wasn't there a bizarre thing"
00:48:13,00:48:16,"that happened with one of the British teams,"
00:48:16,00:48:17,"or two British teams,"
00:48:17,00:48:19,that got to the final of some cup?
00:48:19,00:48:21,"And they had to, it was Arsenal and someone, right?"
00:48:21,00:48:22,They had to fly.
00:48:22,00:48:24,I think it was Chelsea against someone.
00:48:24,00:48:26,Chelsea Spurs or Chelsea Arsenal or something.
00:48:26,00:48:29,"But yeah, then the final was in Baku, I think,"
00:48:29,00:48:30,in Azerbaijan.
00:48:30,00:48:31,"And they had to,"
00:48:31,00:48:32,they both had to go all the way over there for it.
00:48:32,00:48:35,"That was in the UEFA Cup, possibly."
00:48:35,00:48:36,Yeah.
00:48:36,00:48:37,Wow.
00:48:37,00:48:38,"I didn't realise that this,"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"so this place is basically in the islands of Japan,"
00:48:40,00:48:41,isn't it?
00:48:41,00:48:41,"Pretty much, yeah."
00:48:41,00:48:44,I actually didn't realise that Russia claimed a portion
00:48:44,00:48:45,"of what I would have,"
00:48:45,00:48:46,"if I'd looked at a blank map,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,assumed towards Japan.
00:48:48,00:48:50,"And I think, no, sorry, Putin,"
00:48:50,00:48:51,"really hope you don't listen to this, his show."
00:48:51,00:48:55,"And I think, isn't the south half of the island"
00:48:55,00:48:56,"is Japanese, isn't it?"
00:48:56,00:48:58,He turned off when we started making jokes
00:48:58,00:48:59,"about short people, I think."
00:48:59,00:49:00,Oh yeah.
00:49:00,00:49:01,There were other podcasts.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"Yeah, exactly, that's it."
00:49:03,00:49:05,"It's basically a part of,"
00:49:05,00:49:07,"well, it's right on the border of Russia and Chepovo."
00:49:07,00:49:09,"Geologically, I guess, it looks Japanese,"
00:49:09,00:49:10,but it's a very disputed territory.
00:49:10,00:49:11,"And there are still some islands,"
00:49:11,00:49:13,"the Kuril Islands, which are disputed."
00:49:13,00:49:16,"But this is Russian sort of,"
00:49:16,00:49:18,is Russian and is Russian a benested?
00:49:18,00:49:19,Yeah.
00:49:19,00:49:20,Yeah.
00:49:20,00:49:21,I don't know why anyone plays football in Russia.
00:49:21,00:49:24,It sounds like an enormous hassle for so many teams.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"It's just, it's too big."
00:49:26,00:49:28,"Even if you're playing for Vladivostok,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,"which at least is attached to it by land,"
00:49:30,00:49:34,"it's still, I think, 10,000 kilometers east of St. Petersburg."
00:49:34,00:49:36,So a week's train journey.
00:49:36,00:49:40,And I think there was quite a nice story in 2006
00:49:40,00:49:43,"where three fans of Zenit St. Petersburg,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,"which is a football team there,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,"they drove to Vladivostok,"
00:49:47,00:49:49,because Peter was playing an away game there.
00:49:49,00:49:51,So they drove the whole week and a half there.
00:49:51,00:49:54,"Once they got there, their car broke down."
00:49:54,00:49:55,"But to reward their loyalty,"
00:49:55,00:49:57,their team gave them a new car.
00:49:57,00:49:58,Wow.
00:49:58,00:49:59,"Oh, that's cool."
00:49:59,00:49:59,Nice.
00:50:00,00:50:04,"Of course, the reason that people play football in Russia"
00:50:04,00:50:07,is because the Soviets like to force people to play football
00:50:07,00:50:09,back in the day.
00:50:09,00:50:10,Cool.
00:50:10,00:50:13,"Actually, it was quite thought of as a bourgeois sport originally,"
00:50:13,00:50:17,because it was brought over by Scottish people in particular.
00:50:17,00:50:20,And the first person who brought it over there
00:50:20,00:50:22,"was a guy called MacPherson,"
00:50:22,00:50:24,"who was arrested after the revolution,"
00:50:24,00:50:27,"because they saw football as being a bourgeois European thing,"
00:50:27,00:50:29,and they shouldn't be doing it in Russia.
00:50:29,00:50:34,"But the first ever football match in Russia was in 1893,"
00:50:34,00:50:37,and they squeezed it in between two tug-of-war competitions.
00:50:37,00:50:41,"So there was a big tug-of-war thing happening,"
00:50:41,00:50:41,"and they were like,"
00:50:41,00:50:42,"""Well, what shall we do in the middle,"
00:50:42,00:50:44,"because we're just sorting out our rope or something?"""
00:50:44,00:50:46,"And they're like, ""Oh, let's have a game of football."""
00:50:46,00:50:47,So funny.
00:50:47,00:50:50,They cleared all the seven arms off the pitch
00:50:50,00:50:51,before they got the footballers on.
00:50:51,00:50:54,"Oh, dear."
00:50:54,00:50:56,"But yeah, handball,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,and it's just the ball rolling over someone's hand.
00:50:59,00:51:01,(LAUGHTER)
00:51:01,00:51:04,"And then the most famous team in Russia is Spartak, Moscow,"
00:51:04,00:51:05,and they came along.
00:51:05,00:51:07,"When the Soviets were controlling everything,"
00:51:07,00:51:08,"they were the team of the people,"
00:51:08,00:51:12,"and there was a load of brothers called the Starristan Brothers,"
00:51:12,00:51:13,who started Spartak.
00:51:13,00:51:15,"And then, very mysteriously,"
00:51:15,00:51:18,"they got sent to the Gulag about three or four years later,"
00:51:18,00:51:21,"because they started a, you know, people's football team."
00:51:21,00:51:22,But they were so popular
00:51:22,00:51:24,"that when they got to Siberia,"
00:51:24,00:51:26,"they guarded Siberia and knew about them,"
00:51:26,00:51:29,and so let them kind of practice their football.
00:51:29,00:51:33,"And eventually, Stalin's son Vasily was so into football"
00:51:33,00:51:36,that they brought Nikolai Starristan back from the Gulag
00:51:36,00:51:38,"so that he could live with Vasily Stalin,"
00:51:38,00:51:40,and he would just live in his house
00:51:40,00:51:42,because he was such a big fan of this footballer.
00:51:42,00:51:43,That's so awkward.
00:51:43,00:51:43,I know.
00:51:43,00:51:46,Imagine if Lionel Messi just moved in with you or something.
00:51:46,00:51:47,(LAUGHTER)
00:51:47,00:51:49,"Even if you thought he was a great footballer,"
00:51:49,00:51:51,I still think that would be awkward around the dinner table.
00:51:51,00:51:52,I think it would.
00:51:52,00:51:53,"Pass me the salt,"
00:51:53,00:51:56,and he doesn't have a head kick to you or something.
00:51:56,00:51:57,(LAUGHTER)
00:51:57,00:51:59,"Stalin was, just speaking of Stalin,"
00:51:59,00:52:02,was exiled to Siberia six times
00:52:02,00:52:05,between 1900 and 1913 and escaped five times.
00:52:05,00:52:07,"Well, speaking of people who escape a lot"
00:52:07,00:52:10,"and the passing of someone quite famous,"
00:52:10,00:52:11,"Diego Maradona,"
00:52:11,00:52:13,"who passed away recently, very sadly,"
00:52:13,00:52:15,"he used to,"
00:52:15,00:52:18,didn't he go and used to play football
00:52:18,00:52:20,at the request of Pablo Escobar
00:52:20,00:52:22,while he was in prison?
00:52:22,00:52:23,Just him and Pablo.
00:52:23,00:52:26,"Just, yeah, well, I'm sure there were teams"
00:52:26,00:52:28,that were put together.
00:52:28,00:52:30,"But he had, at this particular point,"
00:52:30,00:52:33,"I think it was in 1991, Escobar was in quite a luxurious prison."
00:52:33,00:52:36,"He kind of ran the prisons, didn't he, to begin with?"
00:52:36,00:52:40,"Of course, Escobar and Maradona had quite a lot in common."
00:52:40,00:52:42,"They had some shared hobbies, didn't they?"
00:52:42,00:52:43,"Yes, they did."
00:52:43,00:52:44,(LAUGHTER)
00:52:44,00:52:45,Today?
00:52:45,00:52:48,Maradona was once sent home for the World Cup for taking cocaine.
00:52:48,00:52:52,"I just cottoned on, as you guys said."
00:52:52,00:52:56,You thought maybe he also collected dojos
00:52:56,00:52:58,or whatever it was that Escobar had in his house.
00:52:58,00:53:01,Shall we talk about Siberia for a while?
00:53:01,00:53:01,"Yeah, sure."
00:53:01,00:53:05,"So, I was saying before about people being sent to Siberia,"
00:53:05,00:53:09,"in 1591, this is the earliest example"
00:53:09,00:53:10,"of anyone being sent to Siberia,"
00:53:10,00:53:12,and it's not anyone.
00:53:12,00:53:14,"This was a bell in Russia,"
00:53:14,00:53:15,which was found guilty of sedition
00:53:15,00:53:18,and flogged and exiled to Siberia.
00:53:18,00:53:21,And that was because the bell had been rung
00:53:21,00:53:24,to celebrate the assassination of Dimitri's son Ivan the Terrible.
00:53:24,00:53:27,"And so, the son had died,"
00:53:27,00:53:30,"and the locals were happy about it,"
00:53:30,00:53:31,"and so they rang a bell,"
00:53:31,00:53:33,and then they put the bell in court
00:53:33,00:53:34,and sent it off to Siberia.
00:53:34,00:53:37,Was it because they couldn't identify any of the bell ringers?
00:53:37,00:53:40,"So, was it a way of letting the bell ringers off the hook?"
00:53:40,00:53:41,It could have been that.
00:53:41,00:53:44,"That is the epitome of a workman blaming their tools,"
00:53:44,00:53:45,"really, where that came from."
00:53:45,00:53:47,"It's not really the bell's fault, is it?"
00:53:47,00:53:49,It doesn't feel like it.
00:53:49,00:53:49,It doesn't even know it's about.
00:53:49,00:53:51,It also feels like flogging a bell
00:53:51,00:53:53,"is going to cause it to ring again,"
00:53:53,00:53:55,and then you'll have to flog a bell.
00:53:55,00:53:56,This is never-ending cycle.
00:53:56,00:53:58,"Have you heard of Magadan,"
00:53:58,00:54:00,"which is a very remote city,"
00:54:00,00:54:05,kind of two days north of the nearest train tracks and things like that?
00:54:05,00:54:08,"Just a very, very remote city in Siberia."
00:54:08,00:54:09,"They have a mayoral position,"
00:54:09,00:54:11,and they're having a nightmare filling out at the moment.
00:54:11,00:54:13,There have been zero applications
00:54:13,00:54:15,"for the job of actual mayor of the city,"
00:54:15,00:54:17,"and there are 92,000 people in Magadan."
00:54:17,00:54:18,It's not a small place.
00:54:19,00:54:22,"They've extended the deadline to mid-December,"
00:54:22,00:54:23,"so depending on when this goes out,"
00:54:23,00:54:25,you might still be in time.
00:54:25,00:54:26,What happened to the previous mayor?
00:54:26,00:54:30,If the seven last mayors all died in suspicious circumstances or something.
00:54:30,00:54:32,It's a lot of people say
00:54:32,00:54:34,"that you won't be able to change things properly,"
00:54:34,00:54:38,"and there's a fair bit of graft and corruption,"
00:54:38,00:54:41,and it's probably a pretty thankless job.
00:54:41,00:54:43,"But when the story broke for the first time,"
00:54:43,00:54:45,there have been no applications.
00:54:45,00:54:49,"The boss of a funeral firm from Tomsk, 4,000 miles away,"
00:54:49,00:54:51,"said he would apply,"
00:54:51,00:54:53,"and he said, ""Of course, I don't know much about the city,"
00:54:53,00:54:55,"and it would be better if I had lived there a while,"
00:54:55,00:54:56,"but I've never had the chance."""
00:54:56,00:54:58,So he said he's going to apply it.
00:54:58,00:54:59,His main policy is to build a crematorium.
00:54:59,00:55:03,"Okay, well, that sounds like he's just going to be"
00:55:03,00:55:06,"greasing the palms of his crematorium friends, doesn't it?"
00:55:06,00:55:11,"We've never actually talked about the amazing Lukov family,"
00:55:11,00:55:14,"but if you're talking about the Siberian wilderness,"
00:55:14,00:55:16,they're kind of the epitome of it.
00:55:16,00:55:21,So this is a family who basically fled the Bolsheviks
00:55:21,00:55:25,"and in the 1920s, 1930s, family of four, I think at the time,"
00:55:25,00:55:29,went into Siberia and just lived without ever seeing
00:55:29,00:55:32,another human soul until the 1980s.
00:55:32,00:55:34,"And it is insane, their lifestyle."
00:55:34,00:55:36,"They didn't bring much stuff,"
00:55:36,00:55:39,"so when their clothes started to fall apart,"
00:55:39,00:55:41,they had to grow hemp from seed
00:55:41,00:55:43,in order to make new clothes out of that.
00:55:44,00:55:47,They wrote by dipping sharp birch sticks
00:55:47,00:55:50,"into honey supple juice and writing,"
00:55:50,00:55:51,but they raised this family
00:55:51,00:55:54,"and there's one surviving member, Agafia Lukov,"
00:55:54,00:55:56,"and she is now in her 80s,"
00:55:56,00:55:59,"but she lives completely by herself in the middle of the tiger,"
00:55:59,00:56:03,"middle of nowhere, 150 miles from the nearest town,"
00:56:03,00:56:06,"1,000 meters high on this mountainside."
00:56:06,00:56:09,And she wasn't discovered until the 80s
00:56:09,00:56:11,when these geologists were flying over in a helicopter
00:56:11,00:56:14,and saw their tiny little hut that they were living in.
00:56:14,00:56:17,"And they said they were kind of famous in Russia, weren't they?"
00:56:17,00:56:18,In the 80s for a while.
00:56:18,00:56:21,"When they were found in the 80s, they said to them,"
00:56:21,00:56:22,"""Oh, you guys probably don't know"
00:56:22,00:56:24,"that the Second World War has finished,"""
00:56:24,00:56:26,"and they went, ""What's the Second World War?"""
00:56:26,00:56:30,"They'd went before then, that was in the 30s,"
00:56:30,00:56:32,"I think, or the 20s when they went, like, kind of sense."
00:56:32,00:56:34,"But yeah, when they were found,"
00:56:34,00:56:37,they were kind of taken around the country
00:56:37,00:56:41,"as almost like a kind of a sideshow almost, I suppose,"
00:56:41,00:56:42,"which is like, look at these amazing people"
00:56:42,00:56:44,that have been living in Siberia.
00:56:44,00:56:47,And Agafia Lukvo kind of was...
00:56:47,00:56:51,"They said in one article I read that she saw aeroplanes,"
00:56:51,00:56:53,"horses, cars, and money for the first time,"
00:56:53,00:56:56,"but then basically said,"
00:56:56,00:56:57,"""I ain't having any of this shit."
00:56:57,00:56:59,"I want to go back to where I live,"""
00:56:59,00:57:01,"because she says that whenever she leaves the town,"
00:57:01,00:57:05,"she always gets really bad asthma or, you know,"
00:57:05,00:57:06,it's bad for her skin.
00:57:06,00:57:08,"She just doesn't like, she doesn't like the noise"
00:57:08,00:57:09,and all that kind of stuff.
00:57:09,00:57:11,So she's just kind of happy where she is now.
00:57:11,00:57:14,"And every now and then they bring her, like, food,"
00:57:14,00:57:17,"I think, like, once a year, they bring her things and people."
00:57:17,00:57:19,"People knit them socks and stuff, don't they?"
00:57:19,00:57:20,"And knit them things, I think."
00:57:20,00:57:21,Yeah.
00:57:21,00:57:24,"Just earlier, when I said about the football team"
00:57:24,00:57:26,"going back on the route passing a wizard,"
00:57:26,00:57:27,"I mean, this is it."
00:57:27,00:57:30,"Yeah, almost, yeah, yeah."
00:57:30,00:57:30,This is her.
00:57:30,00:57:32,"It was really sad, actually, when they were discovered,"
00:57:32,00:57:34,I think there were five of them.
00:57:34,00:57:36,"And then in the 80s, they all suddenly died"
00:57:36,00:57:37,and left her on her own.
00:57:37,00:57:40,"But the thing that most amazed the dad,"
00:57:40,00:57:41,he was told everything.
00:57:41,00:57:43,They were told about the moon landings.
00:57:43,00:57:44,"They were shown a television,"
00:57:44,00:57:46,which they became kind of addicted to
00:57:46,00:57:47,"and then thought it was the devil,"
00:57:47,00:57:49,so repented of it immediately.
00:57:49,00:57:50,They were told about the moon landings
00:57:50,00:57:52,"and refused to believe they happened,"
00:57:52,00:57:53,which is fair enough.
00:57:53,00:57:55,The thing that most amazed the dad was cellophane.
00:57:55,00:57:58,"He saw this thing, which he was like,"
00:57:58,00:58:00,"it's like glass, but it crumples."
00:58:00,00:58:02,They couldn't believe it.
00:58:02,00:58:05,"Yeah, and they didn't know what plastic bags were as well."
00:58:05,00:58:07,"I remember reading, that was a new thing for them."
00:58:07,00:58:09,I believe Mick Jagger was flown in
00:58:09,00:58:11,to top his numbers up.
00:58:11,00:58:13,"And they were like, yeah, of course, we know who this guy is."
00:58:13,00:58:16,"But then the big problem now is,"
00:58:16,00:58:17,they do go in there every now and then
00:58:17,00:58:19,and drop her some supplies.
00:58:19,00:58:21,"And especially, like I said, people knit them socks"
00:58:21,00:58:23,and knit them clothes and stuff.
00:58:23,00:58:26,"But of course, with coronavirus,"
00:58:26,00:58:28,you just do not want to be going into an area
00:58:28,00:58:31,with a very elderly lady who's not really had
00:58:31,00:58:35,any human contact for decades and decades and decades.
00:58:35,00:58:37,And so that's a real issue with them at the moment.
00:58:37,00:58:38,You know what they should do?
00:58:38,00:58:41,"They should set her up on a date with,"
00:58:41,00:58:42,"do you remember that Brazilian guy,"
00:58:42,00:58:46,"the man of the whole, the most isolated man in the world?"
00:58:46,00:58:47,They should get those two.
00:58:47,00:58:49,That would be a very charming rom-com.
00:58:49,00:58:54,"We own the copyright, Mr. Spielberg,"
00:58:54,00:58:55,"just to say, because we mentioned it on here."
00:58:55,00:58:57,So we'll take 10% of it.
00:58:57,00:58:58,That's correct how that works.
00:58:58,00:59:01,Just one last bit of data before we go.
00:59:01,00:59:02,"Okay, yeah."
00:59:02,00:59:05,"In the breaks between facts, I texted Anne and Alex"
00:59:05,00:59:08,to see if either of them had seen Mick Jagger live.
00:59:08,00:59:08,"Yeah, go on."
00:59:08,00:59:11,"Anne said, ""No, I have not."""
00:59:11,00:59:12,Okay.
00:59:12,00:59:15,"And Alex said, ""No, I don't really know who he is."""
00:59:15,00:59:20,"So James, if you want someone to talk to about this random guy."
00:59:20,00:59:22,Me and Alex are like the man of the whole
00:59:22,00:59:25,"and the, you know, lady in Siberia."
00:59:25,00:59:25,Yeah.
00:59:25,00:59:29,"Okay, that's it."
00:59:29,00:59:30,That is all of our facts.
