 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,160
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
 Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,440
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,240
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that one in three people

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,160
 in the UK has seen the Queen in real life. Wow. That's insane. It feels high to me. There are

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,840
 about 70 million people in the UK. Shouldn't we start off with a survey of the people on this soon?

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,400
 Yes 100% and I've got some extra data to add actually. I know that Dan has for sure because

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,560
 Dan's actually properly met the Queen. I went to Buckingham Palace. You slept with her, haven't you?

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,000
 It was Phillip. I slept with Phillip that she came in and served us tea in the morning.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,240
 I'm sure you can be arrested for this kind of comment. Definitely. This is now the treason cast.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,320
 Okay, so Dan has to Buckingham Palace Garden Party. Fine. Anna? I don't think so. Okay, data.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,960
 I need a lot of people, you know. We should ask the Queen about if she's that Anna.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,360
 Have you seen her though, Anna? Like have you, with your eyes in public, seen her? That's the

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
 other bit of it. No, not in public. The only reason I hesitate is because I know my siblings have

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,120
 met her because my brother's called Charlie and my... She meets all the Charlie's. It's a ceremony

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,040
 every year. Are they like swans? They're like the UK swans. All the Charlie's belong to the Queen.

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,160
 He got a golden ticket and some chocolate. They let him meet the Queen, didn't they?

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,800
 Yeah. I said that the wrong way round because my dad for his job met the... My parents met her

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,880
 and my mum was holding my brother Charlie as a baby at the time and the Queen said to my mum

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,240
 what's he called and she said Charlie and the Queen said, "Oh, I've got a little Charlie as well."

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,400
 Wow, that's awesome. Which is weird because he would have been about 30 at that point.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:21,840
 Okay, so, no, but that's a no. James? Well, I think I have seen her. It's kind of... I was very

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,080
 young when it happened. I think when... When I was 10 years old, she came to Bolton, right?

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,760
 Okay. To celebrate Bolton's 150th birthday and I think I stood on the street and saw her go past

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,120
 and I looked on the Bolton Even News website to see what happened and they said that everyone

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
 from age nine to 11 was given the morning off to go and see the Queen and I would have been 10,

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,120
 so that makes sense. But I asked my mum and she didn't remember it at all and I'm like,

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,880
 "Yeah, but mum, I have kind of a memory and it's in the Bolton Even News that we were there,

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,960
 so, Charlie, it must have happened." And she said, "Well, I had three young children and a full-time

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,320
 job, so how the hell am I supposed to remember stuff like that?" But I think I might have done.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,960
 Put you down as a half. Yeah. Okay. I'm a yes. Oh, yeah. Consec? Because she was visiting the

34
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,040
 university I was at and she walked past, but no face time with her, no personal contact.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,360
 But I've also asked Ann Miller and Alex Bell, the other regulars, and they have both seen

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,720
 the Queen, Ann was a child and Alex was, I think, an ascot or something and saw a yellow blur

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,000
 in the distance, which he claims was the Queen. Was she on a horse, a yellow blur?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
 Yeah, she came in third. She did really well. But that's, how many is that? That's one, two,

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
 and a half with James. I think I'm a one, Andy. I really do think, honestly, I think I've seen her.

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,160
 So that's five out of six. Am I one and a half because I've touched her?

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,760
 Am I in a different category? You're not allowed to, Dan. That's the main thing.

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,400
 What are you talking about? You're not allowed to touch the Queen.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,520
 Of course you are. No, you're not. Well, she touched me. She touched me. Oh, that's completely different.

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
 You're rather...

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,080
 But that's one of the main rules. There's no touching.

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
 But there aren't really any rules, right? It's just kind of etiquette. In fact, on the Royal

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
 Family website, I think maybe they're trying to play it cool, but they strictly say they're

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
 in no obligatory codes of behaviour at all when you beat the Queen. You can pull your trousers

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,960
 down if you like. You will be shocked. Dan, you actually did pull your pants down, didn't you?

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,800
 And said, "Hey, I've got a little Charlie of my own." Oh, no.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,360
 Oh, next week's episode coming to you live from the Tower of London.

52
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,600
 It is nerve-wracking, though, all the protocols. So I met her at Buckingham Palace. It was part of

53
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,640
 a party in celebration of her heading to Australia, and I got sent an invitation,

54
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,880
 as supposedly a notable Australian, which is so bizarre. And you get with the invitation,

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,280
 you get this extraordinary list of protocol of how you approach the Queen if you meet her,

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,920
 what to say, how to use Mam the first time, and then Her Majesty. I've got the order

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 wrong in that, but it's stuff like that. Sorry, you've also got the pronunciation wrong,

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,280
 according to the Royal Family official website. They're very strict. Is it Mam?

59
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,400
 It's Mam. It's the only bit of protocol, they say, is a rule addressed as Mam as in Jam.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
 Well, she's from the Northeast, isn't she? So she always calls herself Mam.

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
 It's never Mum. It's always Mam. But sorry, Dan, go on.

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,760
 No, I'm just saying, with all that playing in your head, it's a very nerve-wracking

63
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,480
 experience. You find it very hard to be present in the moment when you're meeting the Queen

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,240
 and shaking her hand. Philip, less so, because you're just waiting for him to say something

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,760
 a bit routine, which I was hoping for. He must have been in his element with all those Australians.

66
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,800
 Yeah, exactly. He just had to bite his tongue. He genuinely, when I shook hands with him,

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,080
 he kind of lent in as if he was going to say something and just went, "Ah, not worth it."

68
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,920
 This little shake of his head just went, "Ah, I don't need this today."

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,120
 But he didn't say, "Not worth it." His eyes said that.

70
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
 No, but you could tell with his look. His eyes said, "Well, because I got in a fight later on

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
 with one of his sons, Prince Edward, who came up." Who won?

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,840
 He did, because I was in his house. He kind of just sort of won it by default.

73
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
 He knows where the weapons are. Yeah. He doesn't like QI, by the way.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
 So he kind of insulted all of us. It's awkward.

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
 Yeah. He said, "Oh, is it that pompous show with the pompous Stephen Frye who pretends to know

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
 all these facts?" Well, at least he has seen it. Yeah.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,680
 Christ, I think the Royal Family wants to talk about pomposity.

78
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,560
 That's true. Stephen Frye never insisted on a gold carriage, not for the first three series,

79
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,720
 anyway. So, Dan, you're not the only eminent Australian to have met the Queen.

80
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,000
 I mean, it would be insane if you were a part of the party.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,440
 But this sort of ties in with the touching thing and the etiquette about not touching the Queen,

82
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,680
 unless you're shaking hands with her or whatever. But she visited Australia in 1992,

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
 which I guess was the time before Dan, your garden party with her.

84
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
 But the PM at the time, Paul Keating, he put his arm around her,

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,160
 not in a kind of cinema-yorn stretch way, but he sort of just put his hand on the small of her

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 back. And the British papers called him the Lizard of Oz as a result. Yeah. One newspaper wrote,

87
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,800
 "Mr Keating, in placing his hand in the centre of her back, was actually touching that little

88
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
 fastener, which is the miniature linchpin of all women's femininity."

89
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,000
 What? Is that a thing? It is. And how did they get hold of that secret?

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
 We were sworn to keep it under wraps.

91
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,800
 But the Queen, actually, it's not a linchpin. It's one of those strings that you pull out.

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,280
 When you pull it out, she goes, "How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? How do you do?"

93
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,320
 I think it's implying that he was trying to unhook her bra.

94
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,800
 Is it the minute? It says the minute little fastener,

95
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 which is the miniature linchpin of all women's...

96
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,080
 Not lower back.

97
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 Oh, no, it wasn't. Sorry, it was just a medium back.

98
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,960
 You don't... bras don't descend down your torso as the oppressors do.

99
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,760
 It's not like elderly women have got their bras around their waist.

100
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,400
 You know what? We're learning a lot here today, aren't we?

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
 This is... Yeah.

102
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,120
 Real lesson for the lads.

103
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,480
 But you shrink when you're older, so your back gets smaller, doesn't it?

104
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,200
 It just gets closer... Your shoulders get closer to your bum, naturally.

105
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
 I guess.

106
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:19,680
 This thing about one-third of Britain's having seen the Queen was part of a survey by Yougoth,

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
 wasn't it? And so I looked at some of the other things in that survey.

108
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,480
 And so 22% of people have seen Prince Philip. So that's one in five-ish.

109
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,480
 The next most commonly seen is Princess Anne on 17%.

110
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200
 Only 1% have seen Meghan Markle.

111
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,880
 She was the least, but she's not been going for as long as she...

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,520
 No, that's true.

113
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,800
 She's a new character.

114
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,880
 Prince Harry was the same. It's 3% of 65-year-olds and over have seen him,

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
 and only 5% of 18 to 24-year-olds.

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
 And it's just because the Queen has been going for so long

117
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
 and has been doing so many visits all over the place.

118
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
 So for people over the age of 65, 49% have either seen or met her,

119
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
 which I just find insane.

120
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
 Well, it's true. It's like when she came to Bolton,

121
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,520
 it was just to get her numbers up, really, because she got all the kids along the street,

122
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,200
 and she's like, "Well, this is another 200,000 people that can access the list."

123
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,840
 She's playing a long Pokemon game with all of us.

124
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
 We are the Pokemon.

125
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
 It's Pokemon Comuna, isn't it?

126
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,000
 She's got a list of all the Comunas in the country, and she's just taking them all off.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,160
 The list of people that she's met, I read that she has met over a quarter

128
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,920
 of all the US presidents ever.

129
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
 She's met something close to it.

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
 Yeah, she's met something close to 30% of all the presidents that America has ever had.

131
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,760
 That is insane.

132
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,280
 That is breaking news for me.

133
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,760
 I was trying to find the most famous person the Queen hasn't met,

134
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,320
 and so I went on to Google and searched for who's the most famous person in the world,

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
 and then went down the list to see,

136
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
 and Google has the Queen met this person, has the Queen met this person.

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,680
 Well, I didn't have to go that far, because as far as I can see, she hasn't met Justin Bieber.

138
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,440
 And Google thinks that he's one of the most famous people in the world.

139
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,840
 They've never been seen in the same room at the same time, have they?

140
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,560
 Well, you see, Justin Bieber is another person whose shoulders are quite close to his bum,

141
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
 isn't he, because he's a very small man.

142
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
 Because I was reading about people who have met Justin Bieber,

143
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,160
 and Freddie Flintoff, a cricketer who is an extremely tall guy,

144
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
 he went to meet him, he got a meet and greet with his kids and his wife,

145
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
 and they went down the queue and they got to the front,

146
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
 and the kids got to see Justin Bieber,

147
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
 but the Justin Bieber staff wouldn't let Freddie Flintoff go anywhere near him,

148
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,640
 and they said he doesn't like big guys.

149
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,480
 Because if you have Freddie, who's like six, four, six, five, something like that,

150
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
 standing next to Justin Bieber, he's going to look like a little tiny bloke.

151
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,640
 Yeah, it's like why he only hangs out with Tom Cruise and people like that, Justin Bieber.

152
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
 Yeah, yeah, also Justin Bieber is why he wears his trousers so low,

153
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,200
 is because he's trying to make it look like a distance from his shoulders to his bum,

154
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
 is greater than it actually is.

155
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,280
 There are only a few inches apart, actually.

156
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,400
 The Royal Family have banned commoners from wearing their official tartan.

157
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,520
 Can you believe this? Prince Albert designed the tartan for the family, for the firm,

158
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,600
 in 1853, and then several decades later in 1937,

159
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,760
 there was a tartan manufacturer who wrote to them saying,

160
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
 "Oh, this is a lovely tartan and we'd love to make it."

161
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,080
 And the keeper of the previous purse wrote back saying,

162
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,760
 "Absolutely not. You may not make this as exclusively for the royal use."

163
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,840
 Anyway, you would think that was in 1937.

164
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,200
 Things might have changed a bit since then.

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,760
 In 2016, the palace confirmed that this remains in place.

166
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
 There is one person in the world who is not a member of the Royal Family,

167
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
 who is allowed to wear the tartan.

168
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,680
 Can we guess?

169
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 It's guessable as well.

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
 It's definitely guessable.

171
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,600
 Nicola Sturgeon.

172
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
 It's not Nicola Sturgeon.

173
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
 Is it one of the crankies, if any of us are still alive?

174
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,080
 It's Jimmy Cranky.

175
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,120
 No, it's not.

176
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,280
 Is it the person who tries on stuff for the queen?

177
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,800
 Oh, yeah.

178
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,960
 No, brilliant guess.

179
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,880
 Is it the winner of the caber toss in every year's Highland Games?

180
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
 It's another lovely, lovely guess.

181
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,440
 It's not, it's a bit further away.

182
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
 That would be a great prize, wouldn't it?

183
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
 Is it someone Scottish?

184
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
 Does it have to be someone Scottish in this?

185
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
 It's someone who is almost certainly going to be Scottish due to their job.

186
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,080
 It's someone who might be wearing tartan as a matter of course.

187
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,320
 The person who paints the fourth rail bridge.

188
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
 No, it's not that.

189
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,040
 It's the backpiper on Princess Street,

190
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,520
 who annoys everyone every morning during the festival.

191
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,760
 You were so, you know what?

192
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,640
 I think just to end this torture competition, I'm going to say yes.

193
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,480
 It's her alarm clock, her backpiping alarm clock man.

194
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
 Her backpiping alarm clock man as the official role is, yes.

195
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
 Wow.

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,480
 I know.

197
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
 That's another incredibly long-lasting thing.

198
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,880
 There have only been 15 royal backpipers since 1843,

199
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,560
 and they have to play for her every weekday morning,

200
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,360
 not every morning of the week.

201
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
 She's not a masochist, for 15 minutes they play.

202
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,240
 And apparently she doesn't ever want to hear the same tune twice.

203
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
 So it's a nightmare because there was one called Gordon Webster

204
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
 who said he had to know about seven or 800 different tunes.

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,760
 They must be, yeah, but they must be running out by now.

206
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,520
 Like how long has she been queen?

207
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,640
 60 years, what is it?

208
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,680
 Something like that.

209
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
 And then every morning, apart from the weekends,

210
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,520
 she's had a different tune.

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,240
 They must be getting, they must be kind of getting down to the,

212
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,560
 "All right, I'm going to do the killers today."

213
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 And she had that one.

214
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
 Well, she's had Mr Brightside, but she hasn't.

215
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,480
 That's a cool way to inform her of like the latest charts.

216
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
 You just start playing the latest Ariana Grande.

217
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
 I don't know if she needs to be informed with the latest charts.

218
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
 Is that something that she demands?

219
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
 Well, maybe, you know, when she meets Bieber one day,

220
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,960
 she can say, "Love yourself."

221
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,520
 Can I do one more guessing game?

222
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,880
 Because Andy's one went so loud.

223
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,200
 According to Ben Shart, who I think we all kind of trust,

224
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,360
 writing in the spectator, a brilliant sort of collector of trivia,

225
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,520
 who do you think is the most seen human ever to have lived?

226
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,320
 As in the person that most people have seen in real life.

227
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,040
 Oh, wow.

228
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,240
 So someone who's done huge events and rallies and things like that,

229
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,920
 is it Donald Trump?

230
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
 Nope.

231
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
 Is it a politician from a really popular country, like Xi Jinping?

232
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,480
 Oh, good call.

233
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,440
 Narendra Modi.

234
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
 Oh, is it Dalai Lama?

235
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
 Ben Shart thinks none of those.

236
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,000
 Ben Shart thinks it is probably Mick Jagger.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,080
 And that's because he's been going for so long,

238
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,000
 so long at playing in front of massive, massive audiences,

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,400
 non-stop and non-stop and non-stop, and out of all the...

240
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,800
 Is he from the Rolling Stones?

241
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,760
 Yes, yes, yes.

242
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
 Of all the Rolling Stones.

243
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,320
 He does most of it.

244
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,720
 Sorry.

245
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
 What a slam on the most seen man on earth.

246
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
 You don't deserve this fact.

247
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
 You don't deserve to be saying this fact.

248
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,520
 Oh, my God.

249
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,320
 Hang on.

250
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
 Can we just do a little straw poll among us?

251
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,240
 Who's seen...

252
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,960
 We know James has it.

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,680
 Who knows who he is?

254
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
 I might have done for all I know.

255
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,960
 I don't think I have seen the Rolling Stones at any stage,

256
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,000
 any of them, I don't think.

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,720
 I've seen Jagger.

258
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
 I've seen all of them because I went to a gig once.

259
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,440
 Me too.

260
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,400
 I've not.

261
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,280
 Dan, no.

262
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,280
 No.

263
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,920
 Surprising.

264
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,800
 No, very surprising.

265
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,640
 So the Queen in our little straw poll.

266
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,680
 Can you ask Alex Bell at Dan Miller as well, please, Andy?

267
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,640
 Yeah, I'll draw him a text.

268
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,240
 Yeah, Jagger was on the horse behind the Queen.

269
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,080
 Oh, that's such a good answer.

270
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,680
 While we're just talking of rock stars,

271
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,640
 I've been reading Elton John's autobiography called Me,

272
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,120
 which is unbelievably good, very scandalous.

273
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,000
 And he meets with the Queen quite a few times in the book.

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,960
 And he tells a story in it where he was at a party

275
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,720
 and he saw the Queen approaching a man called Viscount Lindley.

276
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
 And she asked him to look on after his sister

277
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,840
 who'd been taken ill and retired to her room.

278
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,520
 So he said, "Go and look after her."

279
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,360
 And he kept just partying.

280
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
 And so once he was fobbing the Queen off too many times,

281
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
 she went up to them, and this is what Elton John saw.

282
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
 You know that thing of saying a single word

283
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,040
 and slapping a cheek of someone back and forth

284
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,200
 in between the words that you see in movies?

285
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,400
 She says that the Queen went up to Viscount Lindley

286
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,240
 and went, "Don't slap, argue with me.

287
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
 I am the Queen."

288
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,520
 And then he went off to look after the daughter.

289
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,480
 And then Elton says the Queen then turned to Elton.

290
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,280
 She stared at him and gave a little wink and walked off.

291
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,160
 That's what he says.

292
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,280
 I mean, it might have happened.

293
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,040
 It's in the book.

294
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
 He's Elton John's a fantasist.

295
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,280
 I'm not sure he is.

296
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
 I think he tells the truth.

297
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,200
 Is that... I mean, can that have happened?

298
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,160
 No, because it's...

299
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,680
 No, I do remember actually in Prince's biography,

300
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,360
 he says that he saw the Queen slamming Prince Edward's head

301
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
 in the fridge door repeatedly.

302
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,040
 Because he said he didn't like QI.

303
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
 She said, "You should watch QI. It's very funny."

304
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:08,720
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

305
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,440
 My fact this week is that in 1714,

306
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 when a Dutch ship ran out of ammunition 14 hours into a battle,

307
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,560
 the captain sent a boat over to the enemy asking to borrow

308
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,760
 some gunpowder and cannonballs so they could continue the fight.

309
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,880
 And did they give them the cannonballs?

310
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,840
 No.

311
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,280
 Can we borrow them as quite good?

312
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,240
 We'll give them back.

313
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:38,320
 Yeah, no, I think it was seen as a sort of a bit of a cheeky surrender,

314
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,880
 really, because the captains actually,

315
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
 I don't know if it was the humour of it,

316
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,440
 ended up having a drink and toasting each other,

317
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,400
 sending some compliments very nicely for it, well done,

318
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,240
 and then off they went on their ways.

319
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,640
 So neither ship was sunk in the end and neither was captured.

320
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
 So quite a good ending.

321
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,080
 So yeah, so this is a story to do more with the captain,

322
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,480
 whose name was Peter Janssen Vessel, otherwise known as Tordenschild,

323
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,040
 and he was a Dano-Norwegian nobleman who was,

324
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,960
 he's very famous in sort of the history now of Denmark.

325
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
 There's statues of him in Copenhagen,

326
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880
 the most popular brand of matches, has his image on it.

327
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
 He's mentioned in the Royal National Anthem,

328
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
 he was sort of a big character at the time,

329
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
 but this was quite an infamous incident

330
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
 in what was known as the Great Northern War.

331
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,640
 He was captaining this Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy ship,

332
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
 and he ran into what they thought was a British ship,

333
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
 but was actually Swedish,

334
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,840
 and it was a much bigger ship than what he had.

335
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
 He never should have engaged in a fight with it,

336
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,200
 in a battle with it,

337
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,760
 and so he was reprimanded when he got back

338
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
 for having done that,

339
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,600
 for risking everyone's life and the ship itself.

340
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
 So that he survived,

341
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
 but it kind of didn't work out for him for a while.

342
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,360
 Well, although he fought his case

343
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
 and won it in the end, didn't he?

344
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
 He was such a brazen man

345
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,200
 that it seemed like he just always got away with the stuff.

346
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
 He seemed to be always doing things like this,

347
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
 and yeah, like you say, he was reprimanded,

348
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
 he was court-martialed,

349
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,400
 and he managed to find an obscure piece of naval law

350
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
 which got him off,

351
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,960
 so he was court-martialed because he persisted much too long,

352
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
 but then he found a bit of law that said

353
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
 that you have to pursue any ship that's fleeing you,

354
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,160
 and got off scot-free and was immediately promoted,

355
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,560
 and he was constantly promoted in his life.

356
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
 But it was weird, this battle,

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
 because one of the reasons he was lucky,

358
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,560
 I guess, was because he was quite,

359
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,280
 I guess he cheated,

360
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,920
 so he often went in disguise as another country,

361
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,320
 so in this battle it would have looked to the outsider

362
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,120
 like it was a Dutch ship fighting a British ship,

363
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
 because like you said, he thought it was the British

364
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,320
 because the Swedes had sent a ship to Britain

365
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
 to have the Brits fit it out

366
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
 with, you know, some good gear,

367
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
 and the Brits were sending their ship back at the time,

368
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
 so it looked like it was British

369
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
 because it was covered in British regalia,

370
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
 and then he himself disguised his ship as a Dutch ship

371
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
 so that he could sneak up on the enemy

372
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,480
 without them realising that he was the enemy.

373
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
 So it looked like a Dutch ship and a British ship,

374
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
 but it was actually a Dano-Norwegian and a Swedish ship.

375
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,840
 That's correct.

376
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
 It's unbelievable that anyone got anything done in this time.

377
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,960
 But what was the difference?

378
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
 Is it like the flag?

379
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,680
 I guess it's the flag that they're carrying, is it?

380
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,760
 I think it's mostly flags, yeah.

381
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
 It's not that everyone on board was like with a cup of tea

382
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
 and a bowl of hats and stuff and a monocle.

383
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,680
 There's Union Jack suits that had to do.

384
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,400
 He died aged about 30, didn't he?

385
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
 He was incredibly young when he died,

386
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,440
 and he died in a duel with a Swedish count

387
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,320
 who was over a disagreement about cards.

388
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,560
 It feels like he could have,

389
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,800
 it feels like whatever war it was could have gone the other way.

390
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,000
 What did he say? It was Great Northern War.

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,560
 Great Northern War.

392
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,680
 Well, it's like what Anna says.

393
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,760
 He was just incredibly brazen.

394
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
 And what happens is you get promoted to captain,

395
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,360
 then you get promoted to the next thing,

396
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
 then you get promoted to the next thing,

397
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
 but eventually your luck runs out and you get killed in a duel.

398
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,560
 But what happened was he was in this duel with this proper,

399
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,480
 what was he, captain or something like that, colonel.

400
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
 And the colonel was fully kitted out

401
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
 with proper war-like equipment,

402
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,920
 like proper swords and armor and stuff like that.

403
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,960
 Whereas all he had was his ceremonial sword,

404
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
 which was like might as well have been made out of plastic

405
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
 and come to a fashion price,

406
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,080
 because it didn't really work very well.

407
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
 And so as soon as he got in the duel, he had no chance.

408
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,600
 Oh, no.

409
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,240
 Yeah.

410
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,880
 Yeah.

411
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
 His name was given to him quite,

412
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
 it was after even this incident

413
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
 where he asked to borrow some ammunition.

414
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,040
 1716, he was given it.

415
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,120
 And Tordenskild translates as shield of thunder,

416
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
 like thunder shield.

417
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
 Such a such an awesome nickname to have.

418
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
 But yeah, it's interesting that that's what he's known as now.

419
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,920
 And it almost has been put as his unofficial,

420
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,320
 or rather look seemingly official surname,

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
 even the vessel.

422
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
 Well, it was his official title, I think,

423
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
 when he was knighted.

424
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,840
 That's what they knighted him as.

425
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
 Tordenskild shield of thunder,

426
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
 which would actually be a really useful shield

427
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,840
 if it was made of thunder.

428
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,080
 Doesn't work at all.

429
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
 But you'd only hear him coming like five seconds

430
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
 after he'd already attacked you.

431
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,080
 That's true.

432
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,800
 It's a good point.

433
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,560
 Hey, you know the brand of matches you mentioned

434
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,280
 at the start, Dan?

435
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,240
 Yeah.

436
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,680
 That are named after him.

437
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,720
 And they were named after him in 1882,

438
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
 when they were founded.

439
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,200
 And it was because Sweden had a monopoly on matchmaking

440
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
 and match exports.

441
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,120
 And so the free catchphrase of these matches

442
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,160
 was you can use these to once again strike at the Swedish.

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,080
 The idea was to take down their monopoly.

444
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
 Yeah.

445
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,840
 And they were bought by a Swedish company in 1972.

446
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,520
 In your face, Tordenskild.

447
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,560
 So Tordenskild won this war in the end or his side won it.

448
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,960
 And it kind of stopped the Swedes from being

449
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
 like an absolute massive country.

450
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,960
 So at that time, Sweden was huge.

451
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
 Like they were in charge of most of like Northern Europe.

452
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,200
 They even had a colony in North America at the time.

453
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,800
 They were kind of spreading out.

454
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,040
 And then it was kind of the Russians and the Dano-Norwegians.

455
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,520
 And the British were on both sides at various times

456
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,080
 of this conflict, but it was basically the Russians

457
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,640
 who wanted to stop the Swedish from being massive.

458
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
 And then when the Swedish lost, that was kind of the rise

459
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
 of Russia and Peter the Great and stuff like that.

460
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,760
 But what I found really interesting is in this war,

461
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
 there was quite a lot.

462
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,920
 I think there are three or four examples of women

463
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,920
 who fought on the Swedish side who were dressed as men

464
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,640
 and who no one realized until either they got caught

465
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,800
 or after the war and stuff like that.

466
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,360
 There was one called Elizabeth Olstotter

467
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,960
 who was actually executed afterwards on the charges

468
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,920
 of having dressed as a man and serving as a soldier.

469
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,200
 There was another one called Ulrika Stahlhammer

470
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
 who was let off because she did such good work for the army.

471
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
 So they caught her and they arrested her and stuff.

472
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,520
 And she got married to a woman, but they arrested her

473
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,640
 and she got off.

474
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,280
 But there was...

475
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,240
 Sorry, James, did she get married to a woman

476
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,920
 with the woman thinking she was a man?

477
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,040
 Well, it's controversial, Dan, you see, because they got caught

478
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,440
 and it went to court and they said that the woman

479
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,480
 didn't know anything and she only found out later on.

480
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
 But we're not sure what happened there.

481
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,360
 But because this was happening, because it was really famous

482
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,240
 that it was happening, it was used as an excuse

483
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,360
 by homosexual soldiers in the Swedish army

484
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
 because obviously that was illegal in Sweden as well,

485
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
 especially in the army.

486
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,920
 And whenever they got caught, they would say,

487
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,160
 "Well, we'd heard all these stories about these women

488
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,880
 pretending to be men, so we just assumed it was a woman."

489
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,440
 And apparently quite a lot of people got off

490
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
 because they used that excuse.

491
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 That is so slick.

492
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
 I just assumed that half the people on board this ship

493
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,560
 were very realistically women dressed as men.

494
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,640
 That's like...

495
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,760
 Is it Hannah Snell who was the famous person

496
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
 around about the same time, the famous British women

497
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,720
 who was in the Navy, who was in the Royal Marines, I think,

498
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,080
 and she was shot in the groin at one point,

499
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,560
 which is really awkward if you're a woman pretending to be a man.

500
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,400
 And so she had to extract the bullet

501
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,280
 and deal with the word completely herself to keep it secret.

502
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,600
 And she was just like, "Oh, wow, my balls!

503
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,680
 My balls! Oh, they're so soft!"

504
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,560
 I was going to say that would probably help with your secret,

505
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
 going, "Oh, lobbed right off!"

506
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,040
 I was looking into other sort of bizarre moments

507
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,440
 in naval wartime history.

508
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,000
 And just sticking with the Dutch for a second,

509
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,040
 the capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder, this was in 1795.

510
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,520
 And basically this was a battle between the Dutch and the French.

511
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
 And the Dutch were on a boat that was on a body of water

512
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
 that froze over while they were anchored.

513
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,880
 And so the French had the ability to not even need a boat

514
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
 or a ship to get to them.

515
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,120
 They went out on horseback with cavalry,

516
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,160
 and they fought a ship on horseback.

517
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,920
 It was a battle between cannons and men on horses with swords.

518
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,640
 And the French cavalry captured them.

519
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,160
 And it's extraordinary, the imagery.

520
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
 I just want to see the paintings of that.

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,880
 So good.

522
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
 Well, it's surely just by the cannons into the ice,

523
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,560
 create massive holes,

524
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,200
 and the horse is going to fall right through them.

525
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
 See, that's clever.

526
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,880
 Yeah.

527
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
 They needed my kind of leadership,

528
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
 because I think they just surrendered straight away, didn't they?

529
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
 Yeah, they couldn't run away.

530
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,400
 You know, Iran owns a fake US aircraft carrier,

531
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,280
 which is exclusively for the purpose of them attacking it.

532
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,800
 But the great thing is, it's reusable.

533
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,040
 This year, they had their third ever attack on it,

534
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
 where they symbolically sink it, basically.

535
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,840
 But unfortunately, this year, they tried it again,

536
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,200
 and it sank by itself.

537
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 And it's now created a shipping hazard,

538
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,320
 blocking a really important naval port, so they can't get to it.

539
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
 How is it reusable if you sink it?

540
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,320
 Can you bring it back up again or not?

541
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
 OK, so this is a really tricky thing.

542
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,560
 I think they didn't properly bomb it,

543
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
 as in when they do their displays,

544
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,840
 they might fly helicopters at it,

545
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,800
 they might fire it at a bit.

546
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,080
 But they're quite careful to,

547
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,000
 I think, fire it above the water line or whatever,

548
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,160
 so they don't properly sink it.

549
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,200
 And this year, it clearly decided it had enough,

550
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,320
 because it just sank.

551
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
 And they don't have salvage ships,

552
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
 so they now can't get it up either.

553
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
 Well, that sounds like good news,

554
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,920
 because it sounds like, based on that,

555
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,720
 they probably won't be actually attacking the US anytime soon.

556
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,440
 What are you on about?

557
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,920
 They now know exactly how to sink close these ships.

558
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,520
 Just do what all we have to do is try not to sink it.

559
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,600
 That's a good point.

560
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,680
 Do you know how you sink an ancient Greek trirheam?

561
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,360
 What's a trirheam?

562
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,080
 Is that a boat?

563
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
 With three sets of arms, is it?

564
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
 Yeah, exactly.

565
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
 Yeah, one of their boats.

566
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
 It sounds like the start of a joke, doesn't it?

567
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,240
 How do you sink a trirheam?

568
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,800
 Well, do you...

569
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,440
 They've all got holes that they row through,

570
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
 so do you just have to tilt it a bit

571
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
 so that the holes let the water enter?

572
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,240
 That's clever.

573
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,600
 That is clever.

574
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,520
 It's actually, that's how you don't sink it.

575
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,160
 So they would ram each other, right?

576
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,120
 They all had toughen prowls,

577
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,920
 and they would ram each other

578
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,160
 and try and sink each other that way.

579
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,200
 And the rams are often at the waterline,

580
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,920
 so if you hit them with the ram,

581
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,280
 that hole below the waterline,

582
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,160
 they're going to sink fast.

583
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,600
 So genuinely, if you were being attacked by another ship

584
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
 and you can't get out of the way in time,

585
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,960
 what they would do is everyone on board

586
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,280
 would run to one side of the ship,

587
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,360
 which is about to be hit by the ram.

588
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,960
 The ship tilts over into the water.

589
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,240
 Then when the ram hits, it's hitting a much higher bit.

590
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
 Then when you tilt back,

591
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,400
 it's hit somewhere that's above the waterline.

592
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,200
 Exactly.

593
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,840
 Isn't that insane as a defence tactic

594
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
 to run towards the massive battering ram

595
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,800
 that's about to hit your ship?

596
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,760
 That's amazing.

597
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,240
 But if you've half tilted your ship one way,

598
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,000
 isn't the battering ram just being given

599
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,760
 an easier job to flip you over entirely?

600
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
 It's not aiming to flip you over.

601
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,760
 It's not like a spatula.

602
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
 You're not flipping a pancake.

603
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,040
 Now, this isn't robot wars.

604
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,320
 Just mean by accident, not intention.

605
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
 Yeah, if Sir Killalot is approaching you

606
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,920
 with the battering ram, what are you…

607
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,160
 I don't think it would.

608
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,440
 If you're coming at that angle,

609
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,800
 I don't think the physics of that

610
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,640
 wouldn't cause your boat to capsize.

611
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,800
 Largely speaking, boats are designed

612
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,200
 so that they don't flip over that easily.

613
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
 Yeah, true.

614
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,560
 That's true.

615
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,240
 Well, although since…

616
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,840
 I mean, although some boats have flipped over,

617
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,640
 we all know that.

618
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,280
 But famously, we were talking about

619
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,320
 the Swedish Empire and what powerhouse it was.

620
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,880
 And when it was this huge naval power

621
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,640
 in the 17th, early 18th centuries,

622
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,600
 they thought to celebrate this,

623
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,160
 they built the world's best warship.

624
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
 And this was 1628.

625
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
 It was called the Vasa.

626
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,160
 It was 68 metres long.

627
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,640
 It was the most high-tech warship the world had ever known.

628
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,880
 It was painted in really stunning colours,

629
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,040
 scenes from the Swedish military victories

630
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,640
 of history all over it.

631
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,200
 And so thousands of people flocked to see it launch

632
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,160
 from harbour and it set off.

633
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,200
 And 20 minutes later, it tipped over and sunk.

634
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
 And they just built it too top-heavy

635
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,560
 and it keeled right over.

636
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,280
 Oh, my God.

637
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,800
 It's an amazing story.

638
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,080
 Is that the one they have in…

639
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,640
 That they have in…

640
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,520
 In Stockholm.

641
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,480
 In Stockholm, yeah.

642
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,040
 Oh, yeah.

643
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,160
 I just heard about that.

644
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,280
 They dredged it

645
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,440
 and they have built an entire museum around it.

646
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
 And you guys are not going to believe this.

647
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
 Can you see the mug I'm drinking from?

648
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
 It's got a ship on it.

649
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
 That ship is the Vasa.

650
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
 Look at the handle here.

651
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
 It says Vasa.

652
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,080
 How?

653
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,360
 We don't see it, Andy.

654
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,640
 Did you go see it when we were there?

655
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,120
 It's where I bought this mug.

656
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,080
 You should have taken me.

657
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,800
 I didn't know about it.

658
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,120
 I was busy dancing with holograms of ABBA

659
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,160
 at the ABBA Museum.

660
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
 I'd much rather would have been there.

661
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,000
 Some of us are doing long-range research

662
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
 for an episode of the podcast in two years' time.

663
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,280
 Nice try, mate.

664
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

665
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,640
 And that is Anna.

666
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
 My fact this week is that vanilla farmers in Madagascar

667
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
 stump their names on each individual pod on the vine.

668
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,000
 That was very offensive.

669
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,880
 That's incredible.

670
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
 Yeah, it's like when you're at school,

671
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
 you have to have your name sewn into all your clothes.

672
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,240
 It's the same kind of thing.

673
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,200
 Except this is to stop gangs of robbers

674
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
 from stealing your vanilla.

675
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,280
 No, that's why I have my name stitched into my clothes.

676
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,320
 Of course.

677
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,520
 To stop the gangs of robbers.

678
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,920
 You went to a pretty scary school didn't you, Eddie?

679
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,840
 They're really sweet, the little stumps as well.

680
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,080
 So this is because Madagascar

681
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,840
 is in the middle of a vanilla boom,

682
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
 or actually sort of coming out of a huge vanilla boom.

683
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
 So it produces 80% of the world's vanilla

684
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,360
 and price is just shot up a couple of years ago.

685
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,600
 And there are these vanilla gangs,

686
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,680
 these huge gangs and robbers at night who come

687
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,240
 and they strip your vines completely bare

688
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,160
 because it's going for so much money.

689
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,400
 And so now the farmers literally put that

690
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,320
 either their name or sometimes their serial number,

691
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
 a specific serial number on an individual pot.

692
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,800
 So if you see it on eBay later, you could be like,

693
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,120
 "Oh, that was stolen from my farm."

694
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,000
 One of the problems is that once your vanilla pot is ripe,

695
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,640
 you kind of need to leave it for quite a long time, don't you?

696
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,320
 You need to leave it for quite a few months

697
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,080
 to just get better and better and better.

698
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
 And the longer you leave it, the better it is.

699
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,280
 But the thieves know this.

700
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,840
 So if they get there early, then they have something

701
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,920
 which is still good enough to sell,

702
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,440
 but not quite as good enough

703
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,600
 that the farmer would like, it's a trade-off.

704
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,720
 Do you wait till the end

705
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,640
 so you get really high-quality product

706
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,040
 or do you take it early so the thieves don't get it?

707
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,600
 Yeah.

708
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,240
 Actually, that makes more sense of something I found out

709
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,880
 because the government has now banned people,

710
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,840
 the farmers in Madagascar from picking vanilla too early

711
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,040
 because they have to be shrink-wrapped

712
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,960
 if they're picked early and that can make them moldy

713
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,040
 and it lowers the content of vanilla,

714
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,960
 which is the main flavor chemical.

715
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
 And they, in fact, you know how governments

716
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,520
 sometimes burn smuggled or illegal goods in public

717
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,560
 so they'll burn ivory, for example, to destroy the market.

718
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,640
 They recently burned half a tonne

719
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,920
 of prematurely picked vanilla pods in public

720
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,000
 to kind of make an example about this law.

721
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,360
 Do you think that would have smelled nice?

722
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,000
 I bet it would.

723
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,800
 Ah, what does that mean?

724
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,680
 Oh, yeah.

725
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,760
 Like an amazing scented candle, a giant scented candle.

726
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,200
 They ran a huge bath next to it,

727
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,720
 people just relaxing music.

728
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,160
 That's amazing. The prices have leapt up,

729
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,040
 but weirdly, it doesn't seem to have leapt up specifically

730
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,680
 for the growers.

731
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,840
 There seems to be this middle group of people

732
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,560
 who distribute it, who are known as "vanillionaires"

733
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,000
 and they're the ones that are sort of really reaping the money

734
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,640
 and building up all these areas in Madagascar now

735
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,280
 from if you were living in a wooden, hutted house,

736
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,320
 they're now brick.

737
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,800
 Like, there's a big change going there as a result.

738
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,040
 Yeah, weirdly, the huge jump in prices

739
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,200
 doesn't seem to have made it back to the original producers.

740
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,320
 Yeah.

741
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,680
 What a surprise.

742
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,920
 Unusual situation in this world we live.

743
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,120
 Yeah, they're trying to write that wrong, aren't they?

744
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,520
 And actually, I read a very heartening article

745
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,800
 in, I think it was in the FT, which was saying that

746
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,720
 this is being clamped down on,

747
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,160
 and the reason it's being clamped down on

748
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,960
 is because buyers, as in us,

749
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,040
 are more discerning than they used to be.

750
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 So all the hipster sort of morally sound awareness

751
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,480
 of where your goods have come from

752
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,160
 means that there's a lot of pressure on big companies

753
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,480
 like Mars to actually make sure that you're not exploiting

754
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,000
 farms at the other end of the chain.

755
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,520
 And so what that means is, you know,

756
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,560
 the person who owns Mars goes to Madagascar,

757
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,200
 looks at farmers' situations, and tries to sort it out.

758
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,400
 And I think there's a project called

759
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,840
 Livelihoods Out There Now,

760
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,160
 which is making sure that the money's making it back

761
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,080
 to those original producers.

762
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,280
 But some people really did profit from growing them as well.

763
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
 There was a woman called Lydia Sower,

764
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
 who was interviewed in one article,

765
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,920
 who said that her husband was a fisherman a few years ago,

766
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,440
 and she wanted to plant vanilla,

767
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
 and her husband said, "No, absolutely not terrible idea."

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,440
 And she did it anyway.

769
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,360
 And it's now worth about...

770
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,400
 She's got a tiny little garden with a few vanilla pods in it,

771
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,160
 and it's worth about $8,000, which is massive, massive there.

772
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,240
 Although she was saying this very, very proudly

773
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,160
 to a woman called Victoria Mars,

774
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,000
 who was visiting and who does have an 8% stake in Mars,

775
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
 which, as this person pointed out,

776
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,280
 is annual sales are three times the size of Madagascar's GDP.

777
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,800
 But so, you know, it probably didn't...

778
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,600
 Her jaw didn't drop, but the sound was $8,000

779
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,400
 in the same way that this woman was hoping.

780
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,680
 You know how there are vanilla nerds, as you said, Dan, was it?

781
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,640
 There are also, I don't think anyone's called them this,

782
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,920
 "Vanigillantes."

783
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,080
 "Vanilla vigilantes."

784
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,520
 It's the thing I'm trying to get.

785
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,000
 Because, as Anna was saying, it's so much there.

786
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
 So a few years ago, 15% of all the vanilla on the planet

787
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
 was stolen, which is a hard...

788
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
 And some vanilla thieves would write ahead in advance.

789
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,720
 That's how brazen they got.

790
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,920
 They would write a note saying,

791
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
 "We are coming tonight. Prepare what we want."

792
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,040
 And that has actually led to quite a few deaths,

793
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,560
 because when these people have been caught,

794
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,080
 there isn't enough sort of justice available on the ground.

795
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,160
 So there are vanilla vigilantes now

796
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,240
 who are catching and even killing the thieves.

797
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
 That is brazen.

798
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,840
 They sound like they've taken a few leaves

799
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,040
 out of Peter Skulden things, but Thorne Skulde's book.

800
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,280
 But can't you get round the poaching by, you know,

801
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,840
 just changing your name to the name that's on the pod?

802
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,200
 You know, the guy in your article's called Leon.

803
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
 Couldn't I just arrive in town and change my name to Leon?

804
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,600
 Well, Anna also said, sometimes they put like codes and barcodes on.

805
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,640
 You can't change your name to 731-964.

806
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,040
 You could.

807
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,920
 I bet there's a child of a celebrity who's called that right now.

808
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,640
 Yeah, Elon Musk is up to something.

809
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,440
 You don't know what yet.

810
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,920
 And so vanilla grown, like you say,

811
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,440
 80% in Madagascar.

812
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,520
 But it's not originally from there, is it?

813
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,240
 It's originally from South America or South and Central America

814
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,840
 and North America, because Mexico,

815
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,120
 which is neither in South America nor in Central America.

816
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,240
 It's in North America.

817
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,200
 It's from Mexico.

818
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,120
 It's vanilla's from Mexico.

819
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,440
 And it was invented by this woman called Princess Zanat,

820
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
 who probably didn't exist.

821
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,560
 But she was Princess from the Tottenaco people.

822
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,320
 And she was Goddess, kind of, as well as being a princess.

823
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,520
 She was forbidden by her father from marrying a mortal.

824
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,160
 And she ran away to the forest with her lover,

825
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,080
 and they were captured and beheaded.

826
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,840
 And where their blood hit the ground,

827
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,400
 that's where the first vanilla pods grow.

828
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
 And that's where vanilla comes from.

829
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,640
 It was an arduous way to invent something, isn't it?

830
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,840
 And then it got taken over to Madagascar,

831
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
 more specifically, Reunion,

832
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,560
 which is where they learned how to grow it.

833
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,200
 And it didn't work for ages, because the pollen is inaccessible.

834
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,400
 The flowers are insane.

835
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,040
 They're fertile for 12 hours after they bloom.

836
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,440
 So if you're a vanilla farmer, there's big pressure.

837
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,120
 You can't just take the weekend off,

838
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,800
 assuming that it'll be all right when you get back.

839
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,520
 The flowers bloom for one day, yes, for this 12 hours.

840
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,560
 And in Mexico, obviously, there are insects

841
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,120
 which have evolved to fertilize the flowers.

842
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,040
 Only one species of bee.

843
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,280
 There's only one species of bee called a melipone.

844
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,920
 Who can do it?

845
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
 Although, actually, they've recently done a study

846
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,280
 and they don't even think it's that.

847
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,920
 Really?

848
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,400
 They always thought it was this one melipone bee.

849
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,720
 And they now can't...

850
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,600
 I haven't actually got any evidence that this even pollinates it.

851
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,080
 But it's not...

852
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,440
 Something's pollinating it.

853
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,320
 Something's pollinating it.

854
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
 Something in Mexico.

855
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,320
 That's all it comes.

856
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,640
 Yeah, so for years, they couldn't export it around the world

857
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,520
 because you don't have the bee or the hummingbird or whatever it is.

858
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,920
 So the method is hand fertilizing.

859
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
 You have to get in with a toothpick

860
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,960
 and rub the flowers, genitals together.

861
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,040
 And that's what fertilizes it.

862
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,680
 And that's what makes it produce the vanilla pods.

863
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,800
 And if you miss your window with a flower, you lose the pods.

864
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,280
 Yeah.

865
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,840
 You're sort of trying to make it have sex with itself, aren't you?

866
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,120
 Against its will.

867
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,560
 Yeah, not against its will.

868
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
 It's against its will.

869
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,960
 The reason they're so hard to pollinate

870
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
 is because they've got this lid

871
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,120
 between the male and the female parts of the plant.

872
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,920
 And the idea is that you don't really want to self- inseminate

873
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,680
 because, I guess, over many, many generations

874
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,080
 maybe that's bad for an organism.

875
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,440
 And so it's against the plant's will

876
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,920
 that you lift the lid very, very carefully

877
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,400
 and you dip into the answer, the female part,

878
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,880
 and you get the pollen out

879
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
 and you smear it all over the male part.

880
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,040
 Yeah.

881
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
 This is definitely a side of the #MeToo movement.

882
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,480
 I don't think any of us expected it.

883
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,000
 So this was first discovered

884
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,880
 by an enslaved man in Reunion called Edmund Albius.

885
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,520
 And he basically had this guy who was his boss

886
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,200
 and he was telling him how they make watermelons

887
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,520
 but how they can't do it with vanilla pods.

888
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,840
 And so Edmund Albius decided,

889
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,880
 "Well, okay, you say you can't, but let's have a go."

890
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
 And he started messing around with it,

891
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,120
 messing around with it.

892
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,960
 And he came up with this kind of technique

893
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,600
 where you use a little stick or a blade of grass

894
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,920
 and you flip up this little cap,

895
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,080
 which Anna was talking about called the Rustelum,

896
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,280
 and you flip it up and then with kind of a flip of the thumb,

897
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,240
 you move some of the male and female parts together

898
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,600
 and you smear them over each other

899
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,120
 and that's how you pollinate them.

900
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,760
 And that technique is still used today

901
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,280
 in Reunion for sure.

902
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,200
 And I think actually in Madagascar,

903
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,280
 I think all over they use this exact same thing.

904
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
 And then he was given his freedom,

905
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
 but he really struggled afterwards

906
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,880
 and ended up dying in poverty,

907
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
 especially as there was a French guy

908
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,800
 called Jean-Michel Claude Ricard

909
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,840
 who came over and said,

910
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,400
 "Oh, this was my idea. I came up with this."

911
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,360
 And he went back to Paris

912
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,640
 and he told everyone that he'd come up

913
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,440
 with this way of creating vanilla in Reunion.

914
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,000
 And everyone sort of faded him for being amazing

915
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,880
 but then the former owner of Edmund Delbyards

916
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,560
 came to Paris as well and said,

917
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,360
 "Mate, that's just not what happened.

918
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,160
 Like, it was this guy, Edmund Delbyards,

919
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,560
 who went round and teaching everyone else how to do it."

920
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
 And he's like a hero in Reunion

921
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
 and there's a statue of him quite near the airport

922
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,760
 and he's really famous.

923
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
 - What year was it? - It's a good lie to make up.

924
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
 - Yeah, but quite a Trumpian thing to do.

925
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
 - It is. - Just sort of wander into a country

926
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,880
 and be like, "I did that. That was me."

927
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,360
 - You know that thing which is like 4,000 miles away

928
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
 which no one can prove who did it?

929
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,560
 - That was me, yeah.

930
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,960
 (all laughing)

931
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,000
 - The longest cake ever made was vanilla flavoured.

932
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,880
 - What was it?

933
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,120
 - It was baked this year in South India in Kerala,

934
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,440
 state of Kerala and it was 10 centimetres wide

935
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,480
 but how long was it?

936
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,880
 - 10 centimetres wide is really thin.

937
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,240
 - That doesn't help you at all

938
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
 with knowing how long it is.

939
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,880
 - It kind of feels like it.

940
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,440
 - But can you tell us the air full area of the cake?

941
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,760
 - At the height, please.

942
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
 - Yeah, 2.4 kilometres.

943
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,440
 Very strong offer.

944
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,560
 - 20 kilometres.

945
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,680
 - 20 kilometres.

946
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
 - No, that's ridiculous.

947
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,120
 I'm 200 yards long.

948
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,480
 - Oh, shut up.

949
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,880
 And you said that it was in Kerala, not Kerala

950
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,920
 and down on Kerala.

951
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,320
 - How long was it? Come on.

952
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
 These interminable guessing games

953
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,680
 are completely destroying the experience of our guests.

954
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,080
 - It's true.

955
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,840
 It was six and a half kilometres.

956
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,120
 So James wins because he was close.

957
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,640
 It wasn't 20 kilometres down.

958
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,760
 - Where did they fit that?

959
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,560
 Because outdoors,

960
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,480
 you'd imagine you'd run into a lot of obstacles.

961
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,640
 It's very rare you get a six and a half kilometre run.

962
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,680
 - They did it in sections

963
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
 and it goes up and down a lot.

964
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,800
 It's a great deal.

965
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
 - Hang on. So it's not one?

966
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,400
 - It's not one single cake that's 6,000 metres.

967
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,720
 - You can't call that the longest cake.

968
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,400
 - That's not the longest cake.

969
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,440
 - The longest cake.

970
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,800
 - The longest cake is every cake

971
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,760
 that's been made on bake-up in the last 10 years.

972
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,200
 They may not have to be collected.

973
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,800
 - I'm so confused about what's happened here.

974
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,760
 - You can clearly see in the photos of the cake

975
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,840
 that there are sections which slot into place,

976
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,880
 but I think they're joined.

977
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,920
 They are all joined together.

978
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,360
 It's like a big cake snake.

979
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,320
 It weighed 27,000 kilos.

980
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
 And as I say, it was vanilla-favourite.

981
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,600
 Hence me, Metronica.

982
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,200
 - So one of the best books about vanilla,

983
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,240
 I would say the best book,

984
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,200
 is called "Travels in Search of the Vanilla Orchid" by Tim.

985
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,120
 - Sorry, James. Are you claiming to have read

986
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,480
 all the books about vanilla?

987
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,280
 Because it sounds a bit like you are.

988
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,880
 And then you've ranked them all.

989
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,320
 - It's a small field.

990
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,520
 It's a very small field.

991
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,360
 - And they're actually all,

992
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,720
 if you press them up against each other,

993
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
 they just make one long book.

994
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,960
 - It's just one month.

995
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,040
 - Tim Eckhart, who Andy and I at least know,

996
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,360
 he wrote the book about vanilla.

997
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,560
 And it is awesome.

998
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
 There's lots of stuff about the history of vanilla in there.

999
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,680
 When it came to Europe,

1000
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,920
 one of the reasons this guy was showing off about it

1001
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,880
 is because it was an absolute amazing thing.

1002
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,320
 So Louis the 15th would have soup made of vanilla.

1003
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,520
 Francisco Hernandez,

1004
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,840
 who was a physician to Philip II of Spain,

1005
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,320
 he said that vanilla could soothe the stomach,

1006
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,920
 cure the bite of a venomous snake,

1007
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,840
 reduce flatulence and cause the urine to flow admirably.

1008
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,960
 - So if you've just, if you've got a bad stomach

1009
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,400
 and you've just farted really loudly,

1010
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,000
 attracting the attention of a snake,

1011
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,040
 which has then bitten you and you need a piss.

1012
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,840
 - No, and your friend has been stung by a jellyfish.

1013
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,280
 So you need to urinate on them.

1014
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,680
 - Just one?

1015
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,200
 - One vanilla part will do that.

1016
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,960
 - Just one weird trick, yeah.

1017
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,120
 - Also, according to Bizarre Zimmerman,

1018
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,240
 who's a German physician from the 18th century,

1019
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,240
 he says that vanilla cured no fewer than 342 impotent men.

1020
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,040
 So they drank vanilla and it made them able to have sex again.

1021
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,720
 So if you were, if you'd farted really loudly

1022
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,960
 because of your bad stomach and a snake came along,

1023
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,080
 and a very beautiful person of the sex that you're attracted to

1024
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,680
 has been stung by a jellyfish, after you've urinated on them,

1025
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,720
 and they're so grateful you can then have sex with them.

1026
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,440
 - I'm so impressed by the admirable flow of your urine.

1027
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,000
 - This is a Bear Grylls episode, I'd love to see.

1028
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:42,240
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1029
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,840
 and that is James.

1030
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Russian football team,

1031
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,320
 FC Sakhalin, are based in such a remote town

1032
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,640
 that to get to their closest away game,

1033
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,760
 they have to travel one-sixth of the circumference of the earth.

1034
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,320
 - That's just amazing.

1035
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,760
 - It's incredible, isn't it?

1036
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,320
 Oh my days, like, this is incredible.

1037
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,600
 So this is a team based in the town of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,

1038
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,560
 which is in the far, far, far east of Russia,

1039
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,760
 and they're in the third division of Russian football,

1040
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,680
 and the way that the third division works in Russia

1041
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,880
 is it's such a big country,

1042
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
 they want all the teams to be kind of close together

1043
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,040
 because otherwise you have to spend so much money traveling.

1044
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,680
 So they put all the teams that are next to each other

1045
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,960
 playing each other,

1046
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,600
 but unfortunately there's no one else around this town

1047
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,360
 of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,

1048
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,800
 and so they've been put in with all the teams around the Black Sea

1049
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
 and around Dagestan and stuff like that.

1050
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
 And so when they play Krasnodar,

1051
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,400
 which is one of the teams in their league,

1052
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,360
 they have to, if they want to fly,

1053
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,960
 it would be at least 16 hours,

1054
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,520
 just over 16 hours to get to this game.

1055
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,280
 You could drive, but it's a 132 hour drive,

1056
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,200
 a total of 9781 kilometers

1057
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,360
 because you have to go a slightly weird way around.

1058
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,680
 And I looked at it on Google Maps and it says,

1059
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,920
 "Warning, this route includes a ferry.

1060
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,520
 This route has tolls.

1061
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,800
 This route has restricted usage or includes private roads.

1062
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,120
 Your destination is in a different time zone."

1063
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,960
 So it's not an easy place to get to.

1064
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,600
 So I'm suspecting stuff like this bit is guarded by a wizard.

1065
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,240
 This bit is.

1066
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,200
 At the time of writing,

1067
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,320
 they haven't won any away games this season so far.

1068
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,680
 They've won quite a few home games,

1069
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,120
 but they've not won any away games.

1070
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,400
 But they did have a few good seasons a while ago.

1071
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,320
 They won the league a couple of times in the last few years,

1072
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,760
 but they refused to get promoted

1073
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,200
 because if they get promoted,

1074
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
 they're going to have to start playing lots of teams

1075
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
 in different parts of Russia,

1076
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,000
 and then they won't be able to do this thing,

1077
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,440
 which they do, which is they go over

1078
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,720
 and they play loads of games at once,

1079
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,600
 and then they come back.

1080
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,760
 So they don't go every week, if you know what I mean.

1081
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,360
 That is clever.

1082
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:43,840
 Yeah.

1083
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,240
 Is the time difference between them and their nearest team

1084
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,960
 is eight hours?

1085
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,440
 It's so weird.

1086
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,520
 Well, the thing is, it's not their nearest team.

1087
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,880
 So if they played in the Japanese J League, for instance,

1088
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,120
 they're actually quite close to Hokkaido.

1089
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,920
 So let's say all the planes stopped,

1090
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,120
 and they had to play either against someone like Krasnodar

1091
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,520
 or someone around there or against Hokkaido.

1092
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,840
 It would take them two days quicker to get to Hokkaido

1093
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,320
 than it would take them to get to that part of Russia.

1094
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,720
 And that's if they were to walk to Hokkaido

1095
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,160
 and get a cart of Russia.

1096
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,480
 That's how much closer it is.

1097
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,680
 Like they could walk to the ferry,

1098
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,680
 get the ferry and walk to the football match

1099
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,320
 two days quicker than driving all the way across Russia.

1100
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,800
 Wow.

1101
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,360
 Yeah.

1102
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,840
 And we could, if they were doing that distance

1103
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,280
 and we had to do the equivalent,

1104
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,480
 we could drive to Moscow back again to London,

1105
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,880
 back to Moscow, back again to London,

1106
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,760
 and probably one more route before they even got there.

1107
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,280
 It's what a distance.

1108
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,480
 They're closer to the Seattle football team

1109
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,640
 in the American League

1110
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,800
 than they are to their nearest Russian rivals.

1111
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
 It's insane.

1112
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,280
 So there's not a lot of sort of

1113
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,120
 neighbourly antagonism is what you're saying.

1114
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,880
 It's not like Man United, Man City,

1115
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,560
 where you shag the wife of someone

1116
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,480
 who's now married the person across the street.

1117
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:58,960
 Exactly.

1118
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,080
 It's not like Liverpool, Everton,

1119
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,040
 where you literally cross one park to get to the other ground.

1120
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,000
 It's like, yeah.

1121
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,400
 Yeah.

1122
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:04,880
 It's incredible.

1123
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,720
 It's more like there are fault lines left over

1124
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,360
 from the Russo-Japanese War of 1905,

1125
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,040
 which is diplomatically tricky.

1126
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,840
 Wasn't James, wasn't there a bizarre thing

1127
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,560
 that happened with one of the British teams,

1128
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,520
 or two British teams,

1129
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,760
 that got to the final of some cup?

1130
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,680
 And they had to, it was Arsenal and someone, right?

1131
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,880
 They had to fly.

1132
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,960
 I think it was Chelsea against someone.

1133
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,800
 Chelsea Spurs or Chelsea Arsenal or something.

1134
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,120
 But yeah, then the final was in Baku, I think,

1135
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,080
 in Azerbaijan.

1136
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,200
 And they had to,

1137
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,960
 they both had to go all the way over there for it.

1138
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,280
 That was in the UEFA Cup, possibly.

1139
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,480
 Yeah.

1140
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,360
 Wow.

1141
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,480
 I didn't realise that this,

1142
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,720
 so this place is basically in the islands of Japan,

1143
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,040
 isn't it?

1144
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,120
 Pretty much, yeah.

1145
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,560
 I actually didn't realise that Russia claimed a portion

1146
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,840
 of what I would have,

1147
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,880
 if I'd looked at a blank map,

1148
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,080
 assumed towards Japan.

1149
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
 And I think, no, sorry, Putin,

1150
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,920
 really hope you don't listen to this, his show.

1151
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,120
 And I think, isn't the south half of the island

1152
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,080
 is Japanese, isn't it?

1153
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,000
 He turned off when we started making jokes

1154
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,120
 about short people, I think.

1155
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,320
 Oh yeah.

1156
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,440
 There were other podcasts.

1157
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,120
 Yeah, exactly, that's it.

1158
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,280
 It's basically a part of,

1159
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,440
 well, it's right on the border of Russia and Chepovo.

1160
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,120
 Geologically, I guess, it looks Japanese,

1161
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,480
 but it's a very disputed territory.

1162
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,920
 And there are still some islands,

1163
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,760
 the Kuril Islands, which are disputed.

1164
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,160
 But this is Russian sort of,

1165
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,480
 is Russian and is Russian a benested?

1166
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,200
 Yeah.

1167
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,080
 Yeah.

1168
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,680
 I don't know why anyone plays football in Russia.

1169
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,800
 It sounds like an enormous hassle for so many teams.

1170
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,080
 It's just, it's too big.

1171
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,080
 Even if you're playing for Vladivostok,

1172
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,640
 which at least is attached to it by land,

1173
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,480
 it's still, I think, 10,000 kilometers east of St. Petersburg.

1174
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,720
 So a week's train journey.

1175
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,080
 And I think there was quite a nice story in 2006

1176
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,680
 where three fans of Zenit St. Petersburg,

1177
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,280
 which is a football team there,

1178
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,120
 they drove to Vladivostok,

1179
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,280
 because Peter was playing an away game there.

1180
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,520
 So they drove the whole week and a half there.

1181
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,000
 Once they got there, their car broke down.

1182
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,920
 But to reward their loyalty,

1183
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,360
 their team gave them a new car.

1184
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,880
 Wow.

1185
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,520
 Oh, that's cool.

1186
00:49:59,520 --> 00:49:59,840
 Nice.

1187
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,160
 Of course, the reason that people play football in Russia

1188
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,520
 is because the Soviets like to force people to play football

1189
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
 back in the day.

1190
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,400
 Cool.

1191
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,440
 Actually, it was quite thought of as a bourgeois sport originally,

1192
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,200
 because it was brought over by Scottish people in particular.

1193
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,880
 And the first person who brought it over there

1194
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,560
 was a guy called MacPherson,

1195
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,480
 who was arrested after the revolution,

1196
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,520
 because they saw football as being a bourgeois European thing,

1197
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,200
 and they shouldn't be doing it in Russia.

1198
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,080
 But the first ever football match in Russia was in 1893,

1199
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,040
 and they squeezed it in between two tug-of-war competitions.

1200
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,120
 So there was a big tug-of-war thing happening,

1201
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,680
 and they were like,

1202
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,800
 "Well, what shall we do in the middle,

1203
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,720
 because we're just sorting out our rope or something?"

1204
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,480
 And they're like, "Oh, let's have a game of football."

1205
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,440
 So funny.

1206
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,240
 They cleared all the seven arms off the pitch

1207
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,760
 before they got the footballers on.

1208
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,640
 Oh, dear.

1209
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,480
 But yeah, handball,

1210
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,560
 and it's just the ball rolling over someone's hand.

1211
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,440
 (LAUGHTER)

1212
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,480
 And then the most famous team in Russia is Spartak, Moscow,

1213
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,680
 and they came along.

1214
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,200
 When the Soviets were controlling everything,

1215
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,400
 they were the team of the people,

1216
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,160
 and there was a load of brothers called the Starristan Brothers,

1217
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,920
 who started Spartak.

1218
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,520
 And then, very mysteriously,

1219
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,320
 they got sent to the Gulag about three or four years later,

1220
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,360
 because they started a, you know, people's football team.

1221
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,960
 But they were so popular

1222
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,640
 that when they got to Siberia,

1223
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,800
 they guarded Siberia and knew about them,

1224
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,360
 and so let them kind of practice their football.

1225
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,280
 And eventually, Stalin's son Vasily was so into football

1226
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,400
 that they brought Nikolai Starristan back from the Gulag

1227
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,800
 so that he could live with Vasily Stalin,

1228
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,320
 and he would just live in his house

1229
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,640
 because he was such a big fan of this footballer.

1230
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,920
 That's so awkward.

1231
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:43,920
 I know.

1232
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,960
 Imagine if Lionel Messi just moved in with you or something.

1233
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,440
 (LAUGHTER)

1234
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,600
 Even if you thought he was a great footballer,

1235
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,680
 I still think that would be awkward around the dinner table.

1236
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,560
 I think it would.

1237
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,680
 Pass me the salt,

1238
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,000
 and he doesn't have a head kick to you or something.

1239
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,680
 (LAUGHTER)

1240
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,840
 Stalin was, just speaking of Stalin,

1241
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,160
 was exiled to Siberia six times

1242
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,040
 between 1900 and 1913 and escaped five times.

1243
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,680
 Well, speaking of people who escape a lot

1244
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,400
 and the passing of someone quite famous,

1245
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,440
 Diego Maradona,

1246
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,680
 who passed away recently, very sadly,

1247
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,040
 he used to,

1248
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,160
 didn't he go and used to play football

1249
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,080
 at the request of Pablo Escobar

1250
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,400
 while he was in prison?

1251
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,760
 Just him and Pablo.

1252
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,240
 Just, yeah, well, I'm sure there were teams

1253
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,240
 that were put together.

1254
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,560
 But he had, at this particular point,

1255
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,920
 I think it was in 1991, Escobar was in quite a luxurious prison.

1256
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,800
 He kind of ran the prisons, didn't he, to begin with?

1257
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,960
 Of course, Escobar and Maradona had quite a lot in common.

1258
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,800
 They had some shared hobbies, didn't they?

1259
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,360
 Yes, they did.

1260
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,960
 (LAUGHTER)

1261
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,840
 Today?

1262
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,960
 Maradona was once sent home for the World Cup for taking cocaine.

1263
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,480
 I just cottoned on, as you guys said.

1264
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,080
 You thought maybe he also collected dojos

1265
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,480
 or whatever it was that Escobar had in his house.

1266
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,360
 Shall we talk about Siberia for a while?

1267
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,840
 Yeah, sure.

1268
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,680
 So, I was saying before about people being sent to Siberia,

1269
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,280
 in 1591, this is the earliest example

1270
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,880
 of anyone being sent to Siberia,

1271
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,160
 and it's not anyone.

1272
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,000
 This was a bell in Russia,

1273
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,760
 which was found guilty of sedition

1274
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,160
 and flogged and exiled to Siberia.

1275
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,040
 And that was because the bell had been rung

1276
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,720
 to celebrate the assassination of Dimitri's son Ivan the Terrible.

1277
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,360
 And so, the son had died,

1278
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,080
 and the locals were happy about it,

1279
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,200
 and so they rang a bell,

1280
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
 and then they put the bell in court

1281
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,640
 and sent it off to Siberia.

1282
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,520
 Was it because they couldn't identify any of the bell ringers?

1283
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,560
 So, was it a way of letting the bell ringers off the hook?

1284
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,840
 It could have been that.

1285
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,320
 That is the epitome of a workman blaming their tools,

1286
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,920
 really, where that came from.

1287
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,680
 It's not really the bell's fault, is it?

1288
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,360
 It doesn't feel like it.

1289
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,920
 It doesn't even know it's about.

1290
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,760
 It also feels like flogging a bell

1291
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,360
 is going to cause it to ring again,

1292
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,120
 and then you'll have to flog a bell.

1293
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,640
 This is never-ending cycle.

1294
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,880
 Have you heard of Magadan,

1295
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,880
 which is a very remote city,

1296
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,840
 kind of two days north of the nearest train tracks and things like that?

1297
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,160
 Just a very, very remote city in Siberia.

1298
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,920
 They have a mayoral position,

1299
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,600
 and they're having a nightmare filling out at the moment.

1300
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,280
 There have been zero applications

1301
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,440
 for the job of actual mayor of the city,

1302
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,280
 and there are 92,000 people in Magadan.

1303
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,080
 It's not a small place.

1304
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,400
 They've extended the deadline to mid-December,

1305
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,920
 so depending on when this goes out,

1306
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,200
 you might still be in time.

1307
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,800
 What happened to the previous mayor?

1308
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,240
 If the seven last mayors all died in suspicious circumstances or something.

1309
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,400
 It's a lot of people say

1310
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,640
 that you won't be able to change things properly,

1311
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,960
 and there's a fair bit of graft and corruption,

1312
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,360
 and it's probably a pretty thankless job.

1313
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,120
 But when the story broke for the first time,

1314
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,120
 there have been no applications.

1315
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,920
 The boss of a funeral firm from Tomsk, 4,000 miles away,

1316
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,120
 said he would apply,

1317
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,360
 and he said, "Of course, I don't know much about the city,

1318
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,520
 and it would be better if I had lived there a while,

1319
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,880
 but I've never had the chance."

1320
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,080
 So he said he's going to apply it.

1321
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,840
 His main policy is to build a crematorium.

1322
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,520
 Okay, well, that sounds like he's just going to be

1323
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,240
 greasing the palms of his crematorium friends, doesn't it?

1324
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,920
 We've never actually talked about the amazing Lukov family,

1325
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,880
 but if you're talking about the Siberian wilderness,

1326
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,720
 they're kind of the epitome of it.

1327
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,840
 So this is a family who basically fled the Bolsheviks

1328
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,600
 and in the 1920s, 1930s, family of four, I think at the time,

1329
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,200
 went into Siberia and just lived without ever seeing

1330
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,400
 another human soul until the 1980s.

1331
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,800
 And it is insane, their lifestyle.

1332
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,080
 They didn't bring much stuff,

1333
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,520
 so when their clothes started to fall apart,

1334
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,360
 they had to grow hemp from seed

1335
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,360
 in order to make new clothes out of that.

1336
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,920
 They wrote by dipping sharp birch sticks

1337
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,080
 into honey supple juice and writing,

1338
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,280
 but they raised this family

1339
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,640
 and there's one surviving member, Agafia Lukov,

1340
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,640
 and she is now in her 80s,

1341
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,760
 but she lives completely by herself in the middle of the tiger,

1342
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,040
 middle of nowhere, 150 miles from the nearest town,

1343
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,080
 1,000 meters high on this mountainside.

1344
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,760
 And she wasn't discovered until the 80s

1345
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
 when these geologists were flying over in a helicopter

1346
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,080
 and saw their tiny little hut that they were living in.

1347
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,200
 And they said they were kind of famous in Russia, weren't they?

1348
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,560
 In the 80s for a while.

1349
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,120
 When they were found in the 80s, they said to them,

1350
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,880
 "Oh, you guys probably don't know

1351
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,720
 that the Second World War has finished,"

1352
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,160
 and they went, "What's the Second World War?"

1353
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,400
 They'd went before then, that was in the 30s,

1354
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,560
 I think, or the 20s when they went, like, kind of sense.

1355
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,320
 But yeah, when they were found,

1356
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,760
 they were kind of taken around the country

1357
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,040
 as almost like a kind of a sideshow almost, I suppose,

1358
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,960
 which is like, look at these amazing people

1359
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,720
 that have been living in Siberia.

1360
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,760
 And Agafia Lukvo kind of was...

1361
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,200
 They said in one article I read that she saw aeroplanes,

1362
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,440
 horses, cars, and money for the first time,

1363
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,160
 but then basically said,

1364
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,520
 "I ain't having any of this shit.

1365
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,440
 I want to go back to where I live,"

1366
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,920
 because she says that whenever she leaves the town,

1367
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,520
 she always gets really bad asthma or, you know,

1368
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,320
 it's bad for her skin.

1369
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,240
 She just doesn't like, she doesn't like the noise

1370
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,120
 and all that kind of stuff.

1371
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,200
 So she's just kind of happy where she is now.

1372
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,080
 And every now and then they bring her, like, food,

1373
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,280
 I think, like, once a year, they bring her things and people.

1374
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,280
 People knit them socks and stuff, don't they?

1375
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,800
 And knit them things, I think.

1376
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,760
 Yeah.

1377
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,240
 Just earlier, when I said about the football team

1378
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
 going back on the route passing a wizard,

1379
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,920
 I mean, this is it.

1380
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,000
 Yeah, almost, yeah, yeah.

1381
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,960
 This is her.

1382
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,480
 It was really sad, actually, when they were discovered,

1383
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,240
 I think there were five of them.

1384
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,560
 And then in the 80s, they all suddenly died

1385
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,760
 and left her on her own.

1386
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,320
 But the thing that most amazed the dad,

1387
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,200
 he was told everything.

1388
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,600
 They were told about the moon landings.

1389
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,720
 They were shown a television,

1390
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,560
 which they became kind of addicted to

1391
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,760
 and then thought it was the devil,

1392
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,120
 so repented of it immediately.

1393
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,960
 They were told about the moon landings

1394
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,240
 and refused to believe they happened,

1395
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,520
 which is fair enough.

1396
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,520
 The thing that most amazed the dad was cellophane.

1397
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,320
 He saw this thing, which he was like,

1398
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,800
 it's like glass, but it crumples.

1399
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,240
 They couldn't believe it.

1400
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,040
 Yeah, and they didn't know what plastic bags were as well.

1401
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,280
 I remember reading, that was a new thing for them.

1402
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,440
 I believe Mick Jagger was flown in

1403
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,200
 to top his numbers up.

1404
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,040
 And they were like, yeah, of course, we know who this guy is.

1405
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,240
 But then the big problem now is,

1406
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,680
 they do go in there every now and then

1407
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,120
 and drop her some supplies.

1408
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,920
 And especially, like I said, people knit them socks

1409
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,280
 and knit them clothes and stuff.

1410
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,160
 But of course, with coronavirus,

1411
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,640
 you just do not want to be going into an area

1412
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,520
 with a very elderly lady who's not really had

1413
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,040
 any human contact for decades and decades and decades.

1414
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,440
 And so that's a real issue with them at the moment.

1415
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,880
 You know what they should do?

1416
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,200
 They should set her up on a date with,

1417
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,640
 do you remember that Brazilian guy,

1418
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,240
 the man of the whole, the most isolated man in the world?

1419
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,680
 They should get those two.

1420
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,680
 That would be a very charming rom-com.

1421
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,080
 We own the copyright, Mr. Spielberg,

1422
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,840
 just to say, because we mentioned it on here.

1423
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,440
 So we'll take 10% of it.

1424
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,640
 That's correct how that works.

1425
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,440
 Just one last bit of data before we go.

1426
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,160
 Okay, yeah.

1427
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,440
 In the breaks between facts, I texted Anne and Alex

1428
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,320
 to see if either of them had seen Mick Jagger live.

1429
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:08,880
 Yeah, go on.

1430
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,200
 Anne said, "No, I have not."

1431
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,160
 Okay.

1432
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,840
 And Alex said, "No, I don't really know who he is."

1433
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,160
 So James, if you want someone to talk to about this random guy.

1434
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,320
 Me and Alex are like the man of the whole

1435
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,360
 and the, you know, lady in Siberia.

1436
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,680
 Yeah.

1437
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,280
 Okay, that's it.

1438
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,240
 That is all of our facts.

1439
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,600
 Thank you so much for listening.

1440
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,360

1441
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,560

00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,920

 Yep.

1451
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,560
 Well, you can go to our group account at no such thing

1452
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,520
 or go to our website.

1453
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,440
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1454
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,120
 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

1455
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,120
 We have links to bits of merchandise.

1456
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,200
 And we also have a few live shows coming up.

1457
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,440
 So do check in there occasionally to see where to get tickets from.

1458
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,320
 Okay, that's it.

1459
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,640
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

1460
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,520
 We will see you then.

1461
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:14,960
 Okay, a good bye.
