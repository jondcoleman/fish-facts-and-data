00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.160
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.800
 Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.440
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.240
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that one in three people

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.160
 in the UK has seen the Queen in real life. Wow. That's insane. It feels high to me. There are

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.840
 about 70 million people in the UK. Shouldn't we start off with a survey of the people on this soon?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.400
 Yes 100% and I've got some extra data to add actually. I know that Dan has for sure because

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.560
 Dan's actually properly met the Queen. I went to Buckingham Palace. You slept with her, haven't you?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 It was Phillip. I slept with Phillip that she came in and served us tea in the morning.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.240
 I'm sure you can be arrested for this kind of comment. Definitely. This is now the treason cast.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.320
 Okay, so Dan has to Buckingham Palace Garden Party. Fine. Anna? I don't think so. Okay, data.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.960
 I need a lot of people, you know. We should ask the Queen about if she's that Anna.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.360
 Have you seen her though, Anna? Like have you, with your eyes in public, seen her? That's the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 other bit of it. No, not in public. The only reason I hesitate is because I know my siblings have

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.120
 met her because my brother's called Charlie and my... She meets all the Charlie's. It's a ceremony

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.040
 every year. Are they like swans? They're like the UK swans. All the Charlie's belong to the Queen.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.160
 He got a golden ticket and some chocolate. They let him meet the Queen, didn't they?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.800
 Yeah. I said that the wrong way round because my dad for his job met the... My parents met her

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 and my mum was holding my brother Charlie as a baby at the time and the Queen said to my mum

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.240
 what's he called and she said Charlie and the Queen said, "Oh, I've got a little Charlie as well."

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.400
 Wow, that's awesome. Which is weird because he would have been about 30 at that point.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.840
 Okay, so, no, but that's a no. James? Well, I think I have seen her. It's kind of... I was very

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.080
 young when it happened. I think when... When I was 10 years old, she came to Bolton, right?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.760
 Okay. To celebrate Bolton's 150th birthday and I think I stood on the street and saw her go past

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.120
 and I looked on the Bolton Even News website to see what happened and they said that everyone

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.280
 from age nine to 11 was given the morning off to go and see the Queen and I would have been 10,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 so that makes sense. But I asked my mum and she didn't remember it at all and I'm like,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.880
 "Yeah, but mum, I have kind of a memory and it's in the Bolton Even News that we were there,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.960
 so, Charlie, it must have happened." And she said, "Well, I had three young children and a full-time

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.320
 job, so how the hell am I supposed to remember stuff like that?" But I think I might have done.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.960
 Put you down as a half. Yeah. Okay. I'm a yes. Oh, yeah. Consec? Because she was visiting the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.040
 university I was at and she walked past, but no face time with her, no personal contact.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.360
 But I've also asked Ann Miller and Alex Bell, the other regulars, and they have both seen

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.720
 the Queen, Ann was a child and Alex was, I think, an ascot or something and saw a yellow blur

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.000
 in the distance, which he claims was the Queen. Was she on a horse, a yellow blur?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.120
 Yeah, she came in third. She did really well. But that's, how many is that? That's one, two,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.560
 and a half with James. I think I'm a one, Andy. I really do think, honestly, I think I've seen her.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.160
 So that's five out of six. Am I one and a half because I've touched her?

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.760
 Am I in a different category? You're not allowed to, Dan. That's the main thing.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.400
 What are you talking about? You're not allowed to touch the Queen.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.520
 Of course you are. No, you're not. Well, she touched me. She touched me. Oh, that's completely different.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.520
 You're rather...

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.080
 But that's one of the main rules. There's no touching.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.400
 But there aren't really any rules, right? It's just kind of etiquette. In fact, on the Royal

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
 Family website, I think maybe they're trying to play it cool, but they strictly say they're

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.720
 in no obligatory codes of behaviour at all when you beat the Queen. You can pull your trousers

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.960
 down if you like. You will be shocked. Dan, you actually did pull your pants down, didn't you?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.800
 And said, "Hey, I've got a little Charlie of my own." Oh, no.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.360
 Oh, next week's episode coming to you live from the Tower of London.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.600
 It is nerve-wracking, though, all the protocols. So I met her at Buckingham Palace. It was part of

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.640
 a party in celebration of her heading to Australia, and I got sent an invitation,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.880
 as supposedly a notable Australian, which is so bizarre. And you get with the invitation,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.280
 you get this extraordinary list of protocol of how you approach the Queen if you meet her,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.920
 what to say, how to use Mam the first time, and then Her Majesty. I've got the order

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.920
 wrong in that, but it's stuff like that. Sorry, you've also got the pronunciation wrong,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.280
 according to the Royal Family official website. They're very strict. Is it Mam?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.400
 It's Mam. It's the only bit of protocol, they say, is a rule addressed as Mam as in Jam.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.600
 Well, she's from the Northeast, isn't she? So she always calls herself Mam.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.720
 It's never Mum. It's always Mam. But sorry, Dan, go on.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.760
 No, I'm just saying, with all that playing in your head, it's a very nerve-wracking

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.480
 experience. You find it very hard to be present in the moment when you're meeting the Queen

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.240
 and shaking her hand. Philip, less so, because you're just waiting for him to say something

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.760
 a bit routine, which I was hoping for. He must have been in his element with all those Australians.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.800
 Yeah, exactly. He just had to bite his tongue. He genuinely, when I shook hands with him,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.080
 he kind of lent in as if he was going to say something and just went, "Ah, not worth it."

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.920
 This little shake of his head just went, "Ah, I don't need this today."

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.120
 But he didn't say, "Not worth it." His eyes said that.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.160
 No, but you could tell with his look. His eyes said, "Well, because I got in a fight later on

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.960
 with one of his sons, Prince Edward, who came up." Who won?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.840
 He did, because I was in his house. He kind of just sort of won it by default.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.000
 He knows where the weapons are. Yeah. He doesn't like QI, by the way.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.160
 So he kind of insulted all of us. It's awkward.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.000
 Yeah. He said, "Oh, is it that pompous show with the pompous Stephen Frye who pretends to know

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.560
 all these facts?" Well, at least he has seen it. Yeah.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.680
 Christ, I think the Royal Family wants to talk about pomposity.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.560
 That's true. Stephen Frye never insisted on a gold carriage, not for the first three series,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.720
 anyway. So, Dan, you're not the only eminent Australian to have met the Queen.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.000
 I mean, it would be insane if you were a part of the party.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.440
 But this sort of ties in with the touching thing and the etiquette about not touching the Queen,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.680
 unless you're shaking hands with her or whatever. But she visited Australia in 1992,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.280
 which I guess was the time before Dan, your garden party with her.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.720
 But the PM at the time, Paul Keating, he put his arm around her,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.160
 not in a kind of cinema-yorn stretch way, but he sort of just put his hand on the small of her

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.160
 back. And the British papers called him the Lizard of Oz as a result. Yeah. One newspaper wrote,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.800
 "Mr Keating, in placing his hand in the centre of her back, was actually touching that little

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.880
 fastener, which is the miniature linchpin of all women's femininity."

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.000
 What? Is that a thing? It is. And how did they get hold of that secret?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.400
 We were sworn to keep it under wraps.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.800
 But the Queen, actually, it's not a linchpin. It's one of those strings that you pull out.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.280
 When you pull it out, she goes, "How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? How do you do?"

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.320
 I think it's implying that he was trying to unhook her bra.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800
 Is it the minute? It says the minute little fastener,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 which is the miniature linchpin of all women's...

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.080
 Not lower back.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.080
 Oh, no, it wasn't. Sorry, it was just a medium back.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.960
 You don't... bras don't descend down your torso as the oppressors do.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.760
 It's not like elderly women have got their bras around their waist.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.400
 You know what? We're learning a lot here today, aren't we?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.200
 This is... Yeah.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.120
 Real lesson for the lads.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.480
 But you shrink when you're older, so your back gets smaller, doesn't it?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.200
 It just gets closer... Your shoulders get closer to your bum, naturally.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.600
 I guess.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:19.680
 This thing about one-third of Britain's having seen the Queen was part of a survey by Yougoth,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.280
 wasn't it? And so I looked at some of the other things in that survey.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.480
 And so 22% of people have seen Prince Philip. So that's one in five-ish.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.480
 The next most commonly seen is Princess Anne on 17%.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.200
 Only 1% have seen Meghan Markle.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.880
 She was the least, but she's not been going for as long as she...

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.520
 No, that's true.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.800
 She's a new character.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.880
 Prince Harry was the same. It's 3% of 65-year-olds and over have seen him,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.040
 and only 5% of 18 to 24-year-olds.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.760
 And it's just because the Queen has been going for so long

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.320
 and has been doing so many visits all over the place.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.640
 So for people over the age of 65, 49% have either seen or met her,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.160
 which I just find insane.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.800
 Well, it's true. It's like when she came to Bolton,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.520
 it was just to get her numbers up, really, because she got all the kids along the street,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.200
 and she's like, "Well, this is another 200,000 people that can access the list."

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.840
 She's playing a long Pokemon game with all of us.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.120
 We are the Pokemon.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.040
 It's Pokemon Comuna, isn't it?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.000
 She's got a list of all the Comunas in the country, and she's just taking them all off.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.160
 The list of people that she's met, I read that she has met over a quarter

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.920
 of all the US presidents ever.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.320
 She's met something close to it.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.800
 Yeah, she's met something close to 30% of all the presidents that America has ever had.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.760
 That is insane.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.280
 That is breaking news for me.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.760
 I was trying to find the most famous person the Queen hasn't met,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.320
 and so I went on to Google and searched for who's the most famous person in the world,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.160
 and then went down the list to see,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.600
 and Google has the Queen met this person, has the Queen met this person.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.680
 Well, I didn't have to go that far, because as far as I can see, she hasn't met Justin Bieber.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.440
 And Google thinks that he's one of the most famous people in the world.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.840
 They've never been seen in the same room at the same time, have they?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.560
 Well, you see, Justin Bieber is another person whose shoulders are quite close to his bum,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.600
 isn't he, because he's a very small man.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.160
 Because I was reading about people who have met Justin Bieber,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.160
 and Freddie Flintoff, a cricketer who is an extremely tall guy,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.760
 he went to meet him, he got a meet and greet with his kids and his wife,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.240
 and they went down the queue and they got to the front,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.000
 and the kids got to see Justin Bieber,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.680
 but the Justin Bieber staff wouldn't let Freddie Flintoff go anywhere near him,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.640
 and they said he doesn't like big guys.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.480
 Because if you have Freddie, who's like six, four, six, five, something like that,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.240
 standing next to Justin Bieber, he's going to look like a little tiny bloke.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.640
 Yeah, it's like why he only hangs out with Tom Cruise and people like that, Justin Bieber.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.920
 Yeah, yeah, also Justin Bieber is why he wears his trousers so low,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.200
 is because he's trying to make it look like a distance from his shoulders to his bum,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.640
 is greater than it actually is.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.280
 There are only a few inches apart, actually.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.400
 The Royal Family have banned commoners from wearing their official tartan.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.520
 Can you believe this? Prince Albert designed the tartan for the family, for the firm,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.600
 in 1853, and then several decades later in 1937,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.760
 there was a tartan manufacturer who wrote to them saying,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.160
 "Oh, this is a lovely tartan and we'd love to make it."

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.080
 And the keeper of the previous purse wrote back saying,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.760
 "Absolutely not. You may not make this as exclusively for the royal use."

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.840
 Anyway, you would think that was in 1937.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.200
 Things might have changed a bit since then.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.760
 In 2016, the palace confirmed that this remains in place.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.120
 There is one person in the world who is not a member of the Royal Family,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.120
 who is allowed to wear the tartan.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.680
 Can we guess?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.680
 It's guessable as well.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.720
 It's definitely guessable.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.600
 Nicola Sturgeon.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.760
 It's not Nicola Sturgeon.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.040
 Is it one of the crankies, if any of us are still alive?

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.080
 It's Jimmy Cranky.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.120
 No, it's not.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.280
 Is it the person who tries on stuff for the queen?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.960
 No, brilliant guess.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.880
 Is it the winner of the caber toss in every year's Highland Games?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.320
 It's another lovely, lovely guess.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.440
 It's not, it's a bit further away.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.440
 That would be a great prize, wouldn't it?

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.480
 Is it someone Scottish?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.160
 Does it have to be someone Scottish in this?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.360
 It's someone who is almost certainly going to be Scottish due to their job.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.080
 It's someone who might be wearing tartan as a matter of course.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.320
 The person who paints the fourth rail bridge.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.800
 No, it's not that.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.040
 It's the backpiper on Princess Street,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.520
 who annoys everyone every morning during the festival.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.760
 You were so, you know what?

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.640
 I think just to end this torture competition, I'm going to say yes.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.480
 It's her alarm clock, her backpiping alarm clock man.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.440
 Her backpiping alarm clock man as the official role is, yes.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.760
 Wow.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.480
 I know.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.920
 That's another incredibly long-lasting thing.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.880
 There have only been 15 royal backpipers since 1843,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.560
 and they have to play for her every weekday morning,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.360
 not every morning of the week.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.920
 She's not a masochist, for 15 minutes they play.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.240
 And apparently she doesn't ever want to hear the same tune twice.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.240
 So it's a nightmare because there was one called Gordon Webster

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.200
 who said he had to know about seven or 800 different tunes.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.760
 They must be, yeah, but they must be running out by now.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.520
 Like how long has she been queen?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.640
 60 years, what is it?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.680
 Something like that.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.240
 And then every morning, apart from the weekends,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.520
 she's had a different tune.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.240
 They must be getting, they must be kind of getting down to the,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.560
 "All right, I'm going to do the killers today."

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.560
 And she had that one.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.560
 Well, she's had Mr Brightside, but she hasn't.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.480
 That's a cool way to inform her of like the latest charts.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.120
 You just start playing the latest Ariana Grande.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.880
 I don't know if she needs to be informed with the latest charts.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.320
 Is that something that she demands?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.680
 Well, maybe, you know, when she meets Bieber one day,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.960
 she can say, "Love yourself."

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.520
 Can I do one more guessing game?

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.880
 Because Andy's one went so loud.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.200
 According to Ben Shart, who I think we all kind of trust,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.360
 writing in the spectator, a brilliant sort of collector of trivia,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.520
 who do you think is the most seen human ever to have lived?

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.320
 As in the person that most people have seen in real life.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.040
 Oh, wow.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.240
 So someone who's done huge events and rallies and things like that,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.920
 is it Donald Trump?

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.440
 Nope.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.440
 Is it a politician from a really popular country, like Xi Jinping?

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.480
 Oh, good call.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.440
 Narendra Modi.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.440
 Oh, is it Dalai Lama?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.120
 Ben Shart thinks none of those.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.000
 Ben Shart thinks it is probably Mick Jagger.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.080
 And that's because he's been going for so long,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.000
 so long at playing in front of massive, massive audiences,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.400
 non-stop and non-stop and non-stop, and out of all the...

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.800
 Is he from the Rolling Stones?

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.760
 Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.200
 Of all the Rolling Stones.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.320
 He does most of it.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:46.720
 Sorry.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.600
 What a slam on the most seen man on earth.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.720
 You don't deserve this fact.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.560
 You don't deserve to be saying this fact.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.520
 Oh, my God.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.320
 Hang on.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.360
 Can we just do a little straw poll among us?

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.240
 Who's seen...

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.960
 We know James has it.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.680
 Who knows who he is?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.760
 I might have done for all I know.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.960
 I don't think I have seen the Rolling Stones at any stage,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.000
 any of them, I don't think.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.720
 I've seen Jagger.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.800
 I've seen all of them because I went to a gig once.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.440
 Me too.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.400
 I've not.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.280
 Dan, no.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.280
 No.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.920
 Surprising.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.800
 No, very surprising.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.640
 So the Queen in our little straw poll.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.680
 Can you ask Alex Bell at Dan Miller as well, please, Andy?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.640
 Yeah, I'll draw him a text.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.240
 Yeah, Jagger was on the horse behind the Queen.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.080
 Oh, that's such a good answer.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.680
 While we're just talking of rock stars,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.640
 I've been reading Elton John's autobiography called Me,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.120
 which is unbelievably good, very scandalous.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.000
 And he meets with the Queen quite a few times in the book.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.960
 And he tells a story in it where he was at a party

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.720
 and he saw the Queen approaching a man called Viscount Lindley.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.360
 And she asked him to look on after his sister

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.840
 who'd been taken ill and retired to her room.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.520
 So he said, "Go and look after her."

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.360
 And he kept just partying.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.240
 And so once he was fobbing the Queen off too many times,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.040
 she went up to them, and this is what Elton John saw.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.880
 You know that thing of saying a single word

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.040
 and slapping a cheek of someone back and forth

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.200
 in between the words that you see in movies?

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.400
 She says that the Queen went up to Viscount Lindley

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.240
 and went, "Don't slap, argue with me.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.920
 I am the Queen."

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.520
 And then he went off to look after the daughter.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.480
 And then Elton says the Queen then turned to Elton.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.280
 She stared at him and gave a little wink and walked off.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.160
 That's what he says.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.280
 I mean, it might have happened.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.040
 It's in the book.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.360
 He's Elton John's a fantasist.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.280
 I'm not sure he is.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.560
 I think he tells the truth.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.200
 Is that... I mean, can that have happened?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.160
 No, because it's...

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.680
 No, I do remember actually in Prince's biography,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.360
 he says that he saw the Queen slamming Prince Edward's head

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.200
 in the fridge door repeatedly.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.040
 Because he said he didn't like QI.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.800
 She said, "You should watch QI. It's very funny."

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:08.720
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.440
 My fact this week is that in 1714,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.440
 when a Dutch ship ran out of ammunition 14 hours into a battle,

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.560
 the captain sent a boat over to the enemy asking to borrow

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.760
 some gunpowder and cannonballs so they could continue the fight.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.880
 And did they give them the cannonballs?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.840
 No.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.280
 Can we borrow them as quite good?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.240
 We'll give them back.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:38.320
 Yeah, no, I think it was seen as a sort of a bit of a cheeky surrender,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.880
 really, because the captains actually,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.720
 I don't know if it was the humour of it,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.440
 ended up having a drink and toasting each other,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.400
 sending some compliments very nicely for it, well done,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.240
 and then off they went on their ways.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.640
 So neither ship was sunk in the end and neither was captured.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.720
 So quite a good ending.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.080
 So yeah, so this is a story to do more with the captain,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.480
 whose name was Peter Janssen Vessel, otherwise known as Tordenschild,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.040
 and he was a Dano-Norwegian nobleman who was,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.960
 he's very famous in sort of the history now of Denmark.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.280
 There's statues of him in Copenhagen,

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.880
 the most popular brand of matches, has his image on it.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.120
 He's mentioned in the Royal National Anthem,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.200
 he was sort of a big character at the time,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.120
 but this was quite an infamous incident

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.800
 in what was known as the Great Northern War.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.640
 He was captaining this Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy ship,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.200
 and he ran into what they thought was a British ship,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.960
 but was actually Swedish,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.840
 and it was a much bigger ship than what he had.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.320
 He never should have engaged in a fight with it,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.200
 in a battle with it,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.760
 and so he was reprimanded when he got back

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.720
 for having done that,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.600
 for risking everyone's life and the ship itself.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.880
 So that he survived,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.640
 but it kind of didn't work out for him for a while.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.360
 Well, although he fought his case

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.640
 and won it in the end, didn't he?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.480
 He was such a brazen man

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.200
 that it seemed like he just always got away with the stuff.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.360
 He seemed to be always doing things like this,

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.960
 and yeah, like you say, he was reprimanded,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.320
 he was court-martialed,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.400
 and he managed to find an obscure piece of naval law

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.200
 which got him off,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.960
 so he was court-martialed because he persisted much too long,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.880
 but then he found a bit of law that said

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.760
 that you have to pursue any ship that's fleeing you,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.160
 and got off scot-free and was immediately promoted,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.560
 and he was constantly promoted in his life.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.760
 But it was weird, this battle,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.280
 because one of the reasons he was lucky,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.560
 I guess, was because he was quite,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.280
 I guess he cheated,

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.920
 so he often went in disguise as another country,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.320
 so in this battle it would have looked to the outsider

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.120
 like it was a Dutch ship fighting a British ship,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.960
 because like you said, he thought it was the British

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.320
 because the Swedes had sent a ship to Britain

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.240
 to have the Brits fit it out

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.160
 with, you know, some good gear,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.480
 and the Brits were sending their ship back at the time,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.600
 so it looked like it was British

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.200
 because it was covered in British regalia,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.400
 and then he himself disguised his ship as a Dutch ship

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.080
 so that he could sneak up on the enemy

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.480
 without them realising that he was the enemy.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.080
 So it looked like a Dutch ship and a British ship,

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.960
 but it was actually a Dano-Norwegian and a Swedish ship.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.840
 That's correct.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.720
 It's unbelievable that anyone got anything done in this time.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.960
 But what was the difference?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.760
 Is it like the flag?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.680
 I guess it's the flag that they're carrying, is it?

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.760
 I think it's mostly flags, yeah.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.400
 It's not that everyone on board was like with a cup of tea

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.480
 and a bowl of hats and stuff and a monocle.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.680
 There's Union Jack suits that had to do.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.400
 He died aged about 30, didn't he?

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.920
 He was incredibly young when he died,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.440
 and he died in a duel with a Swedish count

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.320
 who was over a disagreement about cards.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.560
 It feels like he could have,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.800
 it feels like whatever war it was could have gone the other way.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.000
 What did he say? It was Great Northern War.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.560
 Great Northern War.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.680
 Well, it's like what Anna says.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.760
 He was just incredibly brazen.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.080
 And what happens is you get promoted to captain,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.360
 then you get promoted to the next thing,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.640
 then you get promoted to the next thing,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.200
 but eventually your luck runs out and you get killed in a duel.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.560
 But what happened was he was in this duel with this proper,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.480
 what was he, captain or something like that, colonel.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.440
 And the colonel was fully kitted out

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.280
 with proper war-like equipment,

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.920
 like proper swords and armor and stuff like that.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.960
 Whereas all he had was his ceremonial sword,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.600
 which was like might as well have been made out of plastic

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.720
 and come to a fashion price,

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.080
 because it didn't really work very well.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.960
 And so as soon as he got in the duel, he had no chance.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.600
 Oh, no.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.240
 Yeah.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.880
 Yeah.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.120
 His name was given to him quite,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.280
 it was after even this incident

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.520
 where he asked to borrow some ammunition.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.040
 1716, he was given it.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.120
 And Tordenskild translates as shield of thunder,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.320
 like thunder shield.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.960
 Such a such an awesome nickname to have.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.440
 But yeah, it's interesting that that's what he's known as now.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.920
 And it almost has been put as his unofficial,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.320
 or rather look seemingly official surname,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.280
 even the vessel.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.960
 Well, it was his official title, I think,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.160
 when he was knighted.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.840
 That's what they knighted him as.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.440
 Tordenskild shield of thunder,

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.960
 which would actually be a really useful shield

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.840
 if it was made of thunder.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.080
 Doesn't work at all.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.080
 But you'd only hear him coming like five seconds

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.360
 after he'd already attacked you.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.080
 That's true.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.800
 It's a good point.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.560
 Hey, you know the brand of matches you mentioned

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.280
 at the start, Dan?

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.240
 Yeah.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.680
 That are named after him.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.720
 And they were named after him in 1882,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.000
 when they were founded.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.200
 And it was because Sweden had a monopoly on matchmaking

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.240
 and match exports.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.120
 And so the free catchphrase of these matches

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.160
 was you can use these to once again strike at the Swedish.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.080
 The idea was to take down their monopoly.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.200
 Yeah.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.840
 And they were bought by a Swedish company in 1972.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.520
 In your face, Tordenskild.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.560
 So Tordenskild won this war in the end or his side won it.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.960
 And it kind of stopped the Swedes from being

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.480
 like an absolute massive country.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.960
 So at that time, Sweden was huge.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.880
 Like they were in charge of most of like Northern Europe.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.200
 They even had a colony in North America at the time.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.800
 They were kind of spreading out.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.040
 And then it was kind of the Russians and the Dano-Norwegians.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.520
 And the British were on both sides at various times

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.080
 of this conflict, but it was basically the Russians

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.640
 who wanted to stop the Swedish from being massive.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.880
 And then when the Swedish lost, that was kind of the rise

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.640
 of Russia and Peter the Great and stuff like that.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.760
 But what I found really interesting is in this war,

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.600
 there was quite a lot.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.920
 I think there are three or four examples of women

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.920
 who fought on the Swedish side who were dressed as men

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.640
 and who no one realized until either they got caught

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.800
 or after the war and stuff like that.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.360
 There was one called Elizabeth Olstotter

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.960
 who was actually executed afterwards on the charges

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.920
 of having dressed as a man and serving as a soldier.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.200
 There was another one called Ulrika Stahlhammer

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.400
 who was let off because she did such good work for the army.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.240
 So they caught her and they arrested her and stuff.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.520
 And she got married to a woman, but they arrested her

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.640
 and she got off.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.280
 But there was...

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.240
 Sorry, James, did she get married to a woman

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.920
 with the woman thinking she was a man?

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.040
 Well, it's controversial, Dan, you see, because they got caught

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.440
 and it went to court and they said that the woman

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.480
 didn't know anything and she only found out later on.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.640
 But we're not sure what happened there.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.360
 But because this was happening, because it was really famous

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.240
 that it was happening, it was used as an excuse

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.360
 by homosexual soldiers in the Swedish army

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.080
 because obviously that was illegal in Sweden as well,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.360
 especially in the army.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.920
 And whenever they got caught, they would say,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.160
 "Well, we'd heard all these stories about these women

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.880
 pretending to be men, so we just assumed it was a woman."

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.440
 And apparently quite a lot of people got off

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.600
 because they used that excuse.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 That is so slick.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.360
 I just assumed that half the people on board this ship

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.560
 were very realistically women dressed as men.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.640
 That's like...

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.760
 Is it Hannah Snell who was the famous person

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.520
 around about the same time, the famous British women

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.720
 who was in the Navy, who was in the Royal Marines, I think,

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.080
 and she was shot in the groin at one point,

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.560
 which is really awkward if you're a woman pretending to be a man.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.400
 And so she had to extract the bullet

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.280
 and deal with the word completely herself to keep it secret.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.600
 And she was just like, "Oh, wow, my balls!

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.680
 My balls! Oh, they're so soft!"

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.560
 I was going to say that would probably help with your secret,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.320
 going, "Oh, lobbed right off!"

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.040
 I was looking into other sort of bizarre moments

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.440
 in naval wartime history.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.000
 And just sticking with the Dutch for a second,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.040
 the capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder, this was in 1795.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.520
 And basically this was a battle between the Dutch and the French.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.960
 And the Dutch were on a boat that was on a body of water

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.360
 that froze over while they were anchored.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.880
 And so the French had the ability to not even need a boat

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.320
 or a ship to get to them.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.120
 They went out on horseback with cavalry,

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.160
 and they fought a ship on horseback.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.920
 It was a battle between cannons and men on horses with swords.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.640
 And the French cavalry captured them.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.160
 And it's extraordinary, the imagery.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.000
 I just want to see the paintings of that.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.880
 So good.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.040
 Well, it's surely just by the cannons into the ice,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.560
 create massive holes,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.200
 and the horse is going to fall right through them.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.400
 See, that's clever.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:16.880
 Yeah.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.080
 They needed my kind of leadership,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.080
 because I think they just surrendered straight away, didn't they?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.840
 Yeah, they couldn't run away.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.400
 You know, Iran owns a fake US aircraft carrier,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.280
 which is exclusively for the purpose of them attacking it.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.800
 But the great thing is, it's reusable.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.040
 This year, they had their third ever attack on it,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.040
 where they symbolically sink it, basically.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.840
 But unfortunately, this year, they tried it again,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.200
 and it sank by itself.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200
 And it's now created a shipping hazard,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.320
 blocking a really important naval port, so they can't get to it.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.720
 How is it reusable if you sink it?

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.320
 Can you bring it back up again or not?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.480
 OK, so this is a really tricky thing.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.560
 I think they didn't properly bomb it,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.560
 as in when they do their displays,

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.840
 they might fly helicopters at it,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.800
 they might fire it at a bit.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.080
 But they're quite careful to,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.000
 I think, fire it above the water line or whatever,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.160
 so they don't properly sink it.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.200
 And this year, it clearly decided it had enough,

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.320
 because it just sank.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.440
 And they don't have salvage ships,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.960
 so they now can't get it up either.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.400
 Well, that sounds like good news,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.920
 because it sounds like, based on that,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.720
 they probably won't be actually attacking the US anytime soon.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.440
 What are you on about?

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.920
 They now know exactly how to sink close these ships.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.520
 Just do what all we have to do is try not to sink it.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.600
 That's a good point.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.680
 Do you know how you sink an ancient Greek trirheam?

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.360
 What's a trirheam?

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.080
 Is that a boat?

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.000
 With three sets of arms, is it?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.880
 Yeah, one of their boats.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.320
 It sounds like the start of a joke, doesn't it?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.240
 How do you sink a trirheam?

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.800
 Well, do you...

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.440
 They've all got holes that they row through,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.960
 so do you just have to tilt it a bit

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.600
 so that the holes let the water enter?

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.240
 That's clever.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.600
 That is clever.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.520
 It's actually, that's how you don't sink it.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.160
 So they would ram each other, right?

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.120
 They all had toughen prowls,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.920
 and they would ram each other

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.160
 and try and sink each other that way.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.200
 And the rams are often at the waterline,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.920
 so if you hit them with the ram,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.280
 that hole below the waterline,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.160
 they're going to sink fast.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.600
 So genuinely, if you were being attacked by another ship

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.200
 and you can't get out of the way in time,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.960
 what they would do is everyone on board

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.280
 would run to one side of the ship,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.360
 which is about to be hit by the ram.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.960
 The ship tilts over into the water.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.240
 Then when the ram hits, it's hitting a much higher bit.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240
 Then when you tilt back,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.400
 it's hit somewhere that's above the waterline.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.200
 Exactly.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.840
 Isn't that insane as a defence tactic

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.600
 to run towards the massive battering ram

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.800
 that's about to hit your ship?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.760
 That's amazing.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.240
 But if you've half tilted your ship one way,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.000
 isn't the battering ram just being given

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.760
 an easier job to flip you over entirely?

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.760
 It's not aiming to flip you over.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.760
 It's not like a spatula.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.120
 You're not flipping a pancake.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.040
 Now, this isn't robot wars.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.320
 Just mean by accident, not intention.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.240
 Yeah, if Sir Killalot is approaching you

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.920
 with the battering ram, what are you…

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.160
 I don't think it would.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.440
 If you're coming at that angle,

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.800
 I don't think the physics of that

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.640
 wouldn't cause your boat to capsize.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.800
 Largely speaking, boats are designed

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.200
 so that they don't flip over that easily.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.000
 Yeah, true.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.560
 That's true.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.240
 Well, although since…

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.840
 I mean, although some boats have flipped over,

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.640
 we all know that.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.280
 But famously, we were talking about

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.320
 the Swedish Empire and what powerhouse it was.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.880
 And when it was this huge naval power

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.640
 in the 17th, early 18th centuries,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.600
 they thought to celebrate this,

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.160
 they built the world's best warship.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.760
 And this was 1628.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.880
 It was called the Vasa.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.160
 It was 68 metres long.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.640
 It was the most high-tech warship the world had ever known.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.880
 It was painted in really stunning colours,

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.040
 scenes from the Swedish military victories

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.640
 of history all over it.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.200
 And so thousands of people flocked to see it launch

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.160
 from harbour and it set off.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:57.200
 And 20 minutes later, it tipped over and sunk.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.960
 And they just built it too top-heavy

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.560
 and it keeled right over.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.280
 Oh, my God.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.800
 It's an amazing story.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.080
 Is that the one they have in…

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.640
 That they have in…

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.520
 In Stockholm.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.480
 In Stockholm, yeah.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.160
 I just heard about that.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.280
 They dredged it

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.440
 and they have built an entire museum around it.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.960
 And you guys are not going to believe this.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.480
 Can you see the mug I'm drinking from?

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.960
 It's got a ship on it.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.880
 That ship is the Vasa.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.160
 Look at the handle here.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.200
 It says Vasa.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.080
 How?

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.360
 We don't see it, Andy.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.640
 Did you go see it when we were there?

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.120
 It's where I bought this mug.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.080
 You should have taken me.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.800
 I didn't know about it.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.120
 I was busy dancing with holograms of ABBA

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.160
 at the ABBA Museum.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.160
 I'd much rather would have been there.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.000
 Some of us are doing long-range research

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.400
 for an episode of the podcast in two years' time.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.280
 Nice try, mate.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.640
 And that is Anna.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.640
 My fact this week is that vanilla farmers in Madagascar

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.320
 stump their names on each individual pod on the vine.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.000
 That was very offensive.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.880
 That's incredible.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.720
 Yeah, it's like when you're at school,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.120
 you have to have your name sewn into all your clothes.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.240
 It's the same kind of thing.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.200
 Except this is to stop gangs of robbers

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.880
 from stealing your vanilla.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.280
 No, that's why I have my name stitched into my clothes.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.320
 Of course.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.520
 To stop the gangs of robbers.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.920
 You went to a pretty scary school didn't you, Eddie?

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.840
 They're really sweet, the little stumps as well.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.080
 So this is because Madagascar

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.840
 is in the middle of a vanilla boom,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.840
 or actually sort of coming out of a huge vanilla boom.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.480
 So it produces 80% of the world's vanilla

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.360
 and price is just shot up a couple of years ago.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.600
 And there are these vanilla gangs,

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.680
 these huge gangs and robbers at night who come

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.240
 and they strip your vines completely bare

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.160
 because it's going for so much money.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.400
 And so now the farmers literally put that

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.320
 either their name or sometimes their serial number,

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.720
 a specific serial number on an individual pot.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.800
 So if you see it on eBay later, you could be like,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.120
 "Oh, that was stolen from my farm."

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.000
 One of the problems is that once your vanilla pot is ripe,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.640
 you kind of need to leave it for quite a long time, don't you?

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.320
 You need to leave it for quite a few months

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.080
 to just get better and better and better.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.240
 And the longer you leave it, the better it is.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.280
 But the thieves know this.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.840
 So if they get there early, then they have something

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.920
 which is still good enough to sell,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.440
 but not quite as good enough

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.600
 that the farmer would like, it's a trade-off.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.720
 Do you wait till the end

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.640
 so you get really high-quality product

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.040
 or do you take it early so the thieves don't get it?

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:17.600
 Yeah.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.240
 Actually, that makes more sense of something I found out

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.880
 because the government has now banned people,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.840
 the farmers in Madagascar from picking vanilla too early

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.040
 because they have to be shrink-wrapped

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.960
 if they're picked early and that can make them moldy

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.040
 and it lowers the content of vanilla,

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.960
 which is the main flavor chemical.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.320
 And they, in fact, you know how governments

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.520
 sometimes burn smuggled or illegal goods in public

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.560
 so they'll burn ivory, for example, to destroy the market.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.640
 They recently burned half a tonne

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.920
 of prematurely picked vanilla pods in public

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.000
 to kind of make an example about this law.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.360
 Do you think that would have smelled nice?

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.000
 I bet it would.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.800
 Ah, what does that mean?

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.760
 Like an amazing scented candle, a giant scented candle.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.200
 They ran a huge bath next to it,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.720
 people just relaxing music.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.160
 That's amazing. The prices have leapt up,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.040
 but weirdly, it doesn't seem to have leapt up specifically

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.680
 for the growers.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.840
 There seems to be this middle group of people

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.560
 who distribute it, who are known as "vanillionaires"

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.000
 and they're the ones that are sort of really reaping the money

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.640
 and building up all these areas in Madagascar now

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.280
 from if you were living in a wooden, hutted house,

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.320
 they're now brick.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.800
 Like, there's a big change going there as a result.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.040
 Yeah, weirdly, the huge jump in prices

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.200
 doesn't seem to have made it back to the original producers.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.320
 Yeah.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.680
 What a surprise.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.920
 Unusual situation in this world we live.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.120
 Yeah, they're trying to write that wrong, aren't they?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.520
 And actually, I read a very heartening article

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.800
 in, I think it was in the FT, which was saying that

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.720
 this is being clamped down on,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.160
 and the reason it's being clamped down on

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.960
 is because buyers, as in us,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.040
 are more discerning than they used to be.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.040
 So all the hipster sort of morally sound awareness

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.480
 of where your goods have come from

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.160
 means that there's a lot of pressure on big companies

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.480
 like Mars to actually make sure that you're not exploiting

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.000
 farms at the other end of the chain.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.520
 And so what that means is, you know,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.560
 the person who owns Mars goes to Madagascar,

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.200
 looks at farmers' situations, and tries to sort it out.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.400
 And I think there's a project called

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.840
 Livelihoods Out There Now,

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.160
 which is making sure that the money's making it back

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.080
 to those original producers.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.280
 But some people really did profit from growing them as well.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.040
 There was a woman called Lydia Sower,

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.280
 who was interviewed in one article,

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.920
 who said that her husband was a fisherman a few years ago,

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.440
 and she wanted to plant vanilla,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.000
 and her husband said, "No, absolutely not terrible idea."

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.440
 And she did it anyway.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.360
 And it's now worth about...

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.400
 She's got a tiny little garden with a few vanilla pods in it,

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.160
 and it's worth about $8,000, which is massive, massive there.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.240
 Although she was saying this very, very proudly

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.160
 to a woman called Victoria Mars,

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.000
 who was visiting and who does have an 8% stake in Mars,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.600
 which, as this person pointed out,

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.280
 is annual sales are three times the size of Madagascar's GDP.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.800
 But so, you know, it probably didn't...

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.600
 Her jaw didn't drop, but the sound was $8,000

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.400
 in the same way that this woman was hoping.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.680
 You know how there are vanilla nerds, as you said, Dan, was it?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.640
 There are also, I don't think anyone's called them this,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.920
 "Vanigillantes."

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.080
 "Vanilla vigilantes."

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.520
 It's the thing I'm trying to get.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.000
 Because, as Anna was saying, it's so much there.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.800
 So a few years ago, 15% of all the vanilla on the planet

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.960
 was stolen, which is a hard...

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.520
 And some vanilla thieves would write ahead in advance.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.720
 That's how brazen they got.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.920
 They would write a note saying,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.920
 "We are coming tonight. Prepare what we want."

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.040
 And that has actually led to quite a few deaths,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.560
 because when these people have been caught,

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.080
 there isn't enough sort of justice available on the ground.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.160
 So there are vanilla vigilantes now

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.240
 who are catching and even killing the thieves.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.920
 That is brazen.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.840
 They sound like they've taken a few leaves

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.040
 out of Peter Skulden things, but Thorne Skulde's book.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.280
 But can't you get round the poaching by, you know,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.840
 just changing your name to the name that's on the pod?

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.200
 You know, the guy in your article's called Leon.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.440
 Couldn't I just arrive in town and change my name to Leon?

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.600
 Well, Anna also said, sometimes they put like codes and barcodes on.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.640
 You can't change your name to 731-964.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.040
 You could.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.920
 I bet there's a child of a celebrity who's called that right now.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.640
 Yeah, Elon Musk is up to something.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.440
 You don't know what yet.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.920
 And so vanilla grown, like you say,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.440
 80% in Madagascar.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.520
 But it's not originally from there, is it?

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.240
 It's originally from South America or South and Central America

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.840
 and North America, because Mexico,

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.120
 which is neither in South America nor in Central America.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.240
 It's in North America.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.200
 It's from Mexico.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.120
 It's vanilla's from Mexico.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.440
 And it was invented by this woman called Princess Zanat,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.440
 who probably didn't exist.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.560
 But she was Princess from the Tottenaco people.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.320
 And she was Goddess, kind of, as well as being a princess.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.520
 She was forbidden by her father from marrying a mortal.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.160
 And she ran away to the forest with her lover,

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.080
 and they were captured and beheaded.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.840
 And where their blood hit the ground,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.400
 that's where the first vanilla pods grow.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.720
 And that's where vanilla comes from.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.640
 It was an arduous way to invent something, isn't it?

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.840
 And then it got taken over to Madagascar,

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.280
 more specifically, Reunion,

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.560
 which is where they learned how to grow it.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.200
 And it didn't work for ages, because the pollen is inaccessible.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.400
 The flowers are insane.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.040
 They're fertile for 12 hours after they bloom.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.440
 So if you're a vanilla farmer, there's big pressure.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.120
 You can't just take the weekend off,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.800
 assuming that it'll be all right when you get back.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.520
 The flowers bloom for one day, yes, for this 12 hours.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.560
 And in Mexico, obviously, there are insects

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.120
 which have evolved to fertilize the flowers.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.040
 Only one species of bee.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.280
 There's only one species of bee called a melipone.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.920
 Who can do it?

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.920
 Although, actually, they've recently done a study

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.280
 and they don't even think it's that.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:55.920
 Really?

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.400
 They always thought it was this one melipone bee.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.720
 And they now can't...

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.600
 I haven't actually got any evidence that this even pollinates it.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.080
 But it's not...

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.440
 Something's pollinating it.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.320
 Something's pollinating it.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.440
 Something in Mexico.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.320
 That's all it comes.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.640
 Yeah, so for years, they couldn't export it around the world

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.520
 because you don't have the bee or the hummingbird or whatever it is.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.920
 So the method is hand fertilizing.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.920
 You have to get in with a toothpick

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.960
 and rub the flowers, genitals together.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.040
 And that's what fertilizes it.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.680
 And that's what makes it produce the vanilla pods.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.800
 And if you miss your window with a flower, you lose the pods.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.280
 Yeah.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.840
 You're sort of trying to make it have sex with itself, aren't you?

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.120
 Against its will.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.560
 Yeah, not against its will.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.760
 It's against its will.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.960
 The reason they're so hard to pollinate

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.800
 is because they've got this lid

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.120
 between the male and the female parts of the plant.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.920
 And the idea is that you don't really want to self- inseminate

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.680
 because, I guess, over many, many generations

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.080
 maybe that's bad for an organism.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.440
 And so it's against the plant's will

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.920
 that you lift the lid very, very carefully

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.400
 and you dip into the answer, the female part,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.880
 and you get the pollen out

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.800
 and you smear it all over the male part.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.040
 Yeah.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.960
 This is definitely a side of the #MeToo movement.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.480
 I don't think any of us expected it.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.000
 So this was first discovered

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.880
 by an enslaved man in Reunion called Edmund Albius.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.520
 And he basically had this guy who was his boss

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.200
 and he was telling him how they make watermelons

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.520
 but how they can't do it with vanilla pods.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.840
 And so Edmund Albius decided,

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.880
 "Well, okay, you say you can't, but let's have a go."

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.400
 And he started messing around with it,

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.120
 messing around with it.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.960
 And he came up with this kind of technique

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.600
 where you use a little stick or a blade of grass

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.920
 and you flip up this little cap,

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.080
 which Anna was talking about called the Rustelum,

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.280
 and you flip it up and then with kind of a flip of the thumb,

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.240
 you move some of the male and female parts together

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.600
 and you smear them over each other

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.120
 and that's how you pollinate them.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.760
 And that technique is still used today

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.280
 in Reunion for sure.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.200
 And I think actually in Madagascar,

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.280
 I think all over they use this exact same thing.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.240
 And then he was given his freedom,

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.720
 but he really struggled afterwards

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.880
 and ended up dying in poverty,

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.720
 especially as there was a French guy

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.800
 called Jean-Michel Claude Ricard

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.840
 who came over and said,

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.400
 "Oh, this was my idea. I came up with this."

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.360
 And he went back to Paris

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.640
 and he told everyone that he'd come up

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.440
 with this way of creating vanilla in Reunion.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.000
 And everyone sort of faded him for being amazing

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.880
 but then the former owner of Edmund Delbyards

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.560
 came to Paris as well and said,

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.360
 "Mate, that's just not what happened.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.160
 Like, it was this guy, Edmund Delbyards,

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.560
 who went round and teaching everyone else how to do it."

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.160
 And he's like a hero in Reunion

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.240
 and there's a statue of him quite near the airport

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.760
 and he's really famous.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.520
 - What year was it? - It's a good lie to make up.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.760
 - Yeah, but quite a Trumpian thing to do.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.120
 - It is. - Just sort of wander into a country

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.880
 and be like, "I did that. That was me."

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.360
 - You know that thing which is like 4,000 miles away

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.360
 which no one can prove who did it?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.560
 - That was me, yeah.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.960
 (all laughing)

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.000
 - The longest cake ever made was vanilla flavoured.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.880
 - What was it?

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.120
 - It was baked this year in South India in Kerala,

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.440
 state of Kerala and it was 10 centimetres wide

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.480
 but how long was it?

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.880
 - 10 centimetres wide is really thin.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.240
 - That doesn't help you at all

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.920
 with knowing how long it is.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.880
 - It kind of feels like it.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.440
 - But can you tell us the air full area of the cake?

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.760
 - At the height, please.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.760
 - Yeah, 2.4 kilometres.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.440
 Very strong offer.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.560
 - 20 kilometres.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.680
 - 20 kilometres.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.040
 - No, that's ridiculous.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.120
 I'm 200 yards long.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.480
 - Oh, shut up.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.880
 And you said that it was in Kerala, not Kerala

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.920
 and down on Kerala.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.320
 - How long was it? Come on.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.760
 These interminable guessing games

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.680
 are completely destroying the experience of our guests.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.080
 - It's true.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.840
 It was six and a half kilometres.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.120
 So James wins because he was close.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.640
 It wasn't 20 kilometres down.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.760
 - Where did they fit that?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.560
 Because outdoors,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.480
 you'd imagine you'd run into a lot of obstacles.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.640
 It's very rare you get a six and a half kilometre run.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.680
 - They did it in sections

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.280
 and it goes up and down a lot.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.800
 It's a great deal.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.240
 - Hang on. So it's not one?

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.400
 - It's not one single cake that's 6,000 metres.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.720
 - You can't call that the longest cake.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.400
 - That's not the longest cake.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.440
 - The longest cake.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.800
 - The longest cake is every cake

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.760
 that's been made on bake-up in the last 10 years.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.200
 They may not have to be collected.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.800
 - I'm so confused about what's happened here.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.760
 - You can clearly see in the photos of the cake

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.840
 that there are sections which slot into place,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.880
 but I think they're joined.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.920
 They are all joined together.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.360
 It's like a big cake snake.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.320
 It weighed 27,000 kilos.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.320
 And as I say, it was vanilla-favourite.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.600
 Hence me, Metronica.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.200
 - So one of the best books about vanilla,

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.240
 I would say the best book,

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.200
 is called "Travels in Search of the Vanilla Orchid" by Tim.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.120
 - Sorry, James. Are you claiming to have read

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.480
 all the books about vanilla?

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.280
 Because it sounds a bit like you are.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.880
 And then you've ranked them all.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.320
 - It's a small field.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.520
 It's a very small field.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.360
 - And they're actually all,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.720
 if you press them up against each other,

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.000
 they just make one long book.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.960
 - It's just one month.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:03.040
 - Tim Eckhart, who Andy and I at least know,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.360
 he wrote the book about vanilla.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.560
 And it is awesome.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.560
 There's lots of stuff about the history of vanilla in there.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.680
 When it came to Europe,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.920
 one of the reasons this guy was showing off about it

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.880
 is because it was an absolute amazing thing.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:20.320
 So Louis the 15th would have soup made of vanilla.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.520
 Francisco Hernandez,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.840
 who was a physician to Philip II of Spain,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.320
 he said that vanilla could soothe the stomach,

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.920
 cure the bite of a venomous snake,

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.840
 reduce flatulence and cause the urine to flow admirably.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.960
 - So if you've just, if you've got a bad stomach

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.400
 and you've just farted really loudly,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.000
 attracting the attention of a snake,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.040
 which has then bitten you and you need a piss.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.840
 - No, and your friend has been stung by a jellyfish.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.280
 So you need to urinate on them.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.680
 - Just one?

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.200
 - One vanilla part will do that.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.960
 - Just one weird trick, yeah.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.120
 - Also, according to Bizarre Zimmerman,

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.240
 who's a German physician from the 18th century,

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:02.240
 he says that vanilla cured no fewer than 342 impotent men.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.040
 So they drank vanilla and it made them able to have sex again.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.720
 So if you were, if you'd farted really loudly

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.960
 because of your bad stomach and a snake came along,

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.080
 and a very beautiful person of the sex that you're attracted to

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.680
 has been stung by a jellyfish, after you've urinated on them,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.720
 and they're so grateful you can then have sex with them.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.440
 - I'm so impressed by the admirable flow of your urine.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:32.000
 - This is a Bear Grylls episode, I'd love to see.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:42.240
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.840
 and that is James.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Russian football team,

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.320
 FC Sakhalin, are based in such a remote town

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.640
 that to get to their closest away game,

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.760
 they have to travel one-sixth of the circumference of the earth.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.320
 - That's just amazing.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.760
 - It's incredible, isn't it?

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.320
 Oh my days, like, this is incredible.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.600
 So this is a team based in the town of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.560
 which is in the far, far, far east of Russia,

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.760
 and they're in the third division of Russian football,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.680
 and the way that the third division works in Russia

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.880
 is it's such a big country,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.720
 they want all the teams to be kind of close together

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.040
 because otherwise you have to spend so much money traveling.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.680
 So they put all the teams that are next to each other

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.960
 playing each other,

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.600
 but unfortunately there's no one else around this town

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.360
 of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk,

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.800
 and so they've been put in with all the teams around the Black Sea

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.800
 and around Dagestan and stuff like that.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.720
 And so when they play Krasnodar,

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.400
 which is one of the teams in their league,

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.360
 they have to, if they want to fly,

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.960
 it would be at least 16 hours,

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.520
 just over 16 hours to get to this game.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.280
 You could drive, but it's a 132 hour drive,

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.200
 a total of 9781 kilometers

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.360
 because you have to go a slightly weird way around.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.680
 And I looked at it on Google Maps and it says,

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.920
 "Warning, this route includes a ferry.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.520
 This route has tolls.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.800
 This route has restricted usage or includes private roads.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.120
 Your destination is in a different time zone."

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.960
 So it's not an easy place to get to.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.600
 So I'm suspecting stuff like this bit is guarded by a wizard.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.240
 This bit is.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.200
 At the time of writing,

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.320
 they haven't won any away games this season so far.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.680
 They've won quite a few home games,

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.120
 but they've not won any away games.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.400
 But they did have a few good seasons a while ago.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.320
 They won the league a couple of times in the last few years,

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.760
 but they refused to get promoted

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.200
 because if they get promoted,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.960
 they're going to have to start playing lots of teams

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.480
 in different parts of Russia,

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.000
 and then they won't be able to do this thing,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.440
 which they do, which is they go over

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.720
 and they play loads of games at once,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.600
 and then they come back.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.760
 So they don't go every week, if you know what I mean.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.360
 That is clever.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:43.840
 Yeah.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.240
 Is the time difference between them and their nearest team

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.960
 is eight hours?

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.440
 It's so weird.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.520
 Well, the thing is, it's not their nearest team.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.880
 So if they played in the Japanese J League, for instance,

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.120
 they're actually quite close to Hokkaido.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.920
 So let's say all the planes stopped,

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.120
 and they had to play either against someone like Krasnodar

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.520
 or someone around there or against Hokkaido.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.840
 It would take them two days quicker to get to Hokkaido

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.320
 than it would take them to get to that part of Russia.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.720
 And that's if they were to walk to Hokkaido

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.160
 and get a cart of Russia.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.480
 That's how much closer it is.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.680
 Like they could walk to the ferry,

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.680
 get the ferry and walk to the football match

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.320
 two days quicker than driving all the way across Russia.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:24.800
 Wow.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.360
 Yeah.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.840
 And we could, if they were doing that distance

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.280
 and we had to do the equivalent,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.480
 we could drive to Moscow back again to London,

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.880
 back to Moscow, back again to London,

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.760
 and probably one more route before they even got there.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.280
 It's what a distance.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.480
 They're closer to the Seattle football team

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.640
 in the American League

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.800
 than they are to their nearest Russian rivals.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.000
 It's insane.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.280
 So there's not a lot of sort of

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.120
 neighbourly antagonism is what you're saying.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.880
 It's not like Man United, Man City,

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.560
 where you shag the wife of someone

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.480
 who's now married the person across the street.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:58.960
 Exactly.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.080
 It's not like Liverpool, Everton,

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.040
 where you literally cross one park to get to the other ground.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.000
 It's like, yeah.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.400
 Yeah.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:04.880
 It's incredible.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.720
 It's more like there are fault lines left over

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.360
 from the Russo-Japanese War of 1905,

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.040
 which is diplomatically tricky.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.840
 Wasn't James, wasn't there a bizarre thing

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.560
 that happened with one of the British teams,

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.520
 or two British teams,

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.760
 that got to the final of some cup?

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.680
 And they had to, it was Arsenal and someone, right?

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.880
 They had to fly.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.960
 I think it was Chelsea against someone.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.800
 Chelsea Spurs or Chelsea Arsenal or something.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.120
 But yeah, then the final was in Baku, I think,

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.080
 in Azerbaijan.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.200
 And they had to,

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.960
 they both had to go all the way over there for it.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.280
 That was in the UEFA Cup, possibly.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.480
 Yeah.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.360
 Wow.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.480
 I didn't realise that this,

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.720
 so this place is basically in the islands of Japan,

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.040
 isn't it?

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.120
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.560
 I actually didn't realise that Russia claimed a portion

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.840
 of what I would have,

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.880
 if I'd looked at a blank map,

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.080
 assumed towards Japan.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.080
 And I think, no, sorry, Putin,

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.920
 really hope you don't listen to this, his show.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.120
 And I think, isn't the south half of the island

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.080
 is Japanese, isn't it?

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.000
 He turned off when we started making jokes

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.120
 about short people, I think.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.320
 Oh yeah.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.440
 There were other podcasts.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.120
 Yeah, exactly, that's it.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.280
 It's basically a part of,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.440
 well, it's right on the border of Russia and Chepovo.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.120
 Geologically, I guess, it looks Japanese,

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.480
 but it's a very disputed territory.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.920
 And there are still some islands,

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.760
 the Kuril Islands, which are disputed.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.160
 But this is Russian sort of,

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.480
 is Russian and is Russian a benested?

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.200
 Yeah.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.080
 Yeah.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.680
 I don't know why anyone plays football in Russia.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.800
 It sounds like an enormous hassle for so many teams.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.080
 It's just, it's too big.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.080
 Even if you're playing for Vladivostok,

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.640
 which at least is attached to it by land,

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.480
 it's still, I think, 10,000 kilometers east of St. Petersburg.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.720
 So a week's train journey.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.080
 And I think there was quite a nice story in 2006

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.680
 where three fans of Zenit St. Petersburg,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.280
 which is a football team there,

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.120
 they drove to Vladivostok,

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.280
 because Peter was playing an away game there.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.520
 So they drove the whole week and a half there.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.000
 Once they got there, their car broke down.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.920
 But to reward their loyalty,

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.360
 their team gave them a new car.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.880
 Wow.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.520
 Oh, that's cool.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:49:59.840
 Nice.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.160
 Of course, the reason that people play football in Russia

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.520
 is because the Soviets like to force people to play football

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.520
 back in the day.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.400
 Cool.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.440
 Actually, it was quite thought of as a bourgeois sport originally,

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.200
 because it was brought over by Scottish people in particular.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.880
 And the first person who brought it over there

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.560
 was a guy called MacPherson,

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.480
 who was arrested after the revolution,

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.520
 because they saw football as being a bourgeois European thing,

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.200
 and they shouldn't be doing it in Russia.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.080
 But the first ever football match in Russia was in 1893,

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.040
 and they squeezed it in between two tug-of-war competitions.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.120
 So there was a big tug-of-war thing happening,

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.680
 and they were like,

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.800
 "Well, what shall we do in the middle,

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.720
 because we're just sorting out our rope or something?"

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.480
 And they're like, "Oh, let's have a game of football."

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.440
 So funny.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.240
 They cleared all the seven arms off the pitch

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.760
 before they got the footballers on.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.640
 Oh, dear.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.480
 But yeah, handball,

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.560
 and it's just the ball rolling over someone's hand.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.480
 And then the most famous team in Russia is Spartak, Moscow,

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.680
 and they came along.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.200
 When the Soviets were controlling everything,

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.400
 they were the team of the people,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.160
 and there was a load of brothers called the Starristan Brothers,

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.920
 who started Spartak.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.520
 And then, very mysteriously,

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.320
 they got sent to the Gulag about three or four years later,

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.360
 because they started a, you know, people's football team.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.960
 But they were so popular

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.640
 that when they got to Siberia,

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.800
 they guarded Siberia and knew about them,

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.360
 and so let them kind of practice their football.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.280
 And eventually, Stalin's son Vasily was so into football

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.400
 that they brought Nikolai Starristan back from the Gulag

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.800
 so that he could live with Vasily Stalin,

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.320
 and he would just live in his house

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.640
 because he was such a big fan of this footballer.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.920
 That's so awkward.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:43.920
 I know.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.960
 Imagine if Lionel Messi just moved in with you or something.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.600
 Even if you thought he was a great footballer,

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.680
 I still think that would be awkward around the dinner table.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.560
 I think it would.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.680
 Pass me the salt,

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.000
 and he doesn't have a head kick to you or something.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.680
 (LAUGHTER)

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.840
 Stalin was, just speaking of Stalin,

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.160
 was exiled to Siberia six times

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.040
 between 1900 and 1913 and escaped five times.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.680
 Well, speaking of people who escape a lot

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.400
 and the passing of someone quite famous,

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.440
 Diego Maradona,

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.680
 who passed away recently, very sadly,

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.040
 he used to,

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.160
 didn't he go and used to play football

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.080
 at the request of Pablo Escobar

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.400
 while he was in prison?

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.760
 Just him and Pablo.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.240
 Just, yeah, well, I'm sure there were teams

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.240
 that were put together.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.560
 But he had, at this particular point,

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.920
 I think it was in 1991, Escobar was in quite a luxurious prison.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.800
 He kind of ran the prisons, didn't he, to begin with?

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.960
 Of course, Escobar and Maradona had quite a lot in common.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.800
 They had some shared hobbies, didn't they?

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.360
 Yes, they did.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.840
 Today?

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.960
 Maradona was once sent home for the World Cup for taking cocaine.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.480
 I just cottoned on, as you guys said.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.080
 You thought maybe he also collected dojos

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.480
 or whatever it was that Escobar had in his house.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.360
 Shall we talk about Siberia for a while?

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:01.840
 Yeah, sure.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.680
 So, I was saying before about people being sent to Siberia,

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.280
 in 1591, this is the earliest example

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.880
 of anyone being sent to Siberia,

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.160
 and it's not anyone.

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.000
 This was a bell in Russia,

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.760
 which was found guilty of sedition

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.160
 and flogged and exiled to Siberia.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.040
 And that was because the bell had been rung

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.720
 to celebrate the assassination of Dimitri's son Ivan the Terrible.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.360
 And so, the son had died,

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.080
 and the locals were happy about it,

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.200
 and so they rang a bell,

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.200
 and then they put the bell in court

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.640
 and sent it off to Siberia.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.520
 Was it because they couldn't identify any of the bell ringers?

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.560
 So, was it a way of letting the bell ringers off the hook?

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.840
 It could have been that.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.320
 That is the epitome of a workman blaming their tools,

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.920
 really, where that came from.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.680
 It's not really the bell's fault, is it?

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.360
 It doesn't feel like it.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:49.920
 It doesn't even know it's about.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.760
 It also feels like flogging a bell

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.360
 is going to cause it to ring again,

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.120
 and then you'll have to flog a bell.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.640
 This is never-ending cycle.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.880
 Have you heard of Magadan,

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.880
 which is a very remote city,

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:05.840
 kind of two days north of the nearest train tracks and things like that?

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.160
 Just a very, very remote city in Siberia.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.920
 They have a mayoral position,

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.600
 and they're having a nightmare filling out at the moment.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.280
 There have been zero applications

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.440
 for the job of actual mayor of the city,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.280
 and there are 92,000 people in Magadan.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.080
 It's not a small place.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.400
 They've extended the deadline to mid-December,

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.920
 so depending on when this goes out,

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.200
 you might still be in time.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.800
 What happened to the previous mayor?

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.240
 If the seven last mayors all died in suspicious circumstances or something.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.400
 It's a lot of people say

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.640
 that you won't be able to change things properly,

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:38.960
 and there's a fair bit of graft and corruption,

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.360
 and it's probably a pretty thankless job.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.120
 But when the story broke for the first time,

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.120
 there have been no applications.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.920
 The boss of a funeral firm from Tomsk, 4,000 miles away,

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.120
 said he would apply,

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.360
 and he said, "Of course, I don't know much about the city,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.520
 and it would be better if I had lived there a while,

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.880
 but I've never had the chance."

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.080
 So he said he's going to apply it.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.840
 His main policy is to build a crematorium.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.520
 Okay, well, that sounds like he's just going to be

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.240
 greasing the palms of his crematorium friends, doesn't it?

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.920
 We've never actually talked about the amazing Lukov family,

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.880
 but if you're talking about the Siberian wilderness,

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.720
 they're kind of the epitome of it.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.840
 So this is a family who basically fled the Bolsheviks

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.600
 and in the 1920s, 1930s, family of four, I think at the time,

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.200
 went into Siberia and just lived without ever seeing

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.400
 another human soul until the 1980s.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.800
 And it is insane, their lifestyle.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.080
 They didn't bring much stuff,

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.520
 so when their clothes started to fall apart,

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.360
 they had to grow hemp from seed

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.360
 in order to make new clothes out of that.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.920
 They wrote by dipping sharp birch sticks

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.080
 into honey supple juice and writing,

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.280
 but they raised this family

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.640
 and there's one surviving member, Agafia Lukov,

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.640
 and she is now in her 80s,

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.760
 but she lives completely by herself in the middle of the tiger,

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.040
 middle of nowhere, 150 miles from the nearest town,

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.080
 1,000 meters high on this mountainside.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.760
 And she wasn't discovered until the 80s

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.760
 when these geologists were flying over in a helicopter

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.080
 and saw their tiny little hut that they were living in.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.200
 And they said they were kind of famous in Russia, weren't they?

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.560
 In the 80s for a while.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.120
 When they were found in the 80s, they said to them,

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.880
 "Oh, you guys probably don't know

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.720
 that the Second World War has finished,"

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.160
 and they went, "What's the Second World War?"

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.400
 They'd went before then, that was in the 30s,

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.560
 I think, or the 20s when they went, like, kind of sense.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.320
 But yeah, when they were found,

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.760
 they were kind of taken around the country

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.040
 as almost like a kind of a sideshow almost, I suppose,

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.960
 which is like, look at these amazing people

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.720
 that have been living in Siberia.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.760
 And Agafia Lukvo kind of was...

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.200
 They said in one article I read that she saw aeroplanes,

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.440
 horses, cars, and money for the first time,

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.160
 but then basically said,

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.520
 "I ain't having any of this shit.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.440
 I want to go back to where I live,"

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.920
 because she says that whenever she leaves the town,

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.520
 she always gets really bad asthma or, you know,

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.320
 it's bad for her skin.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.240
 She just doesn't like, she doesn't like the noise

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.120
 and all that kind of stuff.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.200
 So she's just kind of happy where she is now.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.080
 And every now and then they bring her, like, food,

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.280
 I think, like, once a year, they bring her things and people.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.280
 People knit them socks and stuff, don't they?

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.800
 And knit them things, I think.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.760
 Yeah.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.240
 Just earlier, when I said about the football team

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.240
 going back on the route passing a wizard,

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.920
 I mean, this is it.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.000
 Yeah, almost, yeah, yeah.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.960
 This is her.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.480
 It was really sad, actually, when they were discovered,

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.240
 I think there were five of them.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.560
 And then in the 80s, they all suddenly died

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.760
 and left her on her own.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.320
 But the thing that most amazed the dad,

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.200
 he was told everything.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.600
 They were told about the moon landings.

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.720
 They were shown a television,

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.560
 which they became kind of addicted to

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.760
 and then thought it was the devil,

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.120
 so repented of it immediately.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.960
 They were told about the moon landings

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.240
 and refused to believe they happened,

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.520
 which is fair enough.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.520
 The thing that most amazed the dad was cellophane.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.320
 He saw this thing, which he was like,

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.800
 it's like glass, but it crumples.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.240
 They couldn't believe it.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.040
 Yeah, and they didn't know what plastic bags were as well.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.280
 I remember reading, that was a new thing for them.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.440
 I believe Mick Jagger was flown in

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.200
 to top his numbers up.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.040
 And they were like, yeah, of course, we know who this guy is.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.240
 But then the big problem now is,

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.680
 they do go in there every now and then

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.120
 and drop her some supplies.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.920
 And especially, like I said, people knit them socks

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.280
 and knit them clothes and stuff.

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.160
 But of course, with coronavirus,

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.640
 you just do not want to be going into an area

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.520
 with a very elderly lady who's not really had

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.040
 any human contact for decades and decades and decades.

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.440
 And so that's a real issue with them at the moment.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.880
 You know what they should do?

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.200
 They should set her up on a date with,

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.640
 do you remember that Brazilian guy,

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.240
 the man of the whole, the most isolated man in the world?

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.680
 They should get those two.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.680
 That would be a very charming rom-com.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:54.080
 We own the copyright, Mr. Spielberg,

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.840
 just to say, because we mentioned it on here.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.440
 So we'll take 10% of it.

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.640
 That's correct how that works.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.440
 Just one last bit of data before we go.

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.160
 Okay, yeah.

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.440
 In the breaks between facts, I texted Anne and Alex

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.320
 to see if either of them had seen Mick Jagger live.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:08.880
 Yeah, go on.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.200
 Anne said, "No, I have not."

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.160
 Okay.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.840
 And Alex said, "No, I don't really know who he is."

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.160
 So James, if you want someone to talk to about this random guy.

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.320
 Me and Alex are like the man of the whole

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.360
 and the, you know, lady in Siberia.

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:25.680
 Yeah.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.280
 Okay, that's it.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.240
 That is all of our facts.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.600
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.360

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.560

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.920
 over the course of this podcast,

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.240
 Yep.

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.560
 Well, you can go to our group account at no such thing

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.520
 or go to our website.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.440
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.120
 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.120
 We have links to bits of merchandise.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.200
 And we also have a few live shows coming up.

00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.440
 So do check in there occasionally to see where to get tickets from.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.320
 Okay, that's it.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.640
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.520
 We will see you then.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:14.960
 Okay, a good bye.
