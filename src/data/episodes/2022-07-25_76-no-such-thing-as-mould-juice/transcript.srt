1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (techno music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,340
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,920
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,880
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,640
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
 this week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,840
 My name is Dan Shriver.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,000
 Please welcome to the stage the other three elves

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,280
 as Additch Isinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,280
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,720
 (audience applauding)

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,680
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,040
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,720
 - My fact this week is that the first man

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,120
 to swim the English channel later had a show

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,680
 where he floated in a tank for two hours.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,680
 That was his show.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,800
 His name was Matthew Webb and to get extra funding,

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,480
 he would do a special endurance show

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,600
 where he floated in a tank for 128 hours.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,040
 - Whoa, that's one hour better than the guy stuck in the rock.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
 - Yeah.

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,320
 - Probably as interesting as well

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,440
 in terms of a feature length movie.

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,280
 - Yeah.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,360
 - I mean without a flotation device.

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
 - Without a flotation device.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
 - And that's really impressive.

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,360
 - It's very impressive.

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,160
 - Yeah, in a boat it's not quite as impressive.

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
 (audience laughing)

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,760
 - It's just basically a big swimming pool right

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,640
 where he's just paddling around.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
 - Yeah, I'm treading water I guess is what he was doing.

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,360
 - Yeah, okay, yeah.

38
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,120
 - So he wasn't lying on his back.

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,000
 That's not fluting.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I think that's just swimming.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
 - Like a child.

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,320
 - He got very philosophical very early on.

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,120
 (audience laughing)

44
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,200
 - The first time he ever did this kind of floting

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 for as long as possible,

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,480
 it was against a Newfoundland dog.

47
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,080
 He had a bet that he'd be able to float

48
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,000
 for longer than a dog and he won his bet.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,080
 - Did the dog die?

50
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,240
 (audience laughing)

51
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
 As they fished the dog out.

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,920
 Victory for Webb.

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,880
 - I mean did the dog even know it was taking part in a bet?

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,040
 (audience laughing)

55
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,360
 - Captain Webb won a year's supply of pedigree charm.

56
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
 (audience laughing)

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,640
 So this is Captain Webb.

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
 This is who we're talking about British hero.

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
 - Yeah, and he was amazing.

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,400
 This was 1875 when he did this

61
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
 and when he swam the channel that is.

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,880
 And after that he didn't really stay famous.

63
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,080
 He tried to keep himself famous

64
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,680
 by doing these endurance events and things like that,

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,800
 but he found it quite hard.

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,040
 But I read that he was so famous

67
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
 that when he came back from the channel swimming

68
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,360
 and he went back to his hometown

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
 with a band procession going on,

70
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,200
 he was so loved that even a pig got up on his trotters

71
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
 to look at him as he went by.

72
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,080
 (audience laughing)

73
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,160
 - Well the pig know that it was taking part in a procession.

74
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,280
 (audience laughing)

75
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,240
 In 1883, just eight years after he was the hero of the nation,

76
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,560
 he tried to swim across a particular bit of the river

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,160
 down from Niagara Falls and it was extremely dangerous

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,440
 and more than 10,000 people turned up to watch him

79
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,760
 and he drowned there.

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
 He was dragged under a current

81
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,600
 and his body was found a few days later

82
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 and he was doing it to try and provide for his family.

83
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,720
 - So I was going through the newspaper archives

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,640
 and before he did it, every single headline

85
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,720
 about what he was about to do said,

86
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,480
 "We're the engages in suicidal endeavor."

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,240
 Every headline went, "A fool's there and totally mad.

88
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,000
 "Everyone predicts he will die."

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,480
 There's a whirlpool about 20 yards down the river

90
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,840
 into which he'd will definitely be sucked and perished

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
 and he went on and did it anyway.

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,160
 I just wonder if he read any of that.

93
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,480
 (audience laughing)

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
 - He didn't like to read his own press.

95
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,400
 He was a very modest man.

96
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,040
 But actually everyone thought that he would die

97
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,440
 when he swam the channel as well.

98
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,560
 It was 34 kilometers but it actually took him

99
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,600
 64 kilometers to swim it because of all the currents.

100
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,400
 He just went in a real zigzag all the way.

101
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
 - He refused to ask the directions.

102
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,640
 (audience laughing)

103
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,280
 - And he smothered himself in poor pice fat

104
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,640
 to keep warm, which is quite good.

105
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,480
 And towards the end, he got really tired

106
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,040
 but then a boat went past

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
 and everyone on the boat started singing

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,560
 "Rule Britannia" to keep him going.

109
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,440
 - And I don't know if this would have been an encouragement

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,160
 or put him off, but apparently his coach Arthur Payne

111
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,840
 used to jump in occasionally and swim alongside him.

112
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,600
 - Which I would find really irritating.

113
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,080
 Hey man, this is easy.

114
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,160
 (audience laughing)

115
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,000
 - I read also at one stage that he had a run in with a poor pice.

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
 (audience laughing)

117
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,160
 - It's a boy you covered in poor pice fat.

118
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,480
 What have you done with my friends?

119
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,520
 (audience laughing)

120
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,440
 - I think that might have been it.

121
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,560
 They might have confused him.

122
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,880
 Smells like a poor pice, looks like a poor pice.

123
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,360
 (audience laughing)

124
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
 But there was actually someone who went across

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,160
 the channel before him.

126
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,160
 He was called Paul the Fearless Frogman, Boynton.

127
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
 (audience laughing)

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
 And he did manage to get in a cross

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,280
 but he was wearing a rubber suit with a puddle and a sail.

130
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,000
 (audience laughing)

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
 - He towed a boat behind him, I think,

132
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,480
 which had his supplies in it.

133
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,320
 - He towed a boat.

134
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
 - He towed a boat a lot.

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,880
 - This is much more impressive than Matthew were.

136
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,720
 (audience laughing)

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
 - I mean he had a sail.

138
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
 I think he had some kind of a small like makeshift

139
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
 clockwork motor thing.

140
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,880
 I'm not sure where we draw the line swimming,

141
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,200
 but I think that is not swimming.

142
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,360
 - It sounds amazing.

143
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,200
 It could support you, so help you float in the water.

144
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,000
 And also you could store nine days worth of food

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,840
 in the pockets.

146
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,040
 (audience laughing)

147
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,160
 - Basically it was a publicity stunt to sell this suit

148
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,600
 'cause he called it a life-saving suit.

149
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,720
 - He was actually the guy, he set up the first ever theme park

150
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,520
 in America and then he set up what became Coney Island.

151
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,360
 - Oh.

152
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
 - And then he befriended sea lions

153
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,160
 and used to appear in silent films with them all the time.

154
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,000
 - That hang on.

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,160
 (audience laughing)

156
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
 - He just, they were, who he felt closest to.

157
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,400
 - He befriended sea lions.

158
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,960
 - Yeah, he performed in films with sea lions.

159
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,120
 - The sea lions know they were being befriended.

160
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,800
 (audience laughing)

161
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
 - Even cooler than there was someone who swam across before,

162
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,480
 even what was it, Paul, the amazing frogman,

163
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
 boy, it's a fearless frogman.

164
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,600
 It was a guy called William Hoskins, and this was in 1862,

165
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,840
 and he kick paddled his way across on a bail of straw.

166
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,800
 (audience laughing)

167
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,720
 I was the first man to go across the channel, not in a boat.

168
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,240
 - Do you guys know who the best living swimmer

169
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,400
 alive today is?

170
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,040
 - Michael Phelps.

171
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,760
 - Oh no, so this is for a long distance.

172
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,160
 I'm talking, it's a guy called Martin Strell.

173
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
 - Okay.

174
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,480
 - He had a lot of TV shows, so actually might be a name

175
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,920
 familiar to those listening and those here tonight.

176
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,240
 He's an amazing guy, he's a Slovenian, long distance swimmer.

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,960
 He swam the entire Amazon river,

178
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,440
 first person ever to do that.

179
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 The Danube, the Yang Sea, he did the Danube in one go.

180
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,520
 He swam for 84 hours straight, he lost 40 pounds.

181
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
 By the time he got out, he was 40 pounds lighter,

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,160
 and along the way, and along every single swim that he does,

183
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,920
 he drinks two bottles of wine.

184
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,200
 He has just a favorite white wine, I think it is,

185
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
 that he drinks.

186
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,340
 - But there's sort of like,

187
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,840
 thresher shocks along the way.

188
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,160
 (audience laughing)

189
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,120
 The Amazon is much better provided for than I realized.

190
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,800
 - That's where thresher sharks get the name, actually.

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,520
 - Oh really, there's something.

192
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,560
 (audience laughing)

193
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
 - But this is how hardcore he is with his swimming.

194
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,560
 He hasn't swam the Nile yet, and he's been asked,

195
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,040
 "Why have you not swam the Nile?"

196
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,640
 And he said that it's neither long or challenging enough.

197
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,960
 - Oh, it is like the second longest river in the world.

198
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
 - Yeah, I know, he said, it's just like a small creek.

199
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,880
 - This guy is a liar.

200
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,920
 I say that when people say, "Why have you never fought a lion?"

201
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,240
 They are neither large nor fierce enough for me,

202
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,040
 so it's not worth me wasting my time.

203
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
 (audience laughing)

204
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,120
 - We're gonna have to move on in about two minutes.

205
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,560
 - Can I tell you one more guy who I found out about

206
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,360
 in terms of the annals of cross-channel swimming history.

207
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,760
 This is one of my favorite ever people.

208
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,400
 His name is Bob Platon, I don't know much about him,

209
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,520
 but he crossed the channel on an iron bed stud in 1961,

210
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,120
 which he had attached floating barrels to.

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,160
 Then in 1963, he surpassed himself,

212
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,720
 he went over on a barrel with an outboard motor.

213
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,240
 Eventually commercialism crept in in 1969,

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
 he went across again in a shoe sponsored by British Lather.

215
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,960
 (audience laughing)

216
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,280
 And then in 1965, he crossed in a gin bottle

217
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,760
 sponsored by Gilby's gin.

218
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,880
 - Hang on, where do we get these oversized gin bottles?

219
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,040
 (audience laughing)

220
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,400
 - Bob Platon, what a guy.

221
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,960
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,160
 My fact this week is that the first item sold on eBay

223
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,080
 was a broken laser pointer.

224
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,920
 - Yeah.

225
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
 - And it was bought by a man who collects

226
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,800
 broken laser pointers.

227
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,520
 (audience laughing)

228
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
 - Genuinely was, do you think he ever buys

229
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,320
 working laser pointers and then breaks them

230
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,840
 so that they can go in his collection?

231
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,920
 (audience laughing)

232
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
 - Yeah, I guess so.

233
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
 - That's a good question because you would have thought

234
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,360
 that the working laser pointer is actually easier

235
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
 to come across than a broken laser pointer.

236
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,320
 - Yeah, the guy who sold it, did he know

237
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,600
 that someone might want a broken laser pointer?

238
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
 What was he like, just scamming people?

239
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,080
 - It was the creator of eBay.

240
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 So prior to eBay being called eBay,

241
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,520
 it was called Auction Web.

242
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,440
 And Auction Web was his little sideline.

243
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,720
 There's a bit of a mythology that he set it up.

244
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
 He set eBay up because his wife had a huge collection

245
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
 of pes dispenser as she wanted to get rid of.

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,640
 And he thought, let's do it that way.

247
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,080
 And that was actually marketed, I think,

248
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,440
 through eBay themselves saying that was the case.

249
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,560
 Turns out it's not true.

250
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,280
 But so it was the guy who set up eBay.

251
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,400
 - So this guy who started eBay, it was called Auction Web

252
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
 but it was on eBay.com I think.

253
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,880
 And he had some other sites on eBay.com as well.

254
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,960
 And one of them was an Ebola information site.

255
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,080
 That was the first thing on eBay.com,

256
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,360
 a place to find out where Ebola's happening around the world.

257
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,400
 - Yeah, he was weirdly obsessed with Ebola, right?

258
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,640
 In the 90s, before it was kind of fashionable.

259
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
 (audience laughing)

260
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,960
 And he employed a marketing guy who was like,

261
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,480
 "You really have to take this Ebola shit down.

262
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
 No one wants it."

263
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
 - People just want to buy stuff.

264
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,240
 - Another thing sold on eBay or what they tried to sell this

265
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,080
 and actually got taken off, Iceland, the country.

266
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,640
 And this was this part of the description.

267
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,040
 Bjork, not included.

268
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
 (audience laughing)

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,520
 - There was, did you read about the musician who sold,

270
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,440
 what he claimed was the world's longest hula hoop?

271
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,280
 - Oh, yeah. - So it was three inches.

272
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,480
 And this was last year, I think.

273
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
 - Whoa.

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
 (audience laughing)

275
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,000
 - Whoa, no.

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,520
 - He's pissed out.

277
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
 - How much did he go full?

278
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,680
 - Well, someone bid 712 pounds for it.

279
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,440
 - If I had known about this at the time,

280
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
 I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.

281
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,880
 - I would cheerfully affect three inches of hula hoop.

282
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,840
 - But you know what's really sad about this guy

283
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
 or kind of nice.

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
 He said he was going to use any funds he raised off,

285
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,400
 selling stuff on eBay to fund his commune

286
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
 that he wanted to set up.

287
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,600
 And one of the things he first tried to sell

288
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,840
 was his love on eBay.

289
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,040
 (audience laughing)

290
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
 He put that up there.

291
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,400
 He said he was willing to sit quietly somewhere

292
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,120
 and send you good vibes and love for five pounds.

293
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,800
 Five pounds was the maximum he got for that.

294
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,120
 And then he got 712 for an oversized hula hoop.

295
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
 - Yeah. - Looking at Andy,

296
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,400
 I think you'd rather have the hula hoop.

297
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,360
 - I would definitely rather have the hula hoop.

298
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,680
 - Can you imagine opening the packet and finding that?

299
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
 (audience laughing)

300
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
 - It would be so exciting.

301
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,400
 I mean, the packets are barely four inches long.

302
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
 It's a bit, you know.

303
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,720
 - Sorry. - Let's put love and the love.

304
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
 (audience laughing)

305
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,040
 - I want a massive hula hoop.

306
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,200
 (audience laughing)

307
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,920
 - There was actually, I know this seems implausible,

308
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
 but this was last year.

309
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,280
 And then there was a 26 year old woman in March,

310
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,960
 this year, who found a bigger hula hoop,

311
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,120
 which she then put on eBay.

312
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
 - Did you get more for it?

313
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
 - That was five inches long.

314
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,840
 I don't think she actually got off with much,

315
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,000
 'cause the craze was stood over by that point.

316
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,320
 - I feel there isn't enough astonishment

317
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
 in the room about this.

318
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
 (audience laughing)

319
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,800
 The normal hula hoop is about a 10th as long as that.

320
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,360
 (audience laughing)

321
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,840
 So in 2004, there was a sale on eBay of some water

322
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,480
 that Elvis had left in a cup.

323
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,120
 It went for 237 quid, all the equivalent in dollars.

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
 And it was from a plastic cup that he'd sit from

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,520
 in North Carolina in 1977.

326
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,880
 - But isn't it true that the person who sold it kept the cup?

327
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
 - He kept the cup, yes.

328
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 (audience laughing)

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,160
 - So he sent out the water, but the cup was, yeah.

330
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,720
 - And he said at the time, I promised this thing

331
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,360
 is 100% legitimate.

332
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
 (audience laughing)

333
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,840
 - But did it have a certificate that went with him

334
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,560
 just writing, seriously, I promise.

335
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
 (audience laughing)

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,720
 Can I mention a few things about lasers?

337
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,760
 - Yeah, yeah. - Because so he broke this,

338
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,680
 the fact was a broken laser pointer.

339
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,120
 I read that the sort of founding father

340
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,160
 of laser technology died just this year.

341
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,960
 Charles Towns, he originally came up not with the laser,

342
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,760
 he sort of had the one just before it was called the laser.

343
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,600
 (audience laughing)

344
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 But I mean, how amazing that he was able to see how far it's come

345
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,320
 and he made it into a Bond movie with his invention.

346
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 Bond's crotch was almost burnt off, wasn't it?

347
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
 - By his invention.

348
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,080
 - And the novel apparently it was a circular saw

349
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,360
 that he was attacked by rather than a laser.

350
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
 - Really? - Apparently.

351
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,280
 - But they put the laser in the movie

352
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,160
 to make it a bit more exciting.

353
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,600
 The way that they worked it is they had a special effects man

354
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,560
 underneath the table and he was burning,

355
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,720
 cutting through the table from beneath

356
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,080
 with a kind of a torch.

357
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,200
 And apparently because he was doing that,

358
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,280
 it meant that Sean Connery was sweating and worried

359
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,400
 in the same way that he would have been

360
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,880
 if a laser was coming from above

361
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,560
 because not only was this kind of being cut from below,

362
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
 the guy below couldn't see where he was cutting through.

363
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
 (audience laughing)

364
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,520
 - And also when the director wants the shot to end,

365
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,880
 he'll shout, "Cut."

366
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 (audience laughing)

367
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,960
 - This guy, Charles Townes, when he invented the laser,

368
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,000
 everyone, or as he was proposing it,

369
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,840
 he needed funding and he asked for funding

370
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,000
 and everyone in the scientific community

371
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,320
 thought that he was insane, that it wouldn't work.

372
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,040
 It was going against certain laws that were in place

373
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
 about physics and the world.

374
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,920
 And they said that this is why Dr. Schreiber,

375
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,960
 please kind of understand what you're saying.

376
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,680
 (audience laughing)

377
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
 We have a lay audience here.

378
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,520
 (audience laughing)

379
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,920
 - Yeah, so science said that it couldn't work

380
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,240
 and so he still went along with it

381
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,640
 and Neil's bore whose very famous physicist said,

382
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,720
 "This is not gonna work."

383
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,480
 To the point where eventually a few scientists said,

384
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,840
 we need to write to him.

385
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,400
 We actually know the letter that was sent to him

386
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,360
 which was by Isadora Isaac Rabi.

387
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,520
 And this is genuine, look, you should stop the work

388
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,640
 you were doing.

389
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,080
 It isn't gonna work.

390
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,640
 You know it's not gonna work.

391
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,480
 We know it's not gonna work.

392
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,120
 You're wasting money, just stop.

393
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,080
 (audience laughing)

394
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,480
 And then three months later was the first successful experiment

395
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,400
 of the laser. - Wow.

396
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,040
 - Yeah. - Oh.

397
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
 - Amazing. - That's so cool.

398
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,200
 - Someone's used a laser cutter to imprint a song

399
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,680
 onto a tortilla.

400
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
 (audience laughing)

401
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
 - It should be, for it to work,

402
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
 it should be an uncooked tortilla if you wanted to try it.

403
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
 And they printed a Mexican dance onto it.

404
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,400
 It didn't sound very good, actually,

405
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,040
 but you can watch on YouTube.

406
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
 - Charles Towns would, I think, be glad to know.

407
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
 (audience laughing)

408
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,520
 Okay, we're gonna have to move on to our next fact

409
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,000
 and that is Chazinski.

410
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 - Yes, my fact is that when Alexander Fleming's neighbors

411
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,120
 followed a burglary at his house,

412
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
 as a thank you gift, he gave them some mold.

413
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,080
 (audience laughing)

414
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
 - This is kind of a predictable possibly

415
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,360
 for everyone who knows who Alexander Fleming is.

416
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,760
 He gave them the mold, not just some mold.

417
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
 So he gave them the first penicillin culture.

418
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,720
 So it was really short before he died, actually.

419
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,000
 And his neighbors saw burglars trying to burgl his house

420
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
 and they stopped them and they called the police

421
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,640
 and then they received a letter shortly afterwards

422
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,040
 from Alexander Fleming and Mrs. Montgomery,

423
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,600
 his housekeeper, saying, look, enclosed as some mold.

424
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
 And then Mrs. Montgomery clarified,

425
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,280
 she wrote something on lines of, as though you didn't know,

426
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,760
 but just in case this set of fare is a blob

427
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,520
 of the original mold of penicillin,

428
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,680
 not to be confused with Gorgonzola cheese.

429
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,760
 (audience laughing)

430
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
 - Yeah, I was gonna say, how did they know

431
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,280
 it was the original mold?

432
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's a bit like Elvis' water, isn't it?

433
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,960
 It's just a letter saying, no, it really is the original mold.

434
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
 - And they kept the petri dish that it had grown in,

435
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,440
 actually, it just gave them the mold.

436
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,040
 (audience laughing)

437
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,000
 - Birmingham had a very high star rating on eBay.

438
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,640
 So I think he was a trustworthy seller by that point.

439
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,560
 So this just went up for auction, didn't it?

440
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,400
 - It sure did, yeah.

441
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,680
 - Yeah, do you know how much it sold for?

442
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,520
 - Go on.

443
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,360
 - Was it 712 pounds in a hotly contested race

444
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,080
 with a three-inch long hula hoop?

445
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,840
 (audience laughing)

446
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,320
 - And you don't know how eBay works.

447
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,560
 (audience laughing)

448
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,680
 Where's one more like ed, the hula hoop on the mold?

449
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,840
 (audience laughing)

450
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,680
 - And he just bids for every single eBay

451
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,640
 in the hope that one day a hula hoop comes.

452
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,440
 (audience laughing)

453
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,680
 - Oh, it's sold for 4,720 pounds.

454
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,080
 - Do you think that's not much?

455
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,920
 - I'm pissed off.

456
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,680
 - That's such an achievable amount to buy.

457
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,160
 - I'm so glad you said this, it's exactly,

458
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,680
 I wanted to call you up and say,

459
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,040
 why didn't we get together and buy this?

460
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,880
 - Yeah.

461
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,120
 - I think you two aren't too much.

462
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
 (audience laughing)

463
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
 - I allow myself to work with that boss.

464
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,760
 (audience laughing)

465
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,320
 - But he discovered it really,

466
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
 far before it was used in medicine, didn't he?

467
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,320
 He discovered it in about 1928 and then he wrote a paper

468
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,200
 on it saying this has antibiotic properties,

469
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,160
 this could be very useful.

470
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,720
 - He couldn't quite get it working, that was it.

471
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
 - Yeah, and nobody paid any attention

472
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,040
 for another 10 years.

473
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,520
 - There was this huge argument over who had really

474
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,440
 invented it or made it useful for mankind.

475
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
 - Oh, did they argue over it?

476
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,920
 'Cause they shared the Nobel Prize,

477
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,480
 Flurry and Shane and Fleming.

478
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,800
 - There was a guy called Elmroth Wright who worked with Fleming

479
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,760
 who wrote a letter to the Times saying,

480
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,440
 actually it was me who came up with that, not him.

481
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,240
 And then the press all went down to speak to both of them.

482
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,000
 Fleming worked for this big company actually

483
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,560
 and he was, you know, he did find it,

484
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,800
 but he worked for this big company

485
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,040
 and he was just like a small cog in it really.

486
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,480
 But the press went down to speak to them

487
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,720
 but the reason that we all kind of know Fleming today

488
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
 is 'cause he had such a good story.

489
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,760
 He came from a humble background.

490
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,040
 He supposedly came up with it serendipitously

491
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
 like there was a little petri dish on his desk

492
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,640
 and it just accidentally grew and it was just a better story.

493
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
 And the other story was like basically

494
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,000
 a group of international researchers working in state.

495
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,320
 - Oh, it did.

496
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,720
 - Snore.

497
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,200
 - It was the accidental discovery.

498
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,840
 He went away for a trip and then he came back

499
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,000
 and he found that he had a load of bacterial cultures

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
 and one of them, the bacteria weren't growing.

501
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
 And it was because the mold had supposedly drifted

502
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 through the window.

503
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,280
 - I read a really interesting set of articles

504
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,280
 about the idea that they think that he got to his

505
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,960
 to noticing what was going on because he was an artist.

506
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
 He painted, he painted a lot,

507
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
 but he didn't use actual colors

508
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,200
 that you would buy in shops and so on.

509
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,720
 He grew his colors in petri dishes.

510
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,200
 - He would like have this petri dish

511
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,840
 with different microbes in there

512
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
 and some of them would grow green

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
 and that would be grass, some would grow blue.

514
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
 That would be the sky.

515
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,680
 And it would just make these beautiful little images.

516
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,520
 And the great thing was

517
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,720
 is they would only last for a few like days

518
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,120
 and then they would all grow into each other.

519
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,280
 So it was really a trend.

520
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,120
 - That's amazing.

521
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,960
 Isn't that crazy?

522
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
 So he used to paint things like ballerinas, horses,

523
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,120
 mother's feeding children, stick figures, fighting.

524
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,000
 I mean, that's pretty cool.

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,920
 - Conveniently, they didn't last long

526
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,000
 'cause out a few days it just appeared.

527
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
 So we have no evidence they were any good at all.

528
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
 - Well, he used to show them to people

529
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,960
 and people wrote about them

530
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,720
 and one day he showed them to Queen Mary who said,

531
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
 "I don't see the points of these."

532
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 (laughing)

533
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,960
 Apparently he was Alexander Fleming

534
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,040
 who was very bad at conversation

535
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,440
 and on his entry on the Oxford Dictionary

536
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,120
 of National Bography, this was how someone put it.

537
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,000
 As one visitor put it, talking with him

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,960
 was like playing tennis with a man who,

539
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
 whenever you knock the ball over to his side,

540
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,120
 put it in his pocket.

541
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,400
 (laughing)

542
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,480
 - That is such a good description

543
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,440
 of so many conversations we all have.

544
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,080
 (laughing)

545
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
 - With James.

546
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,040
 (laughing)

547
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,480
 - I call it fall taller.

548
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
 (laughing)

549
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
 - He did say I really liked this quote from him

550
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,040
 when he was interviewed about discovering penicillin.

551
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,080
 He said, "When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th,

552
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,120
 "1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine

553
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
 "by discovering the world's first antibiotic,

554
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,040
 "but I suppose that was exactly what I did."

555
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,880
 - Wow.

556
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,400
 - I reckon whatever you had a conversation with him,

557
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,840
 that was always his reply to no matter what you said.

558
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,480
 (laughing)

559
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
 - Here's something cool about penicillin.

560
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,480
 So after the, so in about the late 30s, 38, 39,

561
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
 it was really, really costly and very, very labor intensive

562
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,520
 to make more of it.

563
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,840
 And you needed 2000 liters of mold culture fluid

564
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,720
 to get enough pure penicillin to treat a single patient.

565
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,120
 So obviously that was incredibly time consuming

566
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,480
 and difficult and laborious.

567
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,400
 So to make up the shortfall, the researchers extracted it

568
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
 from the urine of patients who had already taken it.

569
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
 So when you take penicillin, 40 to 99% of it

570
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,480
 is excreted about four hours later,

571
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,840
 'cause your kidney's very good at getting rid of it.

572
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
 So you could take the urine, crystallize it,

573
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,880
 extract the penicillin, give it to the patient

574
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,080
 in the next bed.

575
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,800
 - Oh, wow, that is strange.

576
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,360
 - So you literally take in the piss?

577
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,200
 - Yes.

578
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,480
 (laughing)

579
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 - This confused me about, so the original fact

580
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,640
 about the penicillin being sold on eBay,

581
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
 in the scientific American article

582
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,680
 where I initially read this, the title was,

583
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,520
 Fleming's original penicillin culture sold at auction,

584
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,600
 and then there was a little note at the bottom of corrections

585
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,680
 saying in tiny writing, this article was originally published

586
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,320
 with the title Old Mold Sold.

587
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,640
 (laughing)

588
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,120
 Why did you change that?

589
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,840
 (laughing)

590
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,680
 - So penicillin Camembertie is the mold

591
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,120
 which is used to make Camembert and it's naturally green.

592
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,240
 And so Camembert always used to be green.

593
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,200
 And then suddenly it started to get a bit whiter

594
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
 and then humans selected it to get whiter

595
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,240
 and whiter and whiter and now it's white.

596
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
 But only a few hundred years ago,

597
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,040
 Camembert was all green.

598
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,520
 - Wow.

599
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,840
 - Is it good for you if you take Camembert here?

600
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,160
 - It's, three times a day.

601
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,320
 (laughing)

602
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,480
 - I would say it's worth a try.

603
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,800
 - Yeah.

604
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,640
 - In Asia and Egypt,

605
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,440
 they used to whack moldy bread onto their wounds.

606
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,280
 I think they did.

607
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,240
 And they thought that that was one of the first uses

608
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,480
 of the effects of penicillin, essentially.

609
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,920
 - And the way that they used to make Camembert

610
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,120
 is they used to get bread and put it in a cave.

611
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,280
 And then the bread would get moldy and moldy

612
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
 and then they'd get the bread out

613
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,360
 and then kind of turn it into a dust

614
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,040
 and then they put the dust into the cheese

615
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,560
 and that's how they got Camembert.

616
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,680
 - We're gonna have to move on.

617
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,320
 I got one last thing.

618
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,400
 Penicillin, the name itself, penicillin,

619
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,560
 he didn't come up with for quite a few months.

620
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,160
 So he had a working title.

621
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
 I think they should have kept it.

622
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,520
 Mold juice.

623
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,120
 (laughing)

624
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,400
 - Okay, time for our final fact of the evening

625
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
 and that is James Harkin.

626
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,200
 - Okay, my fact this week is

627
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,400
 that the earliest known ice cream recipe

628
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,800
 suggests flavoring with poo.

629
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,280
 (laughing)

630
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,160
 - If this is what Harkin as Belgian chocolate is,

631
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,640
 I'm gonna be pretty upset.

632
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,080
 (laughing)

633
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,560
 - No, they offered lots of different things.

634
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,200
 Orange, flour, water was one of the things.

635
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,520
 And the other one was ambergree, which is whale poo.

636
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,760
 - Oh, that's not human poo.

637
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,080
 I've won't sell disappointed.

638
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
 (laughing)

639
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,480
 - So yeah, ambergree is sperm whale poo.

640
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,600
 It's when a sperm whale eats a squid

641
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,320
 and the beak is indigestible.

642
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,120
 And so its body creates mucus and vomity covering

643
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,360
 of the squid's beak.

644
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,760
 And then it expels it almost always through the anus.

645
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,440
 And people in the olden days really like the taste of it.

646
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,000
 And they describe it as earthy and mildly fecal.

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,920
 - Wow.

648
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,720
 - And apparently this was the kind of thing

649
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
 you flavored ice cream with at the back of the day.

650
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,840
 - It floats around, doesn't it?

651
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,240
 On the sea for months or sometimes years.

652
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,320
 'Cause only about 1% of sperm whales produce ambergree

653
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
 and they're not that many sperm whales.

654
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,640
 And so as it floats, it hardens and it changes

655
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,680
 and it takes on a much more perfumey aroma

656
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,560
 than you would think it would have.

657
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,040
 - And it's worth a fortune if you find it on the shore

658
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,520
 because it's what they use for--

659
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
 - Although it's some countries you're not allowed to sell it

660
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,480
 and a lot of places use fake ambergree now,

661
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,200
 but yeah, if you can find the buyer,

662
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,360
 you can sell it for a lot of money.

663
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
 - Because it's used in perfume, right?

664
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,480
 So-- - Yeah, it used to be at least.

665
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,360
 - Well, a lot of perfume companies,

666
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,640
 so there's actually a really good book on this

667
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,520
 called Floating Gold.

668
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
 But perfume companies tend to deny that they use it,

669
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,520
 but this guy found a lot of people who sell ambergree

670
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,280
 to a lot of companies like Chanel, et cetera.

671
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,040
 So yeah, they still use--

672
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,480
 And apparently it does smell delicious and incredible.

673
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,000
 - The worst thing about it is to make it

674
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,320
 to put the stuff into the food,

675
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
 you would make a tincture of ambergree.

676
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,040
 And to make that, you had to warm it very slowly.

677
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,640
 And the way that they would do that is either put it

678
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
 in the sun, but if it wasn't sunny,

679
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
 you would put it in hot dung--

680
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,080
 - Ah, wow.

681
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,720
 - So if it wasn't fecal enough,

682
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,400
 you had to make it a little bit more fecal

683
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
 before putting it in your ice cream.

684
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
 - I have a story about finding it thing, finding it on the beach.

685
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,160
 So in 2013, there was a dog water on a beach in Lancashire,

686
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,920
 and he found a three kilo lump, and that is huge.

687
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
 I mean, you get the smallest 15 grams of the lumps of ambergree.

688
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,440
 And the report said it could be worth up to 100,000 pounds,

689
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,760
 and one French expert offered him 50,000 euros

690
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,000
 if it checked out.

691
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
 And he said, it smelled horrible.

692
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,960
 I left it, came back home, and looked it up on the internet.

693
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
 When I saw how much it could be worth,

694
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,600
 I went back and grabbed it.

695
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,280
 And then there was another story in the same newspaper,

696
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,200
 two months later, which revealed it wasn't ambergree.

697
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,040
 And he said, if I had my time again,

698
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,000
 I would kick the rock to one side and walk away.

699
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,400
 I wish I'd never found it.

700
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,880
 - I read the article as well, and it said,

701
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,240
 it turned out to be just a smelly rock.

702
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,480
 Can we talk about poo very quickly?

703
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,240
 - Yes, please.

704
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,720
 - Okay, cool.

705
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
 There's a museum in Tasmania called Mona.

706
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,360
 If you don't know Mona, it's very famous, very good museum.

707
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,960
 - It's incredible best gallery I've ever been in my life,

708
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,800
 by the way.

709
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,600
 - So there's an art exhibition in the Mona Museum

710
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,080
 that takes a poo at 2 p.m. every day.

711
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,920
 - Sorry.

712
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,240
 - The exhibition itself takes a poo.

713
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,560
 - It's actually a very sick museum employee.

714
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
 (laughing)

715
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,000
 They were actually little plaques next to him.

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,920
 - He's been trying to pass it off as,

717
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,080
 though it must have been the museum that took the poo.

718
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,560
 (laughing)

719
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,560
 They have an installation which has been designed by someone

720
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,360
 which replicates the actions of a human digestive system,

721
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,480
 so it starts, it gets fed twice a day,

722
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,840
 and at 2 p.m. every day it produces a poo

723
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
 and lats out the poo.

724
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760
 - Great.

725
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
 - Yeah, they did it because they had a really successful

726
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,920
 exhibit just before it called the vomit room.

727
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,360
 Sounds like an amazing museum.

728
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,600
 They call it the adult's Disneyland.

729
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,440
 - It is?

730
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,920
 - I mean, is it still a poo?

731
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
 (laughing)

732
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,680
 - Again, we've gone philosophical, but I think,

733
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,560
 that's what I'm sort of, hmm, all right.

734
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,920
 - That's so soft on ice cream, maybe.

735
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
 - Yeah.

736
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,920
 - In Uta Pradesh in 2007,

737
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,240
 you could buy something called Hitler ice cream.

738
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,880
 This was basically ice cream

739
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,400
 with a big picture of Hitler of it.

740
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,440
 - It wasn't, it wasn't flavored, right?

741
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
 (laughing)

742
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,520
 And apparently the people that didn't really realize

743
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,400
 the problem with doing such a thing,

744
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,360
 the guy who was selling it when interviews said,

745
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,400
 "One of my uncles is a short tempered and strict man,

746
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,600
 "so we nicknamed him Hitler and we called it after him."

747
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 (laughing)

748
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
 It's a good excuse.

749
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
 But they have form actually in India.

750
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
 In 2000, in the same year, actually, in Mumbai,

751
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
 there was a whole furnishing firm

752
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,480
 who did bedsheets called the Nazi collection,

753
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,440
 which were full of swastikers.

754
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,040
 But when they were asked about it,

755
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,280
 they said that Nazi stood for new arrival zone for India.

756
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,400
 (laughing)

757
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,040
 Wow.

758
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,520
 Very quick thinking, actually.

759
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,160
 Did you guys know that Ben and Jerry's

760
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,680
 has an ice cream flavor graveyard?

761
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,520
 (laughing)

762
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
 - No, really.

763
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,520
 - It's so cool.

764
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,320
 So it's for every ice cream flavor that has died over the years,

765
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,920
 which is actually quite a lot, such a gross ad.

766
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,560
 And they, it's a real graveyard.

767
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,160
 They've got tombstones in there.

768
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,000
 - Yes.

769
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,120
 - They've got the name of the ice cream on the tombstones.

770
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,280
 And then they've written a little individual poem

771
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,440
 for each ice cream that's died a terrible death.

772
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,760
 And it's brilliant.

773
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,320
 - So some examples are the ice cream shwetty balls.

774
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
 (laughing)

775
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,880
 - Why are they after they get rid of that?

776
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,400
 - It's so impossible to know.

777
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,240
 Seems like a winner.

778
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
 - What did it taste like?

779
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
 (laughing)

780
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,640
 - I don't think we need to answer that.

781
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,040
 No, apparently that was based on a Saturday Night Live sketch

782
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,080
 from the '90s where Alec Baldwin talks

783
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,640
 about shwetty balls ice cream, I don't know.

784
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,640
 But yeah, that did not last very long.

785
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,480
 There's a vermonty python ice cream, which also died.

786
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
 - Oh yeah.

787
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,480
 - There is right then.

788
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
 Is it dead or isn't it?

789
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
 No, it isn't.

790
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,560
 Yes, it is.

791
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,400
 No, it isn't.

792
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
 Rubbish.

793
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,080
 You're a loonie.

794
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
 No, I'm not.

795
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,920
 Like it.

796
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,440
 (laughing)

797
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
 - Makes sense, right?

798
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,800
 - Yeah, great.

799
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,440
 - I didn't know that I feel like I might be the only person

800
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,360
 that didn't know this.

801
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,600
 But I didn't realize that Hagen does wasn't a real name.

802
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,040
 In terms of, I thought Hagen does the ice cream was called

803
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,480
 Hagen does because either there were two people

804
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,760
 one called Hagen, one called does.

805
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,200
 - Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

806
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,240
 - So what it was was a Polish guy lived in New York

807
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,520
 and he wanted just a nice Danish sounding name.

808
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,400
 And his daughter said they would sit around the table

809
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,520
 and he'd be like, "Splagen Mars, vegan Mars, vegan does."

810
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,360
 Hagen does.

811
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,200
 And they went, "That sounds good."

812
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,040
 That's why they called it.

813
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,880
 It was him around the dinner table going,

814
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,440
 "Hagen does, that Hagen does."

815
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
 And they named it there.

816
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,760
 - Same for Rolex.

817
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,640
 There are lots of very vexed etymologies.

818
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
 We don't really know where it comes from.

819
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,080
 There are a few theories about it,

820
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,240
 but they all contradict each other.

821
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,160
 - Well, they think they just made it up

822
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 'cause it sounded nice.

823
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
 - Maybe.

824
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,840
 Yeah, that's one of the theories.

825
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,680
 - Uncle Ben's rice is made by--

826
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,400
 - Don't tell me Uncle Ben doesn't exist, James.

827
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,280
 - I'm really sorry.

828
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,120
 - Come on.

829
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
 - It was made by a German guy, German company,

830
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
 and they called it Uncle Ben's to make it sound more American.

831
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,000
 - Oh, I don't like to hear that.

832
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
 - Wow.

833
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,000
 - Wow.

834
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,240
 - Mr. Whippy, do you know where that came from?

835
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,400
 You know, Mr. Whippy or South Scoop, if you're American?

836
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,520
 Ice cream.

837
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,640
 - It's not a story that it came from Margaret Thatcher.

838
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,280
 - Yeah, there's a story that Margaret Thatcher

839
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,880
 was on the original team which developed Mr. Whippy ice cream.

840
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,000
 But I think it's not really true, is it?

841
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,440
 - She was, I think she was a chemist.

842
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,840
 - That's for the company at the time.

843
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
 - She did work on ice cream, but not specifically on that.

844
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
 - But the time that we came up with, the idea of softer ice cream

845
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
 as a concept, a revolutionary idea, as everyone agrees,

846
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,120
 is this guy called Tom Carvell, who was an American,

847
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,560
 and he just sold ice cream and his truck broke down

848
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,400
 in some really hot American state.

849
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,760
 He got a flat tire, and so he had to pull over,

850
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,200
 and his ice cream was not melting,

851
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,760
 and he was like, "Oh, Margaret, what do I do with this?"

852
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,720
 And someone came up and said, "Oh, can I bite that?"

853
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,400
 And he realized they had just moving ice cream stool,

854
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,160
 and people wanted to buy melting ice cream.

855
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,360
 And so he stayed there.

856
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,360
 He set up shop next to a pottery shop, I think.

857
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,920
 And that's how where Mr. Whippy came,

858
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
 was melting ice cream accidentally,

859
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,520
 another accidental invention, much like penicillin.

860
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,440
 - I didn't mean to revolutionize ice cream when I got up today.

861
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,880
 (audience laughing)

862
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
 - Okay, I think we need to wrap up.

863
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,720
 We've run out of time, everyone.

864
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,640
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

865
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,840
