00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (techno music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.340
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.920
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.880
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.640
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.520
 this week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.840
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.000
 Please welcome to the stage the other three elves

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.280
 as Additch Isinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.280
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.720
 (audience applauding)

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.680
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.040
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.720
 - My fact this week is that the first man

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.120
 to swim the English channel later had a show

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.680
 where he floated in a tank for two hours.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 That was his show.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.800
 His name was Matthew Webb and to get extra funding,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.480
 he would do a special endurance show

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.600
 where he floated in a tank for 128 hours.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.040
 - Whoa, that's one hour better than the guy stuck in the rock.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.880
 - Yeah.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.320
 - Probably as interesting as well

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.440
 in terms of a feature length movie.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.280
 - Yeah.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.360
 - I mean without a flotation device.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 - Without a flotation device.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
 - And that's really impressive.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 - It's very impressive.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.160
 - Yeah, in a boat it's not quite as impressive.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 (audience laughing)

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.760
 - It's just basically a big swimming pool right

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.640
 where he's just paddling around.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.400
 - Yeah, I'm treading water I guess is what he was doing.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 - Yeah, okay, yeah.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120
 - So he wasn't lying on his back.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.000
 That's not fluting.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 I think that's just swimming.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.840
 - Like a child.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.320
 - He got very philosophical very early on.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.120
 (audience laughing)

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.200
 - The first time he ever did this kind of floting

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 for as long as possible,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.480
 it was against a Newfoundland dog.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.080
 He had a bet that he'd be able to float

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.000
 for longer than a dog and he won his bet.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.080
 - Did the dog die?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.240
 (audience laughing)

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 As they fished the dog out.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.920
 Victory for Webb.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 - I mean did the dog even know it was taking part in a bet?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.040
 (audience laughing)

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.360
 - Captain Webb won a year's supply of pedigree charm.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 (audience laughing)

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 So this is Captain Webb.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 This is who we're talking about British hero.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.320
 - Yeah, and he was amazing.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.400
 This was 1875 when he did this

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.560
 and when he swam the channel that is.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 And after that he didn't really stay famous.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.080
 He tried to keep himself famous

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.680
 by doing these endurance events and things like that,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.800
 but he found it quite hard.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.040
 But I read that he was so famous

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.720
 that when he came back from the channel swimming

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360
 and he went back to his hometown

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.920
 with a band procession going on,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.200
 he was so loved that even a pig got up on his trotters

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600
 to look at him as he went by.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.080
 (audience laughing)

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.160
 - Well the pig know that it was taking part in a procession.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.280
 (audience laughing)

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.240
 In 1883, just eight years after he was the hero of the nation,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.560
 he tried to swim across a particular bit of the river

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.160
 down from Niagara Falls and it was extremely dangerous

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.440
 and more than 10,000 people turned up to watch him

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.760
 and he drowned there.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.040
 He was dragged under a current

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.600
 and his body was found a few days later

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 and he was doing it to try and provide for his family.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.720
 - So I was going through the newspaper archives

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.640
 and before he did it, every single headline

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.720
 about what he was about to do said,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.480
 "We're the engages in suicidal endeavor."

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.240
 Every headline went, "A fool's there and totally mad.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.000
 "Everyone predicts he will die."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.480
 There's a whirlpool about 20 yards down the river

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.840
 into which he'd will definitely be sucked and perished

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.440
 and he went on and did it anyway.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.160
 I just wonder if he read any of that.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.480
 (audience laughing)

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.920
 - He didn't like to read his own press.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.400
 He was a very modest man.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.040
 But actually everyone thought that he would die

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.440
 when he swam the channel as well.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.560
 It was 34 kilometers but it actually took him

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.600
 64 kilometers to swim it because of all the currents.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.400
 He just went in a real zigzag all the way.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.600
 - He refused to ask the directions.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.640
 (audience laughing)

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.280
 - And he smothered himself in poor pice fat

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.640
 to keep warm, which is quite good.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.480
 And towards the end, he got really tired

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.040
 but then a boat went past

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.720
 and everyone on the boat started singing

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.560
 "Rule Britannia" to keep him going.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.440
 - And I don't know if this would have been an encouragement

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.160
 or put him off, but apparently his coach Arthur Payne

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.840
 used to jump in occasionally and swim alongside him.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.600
 - Which I would find really irritating.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.080
 Hey man, this is easy.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.160
 (audience laughing)

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.000
 - I read also at one stage that he had a run in with a poor pice.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 (audience laughing)

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.160
 - It's a boy you covered in poor pice fat.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.480
 What have you done with my friends?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.520
 (audience laughing)

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.440
 - I think that might have been it.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.560
 They might have confused him.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.880
 Smells like a poor pice, looks like a poor pice.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.360
 (audience laughing)

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.120
 But there was actually someone who went across

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.160
 the channel before him.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
 He was called Paul the Fearless Frogman, Boynton.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160
 (audience laughing)

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.560
 And he did manage to get in a cross

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.280
 but he was wearing a rubber suit with a puddle and a sail.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.000
 (audience laughing)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.600
 - He towed a boat behind him, I think,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.480
 which had his supplies in it.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.320
 - He towed a boat.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.160
 - He towed a boat a lot.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.880
 - This is much more impressive than Matthew were.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.720
 (audience laughing)

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.560
 - I mean he had a sail.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.680
 I think he had some kind of a small like makeshift

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.360
 clockwork motor thing.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.880
 I'm not sure where we draw the line swimming,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.200
 but I think that is not swimming.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.360
 - It sounds amazing.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.200
 It could support you, so help you float in the water.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.000
 And also you could store nine days worth of food

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.840
 in the pockets.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.040
 (audience laughing)

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.160
 - Basically it was a publicity stunt to sell this suit

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.600
 'cause he called it a life-saving suit.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.720
 - He was actually the guy, he set up the first ever theme park

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.520
 in America and then he set up what became Coney Island.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.360
 - Oh.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.120
 - And then he befriended sea lions

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.160
 and used to appear in silent films with them all the time.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.000
 - That hang on.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.160
 (audience laughing)

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.560
 - He just, they were, who he felt closest to.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.400
 - He befriended sea lions.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.960
 - Yeah, he performed in films with sea lions.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.120
 - The sea lions know they were being befriended.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.800
 (audience laughing)

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.080
 - Even cooler than there was someone who swam across before,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.480
 even what was it, Paul, the amazing frogman,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.800
 boy, it's a fearless frogman.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.600
 It was a guy called William Hoskins, and this was in 1862,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.840
 and he kick paddled his way across on a bail of straw.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.800
 (audience laughing)

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.720
 I was the first man to go across the channel, not in a boat.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.240
 - Do you guys know who the best living swimmer

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.400
 alive today is?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.040
 - Michael Phelps.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.760
 - Oh no, so this is for a long distance.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.160
 I'm talking, it's a guy called Martin Strell.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.000
 - Okay.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.480
 - He had a lot of TV shows, so actually might be a name

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.920
 familiar to those listening and those here tonight.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.240
 He's an amazing guy, he's a Slovenian, long distance swimmer.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.960
 He swam the entire Amazon river,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.440
 first person ever to do that.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.440
 The Danube, the Yang Sea, he did the Danube in one go.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.520
 He swam for 84 hours straight, he lost 40 pounds.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.000
 By the time he got out, he was 40 pounds lighter,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.160
 and along the way, and along every single swim that he does,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.920
 he drinks two bottles of wine.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.200
 He has just a favorite white wine, I think it is,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.040
 that he drinks.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.340
 - But there's sort of like,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.840
 thresher shocks along the way.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.160
 (audience laughing)

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.120
 The Amazon is much better provided for than I realized.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.800
 - That's where thresher sharks get the name, actually.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.520
 - Oh really, there's something.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.560
 (audience laughing)

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.360
 - But this is how hardcore he is with his swimming.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.560
 He hasn't swam the Nile yet, and he's been asked,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.040
 "Why have you not swam the Nile?"

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.640
 And he said that it's neither long or challenging enough.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.960
 - Oh, it is like the second longest river in the world.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.680
 - Yeah, I know, he said, it's just like a small creek.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.880
 - This guy is a liar.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.920
 I say that when people say, "Why have you never fought a lion?"

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.240
 They are neither large nor fierce enough for me,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.040
 so it's not worth me wasting my time.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.480
 (audience laughing)

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.120
 - We're gonna have to move on in about two minutes.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.560
 - Can I tell you one more guy who I found out about

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.360
 in terms of the annals of cross-channel swimming history.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.760
 This is one of my favorite ever people.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.400
 His name is Bob Platon, I don't know much about him,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.520
 but he crossed the channel on an iron bed stud in 1961,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.120
 which he had attached floating barrels to.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.160
 Then in 1963, he surpassed himself,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.720
 he went over on a barrel with an outboard motor.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.240
 Eventually commercialism crept in in 1969,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.840
 he went across again in a shoe sponsored by British Lather.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.960
 (audience laughing)

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.280
 And then in 1965, he crossed in a gin bottle

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.760
 sponsored by Gilby's gin.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.880
 - Hang on, where do we get these oversized gin bottles?

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.040
 (audience laughing)

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.400
 - Bob Platon, what a guy.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.960
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.160
 My fact this week is that the first item sold on eBay

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.080
 was a broken laser pointer.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.920
 - Yeah.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.320
 - And it was bought by a man who collects

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.800
 broken laser pointers.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.520
 (audience laughing)

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.920
 - Genuinely was, do you think he ever buys

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.320
 working laser pointers and then breaks them

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.840
 so that they can go in his collection?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.920
 (audience laughing)

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.760
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
 - That's a good question because you would have thought

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.360
 that the working laser pointer is actually easier

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.120
 to come across than a broken laser pointer.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.320
 - Yeah, the guy who sold it, did he know

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.600
 that someone might want a broken laser pointer?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.200
 What was he like, just scamming people?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.080
 - It was the creator of eBay.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.080
 So prior to eBay being called eBay,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.520
 it was called Auction Web.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.440
 And Auction Web was his little sideline.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.720
 There's a bit of a mythology that he set it up.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.080
 He set eBay up because his wife had a huge collection

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.000
 of pes dispenser as she wanted to get rid of.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.640
 And he thought, let's do it that way.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.080
 And that was actually marketed, I think,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.440
 through eBay themselves saying that was the case.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.560
 Turns out it's not true.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.280
 But so it was the guy who set up eBay.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.400
 - So this guy who started eBay, it was called Auction Web

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.280
 but it was on eBay.com I think.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.880
 And he had some other sites on eBay.com as well.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.960
 And one of them was an Ebola information site.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.080
 That was the first thing on eBay.com,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.360
 a place to find out where Ebola's happening around the world.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.400
 - Yeah, he was weirdly obsessed with Ebola, right?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.640
 In the 90s, before it was kind of fashionable.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.880
 (audience laughing)

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.960
 And he employed a marketing guy who was like,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.480
 "You really have to take this Ebola shit down.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480
 No one wants it."

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.920
 - People just want to buy stuff.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.240
 - Another thing sold on eBay or what they tried to sell this

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.080
 and actually got taken off, Iceland, the country.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.640
 And this was this part of the description.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.040
 Bjork, not included.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.000
 (audience laughing)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.520
 - There was, did you read about the musician who sold,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.440
 what he claimed was the world's longest hula hoop?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.280
 - Oh, yeah. - So it was three inches.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.480
 And this was last year, I think.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.320
 - Whoa.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.160
 (audience laughing)

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.000
 - Whoa, no.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.520
 - He's pissed out.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.520
 - How much did he go full?

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.680
 - Well, someone bid 712 pounds for it.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.440
 - If I had known about this at the time,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440
 I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.880
 - I would cheerfully affect three inches of hula hoop.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.840
 - But you know what's really sad about this guy

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.440
 or kind of nice.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.360
 He said he was going to use any funds he raised off,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.400
 selling stuff on eBay to fund his commune

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.640
 that he wanted to set up.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.600
 And one of the things he first tried to sell

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.840
 was his love on eBay.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.040
 (audience laughing)

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 He put that up there.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.400
 He said he was willing to sit quietly somewhere

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.120
 and send you good vibes and love for five pounds.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.800
 Five pounds was the maximum he got for that.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.120
 And then he got 712 for an oversized hula hoop.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 - Yeah. - Looking at Andy,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.400
 I think you'd rather have the hula hoop.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.360
 - I would definitely rather have the hula hoop.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.680
 - Can you imagine opening the packet and finding that?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.680
 (audience laughing)

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.880
 - It would be so exciting.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.400
 I mean, the packets are barely four inches long.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.760
 It's a bit, you know.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.720
 - Sorry. - Let's put love and the love.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.560
 (audience laughing)

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.040
 - I want a massive hula hoop.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.200
 (audience laughing)

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.920
 - There was actually, I know this seems implausible,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.920
 but this was last year.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.280
 And then there was a 26 year old woman in March,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.960
 this year, who found a bigger hula hoop,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.120
 which she then put on eBay.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.960
 - Did you get more for it?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.160
 - That was five inches long.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.840
 I don't think she actually got off with much,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.000
 'cause the craze was stood over by that point.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.320
 - I feel there isn't enough astonishment

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.200
 in the room about this.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.040
 (audience laughing)

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.800
 The normal hula hoop is about a 10th as long as that.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.360
 (audience laughing)

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.840
 So in 2004, there was a sale on eBay of some water

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.480
 that Elvis had left in a cup.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.120
 It went for 237 quid, all the equivalent in dollars.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.120
 And it was from a plastic cup that he'd sit from

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.520
 in North Carolina in 1977.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.880
 - But isn't it true that the person who sold it kept the cup?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.000
 - He kept the cup, yes.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 (audience laughing)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.160
 - So he sent out the water, but the cup was, yeah.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.720
 - And he said at the time, I promised this thing

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.360
 is 100% legitimate.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.880
 (audience laughing)

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.840
 - But did it have a certificate that went with him

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.560
 just writing, seriously, I promise.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.000
 (audience laughing)

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.720
 Can I mention a few things about lasers?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.760
 - Yeah, yeah. - Because so he broke this,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.680
 the fact was a broken laser pointer.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.120
 I read that the sort of founding father

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.160
 of laser technology died just this year.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.960
 Charles Towns, he originally came up not with the laser,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.760
 he sort of had the one just before it was called the laser.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.600
 (audience laughing)

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.600
 But I mean, how amazing that he was able to see how far it's come

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.320
 and he made it into a Bond movie with his invention.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.320
 Bond's crotch was almost burnt off, wasn't it?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.160
 - By his invention.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.080
 - And the novel apparently it was a circular saw

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.360
 that he was attacked by rather than a laser.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.560
 - Really? - Apparently.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.280
 - But they put the laser in the movie

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.160
 to make it a bit more exciting.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.600
 The way that they worked it is they had a special effects man

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.560
 underneath the table and he was burning,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.720
 cutting through the table from beneath

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.080
 with a kind of a torch.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.200
 And apparently because he was doing that,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.280
 it meant that Sean Connery was sweating and worried

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.400
 in the same way that he would have been

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.880
 if a laser was coming from above

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.560
 because not only was this kind of being cut from below,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.880
 the guy below couldn't see where he was cutting through.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.440
 (audience laughing)

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.520
 - And also when the director wants the shot to end,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.880
 he'll shout, "Cut."

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.880
 (audience laughing)

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.960
 - This guy, Charles Townes, when he invented the laser,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.000
 everyone, or as he was proposing it,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.840
 he needed funding and he asked for funding

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.000
 and everyone in the scientific community

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.320
 thought that he was insane, that it wouldn't work.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.040
 It was going against certain laws that were in place

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.240
 about physics and the world.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.920
 And they said that this is why Dr. Schreiber,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.960
 please kind of understand what you're saying.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.680
 (audience laughing)

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.000
 We have a lay audience here.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.520
 (audience laughing)

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.920
 - Yeah, so science said that it couldn't work

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.240
 and so he still went along with it

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.640
 and Neil's bore whose very famous physicist said,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.720
 "This is not gonna work."

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.480
 To the point where eventually a few scientists said,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.840
 we need to write to him.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.400
 We actually know the letter that was sent to him

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.360
 which was by Isadora Isaac Rabi.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.520
 And this is genuine, look, you should stop the work

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.640
 you were doing.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.080
 It isn't gonna work.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.640
 You know it's not gonna work.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.480
 We know it's not gonna work.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.120
 You're wasting money, just stop.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.080
 (audience laughing)

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.480
 And then three months later was the first successful experiment

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.400
 of the laser. - Wow.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.040
 - Yeah. - Oh.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.400
 - Amazing. - That's so cool.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.200
 - Someone's used a laser cutter to imprint a song

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.680
 onto a tortilla.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.680
 (audience laughing)

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.120
 - It should be, for it to work,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.920
 it should be an uncooked tortilla if you wanted to try it.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.240
 And they printed a Mexican dance onto it.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.400
 It didn't sound very good, actually,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.040
 but you can watch on YouTube.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.360
 - Charles Towns would, I think, be glad to know.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.600
 (audience laughing)

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.520
 Okay, we're gonna have to move on to our next fact

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.000
 and that is Chazinski.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 - Yes, my fact is that when Alexander Fleming's neighbors

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.120
 followed a burglary at his house,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.480
 as a thank you gift, he gave them some mold.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.080
 (audience laughing)

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.880
 - This is kind of a predictable possibly

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.360
 for everyone who knows who Alexander Fleming is.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.760
 He gave them the mold, not just some mold.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.760
 So he gave them the first penicillin culture.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.720
 So it was really short before he died, actually.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.000
 And his neighbors saw burglars trying to burgl his house

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.400
 and they stopped them and they called the police

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.640
 and then they received a letter shortly afterwards

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.040
 from Alexander Fleming and Mrs. Montgomery,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.600
 his housekeeper, saying, look, enclosed as some mold.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.760
 And then Mrs. Montgomery clarified,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.280
 she wrote something on lines of, as though you didn't know,

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.760
 but just in case this set of fare is a blob

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.520
 of the original mold of penicillin,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.680
 not to be confused with Gorgonzola cheese.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.760
 (audience laughing)

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.960
 - Yeah, I was gonna say, how did they know

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.280
 it was the original mold?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.000
 It's a bit like Elvis' water, isn't it?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.960
 It's just a letter saying, no, it really is the original mold.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.960
 - And they kept the petri dish that it had grown in,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.440
 actually, it just gave them the mold.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.040
 (audience laughing)

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.000
 - Birmingham had a very high star rating on eBay.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.640
 So I think he was a trustworthy seller by that point.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.560
 So this just went up for auction, didn't it?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.400
 - It sure did, yeah.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.680
 - Yeah, do you know how much it sold for?

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.520
 - Go on.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.360
 - Was it 712 pounds in a hotly contested race

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.080
 with a three-inch long hula hoop?

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.840
 (audience laughing)

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.320
 - And you don't know how eBay works.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.560
 (audience laughing)

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.680
 Where's one more like ed, the hula hoop on the mold?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.840
 (audience laughing)

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.680
 - And he just bids for every single eBay

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.640
 in the hope that one day a hula hoop comes.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.440
 (audience laughing)

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.680
 - Oh, it's sold for 4,720 pounds.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.080
 - Do you think that's not much?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.920
 - I'm pissed off.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.680
 - That's such an achievable amount to buy.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.160
 - I'm so glad you said this, it's exactly,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.680
 I wanted to call you up and say,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.040
 why didn't we get together and buy this?

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.880
 - Yeah.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.120
 - I think you two aren't too much.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.320
 (audience laughing)

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.000
 - I allow myself to work with that boss.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.760
 (audience laughing)

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.320
 - But he discovered it really,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
 far before it was used in medicine, didn't he?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.320
 He discovered it in about 1928 and then he wrote a paper

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.200
 on it saying this has antibiotic properties,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.160
 this could be very useful.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.720
 - He couldn't quite get it working, that was it.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.960
 - Yeah, and nobody paid any attention

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.040
 for another 10 years.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.520
 - There was this huge argument over who had really

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.440
 invented it or made it useful for mankind.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.280
 - Oh, did they argue over it?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.920
 'Cause they shared the Nobel Prize,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.480
 Flurry and Shane and Fleming.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.800
 - There was a guy called Elmroth Wright who worked with Fleming

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.760
 who wrote a letter to the Times saying,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.440
 actually it was me who came up with that, not him.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.240
 And then the press all went down to speak to both of them.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.000
 Fleming worked for this big company actually

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.560
 and he was, you know, he did find it,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.800
 but he worked for this big company

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.040
 and he was just like a small cog in it really.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.480
 But the press went down to speak to them

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.720
 but the reason that we all kind of know Fleming today

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.080
 is 'cause he had such a good story.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.760
 He came from a humble background.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.040
 He supposedly came up with it serendipitously

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.360
 like there was a little petri dish on his desk

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.640
 and it just accidentally grew and it was just a better story.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.320
 And the other story was like basically

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.000
 a group of international researchers working in state.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.320
 - Oh, it did.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.720
 - Snore.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.200
 - It was the accidental discovery.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.840
 He went away for a trip and then he came back

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.000
 and he found that he had a load of bacterial cultures

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.480
 and one of them, the bacteria weren't growing.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.680
 And it was because the mold had supposedly drifted

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680
 through the window.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.280
 - I read a really interesting set of articles

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.280
 about the idea that they think that he got to his

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.960
 to noticing what was going on because he was an artist.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.600
 He painted, he painted a lot,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.800
 but he didn't use actual colors

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.200
 that you would buy in shops and so on.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.720
 He grew his colors in petri dishes.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.200
 - He would like have this petri dish

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.840
 with different microbes in there

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.000
 and some of them would grow green

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.520
 and that would be grass, some would grow blue.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.200
 That would be the sky.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.680
 And it would just make these beautiful little images.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.520
 And the great thing was

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.720
 is they would only last for a few like days

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.120
 and then they would all grow into each other.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.280
 So it was really a trend.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.120
 - That's amazing.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.960
 Isn't that crazy?

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.880
 So he used to paint things like ballerinas, horses,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.120
 mother's feeding children, stick figures, fighting.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.000
 I mean, that's pretty cool.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.920
 - Conveniently, they didn't last long

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.000
 'cause out a few days it just appeared.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.200
 So we have no evidence they were any good at all.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.000
 - Well, he used to show them to people

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.960
 and people wrote about them

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.720
 and one day he showed them to Queen Mary who said,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.480
 "I don't see the points of these."

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.480
 (laughing)

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.960
 Apparently he was Alexander Fleming

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.040
 who was very bad at conversation

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.440
 and on his entry on the Oxford Dictionary

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.120
 of National Bography, this was how someone put it.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.000
 As one visitor put it, talking with him

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.960
 was like playing tennis with a man who,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.960
 whenever you knock the ball over to his side,

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.120
 put it in his pocket.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.400
 (laughing)

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.480
 - That is such a good description

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.440
 of so many conversations we all have.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.080
 (laughing)

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.920
 - With James.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.040
 (laughing)

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.480
 - I call it fall taller.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.240
 (laughing)

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.240
 - He did say I really liked this quote from him

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.040
 when he was interviewed about discovering penicillin.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.080
 He said, "When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.120
 "1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.840
 "by discovering the world's first antibiotic,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.040
 "but I suppose that was exactly what I did."

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.880
 - Wow.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.400
 - I reckon whatever you had a conversation with him,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.840
 that was always his reply to no matter what you said.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.480
 (laughing)

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.840
 - Here's something cool about penicillin.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.480
 So after the, so in about the late 30s, 38, 39,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.640
 it was really, really costly and very, very labor intensive

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.520
 to make more of it.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.840
 And you needed 2000 liters of mold culture fluid

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.720
 to get enough pure penicillin to treat a single patient.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.120
 So obviously that was incredibly time consuming

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.480
 and difficult and laborious.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.400
 So to make up the shortfall, the researchers extracted it

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.360
 from the urine of patients who had already taken it.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.360
 So when you take penicillin, 40 to 99% of it

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.480
 is excreted about four hours later,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.840
 'cause your kidney's very good at getting rid of it.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.160
 So you could take the urine, crystallize it,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.880
 extract the penicillin, give it to the patient

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.080
 in the next bed.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.800
 - Oh, wow, that is strange.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.360
 - So you literally take in the piss?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.200
 - Yes.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.480
 (laughing)

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.480
 - This confused me about, so the original fact

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.640
 about the penicillin being sold on eBay,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.360
 in the scientific American article

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.680
 where I initially read this, the title was,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.520
 Fleming's original penicillin culture sold at auction,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.600
 and then there was a little note at the bottom of corrections

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.680
 saying in tiny writing, this article was originally published

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.320
 with the title Old Mold Sold.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.640
 (laughing)

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.120
 Why did you change that?

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.840
 (laughing)

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.680
 - So penicillin Camembertie is the mold

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.120
 which is used to make Camembert and it's naturally green.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.240
 And so Camembert always used to be green.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.200
 And then suddenly it started to get a bit whiter

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.360
 and then humans selected it to get whiter

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.240
 and whiter and whiter and now it's white.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.560
 But only a few hundred years ago,

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.040
 Camembert was all green.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.520
 - Wow.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.840
 - Is it good for you if you take Camembert here?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.160
 - It's, three times a day.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.320
 (laughing)

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.480
 - I would say it's worth a try.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.800
 - Yeah.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.640
 - In Asia and Egypt,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.440
 they used to whack moldy bread onto their wounds.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.280
 I think they did.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.240
 And they thought that that was one of the first uses

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.480
 of the effects of penicillin, essentially.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.920
 - And the way that they used to make Camembert

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.120
 is they used to get bread and put it in a cave.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.280
 And then the bread would get moldy and moldy

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.480
 and then they'd get the bread out

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.360
 and then kind of turn it into a dust

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.040
 and then they put the dust into the cheese

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.560
 and that's how they got Camembert.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.680
 - We're gonna have to move on.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.320
 I got one last thing.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.400
 Penicillin, the name itself, penicillin,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.560
 he didn't come up with for quite a few months.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.160
 So he had a working title.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.400
 I think they should have kept it.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.520
 Mold juice.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.120
 (laughing)

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:34.400
 - Okay, time for our final fact of the evening

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.480
 and that is James Harkin.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.200
 - Okay, my fact this week is

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.400
 that the earliest known ice cream recipe

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.800
 suggests flavoring with poo.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.280
 (laughing)

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.160
 - If this is what Harkin as Belgian chocolate is,

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.640
 I'm gonna be pretty upset.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.080
 (laughing)

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.560
 - No, they offered lots of different things.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.200
 Orange, flour, water was one of the things.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.520
 And the other one was ambergree, which is whale poo.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.760
 - Oh, that's not human poo.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.080
 I've won't sell disappointed.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.320
 (laughing)

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.480
 - So yeah, ambergree is sperm whale poo.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.600
 It's when a sperm whale eats a squid

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.320
 and the beak is indigestible.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.120
 And so its body creates mucus and vomity covering

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.360
 of the squid's beak.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.760
 And then it expels it almost always through the anus.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.440
 And people in the olden days really like the taste of it.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.000
 And they describe it as earthy and mildly fecal.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.920
 - Wow.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.720
 - And apparently this was the kind of thing

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.200
 you flavored ice cream with at the back of the day.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.840
 - It floats around, doesn't it?

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.240
 On the sea for months or sometimes years.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.320
 'Cause only about 1% of sperm whales produce ambergree

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.480
 and they're not that many sperm whales.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.640
 And so as it floats, it hardens and it changes

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.680
 and it takes on a much more perfumey aroma

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.560
 than you would think it would have.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.040
 - And it's worth a fortune if you find it on the shore

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.520
 because it's what they use for--

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.200
 - Although it's some countries you're not allowed to sell it

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.480
 and a lot of places use fake ambergree now,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.200
 but yeah, if you can find the buyer,

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.360
 you can sell it for a lot of money.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.800
 - Because it's used in perfume, right?

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.480
 So-- - Yeah, it used to be at least.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.360
 - Well, a lot of perfume companies,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.640
 so there's actually a really good book on this

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.520
 called Floating Gold.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.520
 But perfume companies tend to deny that they use it,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.520
 but this guy found a lot of people who sell ambergree

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.280
 to a lot of companies like Chanel, et cetera.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.040
 So yeah, they still use--

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.480
 And apparently it does smell delicious and incredible.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.000
 - The worst thing about it is to make it

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.320
 to put the stuff into the food,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.480
 you would make a tincture of ambergree.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.040
 And to make that, you had to warm it very slowly.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.640
 And the way that they would do that is either put it

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.280
 in the sun, but if it wasn't sunny,

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.360
 you would put it in hot dung--

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.080
 - Ah, wow.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.720
 - So if it wasn't fecal enough,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.400
 you had to make it a little bit more fecal

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.240
 before putting it in your ice cream.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.080
 - I have a story about finding it thing, finding it on the beach.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.160
 So in 2013, there was a dog water on a beach in Lancashire,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.920
 and he found a three kilo lump, and that is huge.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.920
 I mean, you get the smallest 15 grams of the lumps of ambergree.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.440
 And the report said it could be worth up to 100,000 pounds,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.760
 and one French expert offered him 50,000 euros

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.000
 if it checked out.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.080
 And he said, it smelled horrible.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.960
 I left it, came back home, and looked it up on the internet.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.480
 When I saw how much it could be worth,

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.600
 I went back and grabbed it.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.280
 And then there was another story in the same newspaper,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.200
 two months later, which revealed it wasn't ambergree.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.040
 And he said, if I had my time again,

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.000
 I would kick the rock to one side and walk away.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.400
 I wish I'd never found it.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.880
 - I read the article as well, and it said,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.240
 it turned out to be just a smelly rock.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.480
 Can we talk about poo very quickly?

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.240
 - Yes, please.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.720
 - Okay, cool.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.720
 There's a museum in Tasmania called Mona.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.360
 If you don't know Mona, it's very famous, very good museum.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.960
 - It's incredible best gallery I've ever been in my life,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.800
 by the way.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.600
 - So there's an art exhibition in the Mona Museum

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.080
 that takes a poo at 2 p.m. every day.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.920
 - Sorry.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.240
 - The exhibition itself takes a poo.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.560
 - It's actually a very sick museum employee.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560
 (laughing)

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.000
 They were actually little plaques next to him.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.920
 - He's been trying to pass it off as,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.080
 though it must have been the museum that took the poo.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.560
 (laughing)

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.560
 They have an installation which has been designed by someone

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.360
 which replicates the actions of a human digestive system,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.480
 so it starts, it gets fed twice a day,

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.840
 and at 2 p.m. every day it produces a poo

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.920
 and lats out the poo.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.760
 - Great.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.520
 - Yeah, they did it because they had a really successful

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.920
 exhibit just before it called the vomit room.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.360
 Sounds like an amazing museum.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.600
 They call it the adult's Disneyland.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.440
 - It is?

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.920
 - I mean, is it still a poo?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760
 (laughing)

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.680
 - Again, we've gone philosophical, but I think,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.560
 that's what I'm sort of, hmm, all right.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.920
 - That's so soft on ice cream, maybe.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.760
 - Yeah.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.920
 - In Uta Pradesh in 2007,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.240
 you could buy something called Hitler ice cream.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.880
 This was basically ice cream

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.400
 with a big picture of Hitler of it.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.440
 - It wasn't, it wasn't flavored, right?

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.960
 (laughing)

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.520
 And apparently the people that didn't really realize

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.400
 the problem with doing such a thing,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.360
 the guy who was selling it when interviews said,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.400
 "One of my uncles is a short tempered and strict man,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.600
 "so we nicknamed him Hitler and we called it after him."

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.600
 (laughing)

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.400
 It's a good excuse.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.200
 But they have form actually in India.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.600
 In 2000, in the same year, actually, in Mumbai,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.400
 there was a whole furnishing firm

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.480
 who did bedsheets called the Nazi collection,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.440
 which were full of swastikers.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.040
 But when they were asked about it,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.280
 they said that Nazi stood for new arrival zone for India.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.400
 (laughing)

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.040
 Wow.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.520
 Very quick thinking, actually.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.160
 Did you guys know that Ben and Jerry's

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.680
 has an ice cream flavor graveyard?

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.520
 (laughing)

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.360
 - No, really.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.520
 - It's so cool.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.320
 So it's for every ice cream flavor that has died over the years,

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.920
 which is actually quite a lot, such a gross ad.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.560
 And they, it's a real graveyard.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.160
 They've got tombstones in there.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.000
 - Yes.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.120
 - They've got the name of the ice cream on the tombstones.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.280
 And then they've written a little individual poem

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.440
 for each ice cream that's died a terrible death.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.760
 And it's brilliant.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.320
 - So some examples are the ice cream shwetty balls.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.400
 (laughing)

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.880
 - Why are they after they get rid of that?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.400
 - It's so impossible to know.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.240
 Seems like a winner.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.240
 - What did it taste like?

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.240
 (laughing)

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.640
 - I don't think we need to answer that.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.040
 No, apparently that was based on a Saturday Night Live sketch

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.080
 from the '90s where Alec Baldwin talks

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.640
 about shwetty balls ice cream, I don't know.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.640
 But yeah, that did not last very long.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.480
 There's a vermonty python ice cream, which also died.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.480
 - There is right then.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.800
 Is it dead or isn't it?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.720
 No, it isn't.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.560
 Yes, it is.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.400
 No, it isn't.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.240
 Rubbish.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.080
 You're a loonie.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.080
 No, I'm not.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.920
 Like it.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.440
 (laughing)

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.440
 - Makes sense, right?

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.800
 - Yeah, great.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.440
 - I didn't know that I feel like I might be the only person

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.360
 that didn't know this.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.600
 But I didn't realize that Hagen does wasn't a real name.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.040
 In terms of, I thought Hagen does the ice cream was called

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.480
 Hagen does because either there were two people

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.760
 one called Hagen, one called does.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.200
 - Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.240
 - So what it was was a Polish guy lived in New York

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.520
 and he wanted just a nice Danish sounding name.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.400
 And his daughter said they would sit around the table

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.520
 and he'd be like, "Splagen Mars, vegan Mars, vegan does."

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.360
 Hagen does.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.200
 And they went, "That sounds good."

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.040
 That's why they called it.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.880
 It was him around the dinner table going,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.440
 "Hagen does, that Hagen does."

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440
 And they named it there.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.760
 - Same for Rolex.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.640
 There are lots of very vexed etymologies.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.880
 We don't really know where it comes from.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.080
 There are a few theories about it,

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.240
 but they all contradict each other.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.160
 - Well, they think they just made it up

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160
 'cause it sounded nice.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.000
 - Maybe.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.840
 Yeah, that's one of the theories.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.680
 - Uncle Ben's rice is made by--

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.400
 - Don't tell me Uncle Ben doesn't exist, James.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.280
 - I'm really sorry.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.120
 - Come on.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.200
 - It was made by a German guy, German company,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.600
 and they called it Uncle Ben's to make it sound more American.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.000
 - Oh, I don't like to hear that.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.840
 - Wow.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.000
 - Wow.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.240
 - Mr. Whippy, do you know where that came from?

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.400
 You know, Mr. Whippy or South Scoop, if you're American?

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.520
 Ice cream.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.640
 - It's not a story that it came from Margaret Thatcher.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.280
 - Yeah, there's a story that Margaret Thatcher

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.880
 was on the original team which developed Mr. Whippy ice cream.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.000
 But I think it's not really true, is it?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.440
 - She was, I think she was a chemist.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.840
 - That's for the company at the time.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.840
 - She did work on ice cream, but not specifically on that.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.840
 - But the time that we came up with, the idea of softer ice cream

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.840
 as a concept, a revolutionary idea, as everyone agrees,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.120
 is this guy called Tom Carvell, who was an American,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.560
 and he just sold ice cream and his truck broke down

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.400
 in some really hot American state.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.760
 He got a flat tire, and so he had to pull over,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.200
 and his ice cream was not melting,

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.760
 and he was like, "Oh, Margaret, what do I do with this?"

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.720
 And someone came up and said, "Oh, can I bite that?"

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.400
 And he realized they had just moving ice cream stool,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.160
 and people wanted to buy melting ice cream.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.360
 And so he stayed there.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.360
 He set up shop next to a pottery shop, I think.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.920
 And that's how where Mr. Whippy came,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.920
 was melting ice cream accidentally,

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.520
 another accidental invention, much like penicillin.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.440
 - I didn't mean to revolutionize ice cream when I got up today.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.880
 (audience laughing)

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.160
 - Okay, I think we need to wrap up.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.720
 We've run out of time, everyone.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.640
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.840
