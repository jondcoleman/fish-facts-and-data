00:00:00,00:00:02,(techno music)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:13,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:13,00:00:16,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:16,00:00:19,this week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
00:00:19,00:00:20,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:20,00:00:23,Please welcome to the stage the other three elves
00:00:23,00:00:26,"as Additch Isinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:32,(audience applauding)
00:00:32,00:00:35,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:35,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:37,00:00:39,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"Starting with you, Andy Murray."
00:00:42,00:00:43,- My fact this week is that the first man
00:00:43,00:00:46,to swim the English channel later had a show
00:00:46,00:00:48,where he floated in a tank for two hours.
00:00:48,00:00:50,That was his show.
00:00:50,00:00:53,"His name was Matthew Webb and to get extra funding,"
00:00:53,00:00:55,he would do a special endurance show
00:00:55,00:00:58,where he floated in a tank for 128 hours.
00:00:58,00:01:02,"- Whoa, that's one hour better than the guy stuck in the rock."
00:01:02,00:01:02,- Yeah.
00:01:02,00:01:05,- Probably as interesting as well
00:01:05,00:01:07,in terms of a feature length movie.
00:01:07,00:01:08,- Yeah.
00:01:08,00:01:10,- I mean without a flotation device.
00:01:10,00:01:11,- Without a flotation device.
00:01:11,00:01:12,- And that's really impressive.
00:01:12,00:01:13,- It's very impressive.
00:01:13,00:01:15,"- Yeah, in a boat it's not quite as impressive."
00:01:15,00:01:17,(audience laughing)
00:01:17,00:01:18,- It's just basically a big swimming pool right
00:01:18,00:01:20,where he's just paddling around.
00:01:20,00:01:22,"- Yeah, I'm treading water I guess is what he was doing."
00:01:22,00:01:24,"- Yeah, okay, yeah."
00:01:24,00:01:26,- So he wasn't lying on his back.
00:01:26,00:01:27,That's not fluting.
00:01:27,00:01:28,I think that's just swimming.
00:01:28,00:01:28,- Like a child.
00:01:28,00:01:30,- He got very philosophical very early on.
00:01:30,00:01:32,(audience laughing)
00:01:32,00:01:34,- The first time he ever did this kind of floting
00:01:34,00:01:35,"for as long as possible,"
00:01:35,00:01:37,it was against a Newfoundland dog.
00:01:37,00:01:39,He had a bet that he'd be able to float
00:01:39,00:01:41,for longer than a dog and he won his bet.
00:01:41,00:01:42,- Did the dog die?
00:01:42,00:01:43,(audience laughing)
00:01:43,00:01:44,As they fished the dog out.
00:01:44,00:01:46,Victory for Webb.
00:01:46,00:01:48,- I mean did the dog even know it was taking part in a bet?
00:01:48,00:01:52,(audience laughing)
00:01:52,00:01:54,- Captain Webb won a year's supply of pedigree charm.
00:01:54,00:01:55,(audience laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:56,So this is Captain Webb.
00:01:56,00:01:58,This is who we're talking about British hero.
00:01:58,00:02:00,"- Yeah, and he was amazing."
00:02:00,00:02:02,This was 1875 when he did this
00:02:02,00:02:04,and when he swam the channel that is.
00:02:04,00:02:07,And after that he didn't really stay famous.
00:02:07,00:02:09,He tried to keep himself famous
00:02:09,00:02:11,"by doing these endurance events and things like that,"
00:02:11,00:02:12,but he found it quite hard.
00:02:12,00:02:14,But I read that he was so famous
00:02:14,00:02:15,that when he came back from the channel swimming
00:02:15,00:02:17,and he went back to his hometown
00:02:17,00:02:18,"with a band procession going on,"
00:02:18,00:02:22,he was so loved that even a pig got up on his trotters
00:02:22,00:02:23,to look at him as he went by.
00:02:23,00:02:25,(audience laughing)
00:02:25,00:02:27,- Well the pig know that it was taking part in a procession.
00:02:27,00:02:29,(audience laughing)
00:02:29,00:02:33,"In 1883, just eight years after he was the hero of the nation,"
00:02:33,00:02:36,he tried to swim across a particular bit of the river
00:02:36,00:02:40,down from Niagara Falls and it was extremely dangerous
00:02:40,00:02:42,"and more than 10,000 people turned up to watch him"
00:02:42,00:02:43,and he drowned there.
00:02:43,00:02:45,He was dragged under a current
00:02:45,00:02:46,and his body was found a few days later
00:02:46,00:02:48,and he was doing it to try and provide for his family.
00:02:48,00:02:50,- So I was going through the newspaper archives
00:02:50,00:02:53,"and before he did it, every single headline"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"about what he was about to do said,"
00:02:55,00:02:58,"""We're the engages in suicidal endeavor."""
00:02:58,00:03:01,"Every headline went, ""A fool's there and totally mad."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"""Everyone predicts he will die."""
00:03:03,00:03:05,There's a whirlpool about 20 yards down the river
00:03:05,00:03:07,into which he'd will definitely be sucked and perished
00:03:07,00:03:09,and he went on and did it anyway.
00:03:09,00:03:11,I just wonder if he read any of that.
00:03:11,00:03:12,(audience laughing)
00:03:12,00:03:13,- He didn't like to read his own press.
00:03:13,00:03:15,He was a very modest man.
00:03:15,00:03:17,But actually everyone thought that he would die
00:03:17,00:03:18,when he swam the channel as well.
00:03:18,00:03:21,It was 34 kilometers but it actually took him
00:03:21,00:03:24,64 kilometers to swim it because of all the currents.
00:03:24,00:03:26,He just went in a real zigzag all the way.
00:03:26,00:03:27,- He refused to ask the directions.
00:03:27,00:03:30,(audience laughing)
00:03:30,00:03:33,- And he smothered himself in poor pice fat
00:03:33,00:03:35,"to keep warm, which is quite good."
00:03:35,00:03:37,"And towards the end, he got really tired"
00:03:37,00:03:39,but then a boat went past
00:03:39,00:03:40,and everyone on the boat started singing
00:03:40,00:03:43,"""Rule Britannia"" to keep him going."
00:03:43,00:03:45,- And I don't know if this would have been an encouragement
00:03:45,00:03:48,"or put him off, but apparently his coach Arthur Payne"
00:03:48,00:03:50,used to jump in occasionally and swim alongside him.
00:03:50,00:03:53,- Which I would find really irritating.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Hey man, this is easy."
00:03:55,00:03:56,(audience laughing)
00:03:56,00:04:00,- I read also at one stage that he had a run in with a poor pice.
00:04:00,00:04:00,(audience laughing)
00:04:00,00:04:02,- It's a boy you covered in poor pice fat.
00:04:02,00:04:03,What have you done with my friends?
00:04:03,00:04:05,(audience laughing)
00:04:05,00:04:06,- I think that might have been it.
00:04:06,00:04:07,They might have confused him.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"Smells like a poor pice, looks like a poor pice."
00:04:09,00:04:11,(audience laughing)
00:04:11,00:04:13,But there was actually someone who went across
00:04:13,00:04:14,the channel before him.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"He was called Paul the Fearless Frogman, Boynton."
00:04:17,00:04:18,(audience laughing)
00:04:18,00:04:20,And he did manage to get in a cross
00:04:20,00:04:24,but he was wearing a rubber suit with a puddle and a sail.
00:04:24,00:04:27,(audience laughing)
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- He towed a boat behind him, I think,"
00:04:28,00:04:30,which had his supplies in it.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- He towed a boat.
00:04:31,00:04:32,- He towed a boat a lot.
00:04:32,00:04:33,- This is much more impressive than Matthew were.
00:04:33,00:04:34,(audience laughing)
00:04:34,00:04:35,- I mean he had a sail.
00:04:35,00:04:37,I think he had some kind of a small like makeshift
00:04:37,00:04:39,clockwork motor thing.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"I'm not sure where we draw the line swimming,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,but I think that is not swimming.
00:04:43,00:04:44,- It sounds amazing.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"It could support you, so help you float in the water."
00:04:46,00:04:49,And also you could store nine days worth of food
00:04:49,00:04:49,in the pockets.
00:04:49,00:04:52,(audience laughing)
00:04:52,00:04:55,- Basically it was a publicity stunt to sell this suit
00:04:55,00:04:56,'cause he called it a life-saving suit.
00:04:56,00:04:59,"- He was actually the guy, he set up the first ever theme park"
00:04:59,00:05:02,in America and then he set up what became Coney Island.
00:05:02,00:05:03,- Oh.
00:05:03,00:05:05,- And then he befriended sea lions
00:05:05,00:05:07,and used to appear in silent films with them all the time.
00:05:07,00:05:08,- That hang on.
00:05:08,00:05:09,(audience laughing)
00:05:09,00:05:10,"- He just, they were, who he felt closest to."
00:05:10,00:05:12,- He befriended sea lions.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"- Yeah, he performed in films with sea lions."
00:05:13,00:05:16,- The sea lions know they were being befriended.
00:05:16,00:05:18,(audience laughing)
00:05:18,00:05:22,"- Even cooler than there was someone who swam across before,"
00:05:22,00:05:25,"even what was it, Paul, the amazing frogman,"
00:05:25,00:05:26,"boy, it's a fearless frogman."
00:05:26,00:05:32,"It was a guy called William Hoskins, and this was in 1862,"
00:05:32,00:05:35,and he kick paddled his way across on a bail of straw.
00:05:35,00:05:37,(audience laughing)
00:05:37,00:05:40,"I was the first man to go across the channel, not in a boat."
00:05:40,00:05:43,- Do you guys know who the best living swimmer
00:05:43,00:05:44,alive today is?
00:05:44,00:05:47,- Michael Phelps.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"- Oh no, so this is for a long distance."
00:05:48,00:05:52,"I'm talking, it's a guy called Martin Strell."
00:05:52,00:05:53,- Okay.
00:05:53,00:05:54,"- He had a lot of TV shows, so actually might be a name"
00:05:54,00:05:56,familiar to those listening and those here tonight.
00:05:56,00:06:00,"He's an amazing guy, he's a Slovenian, long distance swimmer."
00:06:00,00:06:01,"He swam the entire Amazon river,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,first person ever to do that.
00:06:03,00:06:08,"The Danube, the Yang Sea, he did the Danube in one go."
00:06:08,00:06:11,"He swam for 84 hours straight, he lost 40 pounds."
00:06:11,00:06:14,"By the time he got out, he was 40 pounds lighter,"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"and along the way, and along every single swim that he does,"
00:06:17,00:06:18,he drinks two bottles of wine.
00:06:18,00:06:21,"He has just a favorite white wine, I think it is,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,that he drinks.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"- But there's sort of like,"
00:06:23,00:06:24,thresher shocks along the way.
00:06:24,00:06:27,(audience laughing)
00:06:27,00:06:30,The Amazon is much better provided for than I realized.
00:06:30,00:06:32,"- That's where thresher sharks get the name, actually."
00:06:32,00:06:34,"- Oh really, there's something."
00:06:34,00:06:36,(audience laughing)
00:06:36,00:06:39,- But this is how hardcore he is with his swimming.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"He hasn't swam the Nile yet, and he's been asked,"
00:06:41,00:06:43,"""Why have you not swam the Nile?"""
00:06:43,00:06:45,And he said that it's neither long or challenging enough.
00:06:45,00:06:47,"- Oh, it is like the second longest river in the world."
00:06:47,00:06:50,"- Yeah, I know, he said, it's just like a small creek."
00:06:50,00:06:51,- This guy is a liar.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"I say that when people say, ""Why have you never fought a lion?"""
00:06:53,00:06:56,"They are neither large nor fierce enough for me,"
00:06:56,00:07:00,so it's not worth me wasting my time.
00:07:00,00:07:01,(audience laughing)
00:07:01,00:07:03,- We're gonna have to move on in about two minutes.
00:07:03,00:07:05,- Can I tell you one more guy who I found out about
00:07:05,00:07:08,in terms of the annals of cross-channel swimming history.
00:07:08,00:07:09,This is one of my favorite ever people.
00:07:09,00:07:12,"His name is Bob Platon, I don't know much about him,"
00:07:12,00:07:16,"but he crossed the channel on an iron bed stud in 1961,"
00:07:16,00:07:19,which he had attached floating barrels to.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"Then in 1963, he surpassed himself,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,he went over on a barrel with an outboard motor.
00:07:23,00:07:28,"Eventually commercialism crept in in 1969,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,he went across again in a shoe sponsored by British Lather.
00:07:31,00:07:33,(audience laughing)
00:07:33,00:07:37,"And then in 1965, he crossed in a gin bottle"
00:07:37,00:07:39,sponsored by Gilby's gin.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"- Hang on, where do we get these oversized gin bottles?"
00:07:41,00:07:44,(audience laughing)
00:07:44,00:07:45,"- Bob Platon, what a guy."
00:07:45,00:07:48,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:07:48,00:07:53,My fact this week is that the first item sold on eBay
00:07:53,00:07:55,was a broken laser pointer.
00:07:55,00:07:55,- Yeah.
00:07:55,00:07:58,- And it was bought by a man who collects
00:07:58,00:07:59,broken laser pointers.
00:07:59,00:08:01,(audience laughing)
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- Genuinely was, do you think he ever buys"
00:08:03,00:08:06,working laser pointers and then breaks them
00:08:06,00:08:07,so that they can go in his collection?
00:08:07,00:08:08,(audience laughing)
00:08:08,00:08:09,"- Yeah, I guess so."
00:08:09,00:08:10,- That's a good question because you would have thought
00:08:10,00:08:12,that the working laser pointer is actually easier
00:08:12,00:08:14,to come across than a broken laser pointer.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"- Yeah, the guy who sold it, did he know"
00:08:17,00:08:19,that someone might want a broken laser pointer?
00:08:19,00:08:21,"What was he like, just scamming people?"
00:08:21,00:08:23,- It was the creator of eBay.
00:08:23,00:08:25,"So prior to eBay being called eBay,"
00:08:25,00:08:26,it was called Auction Web.
00:08:26,00:08:28,And Auction Web was his little sideline.
00:08:28,00:08:30,There's a bit of a mythology that he set it up.
00:08:30,00:08:34,He set eBay up because his wife had a huge collection
00:08:34,00:08:36,of pes dispenser as she wanted to get rid of.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"And he thought, let's do it that way."
00:08:37,00:08:39,"And that was actually marketed, I think,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,through eBay themselves saying that was the case.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Turns out it's not true.
00:08:42,00:08:44,But so it was the guy who set up eBay.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"- So this guy who started eBay, it was called Auction Web"
00:08:47,00:08:49,but it was on eBay.com I think.
00:08:49,00:08:51,And he had some other sites on eBay.com as well.
00:08:51,00:08:54,And one of them was an Ebola information site.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"That was the first thing on eBay.com,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,a place to find out where Ebola's happening around the world.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"- Yeah, he was weirdly obsessed with Ebola, right?"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"In the 90s, before it was kind of fashionable."
00:09:03,00:09:04,(audience laughing)
00:09:04,00:09:07,"And he employed a marketing guy who was like,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,"""You really have to take this Ebola shit down."
00:09:09,00:09:10,"No one wants it."""
00:09:10,00:09:11,- People just want to buy stuff.
00:09:11,00:09:15,- Another thing sold on eBay or what they tried to sell this
00:09:15,00:09:18,"and actually got taken off, Iceland, the country."
00:09:18,00:09:21,And this was this part of the description.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"Bjork, not included."
00:09:23,00:09:26,(audience laughing)
00:09:26,00:09:28,"- There was, did you read about the musician who sold,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,what he claimed was the world's longest hula hoop?
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- Oh, yeah. - So it was three inches."
00:09:32,00:09:33,"And this was last year, I think."
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Whoa.
00:09:34,00:09:36,(audience laughing)
00:09:36,00:09:37,"- Whoa, no."
00:09:37,00:09:38,- He's pissed out.
00:09:38,00:09:39,- How much did he go full?
00:09:39,00:09:42,"- Well, someone bid 712 pounds for it."
00:09:42,00:09:44,"- If I had known about this at the time,"
00:09:44,00:09:45,I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.
00:09:45,00:09:47,- I would cheerfully affect three inches of hula hoop.
00:09:47,00:09:49,- But you know what's really sad about this guy
00:09:49,00:09:51,or kind of nice.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"He said he was going to use any funds he raised off,"
00:09:53,00:09:55,selling stuff on eBay to fund his commune
00:09:55,00:09:56,that he wanted to set up.
00:09:56,00:09:58,And one of the things he first tried to sell
00:09:58,00:10:00,was his love on eBay.
00:10:00,00:10:02,(audience laughing)
00:10:02,00:10:03,He put that up there.
00:10:03,00:10:05,He said he was willing to sit quietly somewhere
00:10:05,00:10:08,and send you good vibes and love for five pounds.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Five pounds was the maximum he got for that.
00:10:09,00:10:12,And then he got 712 for an oversized hula hoop.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"- Yeah. - Looking at Andy,"
00:10:13,00:10:14,I think you'd rather have the hula hoop.
00:10:14,00:10:16,- I would definitely rather have the hula hoop.
00:10:16,00:10:18,- Can you imagine opening the packet and finding that?
00:10:18,00:10:19,(audience laughing)
00:10:19,00:10:20,- It would be so exciting.
00:10:20,00:10:23,"I mean, the packets are barely four inches long."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"It's a bit, you know."
00:10:24,00:10:26,- Sorry. - Let's put love and the love.
00:10:26,00:10:27,(audience laughing)
00:10:27,00:10:29,- I want a massive hula hoop.
00:10:29,00:10:30,(audience laughing)
00:10:30,00:10:31,"- There was actually, I know this seems implausible,"
00:10:31,00:10:32,but this was last year.
00:10:32,00:10:35,"And then there was a 26 year old woman in March,"
00:10:35,00:10:36,"this year, who found a bigger hula hoop,"
00:10:36,00:10:39,which she then put on eBay.
00:10:39,00:10:39,- Did you get more for it?
00:10:39,00:10:41,- That was five inches long.
00:10:41,00:10:42,"I don't think she actually got off with much,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,'cause the craze was stood over by that point.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- I feel there isn't enough astonishment
00:10:46,00:10:47,in the room about this.
00:10:47,00:10:49,(audience laughing)
00:10:49,00:10:51,The normal hula hoop is about a 10th as long as that.
00:10:51,00:10:54,(audience laughing)
00:10:54,00:10:58,"So in 2004, there was a sale on eBay of some water"
00:10:58,00:11:00,that Elvis had left in a cup.
00:11:01,00:11:05,"It went for 237 quid, all the equivalent in dollars."
00:11:05,00:11:07,And it was from a plastic cup that he'd sit from
00:11:07,00:11:09,in North Carolina in 1977.
00:11:09,00:11:11,- But isn't it true that the person who sold it kept the cup?
00:11:11,00:11:13,"- He kept the cup, yes."
00:11:13,00:11:14,(audience laughing)
00:11:14,00:11:17,"- So he sent out the water, but the cup was, yeah."
00:11:17,00:11:19,"- And he said at the time, I promised this thing"
00:11:19,00:11:21,is 100% legitimate.
00:11:21,00:11:22,(audience laughing)
00:11:22,00:11:24,- But did it have a certificate that went with him
00:11:24,00:11:26,"just writing, seriously, I promise."
00:11:26,00:11:28,(audience laughing)
00:11:28,00:11:29,Can I mention a few things about lasers?
00:11:29,00:11:31,"- Yeah, yeah. - Because so he broke this,"
00:11:31,00:11:34,the fact was a broken laser pointer.
00:11:34,00:11:38,I read that the sort of founding father
00:11:38,00:11:41,of laser technology died just this year.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"Charles Towns, he originally came up not with the laser,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,he sort of had the one just before it was called the laser.
00:11:47,00:11:48,(audience laughing)
00:11:48,00:11:52,"But I mean, how amazing that he was able to see how far it's come"
00:11:52,00:11:55,and he made it into a Bond movie with his invention.
00:11:55,00:11:57,"Bond's crotch was almost burnt off, wasn't it?"
00:11:57,00:11:58,- By his invention.
00:11:58,00:12:01,- And the novel apparently it was a circular saw
00:12:01,00:12:03,that he was attacked by rather than a laser.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Really? - Apparently.
00:12:04,00:12:06,- But they put the laser in the movie
00:12:06,00:12:08,to make it a bit more exciting.
00:12:08,00:12:10,The way that they worked it is they had a special effects man
00:12:10,00:12:13,"underneath the table and he was burning,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,cutting through the table from beneath
00:12:15,00:12:18,with a kind of a torch.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"And apparently because he was doing that,"
00:12:20,00:12:23,it meant that Sean Connery was sweating and worried
00:12:23,00:12:24,in the same way that he would have been
00:12:24,00:12:25,if a laser was coming from above
00:12:25,00:12:28,"because not only was this kind of being cut from below,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,the guy below couldn't see where he was cutting through.
00:12:30,00:12:32,(audience laughing)
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- And also when the director wants the shot to end,"
00:12:34,00:12:35,"he'll shout, ""Cut."""
00:12:35,00:12:38,(audience laughing)
00:12:38,00:12:44,"- This guy, Charles Townes, when he invented the laser,"
00:12:44,00:12:47,"everyone, or as he was proposing it,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,he needed funding and he asked for funding
00:12:48,00:12:51,and everyone in the scientific community
00:12:51,00:12:53,"thought that he was insane, that it wouldn't work."
00:12:53,00:12:56,It was going against certain laws that were in place
00:12:56,00:12:58,about physics and the world.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"And they said that this is why Dr. Schreiber,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,please kind of understand what you're saying.
00:13:02,00:13:04,(audience laughing)
00:13:04,00:13:06,We have a lay audience here.
00:13:06,00:13:07,(audience laughing)
00:13:07,00:13:10,"- Yeah, so science said that it couldn't work"
00:13:10,00:13:13,and so he still went along with it
00:13:13,00:13:15,"and Neil's bore whose very famous physicist said,"
00:13:15,00:13:16,"""This is not gonna work."""
00:13:16,00:13:19,"To the point where eventually a few scientists said,"
00:13:19,00:13:20,we need to write to him.
00:13:20,00:13:22,We actually know the letter that was sent to him
00:13:22,00:13:24,which was by Isadora Isaac Rabi.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"And this is genuine, look, you should stop the work"
00:13:27,00:13:28,you were doing.
00:13:28,00:13:30,It isn't gonna work.
00:13:30,00:13:31,You know it's not gonna work.
00:13:31,00:13:33,We know it's not gonna work.
00:13:33,00:13:36,"You're wasting money, just stop."
00:13:36,00:13:38,(audience laughing)
00:13:38,00:13:40,And then three months later was the first successful experiment
00:13:40,00:13:41,of the laser. - Wow.
00:13:41,00:13:43,- Yeah. - Oh.
00:13:43,00:13:44,- Amazing. - That's so cool.
00:13:44,00:13:47,- Someone's used a laser cutter to imprint a song
00:13:47,00:13:48,onto a tortilla.
00:13:48,00:13:51,(audience laughing)
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- It should be, for it to work,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,it should be an uncooked tortilla if you wanted to try it.
00:13:55,00:13:58,And they printed a Mexican dance onto it.
00:13:58,00:13:59,"It didn't sound very good, actually,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,but you can watch on YouTube.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"- Charles Towns would, I think, be glad to know."
00:14:03,00:14:05,(audience laughing)
00:14:05,00:14:07,"Okay, we're gonna have to move on to our next fact"
00:14:07,00:14:10,and that is Chazinski.
00:14:10,00:14:15,"- Yes, my fact is that when Alexander Fleming's neighbors"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"followed a burglary at his house,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"as a thank you gift, he gave them some mold."
00:14:20,00:14:23,(audience laughing)
00:14:23,00:14:24,- This is kind of a predictable possibly
00:14:24,00:14:26,for everyone who knows who Alexander Fleming is.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"He gave them the mold, not just some mold."
00:14:28,00:14:31,So he gave them the first penicillin culture.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"So it was really short before he died, actually."
00:14:33,00:14:37,And his neighbors saw burglars trying to burgl his house
00:14:37,00:14:39,and they stopped them and they called the police
00:14:39,00:14:41,and then they received a letter shortly afterwards
00:14:41,00:14:44,"from Alexander Fleming and Mrs. Montgomery,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"his housekeeper, saying, look, enclosed as some mold."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"And then Mrs. Montgomery clarified,"
00:14:49,00:14:52,"she wrote something on lines of, as though you didn't know,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,but just in case this set of fare is a blob
00:14:54,00:14:56,"of the original mold of penicillin,"
00:14:56,00:14:58,not to be confused with Gorgonzola cheese.
00:14:58,00:14:59,(audience laughing)
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- Yeah, I was gonna say, how did they know"
00:15:00,00:15:02,it was the original mold?
00:15:02,00:15:04,"It's a bit like Elvis' water, isn't it?"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"It's just a letter saying, no, it really is the original mold."
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- And they kept the petri dish that it had grown in,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"actually, it just gave them the mold."
00:15:10,00:15:13,(audience laughing)
00:15:13,00:15:15,- Birmingham had a very high star rating on eBay.
00:15:15,00:15:18,So I think he was a trustworthy seller by that point.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"So this just went up for auction, didn't it?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,"- It sure did, yeah."
00:15:21,00:15:22,"- Yeah, do you know how much it sold for?"
00:15:22,00:15:23,- Go on.
00:15:23,00:15:25,- Was it 712 pounds in a hotly contested race
00:15:25,00:15:27,with a three-inch long hula hoop?
00:15:27,00:15:28,(audience laughing)
00:15:28,00:15:30,- And you don't know how eBay works.
00:15:30,00:15:31,(audience laughing)
00:15:31,00:15:33,"Where's one more like ed, the hula hoop on the mold?"
00:15:33,00:15:34,(audience laughing)
00:15:34,00:15:36,- And he just bids for every single eBay
00:15:36,00:15:38,in the hope that one day a hula hoop comes.
00:15:38,00:15:41,(audience laughing)
00:15:41,00:15:45,"- Oh, it's sold for 4,720 pounds."
00:15:45,00:15:47,- Do you think that's not much?
00:15:47,00:15:47,- I'm pissed off.
00:15:47,00:15:49,- That's such an achievable amount to buy.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"- I'm so glad you said this, it's exactly,"
00:15:51,00:15:52,"I wanted to call you up and say,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,why didn't we get together and buy this?
00:15:54,00:15:54,- Yeah.
00:15:54,00:15:56,- I think you two aren't too much.
00:15:56,00:15:57,(audience laughing)
00:15:57,00:15:59,- I allow myself to work with that boss.
00:15:59,00:16:00,(audience laughing)
00:16:00,00:16:02,"- But he discovered it really,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"far before it was used in medicine, didn't he?"
00:16:04,00:16:07,He discovered it in about 1928 and then he wrote a paper
00:16:07,00:16:09,"on it saying this has antibiotic properties,"
00:16:09,00:16:10,this could be very useful.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- He couldn't quite get it working, that was it."
00:16:11,00:16:12,"- Yeah, and nobody paid any attention"
00:16:12,00:16:14,for another 10 years.
00:16:14,00:16:16,- There was this huge argument over who had really
00:16:16,00:16:18,invented it or made it useful for mankind.
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- Oh, did they argue over it?"
00:16:19,00:16:20,"'Cause they shared the Nobel Prize,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,Flurry and Shane and Fleming.
00:16:22,00:16:25,- There was a guy called Elmroth Wright who worked with Fleming
00:16:25,00:16:27,"who wrote a letter to the Times saying,"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"actually it was me who came up with that, not him."
00:16:30,00:16:33,And then the press all went down to speak to both of them.
00:16:33,00:16:35,Fleming worked for this big company actually
00:16:35,00:16:36,"and he was, you know, he did find it,"
00:16:36,00:16:37,but he worked for this big company
00:16:37,00:16:40,and he was just like a small cog in it really.
00:16:40,00:16:41,But the press went down to speak to them
00:16:41,00:16:43,but the reason that we all kind of know Fleming today
00:16:43,00:16:45,is 'cause he had such a good story.
00:16:45,00:16:46,He came from a humble background.
00:16:46,00:16:49,He supposedly came up with it serendipitously
00:16:49,00:16:51,like there was a little petri dish on his desk
00:16:51,00:16:54,and it just accidentally grew and it was just a better story.
00:16:54,00:16:56,And the other story was like basically
00:16:56,00:16:59,a group of international researchers working in state.
00:16:59,00:17:00,"- Oh, it did."
00:17:00,00:17:03,- Snore.
00:17:03,00:17:05,- It was the accidental discovery.
00:17:05,00:17:07,He went away for a trip and then he came back
00:17:07,00:17:10,and he found that he had a load of bacterial cultures
00:17:10,00:17:12,"and one of them, the bacteria weren't growing."
00:17:12,00:17:14,And it was because the mold had supposedly drifted
00:17:14,00:17:15,through the window.
00:17:15,00:17:18,- I read a really interesting set of articles
00:17:18,00:17:22,about the idea that they think that he got to his
00:17:22,00:17:25,to noticing what was going on because he was an artist.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"He painted, he painted a lot,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,but he didn't use actual colors
00:17:29,00:17:31,that you would buy in shops and so on.
00:17:31,00:17:33,He grew his colors in petri dishes.
00:17:33,00:17:35,- He would like have this petri dish
00:17:35,00:17:36,with different microbes in there
00:17:36,00:17:38,and some of them would grow green
00:17:38,00:17:39,"and that would be grass, some would grow blue."
00:17:39,00:17:41,That would be the sky.
00:17:41,00:17:43,And it would just make these beautiful little images.
00:17:43,00:17:44,And the great thing was
00:17:44,00:17:46,is they would only last for a few like days
00:17:46,00:17:48,and then they would all grow into each other.
00:17:48,00:17:49,So it was really a trend.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- That's amazing.
00:17:50,00:17:50,Isn't that crazy?
00:17:50,00:17:52,"So he used to paint things like ballerinas, horses,"
00:17:52,00:17:56,"mother's feeding children, stick figures, fighting."
00:17:56,00:17:58,"I mean, that's pretty cool."
00:17:58,00:17:59,"- Conveniently, they didn't last long"
00:17:59,00:18:01,'cause out a few days it just appeared.
00:18:01,00:18:03,So we have no evidence they were any good at all.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"- Well, he used to show them to people"
00:18:05,00:18:05,and people wrote about them
00:18:05,00:18:08,"and one day he showed them to Queen Mary who said,"
00:18:08,00:18:10,"""I don't see the points of these."""
00:18:10,00:18:12,(laughing)
00:18:12,00:18:13,Apparently he was Alexander Fleming
00:18:13,00:18:16,who was very bad at conversation
00:18:16,00:18:18,and on his entry on the Oxford Dictionary
00:18:18,00:18:22,"of National Bography, this was how someone put it."
00:18:22,00:18:24,"As one visitor put it, talking with him"
00:18:24,00:18:25,"was like playing tennis with a man who,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"whenever you knock the ball over to his side,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,put it in his pocket.
00:18:29,00:18:31,(laughing)
00:18:31,00:18:35,- That is such a good description
00:18:35,00:18:37,of so many conversations we all have.
00:18:37,00:18:39,(laughing)
00:18:39,00:18:39,- With James.
00:18:39,00:18:42,(laughing)
00:18:43,00:18:44,- I call it fall taller.
00:18:44,00:18:46,(laughing)
00:18:46,00:18:48,- He did say I really liked this quote from him
00:18:48,00:18:50,when he was interviewed about discovering penicillin.
00:18:50,00:18:53,"He said, ""When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th,"
00:18:53,00:18:57,"""1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine"
00:18:57,00:18:59,"""by discovering the world's first antibiotic,"
00:18:59,00:19:03,"""but I suppose that was exactly what I did."""
00:19:03,00:19:03,- Wow.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"- I reckon whatever you had a conversation with him,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,that was always his reply to no matter what you said.
00:19:07,00:19:10,(laughing)
00:19:10,00:19:11,- Here's something cool about penicillin.
00:19:11,00:19:16,"So after the, so in about the late 30s, 38, 39,"
00:19:16,00:19:18,"it was really, really costly and very, very labor intensive"
00:19:18,00:19:19,to make more of it.
00:19:19,00:19:23,And you needed 2000 liters of mold culture fluid
00:19:23,00:19:27,to get enough pure penicillin to treat a single patient.
00:19:27,00:19:30,So obviously that was incredibly time consuming
00:19:30,00:19:31,and difficult and laborious.
00:19:31,00:19:34,"So to make up the shortfall, the researchers extracted it"
00:19:34,00:19:37,from the urine of patients who had already taken it.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"So when you take penicillin, 40 to 99% of it"
00:19:41,00:19:43,"is excreted about four hours later,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,'cause your kidney's very good at getting rid of it.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"So you could take the urine, crystallize it,"
00:19:48,00:19:49,"extract the penicillin, give it to the patient"
00:19:49,00:19:51,in the next bed.
00:19:51,00:19:52,"- Oh, wow, that is strange."
00:19:52,00:19:54,- So you literally take in the piss?
00:19:54,00:19:55,- Yes.
00:19:55,00:19:57,(laughing)
00:19:57,00:20:01,"- This confused me about, so the original fact"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"about the penicillin being sold on eBay,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,in the scientific American article
00:20:05,00:20:07,"where I initially read this, the title was,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"Fleming's original penicillin culture sold at auction,"
00:20:10,00:20:12,and then there was a little note at the bottom of corrections
00:20:12,00:20:15,"saying in tiny writing, this article was originally published"
00:20:15,00:20:18,with the title Old Mold Sold.
00:20:18,00:20:20,(laughing)
00:20:20,00:20:22,Why did you change that?
00:20:22,00:20:23,(laughing)
00:20:23,00:20:26,- So penicillin Camembertie is the mold
00:20:26,00:20:30,which is used to make Camembert and it's naturally green.
00:20:30,00:20:32,And so Camembert always used to be green.
00:20:32,00:20:35,And then suddenly it started to get a bit whiter
00:20:35,00:20:37,and then humans selected it to get whiter
00:20:37,00:20:39,and whiter and whiter and now it's white.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"But only a few hundred years ago,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,Camembert was all green.
00:20:42,00:20:43,- Wow.
00:20:43,00:20:45,- Is it good for you if you take Camembert here?
00:20:45,00:20:47,"- It's, three times a day."
00:20:47,00:20:48,(laughing)
00:20:48,00:20:49,- I would say it's worth a try.
00:20:49,00:20:50,- Yeah.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"- In Asia and Egypt,"
00:20:51,00:20:54,they used to whack moldy bread onto their wounds.
00:20:54,00:20:55,I think they did.
00:20:55,00:20:57,And they thought that that was one of the first uses
00:20:57,00:20:59,"of the effects of penicillin, essentially."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- And the way that they used to make Camembert
00:21:00,00:21:03,is they used to get bread and put it in a cave.
00:21:03,00:21:05,And then the bread would get moldy and moldy
00:21:05,00:21:06,and then they'd get the bread out
00:21:06,00:21:08,and then kind of turn it into a dust
00:21:08,00:21:10,and then they put the dust into the cheese
00:21:10,00:21:11,and that's how they got Camembert.
00:21:11,00:21:13,- We're gonna have to move on.
00:21:13,00:21:15,I got one last thing.
00:21:15,00:21:18,"Penicillin, the name itself, penicillin,"
00:21:18,00:21:21,he didn't come up with for quite a few months.
00:21:21,00:21:23,So he had a working title.
00:21:23,00:21:24,I think they should have kept it.
00:21:24,00:21:25,Mold juice.
00:21:25,00:21:28,(laughing)
00:21:28,00:21:34,"- Okay, time for our final fact of the evening"
00:21:34,00:21:36,and that is James Harkin.
00:21:36,00:21:38,"- Okay, my fact this week is"
00:21:38,00:21:40,that the earliest known ice cream recipe
00:21:40,00:21:42,suggests flavoring with poo.
00:21:42,00:21:45,(laughing)
00:21:45,00:21:48,"- If this is what Harkin as Belgian chocolate is,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,I'm gonna be pretty upset.
00:21:49,00:21:51,(laughing)
00:21:51,00:21:52,"- No, they offered lots of different things."
00:21:52,00:21:54,"Orange, flour, water was one of the things."
00:21:54,00:21:57,"And the other one was ambergree, which is whale poo."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"- Oh, that's not human poo."
00:21:58,00:22:00,I've won't sell disappointed.
00:22:00,00:22:01,(laughing)
00:22:01,00:22:04,"- So yeah, ambergree is sperm whale poo."
00:22:04,00:22:06,It's when a sperm whale eats a squid
00:22:06,00:22:08,and the beak is indigestible.
00:22:08,00:22:11,And so its body creates mucus and vomity covering
00:22:11,00:22:12,of the squid's beak.
00:22:12,00:22:15,And then it expels it almost always through the anus.
00:22:15,00:22:18,And people in the olden days really like the taste of it.
00:22:18,00:22:22,And they describe it as earthy and mildly fecal.
00:22:22,00:22:22,- Wow.
00:22:22,00:22:24,- And apparently this was the kind of thing
00:22:24,00:22:27,you flavored ice cream with at the back of the day.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- It floats around, doesn't it?"
00:22:28,00:22:31,On the sea for months or sometimes years.
00:22:31,00:22:34,'Cause only about 1% of sperm whales produce ambergree
00:22:34,00:22:36,and they're not that many sperm whales.
00:22:36,00:22:39,"And so as it floats, it hardens and it changes"
00:22:39,00:22:42,and it takes on a much more perfumey aroma
00:22:42,00:22:44,than you would think it would have.
00:22:44,00:22:48,- And it's worth a fortune if you find it on the shore
00:22:48,00:22:49,because it's what they use for--
00:22:49,00:22:51,- Although it's some countries you're not allowed to sell it
00:22:51,00:22:53,"and a lot of places use fake ambergree now,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"but yeah, if you can find the buyer,"
00:22:55,00:22:56,you can sell it for a lot of money.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"- Because it's used in perfume, right?"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"So-- - Yeah, it used to be at least."
00:22:59,00:23:01,"- Well, a lot of perfume companies,"
00:23:01,00:23:02,so there's actually a really good book on this
00:23:02,00:23:04,called Floating Gold.
00:23:04,00:23:08,"But perfume companies tend to deny that they use it,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,but this guy found a lot of people who sell ambergree
00:23:11,00:23:14,"to a lot of companies like Chanel, et cetera."
00:23:14,00:23:15,"So yeah, they still use--"
00:23:15,00:23:17,And apparently it does smell delicious and incredible.
00:23:17,00:23:19,- The worst thing about it is to make it
00:23:19,00:23:20,"to put the stuff into the food,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,you would make a tincture of ambergree.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"And to make that, you had to warm it very slowly."
00:23:25,00:23:26,And the way that they would do that is either put it
00:23:26,00:23:29,"in the sun, but if it wasn't sunny,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,you would put it in hot dung--
00:23:31,00:23:33,"- Ah, wow."
00:23:33,00:23:34,"- So if it wasn't fecal enough,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,you had to make it a little bit more fecal
00:23:36,00:23:38,before putting it in your ice cream.
00:23:38,00:23:42,"- I have a story about finding it thing, finding it on the beach."
00:23:42,00:23:46,"So in 2013, there was a dog water on a beach in Lancashire,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,"and he found a three kilo lump, and that is huge."
00:23:48,00:23:51,"I mean, you get the smallest 15 grams of the lumps of ambergree."
00:23:51,00:23:55,"And the report said it could be worth up to 100,000 pounds,"
00:23:55,00:23:58,"and one French expert offered him 50,000 euros"
00:23:58,00:24:00,if it checked out.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"And he said, it smelled horrible."
00:24:02,00:24:04,"I left it, came back home, and looked it up on the internet."
00:24:04,00:24:06,"When I saw how much it could be worth,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,I went back and grabbed it.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"And then there was another story in the same newspaper,"
00:24:10,00:24:14,"two months later, which revealed it wasn't ambergree."
00:24:14,00:24:16,"And he said, if I had my time again,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,I would kick the rock to one side and walk away.
00:24:19,00:24:21,I wish I'd never found it.
00:24:21,00:24:22,"- I read the article as well, and it said,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,it turned out to be just a smelly rock.
00:24:29,00:24:31,Can we talk about poo very quickly?
00:24:31,00:24:32,"- Yes, please."
00:24:32,00:24:33,"- Okay, cool."
00:24:33,00:24:35,There's a museum in Tasmania called Mona.
00:24:35,00:24:38,"If you don't know Mona, it's very famous, very good museum."
00:24:38,00:24:40,"- It's incredible best gallery I've ever been in my life,"
00:24:40,00:24:41,by the way.
00:24:41,00:24:44,- So there's an art exhibition in the Mona Museum
00:24:44,00:24:48,that takes a poo at 2 p.m. every day.
00:24:48,00:24:48,- Sorry.
00:24:48,00:24:50,- The exhibition itself takes a poo.
00:24:50,00:24:52,- It's actually a very sick museum employee.
00:24:52,00:24:53,(laughing)
00:24:53,00:24:56,They were actually little plaques next to him.
00:24:56,00:24:57,"- He's been trying to pass it off as,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,though it must have been the museum that took the poo.
00:25:00,00:25:01,(laughing)
00:25:01,00:25:04,They have an installation which has been designed by someone
00:25:04,00:25:07,"which replicates the actions of a human digestive system,"
00:25:07,00:25:09,"so it starts, it gets fed twice a day,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,and at 2 p.m. every day it produces a poo
00:25:11,00:25:12,and lats out the poo.
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Great.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"- Yeah, they did it because they had a really successful"
00:25:15,00:25:17,exhibit just before it called the vomit room.
00:25:17,00:25:20,Sounds like an amazing museum.
00:25:20,00:25:22,They call it the adult's Disneyland.
00:25:22,00:25:23,- It is?
00:25:23,00:25:26,"- I mean, is it still a poo?"
00:25:27,00:25:28,(laughing)
00:25:28,00:25:31,"- Again, we've gone philosophical, but I think,"
00:25:31,00:25:34,"that's what I'm sort of, hmm, all right."
00:25:34,00:25:35,"- That's so soft on ice cream, maybe."
00:25:35,00:25:36,- Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- In Uta Pradesh in 2007,"
00:25:38,00:25:41,you could buy something called Hitler ice cream.
00:25:41,00:25:43,This was basically ice cream
00:25:43,00:25:45,with a big picture of Hitler of it.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"- It wasn't, it wasn't flavored, right?"
00:25:47,00:25:48,(laughing)
00:25:48,00:25:51,And apparently the people that didn't really realize
00:25:51,00:25:53,"the problem with doing such a thing,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,"the guy who was selling it when interviews said,"
00:25:55,00:25:58,"""One of my uncles is a short tempered and strict man,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"""so we nicknamed him Hitler and we called it after him."""
00:26:01,00:26:03,(laughing)
00:26:03,00:26:05,It's a good excuse.
00:26:05,00:26:07,But they have form actually in India.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"In 2000, in the same year, actually, in Mumbai,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,there was a whole furnishing firm
00:26:11,00:26:14,"who did bedsheets called the Nazi collection,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,which were full of swastikers.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"But when they were asked about it,"
00:26:18,00:26:22,they said that Nazi stood for new arrival zone for India.
00:26:22,00:26:23,(laughing)
00:26:23,00:26:25,Wow.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"Very quick thinking, actually."
00:26:26,00:26:29,Did you guys know that Ben and Jerry's
00:26:29,00:26:31,has an ice cream flavor graveyard?
00:26:31,00:26:32,(laughing)
00:26:32,00:26:33,"- No, really."
00:26:33,00:26:34,- It's so cool.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"So it's for every ice cream flavor that has died over the years,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,"which is actually quite a lot, such a gross ad."
00:26:39,00:26:41,"And they, it's a real graveyard."
00:26:41,00:26:43,They've got tombstones in there.
00:26:43,00:26:44,- Yes.
00:26:44,00:26:46,- They've got the name of the ice cream on the tombstones.
00:26:46,00:26:48,And then they've written a little individual poem
00:26:48,00:26:51,for each ice cream that's died a terrible death.
00:26:51,00:26:52,And it's brilliant.
00:26:52,00:26:56,- So some examples are the ice cream shwetty balls.
00:26:56,00:26:58,(laughing)
00:26:58,00:26:59,- Why are they after they get rid of that?
00:26:59,00:27:02,- It's so impossible to know.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Seems like a winner.
00:27:03,00:27:04,- What did it taste like?
00:27:04,00:27:05,(laughing)
00:27:05,00:27:07,- I don't think we need to answer that.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"No, apparently that was based on a Saturday Night Live sketch"
00:27:10,00:27:12,from the '90s where Alec Baldwin talks
00:27:12,00:27:13,"about shwetty balls ice cream, I don't know."
00:27:13,00:27:16,"But yeah, that did not last very long."
00:27:16,00:27:20,"There's a vermonty python ice cream, which also died."
00:27:20,00:27:21,- Oh yeah.
00:27:21,00:27:23,- There is right then.
00:27:23,00:27:24,Is it dead or isn't it?
00:27:24,00:27:25,"No, it isn't."
00:27:25,00:27:26,"Yes, it is."
00:27:26,00:27:27,"No, it isn't."
00:27:27,00:27:28,Rubbish.
00:27:28,00:27:29,You're a loonie.
00:27:29,00:27:30,"No, I'm not."
00:27:30,00:27:30,Like it.
00:27:30,00:27:32,(laughing)
00:27:32,00:27:33,"- Makes sense, right?"
00:27:33,00:27:34,"- Yeah, great."
00:27:34,00:27:37,- I didn't know that I feel like I might be the only person
00:27:37,00:27:38,that didn't know this.
00:27:38,00:27:42,But I didn't realize that Hagen does wasn't a real name.
00:27:42,00:27:45,"In terms of, I thought Hagen does the ice cream was called"
00:27:45,00:27:47,Hagen does because either there were two people
00:27:47,00:27:48,"one called Hagen, one called does."
00:27:48,00:27:50,"- Yeah, that sounds reasonable."
00:27:50,00:27:53,- So what it was was a Polish guy lived in New York
00:27:53,00:27:55,and he wanted just a nice Danish sounding name.
00:27:55,00:27:57,And his daughter said they would sit around the table
00:27:57,00:28:00,"and he'd be like, ""Splagen Mars, vegan Mars, vegan does."""
00:28:00,00:28:01,Hagen does.
00:28:01,00:28:02,"And they went, ""That sounds good."""
00:28:02,00:28:03,That's why they called it.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"It was him around the dinner table going,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,"""Hagen does, that Hagen does."""
00:28:06,00:28:07,And they named it there.
00:28:07,00:28:08,- Same for Rolex.
00:28:08,00:28:10,There are lots of very vexed etymologies.
00:28:10,00:28:11,We don't really know where it comes from.
00:28:11,00:28:13,"There are a few theories about it,"
00:28:13,00:28:14,but they all contradict each other.
00:28:14,00:28:15,"- Well, they think they just made it up"
00:28:15,00:28:16,'cause it sounded nice.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- Maybe.
00:28:17,00:28:17,"Yeah, that's one of the theories."
00:28:17,00:28:19,- Uncle Ben's rice is made by--
00:28:19,00:28:21,"- Don't tell me Uncle Ben doesn't exist, James."
00:28:21,00:28:22,- I'm really sorry.
00:28:22,00:28:23,- Come on.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"- It was made by a German guy, German company,"
00:28:25,00:28:27,and they called it Uncle Ben's to make it sound more American.
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- Oh, I don't like to hear that."
00:28:29,00:28:29,- Wow.
00:28:29,00:28:31,- Wow.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"- Mr. Whippy, do you know where that came from?"
00:28:33,00:28:36,"You know, Mr. Whippy or South Scoop, if you're American?"
00:28:36,00:28:37,Ice cream.
00:28:37,00:28:39,- It's not a story that it came from Margaret Thatcher.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"- Yeah, there's a story that Margaret Thatcher"
00:28:42,00:28:45,was on the original team which developed Mr. Whippy ice cream.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"But I think it's not really true, is it?"
00:28:48,00:28:49,"- She was, I think she was a chemist."
00:28:49,00:28:50,- That's for the company at the time.
00:28:50,00:28:53,"- She did work on ice cream, but not specifically on that."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"- But the time that we came up with, the idea of softer ice cream"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"as a concept, a revolutionary idea, as everyone agrees,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,"is this guy called Tom Carvell, who was an American,"
00:29:02,00:29:05,and he just sold ice cream and his truck broke down
00:29:05,00:29:07,in some really hot American state.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"He got a flat tire, and so he had to pull over,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"and his ice cream was not melting,"
00:29:11,00:29:12,"and he was like, ""Oh, Margaret, what do I do with this?"""
00:29:12,00:29:14,"And someone came up and said, ""Oh, can I bite that?"""
00:29:14,00:29:18,"And he realized they had just moving ice cream stool,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,and people wanted to buy melting ice cream.
00:29:20,00:29:21,And so he stayed there.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"He set up shop next to a pottery shop, I think."
00:29:24,00:29:26,"And that's how where Mr. Whippy came,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"was melting ice cream accidentally,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"another accidental invention, much like penicillin."
00:29:31,00:29:34,- I didn't mean to revolutionize ice cream when I got up today.
00:29:34,00:29:37,(audience laughing)
00:29:37,00:29:39,"- Okay, I think we need to wrap up."
00:29:39,00:29:41,"We've run out of time, everyone."
