1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,000
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,080
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,120
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,320
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,360
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,720
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,040
 Now, once again, we have gathered round the microphones

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,360
 and in a particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,840
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that US Marines

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,320
 are considered to be so stupid

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
 that members of the other armed forces

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,760
 called them crayon eaters.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,880
 This year, a Marine has invented an actual edible crayon.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,540
 Now, does that prove the Marines are not stupid?

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,380
 - I think so.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,520
 - Or does it prove that they are,

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,420
 and that they haven't understood the joke?

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,000
 - This guy, he's invented something.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,640
 So that makes you smart, doesn't it?

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
 - Yeah.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,300
 - Does it draw?

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,140
 It actually draws like a crayon.

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,800
 It's not just an edible stick.

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,880
 - Of course it does draw.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,560
 - He might have just taken a pepper army

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,160
 and shoved a nib in it.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,120
 Does that count as a crayon, a pepper army?

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,200
 I mean, I suppose if you smeared it on the wall,

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,560
 you could get some kind of drawing out of it.

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,440
 (laughing)

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,040
 No, so this is a guy called Frank Manto,

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,920
 and it was both him and his business partner

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
 who's called Cassandra Gordon.

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,480
 And they decided in 2017,

38
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,480
 having heard of this thing about being called crayon eaters,

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,320
 that they would decide to come up with a edible crayon.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,080
 And they've got these things called crayons ready to eat,

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,440
 and they taste like delicious vanilla flavored chocolate.

42
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,600
 And anyone can eat them.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
 Don't give them to your pets,

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
 'cause I think they have some chocolate in them,

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,480
 and pets aren't allowed to chocolate.

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
 And actually this guy called Frank Manto,

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 he was using some crayons to color in a project once

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
 when he was at a high school.

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,760
 And not when he was at high school,

50
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
 he was kind of--

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,440
 - I was gonna say,

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,320
 I mean he's got a lot of Marines reputation here.

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,120
 - And what happened was he put a crayon in his mouth,

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,560
 like to kind of, because he only had two hands

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,920
 and he needed to hold one, so he put it in his mouth.

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,040
 And that was when he realized, wait a minute,

57
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,400
 are there any edible crayons, actually?

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,920
 And so then he got in touch with this lady called Cassandra,

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,240
 who's a pastry chef, and she helped design this new product.

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,960
 - I bet that when he put the crayon in his mouth,

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,840
 immediately a Marines recruiting officer

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,960
 took Cassandra out the door and said,

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,600
 you, you're the kind of guy we need.

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,840
 (laughing)

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
 - So they're currently trying to crowdfund the crayons

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
 in order to go out these new edible crayons.

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
 So if anyone wants to check it out,

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,840
 it's crayonsreadytoeat.com,

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,720
 and they're looking to get $75,000.

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,120
 At the moment, they've got $5,750 as of recording,

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,760
 but you can go to their shop and buy a t-shirt.

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,480
 So that is available right now.

73
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
 - Is it an edible t-shirt?

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,200
 - It is not an edible t-shirt.

75
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
 (laughing)

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
 - It would be a real shame if today,

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,920
 the day that we are doing a comic relief marathon,

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
 asking people to donate money to the best causes in the world,

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
 if actually all of their funds were redirected

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,120
 to fund this edible crayon.

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,460
 (laughing)

82
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,760
 - I just wanna say, if you have to choose one,

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
 just think really carefully.

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,960
 - Okay, look, comic relief for trying to feed the world,

85
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,800
 don't they, huh?

86
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,120
 Better to do that than to send a lot of edible crayons

87
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
 everywhere.

88
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
 (laughing)

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,600
 - James, is it a pun on meals ready to eat?

90
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
 'Cause that's what they call their US military supplies,

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
 isn't it, MREs?

92
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,800
 That's the kind of-

93
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
 - It is.

94
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,160
 - The meal rations you get in the field.

95
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,760
 - To be honest, I didn't know about that,

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
 but now you said it, I mean, it definitely is, isn't it?

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
 - Must be, yeah.

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 It's even in the same packaging style, Andy.

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,420
 So it's like a ground bag, yeah.

100
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,940
 It's got the font on it.

101
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,100
 - And it's the idea that they'd be given

102
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,340
 to children or to Marines,

103
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,260
 because obviously children tend to use crayons more,

104
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,860
 but Marines might need emergency supplies in the field.

105
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,700
 - They're not supposed to be emergency supplies,

106
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,540
 I don't think.

107
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,820
 I don't think you replace them with the usual crayons

108
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,380
 that Marines take in the field.

109
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,460
 (laughing)

110
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,860
 - It's very boring, a lot of it is waiting around,

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,740
 but they've got to have something to entertain them.

112
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,780
 - Yeah, it's a funny product, like a-

113
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,620
 - I like it.

114
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,460
 - Okay, I love it.

115
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,040
 - It's an annual face to the abusers, right?

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
 To the insiders.

117
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,640
 - Yeah, exactly, why do they call Marines crayon eaters?

118
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,680
 It's like, this is quite a new thing.

119
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,040
 The interview with Frank Manto that I saw,

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,720
 he said that when he was in the Marine Corps,

121
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,040
 they never called them crayon eaters.

122
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 That was until 2002.

123
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,880
 They said they were known as jar heads, grunts,

124
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,360
 ground pounders, bullet sponges,

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
 but they were never known as crayon eaters.

126
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,520
 And I can only think, looking at those dates,

127
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,040
 that it's due to Ralph from The Simpsons,

128
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,260
 who was a regular crayon eater,

129
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,140
 and famously supposed to be a bit dumb

130
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,020
 that they must have taken that, it must be.

131
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,220
 - You're so right, yeah.

132
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,420
 There was a blog from another Marine

133
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,660
 about that nickname, Railing Against It,

134
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,140
 not 'cause it's insulting, but because it's just so shit.

135
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,060
 And I couldn't tell if it was like

136
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,460
 the Lady Doth Protest too much,

137
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,220
 but it started out him saying,

138
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,920
 you know, we always make fun of each other in the military,

139
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,580
 so we call the Air Force, the Chair Force, very funny.

140
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,880
 Coast Guard are puddle pirates.

141
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,280
 The list goes on, apparently, but he didn't.

142
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,620
 He didn't.

143
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,520
 But then he said that crayon eaters is just super lame.

144
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,560
 Do you think that something as lame as crayon eater

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
 is gonna offend a member of a tribe

146
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,400
 whose trainees are taught to yell kill during training?

147
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,540
 - Yeah, well, he makes a point.

148
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,600
 - Well, he makes a point, but I think like you say,

149
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,880
 he makes it a bit too strongly, doesn't he?

150
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,480
 - The article is very, very funny.

151
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,720
 Just a couple of extracts, it's bullet point.

152
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,860
 It's like point one, first off, it's just kind of weak.

153
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,220
 Maybe we're just too dumb to understand the insult here,

154
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,860
 but quite frankly, it sucks, it's lame.

155
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,460
 It's no better than a kindergarten insult.

156
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,380
 You might as well say, you poop your pants,

157
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,060
 at least there's some truth to that for the Marines.

158
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
 I mean, it's really--

159
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,340
 - I mean, that seems to be a self, oh, there, doesn't it?

160
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,860
 At least we shit ourselves.

161
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,620
 - Should we be calling them punts poopers instead?

162
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,380
 - You're right, he's shot himself in the foot

163
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,660
 with that article, it's just more ammunition.

164
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,960
 He shot himself in the pants.

165
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,160
 - It doesn't seem like they had a tremendous reputation

166
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,320
 before if they were known as jarheads, grunts,

167
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,280
 and bullets bungers.

168
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
 It's not as though the fine nickname they had before

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
 has taken a backer.

170
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
 - I reckon they probably like ground pounders

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
 'cause that implies running, you know,

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,160
 you know, strong runners, maybe.

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
 - That's true.

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,480
 - Bullet bungers makes you sound pretty damn hardcore.

175
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
 - Yeah.

176
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
 - Yes, that's true.

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,280
 - I guess so.

178
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,360
 - Or more like just people who have disposable in war.

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,800
 - That's what it sounds like to me.

180
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,640
 - It sounds other.

181
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,480
 - Yeah.

182
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
 (laughing)

183
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,340
 - Do you know, if you have chewed off a bunch of crayon,

184
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,600
 but you've left some over, do you know what those are called?

185
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,960
 Those tiny little bits at the end that are sort of useless?

186
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
 - No, I don't know that.

187
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,920
 - They're called left-olars.

188
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,960
 - Left-olars.

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,100
 - Yeah, left-olars are very important

190
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,760
 because they can be collected and remoulded

191
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,920
 into new crayons, and that's a project

192
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,420
 that a guy called Brian Ware was doing.

193
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,080
 So for hospitals in the US, he would collect

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,780
 all the endings, all those tiny little bits at the end,

195
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,180
 and he has a new mold, and he would pour it in,

196
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,660
 he would melt it up, and he would remould crayons,

197
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,040
 and they go to hospitals for free.

198
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,880
 So that's pretty cool.

199
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,520
 - God, I mean, I know hospital food is shit generally,

200
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,040
 but that is a bit beyond the pale, isn't it?

201
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,760
 That's their offering.

202
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,560
 - What was the name of that, the little end bits done?

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
 Did you say?

204
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
 - Left-olars.

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
 - Left-olars, and that probably comes

206
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
 from the ola of crayola, right?

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,360
 - That's right.

208
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
 - So the name crayola, right?

209
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,520
 I think this is amazing.

210
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
 The etymology of this word, it's so ridiculous.

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,500
 It was coined by Alice Binney,

212
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,220
 who was the wife of Edwin Binney.

213
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,580
 These two people kind of started the crayola company,

214
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,740
 and she got the word from the French word cray,

215
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,500
 meaning a stick of chalk,

216
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,180
 and the English word oleaginous, meaning oily.

217
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,620
 So it means oily chalk, but I just love that.

218
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,380
 I mean, oleaginous is such an unusual word

219
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,260
 to just think, well, I'm gonna make a kid's plaything

220
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
 out of this word.

221
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,220
 - It's a stupid name.

222
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,400
 It's neither chalk nor oily, and in fact,

223
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,120
 the whole point of crayons, crayola crayons,

224
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,520
 is that it was the first type of crayon to not use oil.

225
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,040
 It used wax instead.

226
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,080
 So it does seem bizarre to me to then give it the oil name.

227
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,960
 - It's not oleaginous.

228
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,020
 - Well, exactly.

229
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,520
 - But the Binney family in general,

230
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,200
 they made, obviously they made millions out of crayons,

231
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
 and the really nice thing is what the money was spent on,

232
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,120
 because in 1986, the San Diego Museum of Art

233
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,280
 got a world-class collection of art bequeathed to them,

234
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,400
 and that was the result of the Binney family millions.

235
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,740
 I think it was Edwin Binney III, who must have been,

236
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,880
 I guess, grandson of the original Edwin Binney,

237
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,160
 he had bought this wonderful art collection.

238
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,460
 So crayons paid for a world-class art collection,

239
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
 which I think is a very nice--

240
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,440
 - That's all the arts are made of crayons, so.

241
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
 - Yeah, it was only crayon art.

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,780
 It was really, no, I can't remember exactly what was in it,

243
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,640
 but it was really good stuff.

244
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,800
 - Although people used to paint with proper crayons.

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,640
 - That's right, yeah.

246
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,200
 Would you know 2012, up until 2012,

247
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,280
 the most expensive painting ever sold at auction

248
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,540
 was done by crayon, or rather pastels,

249
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,160
 but you know, the same thing really.

250
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,660
 I know there's an oil and wax slight difference to it,

251
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,500
 but--

252
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,420
 - Yeah, and also reputationally,

253
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,440
 if you say I've done a lovely pastel drawing,

254
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,320
 then people think, oh, you must really know what you're doing.

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
 If you say I've done a lovely crayon piece,

256
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
 they think, five.

257
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,520
 - Interesting though, fruit pastels,

258
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,440
 began as a painting tool that tasted like fruit.

259
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,700
 - Oh, God, poor guy, it's already been invented.

260
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,000
 We should tell him, mate, they've done it.

261
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,320
 The fruit pastels.

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,720
 The painting, by the way, was "The Scream" by Edvard Munch.

263
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,040
 - Oh, yeah.

264
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,420
 - He did one, yeah, 'cause he did a bunch of versions

265
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,480
 of "The Scream" and one of them was on cardboard,

266
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,560
 and it was done with these crayon-y pastels,

267
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,040
 and that sold for something like 119 million at the time.

268
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,920
 It's now 23rd in the list

269
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,720
 of the most expensive pieces of art

270
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,240
 that have ever been sold with a da Vinci right at the top.

271
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,400
 But yeah.

272
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,480
 - And also his name, Edvard Munch,

273
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,000
 comes from the fact that he used to eat his drawing equipment

274
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
 as soon as he was done, didn't he?

275
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
 - Yeah.

276
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,800
 - Crayola Vigurd at PR, I would say,

277
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,880
 as a company, when then latest new color,

278
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,240
 "Blootiful" came to be.

279
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
 The company said it beat four other finalists,

280
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,120
 so the other finalists were, "Dreams come blue,

281
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,280
 "blue moon bliss, reach for the stars,

282
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,800
 "star-spangled blue," they're the four that it beat.

283
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,440
 And they said that the company chose "Blootiful"

284
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,160
 from over 90,000 unique submissions.

285
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,200
 Someone read through 90,000 names,

286
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,680
 and then there were 400,000 votes to decide the winner.

287
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,920
 - It's insane that you could have 90,000 unique names

288
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,720
 when the public have no ability

289
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,200
 to think of anything new, do they?

290
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,240
 Basically, if they've got 90,000 unique ones,

291
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,080
 then think of all the people who said "bluey blue face,"

292
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,680
 and add that to that number, and you're in the millions.

293
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,360
 - So I think they can't have meant unique names.

294
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,400
 They must have meant unique submissions from people.

295
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,440
 Some people must have been coming up with the same ones.

296
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,480
 - They must have been.

297
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,920
 - There aren't 90,000 sounds in the world.

298
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
 (laughing)

299
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,960
 - But yeah, there's not 90,000 puns with the word "blue,"

300
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,440
 and that's for sure.

301
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
 - Even you couldn't generate.

302
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,440
 - No, but they probably just had people just sausage stick,

303
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,840
 you know, it's probably just random submissions.

304
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,840
 - 90,000 is a lot of people.

305
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,320
 That's really so many to be part of the base name.

306
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,160
 - It's kids, isn't it?

307
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,600
 It'd be schools that they're all submitting

308
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,840
 around America, I think it is.

309
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
 - But it's crazy.

310
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,560
 I was looking through, I read this amazing site

311
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
 that I wanna give a shout out to,

312
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,520
 which is Jenny's crayon collection site,

313
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,760
 and a woman called Jenny has gone through and cataloged

314
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,520
 every single crayon that's ever been and ever been retired.

315
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,800
 I read through all the colors, obviously,

316
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,640
 and they prioritized bizarre things.

317
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,720
 So the initial ones are really obvious,

318
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,400
 like red, yellow, blue, brown,

319
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,280
 but by the time you're in the 32 crayon box,

320
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,600
 you're getting Timber Wolf as a color.

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,200
 In the 48 box, you've got macaroni and cheese as a color,

322
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,320
 and yet maroon and navy blue,

323
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,600
 you don't get them to the 96 box.

324
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,680
 - Really?

325
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
 Wow, people in the navy must feel very bad about that.

326
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,440
 - Yeah, those puddle pirates.

327
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,080
 So, but one other thing about that,

328
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,240
 the color changes is the famous thing

329
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,160
 when they changed the flesh color.

330
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,640
 So it used to be that Crayola had this color,

331
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,720
 which was flesh, which was very much the same color

332
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,640
 as a white person's skin,

333
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,960
 but obviously that is extremely unwoken,

334
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,320
 not the right thing to do.

335
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,760
 And there was a woman called June Handler.

336
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,640
 She was a scientist, and she realized

337
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
 that when she was observing children,

338
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,000
 they would often bully each other,

339
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
 like the white kids would bully the non-white kids

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,000
 by saying you don't have any flesh

341
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,600
 because you don't have the same color skin as this crayon.

342
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,040
 She wrote to Crayola, and Crayola, to their credit,

343
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,400
 very, very quickly changed it, changed the color to peach.

344
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,040
 And now they have a colors of the world crayons

345
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
 where you can, basically it's all the different skin type

346
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,800
 colors that you can get in one pack.

347
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,920
 It's pretty cool, isn't it?

348
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,160
 - Yeah, good on you, Crayola.

349
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,000
 Yeah.

350
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
 - Oh, good at PR.

351
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
 I'm telling you.

352
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,000
 - Did you read the list of internet crayons

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,920
 that Crayola released in the 1990s?

354
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,840
 I mean, it's just the same colors all over again,

355
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,160
 but they were called things like

356
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,020
 web surfing blue, circuit board green,

357
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,280
 green dot com, just another green,

358
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,440
 online orange, and my favorite, floppy yellow.

359
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,600
 - Oh, really?

360
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,320
 Floppy yellow, that used to be my nickname at school,

361
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,480
 but I don't know why they called me that

362
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
 'cause I used to ship myself all the time.

363
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,500
 (upbeat music)

364
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

365
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,120
 and that is my fact.

366
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,040
 My fact this week is that the London Metropolitan Police

367
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,840
 used to have a van called teapot one exclusively

368
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,080
 to deliver cups of tea to officers stuck

369
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,400
 at the scene of a crime.

370
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,960
 - Wow, that's awesome.

371
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,440
 - Yeah, so this sadly, I believe that teapot one

372
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,560
 and it's brother or sister teapot two

373
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,720
 are now decommissioned tragically,

374
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
 they're no longer running,

375
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,720
 and it's a shame because teapot one was this,

376
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
 it looked kind of like a burger van that went around,

377
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,840
 but it had also the sort of regalia

378
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 of a classic police car,

379
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,000
 and on the very front of it,

380
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,680
 written in capitals was teapot one,

381
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
 and it would be called for, say example,

382
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,560
 if police were called to an area

383
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
 where they thought maybe a protest was,

384
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,200
 or if there was a big festival

385
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,640
 and they needed police on standby the whole time,

386
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,040
 this was the catering truck that would come by

387
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,600
 and top them up with tea,

388
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,080
 there would be other things like coffees

389
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,200
 and sandwiches and so on,

390
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
 but it was known as teapot one.

391
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,240
 - Am I correct in thinking that behind teapot one,

392
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,000
 you would also get the milk motorbike,

393
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
 and that would bring the milk in the sidecar.

394
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,080
 - And you have the sugar scooter behind that, didn't you?

395
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,560
 (laughing)

396
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,400
 - Yeah.

397
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
 - Yeah, so it was basically the government privatized

398
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,760
 the catering of the Met Police after that

399
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,960
 and put it out to tender.

400
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,760
 So this was the Met Police's own thing that they had,

401
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,680
 but then the government said,

402
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,520
 "No, we'll be able to make it more efficient

403
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,960
 if we put it out to other companies."

404
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,120
 - If you ever want an argument against privatization,

405
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,880
 the end of teapot one, is it?

406
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,000
 - Well, I read one vlog about it where they said,

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
 "Let's be honest, in the main, the food was shit."

408
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,640
 But that's not the issue here.

409
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,680
 (laughing)

410
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
 Who else could give you a frozen pork pie,

411
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,960
 a sandwich, an apple, and a cup of hot gray water

412
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,320
 at four o'clock in the morning and do it all with a smile.

413
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,760
 So it's one of these things where everyone knew

414
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,440
 it was terrible, but it was their thing,

415
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,400
 and that's why they were upset about it.

416
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,960
 - That is such a shame.

417
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,000
 When teapot was written across the front of it down,

418
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,520
 was it written backwards so that if you were in a car

419
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,000
 and it was going up with its sirens behind you, you could see?

420
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,520
 - And the siren was the kettle just whistling.

421
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,760
 (laughing)

422
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,920
 - I think from the photo that I've seen,

423
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
 unless they've reversed the photo,

424
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
 it looks like it was a normal reading

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
 for if you were standing in front of it,

426
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,640
 so the correct way.

427
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,120
 So before teapot one existed officially

428
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,160
 on the front of a van, it used to just be a call sign.

429
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
 So police have all sorts of different call signs

430
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,240
 for if they need certain types of units to come in.

431
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,200
 So if there's rioting going on

432
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
 and they have a van full of riot police,

433
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,280
 that call sign might be gold or silver,

434
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,800
 and they would know, okay, we need to send that van in.

435
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
 - It's good that they're quite different, isn't it?

436
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,280
 You don't want to accidentally send the tea lady in.

437
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,120
 - Especially, James, if you say, right,

438
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,480
 we need to kettle everybody at this point.

439
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,640
 Get the teapot!

440
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,680
 (laughing)

441
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,640
 - So I actually spoke to a former police officer to ask,

442
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,040
 do you know anything about where this came from?

443
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,200
 And by an astonishing coincidence,

444
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,240
 the person I spoke to is the person

445
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,520
 who may have generated the call sign teapot one.

446
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,120
 His name is Stephen Colgan, he's a buddy of ours.

447
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,720
 He is a former QIL, he's been on the show before.

448
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,520
 And he told me that at the time when the call sign came out,

449
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,080
 he was an instructor at Met's Telecom and Wireless School.

450
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,880
 And one day, he created a temporary call sign,

451
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,080
 teapot one, for the catering van.

452
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
 And it started getting used and started, it got stuck.

453
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
 And his colleagues started doing the same.

454
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,760
 And then a second van came, which was teapot two.

455
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,000
 He says it's quite possible

456
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,480
 that he wasn't the very first to use it,

457
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
 but he can't find any instances before

458
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
 where anyone had done that.

459
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,720
 And it was years after he left the police

460
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,520
 that it became the call sign so much

461
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,280
 that they eventually turned it into the van itself.

462
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
 - Wicked.

463
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,560
 - I was on a Reddit thread,

464
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,640
 which asked a question that everyone's probably wondering,

465
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,680
 which is, is it appropriate to offer police officers tea

466
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,160
 or coffee if they're outside on your property?

467
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
 Which, so most answers were from American people saying,

468
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,800
 this is the most British question I've ever heard being asked.

469
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,920
 And not only are you offering the police tea,

470
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,000
 but you're asking if that's polite to do it.

471
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,680
 But the answer seems to be from various police officers

472
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,560
 who responded, they love tea, always right to offer.

473
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,440
 Please don't be offended if we turn it down.

474
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,120
 Sometimes we're busy, even if we don't look busy.

475
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,080
 But also there are some instances

476
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,800
 where it may be considered a bribe.

477
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
 And so they are going to be obliged to turn it down.

478
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,560
 - I was told, I was told when I worked in a hotel

479
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,600
 that when the police came for our regular fights

480
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
 and things that we had to call them for,

481
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
 that we weren't allowed to give them tea or biscuits

482
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,000
 or anything like that.

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,320
 We were told we weren't allowed to

484
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,280
 because it was counted as a bribe.

485
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,520
 And that was by the police.

486
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,000
 But we still would ask them all the time

487
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
 because it's just polite, isn't it?

488
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,640
 It was like a cup of tea.

489
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,080
 But then probably about half of them would say,

490
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,400
 no, we're not allowed.

491
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,000
 And then the other half would say, oh yeah, go on then.

492
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,520
 And there was one time that I was working behind the bar

493
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
 and there was a massive fight,

494
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
 like a really, really massive fight going on.

495
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,940
 And we called the police.

496
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,000
 We kind of put all the shutters down and stuff.

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And then eventually the police came.

498
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,920
 I'll never forget it.

499
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 We gave him a cup of tea and he had like four massive guys

500
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,060
 who he was kind of corraling out of the building

501
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,640
 with a cup of tea on the saucer,

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,560
 with a biscuit on the saucer all the way through.

503
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,440
 And he didn't spill a single drop.

504
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,400
 It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

505
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
 - No, that's amazing. - Badass.

506
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,040
 - I did spot that the St. John Ambulance Twitter

507
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,680
 does say as of 28th of June, 2020,

508
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,640
 that they have a vehicle called the teapot,

509
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,440
 which seems to still be running.

510
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,640
 And that is used to deliver refreshments

511
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,720
 to hospital staff and medics and volunteers, so on.

512
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,440
 So it is possible that despite the police teapot one

513
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,720
 being down, we still might have a teapot on the road,

514
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,320
 helping out hospital staff.

515
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,480
 - Thank God, as long as Britain has a teapot vehicle

516
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,800
 on the road somewhere.

517
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,120
 - Hey, like tea is very important to our country, Anna.

518
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,080
 It's like what we were built on.

519
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,920
 Absolutely.

520
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,280
 - That's like the crows of Tower of London.

521
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,320
 If there's not a teapot van on the streets of London,

522
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
 England will fall.

523
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,880
 - In wartime, especially,

524
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,320
 we get very possessive about tea.

525
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,520
 In the Second World War, I don't think we've mentioned that.

526
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,200
 Well, first of all, once the Blitz came,

527
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,680
 all British tea stock was moved out of London.

528
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,720
 And it was dispersed through the country

529
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
 to 500 different locations.

530
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
 - Whoa, 500?

531
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,400
 - That's, you're really making sure.

532
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
 They can't get all 500.

533
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,440
 But also in 1942, Britain bought up

534
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,920
 the world's entire supply of black tea.

535
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,280
 This is how much we realised we needed it

536
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,360
 to get through the war.

537
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,440
 It was all the tea on the European market.

538
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,800
 And it was largely for the North Africa desert campaigns,

539
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,520
 because apparently all their water

540
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,560
 was transported in fuel containers.

541
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,920
 So it tasted like oil.

542
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,000
 So the only drink they would drink was tea.

543
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,880
 But yeah, they bought up all the tea, pretty much available.

544
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,080
 - That's so funny. - To Europe.

545
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,440
 The Suffragette movement, tea was very important in that.

546
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,760
 There was a suffragette called Patricia Hall,

547
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,640
 who once said that the promise of a cup of tea

548
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,240
 was a great inducement to get women to come to meetings.

549
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,840
 And also a lot of the tea rooms in London

550
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
 was where they would meet.

551
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,400
 So there was one in particular on Oxford Street

552
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,320
 called Allen's Tea Rooms,

553
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,240
 where a lot of the early suffragette plans got made.

554
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,760
 And this was run by a guy called Allen Liddle.

555
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,120
 But Allen Liddle was actually a pseudonym

556
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,840
 for the person who actually run it,

557
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,680
 who was called Marguerite Liddle.

558
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
 And her middle name was Allen.

559
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,200
 So she called it Allen's Tea Rooms after her middle name,

560
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,680
 'cause she was called Marguerite Allen Liddle.

561
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,120
 And I can't work out whether the Allen

562
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,080
 as a middle name was fake completely,

563
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,800
 or whether just by coincidence,

564
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,520
 she had a male-sounding middle name,

565
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,000
 and she could use it for this tea shop.

566
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,920
 But yeah.

567
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
 - That's hilarious.

568
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,880
 - Was this sort of like how female authors

569
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,000
 in the 19th century had to have male pseudonyms?

570
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,240
 Was it like you weren't allowed to establish a tea room

571
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,640
 unless you were a male?

572
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,000
 - I think it was like to stop people from worrying

573
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,960
 that this was a place where women were gonna hang out.

574
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,360
 Because Helen Gordon Liddle was one of the people

575
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,160
 who went to Marguerite's Tea Room,

576
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,200
 and she was one of the very famous kind of suffragettes

577
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,480
 who wrote a book about, I think, about force feeding.

578
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,080
 I think it was like the first account of women

579
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
 being force fed in prisons and stuff.

580
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
 So yeah.

581
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,480
 - So they went on to found Liddle, didn't they?

582
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,560
 - Liddle, yeah.

583
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,040
 - Yeah, pretty good.

584
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,160
 Do you guys know who invented tea?

585
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,040
 - God? - What?

586
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,520
 - So close, so close, it was Buddha.

587
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
 Yeah.

588
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,560
 There's an Indian legend that Buddha went to China,

589
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,800
 and when he was there, he said, right,

590
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,400
 I'm gonna meditate for nine years now, okay?

591
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
 He thought he was in for a long meditation,

592
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
 but he fell asleep.

593
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,720
 And when he woke up from his nice sleep,

594
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,280
 halfway through his nine years of meditating,

595
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,600
 he was so annoyed at his own weakness

596
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,640
 that he cut off his own eyelids,

597
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,480
 and he chucked them on the ground.

598
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,280
 And where they fell, a tree with eyelid-shaped leaves

599
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,000
 sprang up in its place,

600
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,040
 and that was the first ever tea tree.

601
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,920
 - Oh, wow, I've never heard that.

602
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,360
 - Citation needed, but still, it's a nice story.

603
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
 - Yeah.

604
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 - Tea pots, original tea pots came from China,

605
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,560
 where tea came from,

606
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,600
 and they became popular in the Ming dynasty,

607
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,840
 but apparently, I read one source that said

608
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,680
 the Chinese people would carry them around with them

609
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,560
 and just drink straight from the nozzle,

610
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,760
 which kind of sounds like that.

611
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,400
 - That does make, well, it would burn,

612
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
 wouldn't it, if it was too hot?

613
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
 I think that's the only thing that stops me from doing it,

614
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
 is that I'm worried that I've burned my mouth.

615
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,960
 - Your lips are gonna blister.

616
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,720
 - And was it known as the nozzle back in the day?

617
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,560
 (laughing)

618
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,000
 - I'll be honest, in ancient China,

619
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
 I don't think they even called it a spout,

620
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,240
 I mean, they probably had their own word for it.

621
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,080
 - You're right, right.

622
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,080
 - I don't think nozzle is a Mandarin etymology.

623
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,320
 - I read that on a lot of ships,

624
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,840
 so sort of military ships,

625
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
 that the tea pots you get there, they are cube shaped.

626
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,840
 - Are they?

627
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
 - Yeah, they're rolling around and stuff.

628
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
 - Exactly, yeah, the cube tea pots.

629
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,560
 So it's, yeah, it's just a really cool tea pot shape.

630
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,120
 It's, sorry, cube shape.

631
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,320
 It was invented by a guy called Robert Crawford Johnson.

632
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,720
 And it's still going, like it's a big cube tea pot's limited,

633
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
 it's a big thing.

634
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,640
 It's easy for storage as well, 'cause you can pack them up,

635
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,680
 you know, like those square watermelons that you get.

636
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,240
 - Yeah, but the nozzle's gonna get in the way,

637
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,480
 but I do see that point.

638
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,920
 But it's quite hard to make square ceramics, isn't it?

639
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,000
 It's like, 'cause you have the joints

640
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,640
 are really, really difficult to make them watertight.

641
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,800
 - Yeah, interestingly, it does not have a nozzle.

642
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,720
 - Which is interesting, which is why you can pack it, yeah.

643
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,560
 - Does it have a handle?

644
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,200
 - It does have a handle, yeah.

645
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
 - 'Cause I was gonna say,

646
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,000
 it's like I'm a little cubic tea pot, shorted out.

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
 I don't have an handle and I don't have a nozzle.

648
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
 (laughing)

649
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,800
 - So it's just, it sounds like they're boxes.

650
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,320
 - Yeah, it's a cardboard box.

651
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,480
 (laughing)

652
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,080
 - And you write teapot on the side in crayon,

653
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,200
 hung it on the ship, give it to the Marines.

654
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,360
 - They'll know what to do with it.

655
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,880
 (laughing)

656
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,160
 - Do you know that the oldest petrol station in America

657
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,520
 is shaped like a teapot?

658
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,120
 - No.

659
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,800
 - So, this is at least claimed to be

660
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,360
 the oldest petrol station in the country.

661
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,640
 It's in Zilla, which is in Washington state,

662
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,640
 and it opened in around 1920s, '21, '22, something like that.

663
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,960
 And the reason it's shaped like a teapot

664
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,080
 is it's based on the teapot dome scandal,

665
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,640
 which was a bribery scandal

666
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
 during the presidency of Warren Harding.

667
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,200
 And there was an oil field

668
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,040
 that was known as the teapot dome oil field,

669
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,680
 and someone had been paying to get their hands

670
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,920
 on this oil field.

671
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,880
 And the teapot dome oil field was named

672
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,760
 after a teapot-shaped rock,

673
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,400
 which was in the middle of the field.

674
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,240
 (laughing)

675
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,960
 And then that became the name of the scandal,

676
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,560
 which became the name of the first petrol station.

677
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
 - Amazing. - Weird.

678
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,840
 - You wouldn't guess a teapot-shaped petrol station

679
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,240
 was associated with mass government corruption.

680
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,440
 So that was what it was nodding towards.

681
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,160
 You'd think they probably sell tea.

682
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,000
 - Yeah, they probably built it thinking,

683
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,640
 "Oh, this'll be one in the eye for the government, won't it?"

684
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
 Everyone will see this for hundreds of years,

685
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,240
 and the first thing they'll think

686
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
 is what an arsehole Warren Harding was,

687
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
 but actually what everyone thinks is,

688
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,800
 "Oh, that looks like a teapot."

689
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,560
 - Sorry, do they call the nozzle the spout?

690
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,560
 - Spout, yeah. (laughing)

691
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,080
 - I know a completely random thing about Zilla,

692
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,040
 just to chuck in this very small town,

693
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,640
 which is that they've got a church there,

694
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,520
 the Church of God in Zilla,

695
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,240
 and they have a giant 10-foot tall T-Rex out the front of it,

696
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,040
 or they used to, which is dubbed

697
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,640
 and known to the locals as Godzilla.

698
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,040
 - Oh, no way.

699
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,760
 - Yeah, and so it's become an attraction.

700
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,600
 You go and see Godzilla at the Church of God.

701
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,840
 - And what kind of corruption was that a metaphor for?

702
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,200
 (laughing)

703
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
 It was a lizard selling scandal

704
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,800
 in the presidency of Taft.

705
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,120
 - It's quite confusing, 'cause Godzilla, am I right,

706
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,920
 is not a T-Rex.

707
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,040
 - Yep, you're raising a very obvious point.

708
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,680
 (laughing)

709
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,280
 - Outch. - Yeah, very obvious.

710
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,040
 - Fine. - I'm saying what I mean

711
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,200
 is everyone was thinking it.

712
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,320
 - I speak for the people when I say,

713
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,280
 I wonder what happened to the Teasmaid.

714
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
 Does anyone else ever wonder that?

715
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
 - Sorry.

716
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,800
 - You know the Teasmaids that our parents reminisce about?

717
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,880
 - 2016 by the Metropolitan Police

718
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,160
 when they decided to outsource the--

719
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,560
 - That's the other--

720
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,080
 - I don't know what a Teasmaid is.

721
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,800
 - So a Teasmaid was what,

722
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,080
 it's like a little thing that you have

723
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,760
 on the side of your bed that not only is the alarm clock,

724
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,400
 but it also makes your cup of tea in the morning.

725
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,960
 - Yeah, it's the thing that makes your tea.

726
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,240
 Everyone sort of had them in the '50s, '60s, '70s.

727
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,960
 - Wow, that's right. - And the first ones

728
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,800
 were actually in 1891.

729
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640
 The first one was made.

730
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,520
 It was called the Early Rises Friend.

731
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,280
 And it was basically an alarm clock.

732
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,600
 But apparently in the description of the patent,

733
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,360
 you replace the spring of the clock with cat gut.

734
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,280
 And when the alarm vibrated, the cat gut struck a match.

735
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,240
 So it like pulled a match, it struck against the surface,

736
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,720
 which lit some, you know, a bit of wick,

737
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,120
 oiled wick, which boiled water.

738
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,400
 And then the boiled water would tip itself

739
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
 into a cup of tea.

740
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,720
 It sounds a little bit like,

741
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,080
 I don't know if any of you guys ever played Mousetrap

742
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,600
 as kids, you know, that thing that just never works.

743
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
 - Yeah, sounds like an OK Go video.

744
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,680
 It's like a heat-robbing machine or whatever they're called.

745
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,400
 - We've all found a reference that fits us,

746
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
 apart from Anna here, so.

747
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,360
 - Anna said Anna had Mousetrap.

748
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,880
 - Mousetrap, Mousetrap. - OK, sorry.

749
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,840
 - Yeah, I don't recall hearing anything from you, Andy.

750
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,360
 You've been particularly silent for references on this one.

751
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,640
 - Oh, dear.

752
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
 - Agree with the rest of us, haven't you,

753
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,480
 in this big old reference off.

754
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,280
 (laughing)

755
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,320
 But anyway, tea's made about a quarter of households

756
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,360
 had them in the '70s.

757
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,040
 And I've always wanted one.

758
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,960
 And they were ruined according to various articles

759
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,480
 in the early '90s by Norma Major.

760
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,880
 So, Norma Major in an interview, as in John Major.

761
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,320
 - Can you just say who, yeah, yeah.

762
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,160
 - Sorry, yes.

763
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,000
 Just for international or younger listeners,

764
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,120
 Norma Major was John Major,

765
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,640
 Prime Minister John Major's wife.

766
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,320
 And she said in an interview that her tea's made

767
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,400
 was the pride and joy of her bedroom

768
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
 and almost immediately sales of tea's made plummeted so far.

769
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,160
 - I've gotta say, that's a bit of a slam on John Major

770
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,920
 to say that your tea's made is the pride

771
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,280
 and joy of your bedroom.

772
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,480
 (laughing)

773
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,200
 - He was normally downstairs enjoying a curry.

774
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,000
 - Hey, good luck getting that one international listener.

775
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
 (laughing)

776
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,320
 - Google it, and then you'll have a good old laugh.

777
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,160
 - It's very funny.

778
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,740
 (upbeat music)

779
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

780
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
 and that is Andy.

781
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,800
 - My fact is that the ninth longest running

782
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,400
 British soap ever was designed exclusively to sell soap.

783
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,600
 - Nice.

784
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,720
 - And you mean soap, when I first read this fact,

785
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,520
 I genuinely forgot the other meaning of the word soap.

786
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,200
 So I just thought you meant a bar of soap.

787
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,640
 The ninth longest running bar of soap

788
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,760
 was designed to sell soap.

789
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
 And I thought, of course it bloody was.

790
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,400
 (laughing)

791
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,960
 - Great point, very good point.

792
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,800
 I do mean a soap opera, yeah.

793
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,640
 So this is a spin-off,

794
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,080
 'cause last week we were talking about laundry.

795
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,320
 And afterwards, I just,

796
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,320
 I remembered that we'd spoken about Dazz briefly

797
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,600
 in the recording and I started reading about Dazz.

798
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,120
 And I found out that for 18 years from 2002 to '19,

799
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,320
 inclusive, they had a soap opera,

800
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,320
 which was in advert form, which was about Dazz.

801
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,240
 And they got soap opera stars to be in the Dazz adverts

802
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,120
 in similar roles to in the actual soaps they were in.

803
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,160
 It's basically, you know, the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

804
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,080
 where everyone kind of meets all these characters

805
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
 from all over the place.

806
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,120
 This is like that, 'cause they've got people from Corey,

807
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,640
 EastEnders, Brookside, Hollyoaks,

808
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,400
 they're all in the same world mingling

809
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
 and interacting with each other.

810
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,320
 It's very much the most ambitious crossover

811
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,360
 in television history, isn't it?

812
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,040
 - It is, it absolutely is.

813
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,400
 It's called Cleaner Close.

814
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
 - Does it count as a soap opera

815
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,160
 if it's actually an advert or not?

816
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,320
 - Well, what a great point, James.

817
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,640
 And what a time to raise it.

818
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,160
 The Wikipedia on it reports that episodes have a character

819
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,640
 who does not use Dazz, which causes them problems,

820
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,240
 which are solved by a character who uses Dazz.

821
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,640
 So, I mean, I don't think anyone was waiting,

822
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,880
 tuning in each week.

823
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,680
 It wasn't like it ran for a thousand episodes or anything.

824
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,040
 - Well, you'd only get like a couple of episodes a year,

825
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,800
 wouldn't you, 'cause they'd rerun the adverts and stuff.

826
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
 - Exactly, yeah.

827
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,320
 But fortunately, I don't think that is the dividing line

828
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,640
 between soap and non-soap.

829
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,320
 And so I'm claiming that this is long-running soap.

830
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,000
 - And what do they do in the ad breaks of the Dazz soap?

831
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,040
 - They have extremely short ad breaks in those,

832
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,480
 where they actually sell Purcell with another ad.

833
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,880
 - So it's like a little Russian doll of soap operas.

834
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,200
 How come we've never seen this?

835
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,160
 I've never seen this.

836
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,520
 - I know it quite well, yeah.

837
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,840
 - Yeah, I've never seen it.

838
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,280
 - A lot of people who listen to this podcast

839
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,800
 will be very familiar with this advertising campaign,

840
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,760
 or I can clean a close.

841
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,600
 - More people will have known it

842
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,160
 than will have read Annika Rennerna.

843
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,080
 We're not gonna spoil her either this week, but,

844
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,920
 but it's really pleasing,

845
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,440
 'cause this is back to the original days of soap operas,

846
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,080
 which were sponsored by soap companies, soap manufacturers.

847
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,920
 The very first ever soap opera, which started in 1930,

848
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,680
 was sponsored by Parmoliv,

849
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,160
 who wanted ads for their super suds attached.

850
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,040
 And the reasoning was these are for women working at home,

851
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,600
 housewives, and what are they like?

852
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,840
 Well, they probably like soap.

853
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,920
 So let's try and sell them soap while they listen

854
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,400
 and are at home.

855
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,040
 - Do you know how Parmoliv got the name just as an aside?

856
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
 - No.

857
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,400
 - I think you can guess probably.

858
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,240
 - All right.

859
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,200
 - Was it founded by a woman called Olive,

860
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
 who had huge, sweaty palms.

861
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,840
 (laughing)

862
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
 Always needed to wash them.

863
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,720
 - Yeah, it's a good guess.

864
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,200
 I reckon the people at home might have worked it out already,

865
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,840
 but the two oils that it was made from

866
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,960
 were Parmol and Olive Oil.

867
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,320
 - Oh yeah, that makes more sense than the hand thing.

868
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,280
 - Yeah, that makes more sense, I'd like to say.

869
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,040
 Just different, truer.

870
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,240
 - But people hated soaps from the start, right?

871
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
 There was never a heyday where soaps were considered

872
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,040
 a high culture thing.

873
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,560
 They were railed against from that early 1930s.

874
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,400
 They were 15 minutes long and most newspaper articles

875
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,760
 when they write about them say basically about four to five

876
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,360
 of those 15 minutes of these blimmin' adverts,

877
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,440
 all of which start with, as you say, Andy,

878
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,760
 ladies, have you tried XYZ?

879
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,600
 And they were sometimes called washboard weepers.

880
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,840
 That was an alternative name for soaps in the '40s.

881
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,120
 - But I think really it was snobbishness, wasn't it?

882
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,560
 And also the fact that they were aimed towards women

883
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,920
 and often made by women.

884
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,160
 So like one of the real first amazing writers

885
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,040
 for soap operas was someone called Anna Phillips.

886
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
 And she was incredibly, incredible writer.

887
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,200
 She wrote two million words a year at her best.

888
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,160
 - And she was often suggesting new colours

889
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,560
 for the Crayola Company, wasn't she?

890
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
 - Yes.

891
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,720
 - A lot of her were lounges.

892
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,080
 - She invented things like the cliffhanger ending.

893
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
 That was her idea.

894
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,440
 But she was kind of the queen of soap operas

895
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,720
 in the early, early days in the '30s.

896
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,960
 - Yeah, she had a show which was called Painted Dreams,

897
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,720
 which was the very first one that she did.

898
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,000
 So that started airing in 1930.

899
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,120
 And she was asked, can you come up with a daily show

900
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,760
 that would show the sort of home life of people?

901
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,840
 And as you say, it was sort of treated like,

902
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,280
 "Ugh, what is this lowbrow nonsense?"

903
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,960
 But actually, for the time, it was 1930,

904
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
 the characters that she created

905
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,280
 were incredibly strong women on the show.

906
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,880
 And there were virtually no regular male characters

907
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,200
 in it whatsoever.

908
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,120
 So she really pushed forward this idea

909
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,480
 that women were more than what society was saying they were,

910
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,240
 that they were much more, they were cleverer,

911
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,120
 they were more ambitious.

912
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,280
 And so that was sort of like a beautiful,

913
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,720
 little secret movement to push women's rights.

914
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,560
 - Yeah.

915
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,000
 - But it must have made a difference

916
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,600
 because they were so popular straight away, weren't they?

917
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,880
 I think by like the, it started in 1930,

918
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,880
 by 1940, 92% of programs on the radio were soaps, basically.

919
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,080
 It was like 25 of the 30 top-rated programs were soaps.

920
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,720
 So maybe they are the cause of women's lip.

921
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,120
 - Well, they did have a lot to say for society

922
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,000
 because the person who came after Ernest Phillips

923
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
 was Agnes Nixon.

924
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
 So she was in the '50s and '60s.

925
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
 She was like the successor of Ernest Phillips.

926
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,320
 And she not only wrote very strong characters,

927
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,000
 but she also wrote about a lot of societal problems.

928
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,040
 You know, these days, when you're so proper,

929
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,520
 she'll have lots of, you know,

930
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,880
 echoing the problems of society, they'll do that.

931
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,480
 And she was really the first one who decided to do that.

932
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,200
 And there was one time where one of her characters

933
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,000
 had cervical cancer and they found it through a smear test.

934
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,720
 And that really was the time that the taboo over smear tests

935
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,760
 really kind of was, obviously it's still there a little bit,

936
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,560
 but it was like, it was completely taboo before that.

937
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,320
 And this really made a massive difference

938
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,560
 and loads more women got tested after that.

939
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,920
 - That's very cool. - That was in 1962.

940
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,840
 - Wow, didn't know they had smear tests back then.

941
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,200
 - Yeah, early days.

942
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,600
 - Another thing that Ernest Phillips innovated

943
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,960
 in the soap field was having an organ player.

944
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,320
 And most soaps then just had an organ player

945
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,920
 as part of the regular employees

946
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,520
 whose job was just to give a "da da da da da da"

947
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,280
 in between scenes. - Did they do that?

948
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,840
 - I don't know if they played that specific piece,

949
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,240
 but they did have, you know.

950
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,000
 - There's TV shows in Australia,

951
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,640
 the soaps like Home and Away and Neighbours are quite famous

952
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,480
 for giving us a lot of big stars that are now,

953
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,360
 you know, Kylie Minot and so on,

954
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,120
 sort of all got, you know, cut their teeth on that show.

955
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,440
 And I didn't really-- - Sorry.

956
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,000
 - Kylie is massive.

957
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,800
 - Yeah, she's also has said I was the dog.

958
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,880
 She's so big that most of us know what her surname is.

959
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,640
 - Minot, guys. - Minot.

960
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,280
 Like the fish, the small fish.

961
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,400
 She's literally not a Minot.

962
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
 She's a big fish. - Kylie Minot.

963
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
 - She is quite petite though.

964
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,480
 - I have been saying Minot my whole life.

965
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
 - Well, she nicknamed,

966
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,920
 that would have been a good nickname for her at school

967
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
 'cause she was, she's so petite.

968
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,400
 - For all I know, she was Minot.

969
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,520
 Hasn't like, that's technically the correct way

970
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,800
 to pronounce it, but that's not the way

971
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,280
 anyone in the world is pronouncing it.

972
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,080
 - No, you're right, now that he points it out,

973
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,440
 I do know that every other person who's ever said the name

974
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,880
 to me in my entire life has said it with the GUE,

975
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,240
 sort of really punctuated.

976
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
 Migno, Migno.

977
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,920
 (all laughing)

978
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,120
 Listen, whatever she's called,

979
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,560
 neighbors gave her to us.

980
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,760
 And, well, I've lost my place now.

981
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,800
 So basically, Corrie, Coronation Street,

982
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,120
 the street is responsible for quite a lot

983
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,920
 of big actors as well that we now have.

984
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,680
 So people who sort of debuted on it

985
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,640
 include Sir Ben Kingsley.

986
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,600
 He was a Coronation Street actor.

987
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,440
 Yeah, Davy Jones of the Monkeys.

988
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,520
 He came out of Coronation Street.

989
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,680
 He had a little role in that.

990
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,000
 And so did Joanna Lumley.

991
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,760
 So, you know, yeah, the soaps are responsible

992
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,040
 for some of our biggest highbrow actors as well,

993
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,240
 Kingsley and Lumley.

994
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,160
 - Yeah, Davy Jones, he doesn't slot into that category.

995
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,000
 - Not quite.

996
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,160
 - He's the wild card.

997
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,960
 - You can be promoted on soap operas.

998
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,160
 So I really like this.

999
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,720
 So there's a guy, there's an actor called Bill Tarny,

1000
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,880
 who is very famous in soap world.

1001
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,320
 He played Jack Duckworth, right?

1002
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,560
 And he started out, he's Corrie, isn't he?

1003
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

1004
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,040
 - He started out as an extra.

1005
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,640
 And his job was to play someone who was just out of shot.

1006
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,480
 - What?

1007
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,680
 (all laughing)

1008
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,520
 - You occasionally would see--

1009
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,800
 - Is he playing the doggen?

1010
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,640
 - You'd see one of his arms briefly

1011
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,800
 and occasionally in a shot.

1012
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,320
 But you would never see anything else of him.

1013
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,160
 That was his role.

1014
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,000
 - Oh, come on.

1015
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,840
 - And then, he's true.

1016
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,360
 That was what he was initially cast as,

1017
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,160
 was just someone else to show the someone else in the room.

1018
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,360
 - Did he have a really attractive arm or something?

1019
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,040
 - He must have, because when he was promoted,

1020
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,560
 he then spent 31 years as a full body actor,

1021
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,480
 as they're known in the biz.

1022
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,040
 And yeah, that's a pleasing thing,

1023
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,520
 the pleasing career progression.

1024
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,960
 - So he was supposed to be just out of shot.

1025
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,440
 So it was the idea that he's someone

1026
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,840
 for the other actors who are in shot to sort of look at.

1027
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
 So it's realistic that--

1028
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,400
 - I think in a crowd scene with a pub or whatever,

1029
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
 you don't just have two people sitting there

1030
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,640
 and you have to imagine that there's everyone else in the pub.

1031
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,440
 You know, you have maybe an establishing shot

1032
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,600
 and then maybe you're next to someone at the pub,

1033
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,920
 so your arms up against theirs.

1034
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,040
 So you occasionally see his arm.

1035
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,400
 - But then he's in shot.

1036
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,800
 - Okay, his job was to be predominantly

1037
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
 and almost always out of shot.

1038
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,440
 - But then actually, when he got the main role

1039
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,560
 as Jack Duckworth, whenever he walked into a room,

1040
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,600
 you would see his arm come in first.

1041
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,240
 (all laughing)

1042
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,360
 - Here's Jack Duckworth, what he'll have to say.

1043
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,960
 - Well, it's that sexy move that I think people do it

1044
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,520
 in like some musicals in Chicago or something.

1045
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,880
 A woman in fishnet tights would project her leg in first

1046
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,920
 and then her body would follow.

1047
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,040
 Does he enter like that?

1048
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,160
 - Yeah, that's exactly how he does it.

1049
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,360
 He's always wearing a very nice watch.

1050
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
 (all laughing)

1051
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,940
 (upbeat music)

1052
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,600
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1053
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,040
 That is Anna.

1054
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,200
 My fact this week is that if you take an hour long nap

1055
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,360
 after listening to this show,

1056
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,920
 you will remember five times as many facts from it.

1057
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,240
 - Wow.

1058
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,080
 - So do it.

1059
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,900
 - Cool.

1060
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,120
 - So five times more than we said on the show

1061
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,080
 or where are these extra facts coming from?

1062
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,320
 - Not everyone remembers every single fact

1063
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,960
 as well you should know on this podcast.

1064
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,680
 (all laughing)

1065
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,200
 - Yes, five times as many as if you don't take a nap.

1066
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,040
 - Yeah.

1067
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,280
 - So this, I really loved an app.

1068
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,400
 So I really enjoyed reading about this study

1069
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
 and generally a lot of studies that have come out

1070
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,800
 in the last couple of decades about how napping is great.

1071
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
 This one was from 2015.

1072
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,560
 It was quite a small cohort,

1073
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,160
 but basically it gave participants 90 words to remember

1074
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,200
 and then 120 word pairs.

1075
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
 So that's two random words paired together.

1076
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,160
 And so like milk taxi is the example they give in the study.

1077
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,000
 - Is that random?

1078
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,360
 - And, sorry?

1079
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,200
 - Is that random?

1080
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,600
 - Milk taxi, you could make a link there.

1081
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,720
 - Yeah, well, I mean, there is of course the milk taxi

1082
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,480
 that follows the teapot one around.

1083
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,440
 (all laughing)

1084
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,400
 - In all subsequent studies,

1085
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,280
 they're gonna have to remove that word pair now.

1086
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,680
 We've ruined it for people.

1087
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,240
 'Cause yeah, they have to be so unrelated

1088
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,040
 that you can't have a familiar connection,

1089
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,840
 which sort of allows you to cheat and remember it.

1090
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,400
 Anyway, they gave these 120 word pairs to people

1091
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,440
 and then half the participants had to watch DVDs

1092
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,440
 and the other half took naps for,

1093
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,000
 it was an hour and a half in fact.

1094
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,040
 And the nappers afterwards were five times better,

1095
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,440
 remembering the word pairs

1096
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,520
 than the ones who'd watched the DVD.

1097
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,920
 And in fact, I find this astonishing,

1098
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,560
 the people who'd had the nap remembered exactly as much

1099
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,440
 as they would have if they'd just been asked

1100
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,560
 immediately afterwards.

1101
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,320
 So you know how, you know,

1102
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,920
 as soon as a couple of hours have passed,

1103
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,680
 then you forget the majority of stuff

1104
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,840
 that you've immediately heard.

1105
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,080
 They remembered exactly the same amount

1106
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,400
 as if they'd just been asked.

1107
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,840
 - I wonder if, so, Finella has a laptop

1108
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,320
 that she was given by work

1109
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,640
 and it was formatted by the people at her work

1110
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,640
 and the password to log into the computer is catbus111.

1111
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,920
 I can say that it's lockdown.

1112
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,840
 No one's taking her computer, it's fine.

1113
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,360
 But immediately both of us went catbus.

1114
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,720
 What the hell is a catbus?

1115
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,320
 Why would you ever use catbus?

1116
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,240
 And both of us have never forgotten it.

1117
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,640
 Like the conversation and the pairing of it

1118
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,440
 was just so bizarre that it's a connection

1119
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,280
 that's stuck in your head.

1120
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,080
 - Also another thing that's interesting, Dad,

1121
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,680
 is now everyone listening to this will never forget it.

1122
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
 So when we are out of lockdown

1123
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,720
 in the not too distant future, we hope

1124
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,240
 that everyone will be able to steal your wife's laptop.

1125
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,040
 - I'll change it after this episode.

1126
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,600
 I'll reset the password.

1127
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,440
 - Try buscat, everyone.

1128
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,120
 - Two, two, two.

1129
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,400
 - My password is coolguy123

1130
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,960
 because no one's ever caught me that.

1131
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,520
 - Two totally unassociated concepts.

1132
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,800
 That's what you need.

1133
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,800
 I quite like this study also

1134
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,560
 because of the choice of DVDs that the participants were given.

1135
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,560
 So, like I said, some got to go to sleep,

1136
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,960
 some had to watch these DVDs.

1137
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,400
 And it was two DVDs that lasted in total two hours.

1138
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,080
 One was called "Relaxing the Most Beautiful Landscapes on Earth."

1139
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,480
 And it was just what it sounds like.

1140
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,680
 And both had only instrumental music.

1141
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,360
 And the other is called "Power Catzy."

1142
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,640
 And it sounds like the maddest thing ever.

1143
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,680
 So it's only instrumental.

1144
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,800
 And it's this weird experimental film made in the 80s

1145
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,080
 about the conflict in third world countries

1146
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,680
 between traditional ways of life

1147
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,120
 and the new ways of life introduced with industrialization

1148
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,960
 but all shown in very surrealist instrumental form.

1149
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,440
 And so I'm kind of amazed that they managed to stay awake

1150
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,840
 through that two hours.

1151
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,960
 - So yeah, I wonder if the study is about

1152
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,400
 how good it is to nap to remember things

1153
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,400
 or whether watching weird DVDs just really distract you.

1154
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,000
 It could be that, couldn't it?

1155
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,720
 If the DVD had been something else,

1156
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,240
 like "Stop All My Mommles Shoots"

1157
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,520
 or "Growing Ups 2" or something like that.

1158
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,120
 - "Stop All My Mommles Shoots."

1159
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,320
 I think that's the second time you've ever referenced

1160
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,640
 that extremely obscure Sylvester Stallone movie.

1161
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,800
 - We finally found the only film James has actually seen.

1162
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,120
 - I just watched it again and again and again.

1163
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,200
 And you guys know my memory for facts is extremely good.

1164
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,240
 So maybe if we'd given these guys

1165
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,080
 "Stop All My Mommles Shoots" to watch.

1166
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,880
 - To be fair, if that had been the first film you'd seen,

1167
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,720
 I could understand why you didn't watch any other film

1168
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,000
 James had put a few years ago.

1169
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,080
 Because there's no point.

1170
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,800
 You know, why climb any other mountains

1171
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,920
 when you started with Everest?

1172
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,760
 You know?

1173
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,400
 - Exactly.

1174
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,640
 By the way, I looked up

1175
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,520
 whether there was such thing as a milk taxi.

1176
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,400
 I don't know if any of the rest of you did.

1177
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,240
 And this is a new product.

1178
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,280
 Well, actually it was made in 2005

1179
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,640
 by a company called Holm and Lau.

1180
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,480
 And they revolutionized bucket feeding for calves

1181
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,880
 by the invention of the milk taxi.

1182
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,440
 And it's almost like a bucket

1183
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
 that kind of drives around the farm

1184
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,280
 and goes to the calves

1185
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,520
 and gives them exactly the right amount of feed

1186
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,120
 and exactly the right amount of milk that they need.

1187
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,200
 It's a bit like a tea's made, but for cows.

1188
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,040
 - Wow.

1189
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,920
 - Is it like a robotic udder though?

1190
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,600
 Because obviously they want an udder to suck a lad.

1191
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,360
 - I couldn't quite tell from the picture.

1192
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,560
 They look more like milk churns on wheels,

1193
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,480
 but I couldn't quite tell.

1194
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,320
 But it is a thing.

1195
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,560
 So, you know.

1196
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,400
 - Wow.

1197
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,520
 - You could call it a tits made

1198
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,160
 because it's flying around, keeping your milk.

1199
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,440
 - Yeah.

1200
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,480
 - God, how bizarre.

1201
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,160
 - Speaking of weird portmanteau words

1202
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,800
 that I already regret saying.

1203
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,480
 Have you guys heard of the napatino?

1204
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,200
 I'm sure you have in the course of this research.

1205
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,240
 - Napatino, what's that?

1206
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,320
 - I haven't actually.

1207
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,240
 I can guess what it is,

1208
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,120
 but also it sounds too much like the word nappy

1209
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,000
 and would put me off.

1210
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
 - It's a practice, it's a habit, it's a behavior.

1211
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,240
 It's where you drink a coffee and then you have a nap.

1212
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,400
 And you have to take a brief nap

1213
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,800
 because then you wake up super charged

1214
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
 just as you come out of the sleep, the caffeine hits.

1215
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
 It takes about 20 minutes.

1216
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,360
 - That's quite advanced, I think,

1217
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,160
 'cause I'm a bit of a napper as well.

1218
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,720
 And I did read about the idea of having a coffee first

1219
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,840
 and I tried it a few times,

1220
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,360
 but if you can't get straight to sleep,

1221
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,840
 then the caffeine hits you

1222
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,800
 just as you think you're about to fall asleep

1223
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,960
 and you just have a massive high

1224
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,040
 and you can't sleep anymore.

1225
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,880
 So I think you need to be--

1226
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,720
 - Must be tense.

1227
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,000
 - Yeah, you need to be one of the nappers

1228
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,560
 who can really kind of just go like a light immediately,

1229
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,880
 whereas I'm not really one of those.

1230
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,400
 It takes me a few minutes to get in.

1231
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,680
 - I've always thought that my dad invented that

1232
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,000
 'cause I know, so I've read about that concept before,

1233
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,880
 but he always did it at car journeys when we were kids.

1234
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,160
 You'd stop in a service station, down a double espresso,

1235
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,000
 and then he was one of these--

1236
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,640
 - And then fall asleep when driving home.

1237
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,480
 - Back by the wheel.

1238
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,520
 (laughing)

1239
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,360
 - Look, you're parked.

1240
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,320
 It's actually incredibly boring for four children in the back.

1241
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,280
 You're in a parked car for 15 minutes,

1242
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,400
 but it's just 15 solid minutes.

1243
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
 Wake up, and it's like, you know, your new woman.

1244
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,200
 - Did it work?

1245
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,600
 - It worked like a dream, he claimed,

1246
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,000
 but I'm with James.

1247
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,960
 I don't think I could fall asleep like that on command,

1248
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,160
 and then it's just annoying.

1249
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,160
 - I can't, I think I could do that,

1250
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,760
 but I don't drink coffee, so it's wasted.

1251
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,560
 - One way that I nap quite probably once a week

1252
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,240
 is this is a good way of getting to sleep

1253
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,640
 is 'cause I edit this podcast every week,

1254
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,440
 I have to then listen back to it

1255
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,760
 to kind of make sure that narratively

1256
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,720
 it all makes sense from start to finish.

1257
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,000
 And I think a good way to do that

1258
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,240
 is kind of lie down in bed while I'm listening to it.

1259
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,720
 And I usually get past about one fact,

1260
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,680
 and then I'm gone, (laughing)

1261
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,400
 and then I have to go all the way back to the start

1262
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,240
 and do it again.

1263
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,800
 But I think like nothing to podcast is a thing, isn't it?

1264
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,080
 And I read an article about this.

1265
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,640
 This was a guy called Craig Richard

1266
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,920
 from Shenandoah University.

1267
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,560
 He wrote a book called Brain Tingles,

1268
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,320
 which is about ASMR stuff.

1269
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,560
 And he said that human voice podcasts

1270
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,200
 are quite a good way of getting to sleep

1271
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,200
 as long as they contain a calm host voice, kindness,

1272
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
 which means basically you're not just having

1273
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,760
 to go at people all the time,

1274
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,320
 and generally banal content.

1275
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,880
 That's the things that you need. (laughing)

1276
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,080
 - Well, at least we've got one out of three.

1277
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,760
 (laughing)

1278
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,200
 We're not kind and Dan's always stressed, but.

1279
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,120
 (laughing)

1280
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,640
 - Hey, do you guys know where you are allowed

1281
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,720
 to nap at the wheel?

1282
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,040
 (laughing)

1283
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,280
 - Driverless car.

1284
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,120
 - Oh, yeah.

1285
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,240
 - No, no, you're definitely not allowed to.

1286
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,080
 - Okay, definitely not.

1287
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,280
 - Oh, you're not, okay.

1288
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,120
 - So some kind of wheel, a ship's wheel.

1289
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,640
 - Ship's wheel, possibly.

1290
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,200
 I didn't actually look through all the possibilities.

1291
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,720
 - Maybe at the roulette table.

1292
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,800
 - Oh, yes.

1293
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,000
 - Fairly nice. - Wake up refreshed.

1294
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,320
 - Put it all on number 17.

1295
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,120
 - Yeah, wake up three hours later

1296
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,680
 and it's landed on 17, 200 times,

1297
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,960
 and you own all the money in the world.

1298
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,480
 - Bad gambling advice, we know that thing is a fish.

1299
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,800
 Is it a water wheel?

1300
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,480
 Wake up and you've got a loaf of bread made.

1301
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,840
 - Oh, Dan, Dan, Dan, Potter's wheel.

1302
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,040
 So you have hands there and then you just drop off,

1303
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,640
 but you've made a perfect vase.

1304
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,880
 - A perfect cubicle teapot.

1305
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,400
 - Nope.

1306
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,240
 - No, okay.

1307
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,640
 - Please put us out of our misery for God's sake.

1308
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,480
 - Oh, no, no, there are more.

1309
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,640
 - I'm trying, I'm trying.

1310
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,760
 (laughing)

1311
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,120
 Christ's sake, drive in five minutes.

1312
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,040
 - Go on, Andy.

1313
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,200
 I didn't have anything, I was just stalling

1314
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,520
 so James could think of another wheel.

1315
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,880
 - I know, I'm thinking the wheel of fortune,

1316
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,240
 the TV game show.

1317
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,800
 - It's not that either,

1318
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,440
 it is in the cockpit as a pilot at the wheel of a plane.

1319
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,600
 - There's no wheel at a plane?

1320
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,440
 Come on, how are we supposed to guess that?

1321
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,360
 - Well, you're at the wheel, you're at the wheel,

1322
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,320
 like you said that you're at the wheel.

1323
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,400
 - But wait a second, we've talked about this before,

1324
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,240
 pilots sleeping before, and it's a problem.

1325
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,120
 They're definitely not allowed to do it, aren't they?

1326
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,640
 - Well, so, they're not really,

1327
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,480
 'cause there have been some horrible incidences,

1328
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,000
 like for example, in 2008,

1329
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,960
 both pilots fell asleep at the wheel,

1330
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,800
 and when they woke up,

1331
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,040
 they just completely gone past

1332
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,840
 where they were meant to land in Hawaii.

1333
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,000
 Just like, where are we?

1334
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,840
 Way past where we're meant to be.

1335
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,560
 But some countries, like Canada and Australia,

1336
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,800
 allow for pilots to take naps in the cockpit.

1337
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,640
 So basically, it's really strict rules,

1338
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,600
 but what they call it is a controlled rest in position,

1339
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,960
 C-R-I-P, and the idea is that the pilot can sleep

1340
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,200
 for no more than 40 minutes,

1341
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,720
 must wake up at least half an hour

1342
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,880
 before the descent of landing,

1343
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,600
 and they have to sort of tell everyone,

1344
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,840
 like, I'm gonna have a nap now,

1345
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,200
 and then they can go down for a nap,

1346
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,640
 sitting in their position without worry

1347
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,320
 that they might affect the controls,

1348
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,280
 as long as obviously they have a co-pilot next to them.

1349
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,120
 So yeah. - Okay.

1350
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,360
 - Wow, controlled rest in position,

1351
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,400
 that's a very good euphemism for saying,

1352
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,360
 having a little sis while you're at your seat, it's clever.

1353
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

1354
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,640
 - There is another place where you used to be able

1355
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,880
 and able to have a nap and no one would mind or object,

1356
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,800
 and that was in the House of Lords in the UK.

1357
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,080
 So there was a convention until 2018, I believe,

1358
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,880
 in the House of Lords that peers,

1359
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,320
 members of the House of Lords are never sleeping,

1360
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,480
 they are resting their eyes and they're closing their eyes

1361
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,840
 and leaning back to really focus on the intellectual debate

1362
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,800
 and the laws that they're debating.

1363
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,640
 And then that was a lovely convention.

1364
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,440
 And then in 2018, they were told off for sleeping

1365
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,120
 in the chamber and kind of burst the bubble.

1366
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,960
 - And then in 2019, they all ripped their eyelids off,

1367
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,800
 didn't they?

1368
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,200
 (laughing)

1369
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,040
 - That's right.

1370
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,560
 - Did Buddha never have eyelids for the rest of his life?

1371
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,360
 Sorry, I've been thinking about this ever since he said it.

1372
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,080
 (laughing)

1373
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,600
 - They must have grown back, eh?

1374
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,640
 - Did they grow back?

1375
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,080
 - It's a really good point, Dan.

1376
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,400
 I don't think the myth says, but it should.

1377
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,000
 - But Buddha had all sorts of weird physical attributes

1378
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,560
 that I think we've discussed before, didn't he?

1379
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,920
 Like tentacles coming out of his earlobes or whatever.

1380
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,680
 I can't remember, you'll have to refer back.

1381
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,160
 Yeah, exactly. - Super long tongue.

1382
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,160
 - If they would have grown back,

1383
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,400
 then that kind of defeats the gesture that he made.

1384
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,040
 If he's just got another pair of eyelids under there,

1385
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,120
 then I think that's a less impressive gesture

1386
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,960
 to repent you falling asleep in your work.

1387
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,440
 - He probably didn't know he did at the time though.

1388
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,880
 When you do it for the first time, you can't be sure.

1389
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,720
 - That's true.

1390
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,000
 - I'll respect him for it.

1391
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,400
 - The snooker player, Ronnie O'Sullivan,

1392
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,800
 he has been seen napping even during competitive matches.

1393
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,640
 - Yeah, he does.

1394
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,080
 - And he said his doctor advised him to do it.

1395
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,640
 But I really like this because obviously the nap in snooker

1396
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,760
 is the direction of the cloth, isn't it?

1397
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,600
 - Yeah.

1398
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,440
 - The bays.

1399
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,760
 So that's kind of pleasing.

1400
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,920
 - A lot of the other players think that he is doing it

1401
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,480
 to try and out psych them.

1402
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,440
 It's like, 'cause when you play snooker,

1403
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,440
 you're on the table or they're on the table.

1404
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,400
 And when they're playing,

1405
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,720
 you're just kind of sat in your chair

1406
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,120
 and there's nothing you can do.

1407
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,200
 But if you're sat there pretending to fall asleep

1408
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,720
 and put in a flannel of your face like he does sometimes,

1409
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,640
 then some people think that that's a bit bad form.

1410
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,480
 You know what I mean?

1411
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,560
 - Well, get a nap on what you can.

1412
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,400
 It's the perfect chance.

1413
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,840
 It's fucking boring snooker.

1414
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,800
 And he knows it, so you might as well have a snooze.

1415
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,520
 - Okay, that's it.

1416
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,480
 That is all of our facts.

1417
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
