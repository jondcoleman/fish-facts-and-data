00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.000
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.080
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.120
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.320
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.360
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.720
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.040
 Now, once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.840
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that US Marines

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.320
 are considered to be so stupid

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
 that members of the other armed forces

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.760
 called them crayon eaters.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.880
 This year, a Marine has invented an actual edible crayon.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.540
 Now, does that prove the Marines are not stupid?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.380
 - I think so.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.520
 - Or does it prove that they are,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 and that they haven't understood the joke?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000
 - This guy, he's invented something.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.640
 So that makes you smart, doesn't it?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.480
 - Yeah.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.300
 - Does it draw?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.140
 It actually draws like a crayon.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.800
 It's not just an edible stick.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.880
 - Of course it does draw.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 - He might have just taken a pepper army

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160
 and shoved a nib in it.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.120
 Does that count as a crayon, a pepper army?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.200
 I mean, I suppose if you smeared it on the wall,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 you could get some kind of drawing out of it.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440
 (laughing)

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.040
 No, so this is a guy called Frank Manto,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.920
 and it was both him and his business partner

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 who's called Cassandra Gordon.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.480
 And they decided in 2017,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 having heard of this thing about being called crayon eaters,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.320
 that they would decide to come up with a edible crayon.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.080
 And they've got these things called crayons ready to eat,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.440
 and they taste like delicious vanilla flavored chocolate.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.600
 And anyone can eat them.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.000
 Don't give them to your pets,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.560
 'cause I think they have some chocolate in them,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.480
 and pets aren't allowed to chocolate.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.680
 And actually this guy called Frank Manto,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 he was using some crayons to color in a project once

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.280
 when he was at a high school.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.760
 And not when he was at high school,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.600
 he was kind of--

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.440
 - I was gonna say,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.320
 I mean he's got a lot of Marines reputation here.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.120
 - And what happened was he put a crayon in his mouth,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.560
 like to kind of, because he only had two hands

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.920
 and he needed to hold one, so he put it in his mouth.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.040
 And that was when he realized, wait a minute,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 are there any edible crayons, actually?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.920
 And so then he got in touch with this lady called Cassandra,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.240
 who's a pastry chef, and she helped design this new product.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.960
 - I bet that when he put the crayon in his mouth,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.840
 immediately a Marines recruiting officer

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.960
 took Cassandra out the door and said,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.600
 you, you're the kind of guy we need.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 (laughing)

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.560
 - So they're currently trying to crowdfund the crayons

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.720
 in order to go out these new edible crayons.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.200
 So if anyone wants to check it out,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.840
 it's crayonsreadytoeat.com,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.720
 and they're looking to get $75,000.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.120
 At the moment, they've got $5,750 as of recording,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.760
 but you can go to their shop and buy a t-shirt.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.480
 So that is available right now.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.080
 - Is it an edible t-shirt?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.200
 - It is not an edible t-shirt.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.680
 (laughing)

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.440
 - It would be a real shame if today,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.920
 the day that we are doing a comic relief marathon,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.560
 asking people to donate money to the best causes in the world,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.560
 if actually all of their funds were redirected

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.120
 to fund this edible crayon.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.460
 (laughing)

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.760
 - I just wanna say, if you have to choose one,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.800
 just think really carefully.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.960
 - Okay, look, comic relief for trying to feed the world,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.800
 don't they, huh?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.120
 Better to do that than to send a lot of edible crayons

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.960
 everywhere.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.400
 (laughing)

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.600
 - James, is it a pun on meals ready to eat?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.800
 'Cause that's what they call their US military supplies,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.640
 isn't it, MREs?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.800
 That's the kind of-

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.640
 - It is.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.160
 - The meal rations you get in the field.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.760
 - To be honest, I didn't know about that,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.560
 but now you said it, I mean, it definitely is, isn't it?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.400
 - Must be, yeah.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 It's even in the same packaging style, Andy.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.420
 So it's like a ground bag, yeah.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.940
 It's got the font on it.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.100
 - And it's the idea that they'd be given

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.340
 to children or to Marines,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.260
 because obviously children tend to use crayons more,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 but Marines might need emergency supplies in the field.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.700
 - They're not supposed to be emergency supplies,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.540
 I don't think.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.820
 I don't think you replace them with the usual crayons

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.380
 that Marines take in the field.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.460
 (laughing)

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.860
 - It's very boring, a lot of it is waiting around,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.740
 but they've got to have something to entertain them.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.780
 - Yeah, it's a funny product, like a-

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.620
 - I like it.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.460
 - Okay, I love it.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.040
 - It's an annual face to the abusers, right?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.880
 To the insiders.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.640
 - Yeah, exactly, why do they call Marines crayon eaters?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.680
 It's like, this is quite a new thing.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.040
 The interview with Frank Manto that I saw,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.720
 he said that when he was in the Marine Corps,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.040
 they never called them crayon eaters.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.040
 That was until 2002.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.880
 They said they were known as jar heads, grunts,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.360
 ground pounders, bullet sponges,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 but they were never known as crayon eaters.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.520
 And I can only think, looking at those dates,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.040
 that it's due to Ralph from The Simpsons,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.260
 who was a regular crayon eater,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.140
 and famously supposed to be a bit dumb

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.020
 that they must have taken that, it must be.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.220
 - You're so right, yeah.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.420
 There was a blog from another Marine

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.660
 about that nickname, Railing Against It,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.140
 not 'cause it's insulting, but because it's just so shit.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.060
 And I couldn't tell if it was like

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.460
 the Lady Doth Protest too much,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.220
 but it started out him saying,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.920
 you know, we always make fun of each other in the military,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.580
 so we call the Air Force, the Chair Force, very funny.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.880
 Coast Guard are puddle pirates.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.280
 The list goes on, apparently, but he didn't.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.620
 He didn't.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.520
 But then he said that crayon eaters is just super lame.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.560
 Do you think that something as lame as crayon eater

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.040
 is gonna offend a member of a tribe

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.400
 whose trainees are taught to yell kill during training?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.540
 - Yeah, well, he makes a point.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.600
 - Well, he makes a point, but I think like you say,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.880
 he makes it a bit too strongly, doesn't he?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.480
 - The article is very, very funny.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.720
 Just a couple of extracts, it's bullet point.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.860
 It's like point one, first off, it's just kind of weak.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.220
 Maybe we're just too dumb to understand the insult here,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.860
 but quite frankly, it sucks, it's lame.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.460
 It's no better than a kindergarten insult.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.380
 You might as well say, you poop your pants,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.060
 at least there's some truth to that for the Marines.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.900
 I mean, it's really--

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.340
 - I mean, that seems to be a self, oh, there, doesn't it?

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.860
 At least we shit ourselves.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.620
 - Should we be calling them punts poopers instead?

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.380
 - You're right, he's shot himself in the foot

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.660
 with that article, it's just more ammunition.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.960
 He shot himself in the pants.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.160
 - It doesn't seem like they had a tremendous reputation

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.320
 before if they were known as jarheads, grunts,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.280
 and bullets bungers.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.000
 It's not as though the fine nickname they had before

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.480
 has taken a backer.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.360
 - I reckon they probably like ground pounders

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.840
 'cause that implies running, you know,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.160
 you know, strong runners, maybe.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.000
 - That's true.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.480
 - Bullet bungers makes you sound pretty damn hardcore.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.320
 - Yeah.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.440
 - Yes, that's true.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.280
 - I guess so.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.360
 - Or more like just people who have disposable in war.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.800
 - That's what it sounds like to me.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.640
 - It sounds other.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.480
 - Yeah.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.680
 (laughing)

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.340
 - Do you know, if you have chewed off a bunch of crayon,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.600
 but you've left some over, do you know what those are called?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.960
 Those tiny little bits at the end that are sort of useless?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.280
 - No, I don't know that.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.920
 - They're called left-olars.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.960
 - Left-olars.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.100
 - Yeah, left-olars are very important

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.760
 because they can be collected and remoulded

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.920
 into new crayons, and that's a project

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.420
 that a guy called Brian Ware was doing.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.080
 So for hospitals in the US, he would collect

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.780
 all the endings, all those tiny little bits at the end,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.180
 and he has a new mold, and he would pour it in,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.660
 he would melt it up, and he would remould crayons,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.040
 and they go to hospitals for free.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.880
 So that's pretty cool.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.520
 - God, I mean, I know hospital food is shit generally,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.040
 but that is a bit beyond the pale, isn't it?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.760
 That's their offering.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.560
 - What was the name of that, the little end bits done?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.400
 Did you say?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.240
 - Left-olars.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.280
 - Left-olars, and that probably comes

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.520
 from the ola of crayola, right?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.360
 - That's right.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.360
 - So the name crayola, right?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.520
 I think this is amazing.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.160
 The etymology of this word, it's so ridiculous.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.500
 It was coined by Alice Binney,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.220
 who was the wife of Edwin Binney.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.580
 These two people kind of started the crayola company,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.740
 and she got the word from the French word cray,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.500
 meaning a stick of chalk,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.180
 and the English word oleaginous, meaning oily.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.620
 So it means oily chalk, but I just love that.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.380
 I mean, oleaginous is such an unusual word

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.260
 to just think, well, I'm gonna make a kid's plaything

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.100
 out of this word.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.220
 - It's a stupid name.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.400
 It's neither chalk nor oily, and in fact,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.120
 the whole point of crayons, crayola crayons,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.520
 is that it was the first type of crayon to not use oil.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.040
 It used wax instead.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.080
 So it does seem bizarre to me to then give it the oil name.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.960
 - It's not oleaginous.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.020
 - Well, exactly.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.520
 - But the Binney family in general,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.200
 they made, obviously they made millions out of crayons,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200
 and the really nice thing is what the money was spent on,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.120
 because in 1986, the San Diego Museum of Art

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.280
 got a world-class collection of art bequeathed to them,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.400
 and that was the result of the Binney family millions.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.740
 I think it was Edwin Binney III, who must have been,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.880
 I guess, grandson of the original Edwin Binney,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.160
 he had bought this wonderful art collection.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.460
 So crayons paid for a world-class art collection,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.500
 which I think is a very nice--

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.440
 - That's all the arts are made of crayons, so.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.640
 - Yeah, it was only crayon art.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.780
 It was really, no, I can't remember exactly what was in it,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.640
 but it was really good stuff.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.800
 - Although people used to paint with proper crayons.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.640
 - That's right, yeah.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.200
 Would you know 2012, up until 2012,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.280
 the most expensive painting ever sold at auction

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.540
 was done by crayon, or rather pastels,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.160
 but you know, the same thing really.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.660
 I know there's an oil and wax slight difference to it,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.500
 but--

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.420
 - Yeah, and also reputationally,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.440
 if you say I've done a lovely pastel drawing,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.320
 then people think, oh, you must really know what you're doing.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.080
 If you say I've done a lovely crayon piece,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.960
 they think, five.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.520
 - Interesting though, fruit pastels,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.440
 began as a painting tool that tasted like fruit.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.700
 - Oh, God, poor guy, it's already been invented.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.000
 We should tell him, mate, they've done it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.320
 The fruit pastels.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.720
 The painting, by the way, was "The Scream" by Edvard Munch.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.040
 - Oh, yeah.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.420
 - He did one, yeah, 'cause he did a bunch of versions

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.480
 of "The Scream" and one of them was on cardboard,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.560
 and it was done with these crayon-y pastels,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.040
 and that sold for something like 119 million at the time.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.920
 It's now 23rd in the list

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.720
 of the most expensive pieces of art

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.240
 that have ever been sold with a da Vinci right at the top.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.400
 But yeah.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.480
 - And also his name, Edvard Munch,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.000
 comes from the fact that he used to eat his drawing equipment

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.440
 as soon as he was done, didn't he?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.640
 - Yeah.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.800
 - Crayola Vigurd at PR, I would say,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.880
 as a company, when then latest new color,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.240
 "Blootiful" came to be.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.480
 The company said it beat four other finalists,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.120
 so the other finalists were, "Dreams come blue,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.280
 "blue moon bliss, reach for the stars,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.800
 "star-spangled blue," they're the four that it beat.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.440
 And they said that the company chose "Blootiful"

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.160
 from over 90,000 unique submissions.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.200
 Someone read through 90,000 names,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.680
 and then there were 400,000 votes to decide the winner.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.920
 - It's insane that you could have 90,000 unique names

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.720
 when the public have no ability

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.200
 to think of anything new, do they?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.240
 Basically, if they've got 90,000 unique ones,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.080
 then think of all the people who said "bluey blue face,"

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.680
 and add that to that number, and you're in the millions.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.360
 - So I think they can't have meant unique names.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.400
 They must have meant unique submissions from people.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.440
 Some people must have been coming up with the same ones.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.480
 - They must have been.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.920
 - There aren't 90,000 sounds in the world.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.160
 (laughing)

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.960
 - But yeah, there's not 90,000 puns with the word "blue,"

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.440
 and that's for sure.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.920
 - Even you couldn't generate.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.440
 - No, but they probably just had people just sausage stick,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.840
 you know, it's probably just random submissions.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.840
 - 90,000 is a lot of people.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.320
 That's really so many to be part of the base name.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.160
 - It's kids, isn't it?

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.600
 It'd be schools that they're all submitting

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.840
 around America, I think it is.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.680
 - But it's crazy.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.560
 I was looking through, I read this amazing site

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.680
 that I wanna give a shout out to,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.520
 which is Jenny's crayon collection site,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.760
 and a woman called Jenny has gone through and cataloged

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.520
 every single crayon that's ever been and ever been retired.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.800
 I read through all the colors, obviously,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.640
 and they prioritized bizarre things.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.720
 So the initial ones are really obvious,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.400
 like red, yellow, blue, brown,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.280
 but by the time you're in the 32 crayon box,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.600
 you're getting Timber Wolf as a color.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.200
 In the 48 box, you've got macaroni and cheese as a color,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.320
 and yet maroon and navy blue,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.600
 you don't get them to the 96 box.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.680
 - Really?

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.880
 Wow, people in the navy must feel very bad about that.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.440
 - Yeah, those puddle pirates.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.080
 So, but one other thing about that,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.240
 the color changes is the famous thing

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.160
 when they changed the flesh color.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.640
 So it used to be that Crayola had this color,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.720
 which was flesh, which was very much the same color

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.640
 as a white person's skin,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.960
 but obviously that is extremely unwoken,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.320
 not the right thing to do.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.760
 And there was a woman called June Handler.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.640
 She was a scientist, and she realized

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.520
 that when she was observing children,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.000
 they would often bully each other,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.360
 like the white kids would bully the non-white kids

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.000
 by saying you don't have any flesh

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.600
 because you don't have the same color skin as this crayon.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.040
 She wrote to Crayola, and Crayola, to their credit,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.400
 very, very quickly changed it, changed the color to peach.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.040
 And now they have a colors of the world crayons

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.040
 where you can, basically it's all the different skin type

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.800
 colors that you can get in one pack.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.920
 It's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.160
 - Yeah, good on you, Crayola.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.000
 Yeah.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.080
 - Oh, good at PR.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.480
 I'm telling you.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.000
 - Did you read the list of internet crayons

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.920
 that Crayola released in the 1990s?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.840
 I mean, it's just the same colors all over again,

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.160
 but they were called things like

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.020
 web surfing blue, circuit board green,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.280
 green dot com, just another green,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.440
 online orange, and my favorite, floppy yellow.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.600
 - Oh, really?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.320
 Floppy yellow, that used to be my nickname at school,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.480
 but I don't know why they called me that

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.480
 'cause I used to ship myself all the time.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.500
 (upbeat music)

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.120
 and that is my fact.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.040
 My fact this week is that the London Metropolitan Police

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.840
 used to have a van called teapot one exclusively

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.080
 to deliver cups of tea to officers stuck

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.400
 at the scene of a crime.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.960
 - Wow, that's awesome.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.440
 - Yeah, so this sadly, I believe that teapot one

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.560
 and it's brother or sister teapot two

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.720
 are now decommissioned tragically,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.840
 they're no longer running,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.720
 and it's a shame because teapot one was this,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.360
 it looked kind of like a burger van that went around,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.840
 but it had also the sort of regalia

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.840
 of a classic police car,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.000
 and on the very front of it,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.680
 written in capitals was teapot one,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.000
 and it would be called for, say example,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.560
 if police were called to an area

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.560
 where they thought maybe a protest was,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.200
 or if there was a big festival

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.640
 and they needed police on standby the whole time,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.040
 this was the catering truck that would come by

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.600
 and top them up with tea,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.080
 there would be other things like coffees

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.200
 and sandwiches and so on,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.600
 but it was known as teapot one.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.240
 - Am I correct in thinking that behind teapot one,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.000
 you would also get the milk motorbike,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.880
 and that would bring the milk in the sidecar.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.080
 - And you have the sugar scooter behind that, didn't you?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.560
 (laughing)

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.400
 - Yeah.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.400
 - Yeah, so it was basically the government privatized

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.760
 the catering of the Met Police after that

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.960
 and put it out to tender.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.760
 So this was the Met Police's own thing that they had,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.680
 but then the government said,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.520
 "No, we'll be able to make it more efficient

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.960
 if we put it out to other companies."

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.120
 - If you ever want an argument against privatization,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.880
 the end of teapot one, is it?

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.000
 - Well, I read one vlog about it where they said,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.120
 "Let's be honest, in the main, the food was shit."

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.640
 But that's not the issue here.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.680
 (laughing)

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.920
 Who else could give you a frozen pork pie,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.960
 a sandwich, an apple, and a cup of hot gray water

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.320
 at four o'clock in the morning and do it all with a smile.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.760
 So it's one of these things where everyone knew

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.440
 it was terrible, but it was their thing,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.400
 and that's why they were upset about it.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.960
 - That is such a shame.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.000
 When teapot was written across the front of it down,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.520
 was it written backwards so that if you were in a car

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.000
 and it was going up with its sirens behind you, you could see?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.520
 - And the siren was the kettle just whistling.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.760
 (laughing)

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.920
 - I think from the photo that I've seen,

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.200
 unless they've reversed the photo,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.000
 it looks like it was a normal reading

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440
 for if you were standing in front of it,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.640
 so the correct way.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.120
 So before teapot one existed officially

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.160
 on the front of a van, it used to just be a call sign.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.560
 So police have all sorts of different call signs

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.240
 for if they need certain types of units to come in.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.200
 So if there's rioting going on

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.600
 and they have a van full of riot police,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.280
 that call sign might be gold or silver,

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.800
 and they would know, okay, we need to send that van in.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.720
 - It's good that they're quite different, isn't it?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.280
 You don't want to accidentally send the tea lady in.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.120
 - Especially, James, if you say, right,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.480
 we need to kettle everybody at this point.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.640
 Get the teapot!

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.680
 (laughing)

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.640
 - So I actually spoke to a former police officer to ask,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.040
 do you know anything about where this came from?

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.200
 And by an astonishing coincidence,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.240
 the person I spoke to is the person

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.520
 who may have generated the call sign teapot one.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.120
 His name is Stephen Colgan, he's a buddy of ours.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.720
 He is a former QIL, he's been on the show before.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.520
 And he told me that at the time when the call sign came out,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.080
 he was an instructor at Met's Telecom and Wireless School.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.880
 And one day, he created a temporary call sign,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.080
 teapot one, for the catering van.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.080
 And it started getting used and started, it got stuck.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.680
 And his colleagues started doing the same.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.760
 And then a second van came, which was teapot two.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.000
 He says it's quite possible

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.480
 that he wasn't the very first to use it,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.400
 but he can't find any instances before

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.840
 where anyone had done that.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.720
 And it was years after he left the police

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.520
 that it became the call sign so much

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.280
 that they eventually turned it into the van itself.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.120
 - Wicked.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.560
 - I was on a Reddit thread,

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.640
 which asked a question that everyone's probably wondering,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.680
 which is, is it appropriate to offer police officers tea

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.160
 or coffee if they're outside on your property?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.360
 Which, so most answers were from American people saying,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.800
 this is the most British question I've ever heard being asked.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.920
 And not only are you offering the police tea,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.000
 but you're asking if that's polite to do it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.680
 But the answer seems to be from various police officers

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.560
 who responded, they love tea, always right to offer.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.440
 Please don't be offended if we turn it down.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.120
 Sometimes we're busy, even if we don't look busy.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.080
 But also there are some instances

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.800
 where it may be considered a bribe.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.200
 And so they are going to be obliged to turn it down.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.560
 - I was told, I was told when I worked in a hotel

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.600
 that when the police came for our regular fights

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.520
 and things that we had to call them for,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.160
 that we weren't allowed to give them tea or biscuits

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.000
 or anything like that.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.320
 We were told we weren't allowed to

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.280
 because it was counted as a bribe.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.520
 And that was by the police.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.000
 But we still would ask them all the time

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.080
 because it's just polite, isn't it?

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.640
 It was like a cup of tea.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.080
 But then probably about half of them would say,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.400
 no, we're not allowed.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.000
 And then the other half would say, oh yeah, go on then.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.520
 And there was one time that I was working behind the bar

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.960
 and there was a massive fight,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.040
 like a really, really massive fight going on.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.940
 And we called the police.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.000
 We kind of put all the shutters down and stuff.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 And then eventually the police came.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.920
 I'll never forget it.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.920
 We gave him a cup of tea and he had like four massive guys

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.060
 who he was kind of corraling out of the building

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.640
 with a cup of tea on the saucer,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.560
 with a biscuit on the saucer all the way through.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.440
 And he didn't spill a single drop.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.400
 It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.200
 - No, that's amazing. - Badass.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.040
 - I did spot that the St. John Ambulance Twitter

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.680
 does say as of 28th of June, 2020,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.640
 that they have a vehicle called the teapot,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.440
 which seems to still be running.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.640
 And that is used to deliver refreshments

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.720
 to hospital staff and medics and volunteers, so on.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.440
 So it is possible that despite the police teapot one

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.720
 being down, we still might have a teapot on the road,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.320
 helping out hospital staff.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.480
 - Thank God, as long as Britain has a teapot vehicle

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.800
 on the road somewhere.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.120
 - Hey, like tea is very important to our country, Anna.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.080
 It's like what we were built on.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.920
 Absolutely.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.280
 - That's like the crows of Tower of London.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.320
 If there's not a teapot van on the streets of London,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.480
 England will fall.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.880
 - In wartime, especially,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.320
 we get very possessive about tea.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.520
 In the Second World War, I don't think we've mentioned that.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.200
 Well, first of all, once the Blitz came,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.680
 all British tea stock was moved out of London.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.720
 And it was dispersed through the country

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.960
 to 500 different locations.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.720
 - Whoa, 500?

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.400
 - That's, you're really making sure.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.800
 They can't get all 500.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.440
 But also in 1942, Britain bought up

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.920
 the world's entire supply of black tea.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.280
 This is how much we realised we needed it

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.360
 to get through the war.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.440
 It was all the tea on the European market.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.800
 And it was largely for the North Africa desert campaigns,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.520
 because apparently all their water

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.560
 was transported in fuel containers.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.920
 So it tasted like oil.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.000
 So the only drink they would drink was tea.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.880
 But yeah, they bought up all the tea, pretty much available.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.080
 - That's so funny. - To Europe.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.440
 The Suffragette movement, tea was very important in that.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.760
 There was a suffragette called Patricia Hall,

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.640
 who once said that the promise of a cup of tea

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.240
 was a great inducement to get women to come to meetings.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.840
 And also a lot of the tea rooms in London

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.880
 was where they would meet.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.400
 So there was one in particular on Oxford Street

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.320
 called Allen's Tea Rooms,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.240
 where a lot of the early suffragette plans got made.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.760
 And this was run by a guy called Allen Liddle.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.120
 But Allen Liddle was actually a pseudonym

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.840
 for the person who actually run it,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.680
 who was called Marguerite Liddle.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.840
 And her middle name was Allen.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.200
 So she called it Allen's Tea Rooms after her middle name,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.680
 'cause she was called Marguerite Allen Liddle.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.120
 And I can't work out whether the Allen

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.080
 as a middle name was fake completely,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.800
 or whether just by coincidence,

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.520
 she had a male-sounding middle name,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.000
 and she could use it for this tea shop.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.920
 But yeah.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.760
 - That's hilarious.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.880
 - Was this sort of like how female authors

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.000
 in the 19th century had to have male pseudonyms?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.240
 Was it like you weren't allowed to establish a tea room

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.640
 unless you were a male?

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.000
 - I think it was like to stop people from worrying

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.960
 that this was a place where women were gonna hang out.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.360
 Because Helen Gordon Liddle was one of the people

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.160
 who went to Marguerite's Tea Room,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.200
 and she was one of the very famous kind of suffragettes

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.480
 who wrote a book about, I think, about force feeding.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.080
 I think it was like the first account of women

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.120
 being force fed in prisons and stuff.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.320
 So yeah.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.480
 - So they went on to found Liddle, didn't they?

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.560
 - Liddle, yeah.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.040
 - Yeah, pretty good.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.160
 Do you guys know who invented tea?

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.040
 - God? - What?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.520
 - So close, so close, it was Buddha.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.400
 Yeah.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.560
 There's an Indian legend that Buddha went to China,

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.800
 and when he was there, he said, right,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.400
 I'm gonna meditate for nine years now, okay?

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.600
 He thought he was in for a long meditation,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.280
 but he fell asleep.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.720
 And when he woke up from his nice sleep,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.280
 halfway through his nine years of meditating,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.600
 he was so annoyed at his own weakness

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.640
 that he cut off his own eyelids,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.480
 and he chucked them on the ground.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.280
 And where they fell, a tree with eyelid-shaped leaves

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.000
 sprang up in its place,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.040
 and that was the first ever tea tree.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.920
 - Oh, wow, I've never heard that.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.360
 - Citation needed, but still, it's a nice story.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360
 - Yeah.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.360
 - Tea pots, original tea pots came from China,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.560
 where tea came from,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.600
 and they became popular in the Ming dynasty,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.840
 but apparently, I read one source that said

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.680
 the Chinese people would carry them around with them

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.560
 and just drink straight from the nozzle,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.760
 which kind of sounds like that.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.400
 - That does make, well, it would burn,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.080
 wouldn't it, if it was too hot?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.400
 I think that's the only thing that stops me from doing it,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.480
 is that I'm worried that I've burned my mouth.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.960
 - Your lips are gonna blister.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.720
 - And was it known as the nozzle back in the day?

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.560
 (laughing)

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.000
 - I'll be honest, in ancient China,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.600
 I don't think they even called it a spout,

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.240
 I mean, they probably had their own word for it.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.080
 - You're right, right.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.080
 - I don't think nozzle is a Mandarin etymology.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.320
 - I read that on a lot of ships,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.840
 so sort of military ships,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.880
 that the tea pots you get there, they are cube shaped.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.840
 - Are they?

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.760
 - Yeah, they're rolling around and stuff.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.840
 - Exactly, yeah, the cube tea pots.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.560
 So it's, yeah, it's just a really cool tea pot shape.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.120
 It's, sorry, cube shape.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.320
 It was invented by a guy called Robert Crawford Johnson.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.720
 And it's still going, like it's a big cube tea pot's limited,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.080
 it's a big thing.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.640
 It's easy for storage as well, 'cause you can pack them up,

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.680
 you know, like those square watermelons that you get.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.240
 - Yeah, but the nozzle's gonna get in the way,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.480
 but I do see that point.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.920
 But it's quite hard to make square ceramics, isn't it?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.000
 It's like, 'cause you have the joints

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.640
 are really, really difficult to make them watertight.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.800
 - Yeah, interestingly, it does not have a nozzle.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.720
 - Which is interesting, which is why you can pack it, yeah.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.560
 - Does it have a handle?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.200
 - It does have a handle, yeah.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.040
 - 'Cause I was gonna say,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.000
 it's like I'm a little cubic tea pot, shorted out.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.480
 I don't have an handle and I don't have a nozzle.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.720
 (laughing)

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.800
 - So it's just, it sounds like they're boxes.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.320
 - Yeah, it's a cardboard box.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.480
 (laughing)

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.080
 - And you write teapot on the side in crayon,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.200
 hung it on the ship, give it to the Marines.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.360
 - They'll know what to do with it.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.880
 (laughing)

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.160
 - Do you know that the oldest petrol station in America

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.520
 is shaped like a teapot?

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.120
 - No.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.800
 - So, this is at least claimed to be

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.360
 the oldest petrol station in the country.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.640
 It's in Zilla, which is in Washington state,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.640
 and it opened in around 1920s, '21, '22, something like that.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.960
 And the reason it's shaped like a teapot

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.080
 is it's based on the teapot dome scandal,

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.640
 which was a bribery scandal

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.960
 during the presidency of Warren Harding.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.200
 And there was an oil field

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.040
 that was known as the teapot dome oil field,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.680
 and someone had been paying to get their hands

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.920
 on this oil field.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.880
 And the teapot dome oil field was named

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.760
 after a teapot-shaped rock,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.400
 which was in the middle of the field.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.240
 (laughing)

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.960
 And then that became the name of the scandal,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.560
 which became the name of the first petrol station.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.560
 - Amazing. - Weird.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.840
 - You wouldn't guess a teapot-shaped petrol station

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.240
 was associated with mass government corruption.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.440
 So that was what it was nodding towards.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.160
 You'd think they probably sell tea.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.000
 - Yeah, they probably built it thinking,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.640
 "Oh, this'll be one in the eye for the government, won't it?"

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.960
 Everyone will see this for hundreds of years,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.240
 and the first thing they'll think

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.640
 is what an arsehole Warren Harding was,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.880
 but actually what everyone thinks is,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.800
 "Oh, that looks like a teapot."

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.560
 - Sorry, do they call the nozzle the spout?

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.560
 - Spout, yeah. (laughing)

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.080
 - I know a completely random thing about Zilla,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.040
 just to chuck in this very small town,

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.640
 which is that they've got a church there,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.520
 the Church of God in Zilla,

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.240
 and they have a giant 10-foot tall T-Rex out the front of it,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.040
 or they used to, which is dubbed

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.640
 and known to the locals as Godzilla.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.040
 - Oh, no way.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.760
 - Yeah, and so it's become an attraction.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.600
 You go and see Godzilla at the Church of God.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.840
 - And what kind of corruption was that a metaphor for?

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.200
 (laughing)

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.840
 It was a lizard selling scandal

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.800
 in the presidency of Taft.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.120
 - It's quite confusing, 'cause Godzilla, am I right,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.920
 is not a T-Rex.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.040
 - Yep, you're raising a very obvious point.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.680
 (laughing)

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.280
 - Outch. - Yeah, very obvious.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.040
 - Fine. - I'm saying what I mean

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.200
 is everyone was thinking it.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.320
 - I speak for the people when I say,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.280
 I wonder what happened to the Teasmaid.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.120
 Does anyone else ever wonder that?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.440
 - Sorry.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.800
 - You know the Teasmaids that our parents reminisce about?

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.880
 - 2016 by the Metropolitan Police

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.160
 when they decided to outsource the--

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.560
 - That's the other--

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.080
 - I don't know what a Teasmaid is.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.800
 - So a Teasmaid was what,

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.080
 it's like a little thing that you have

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.760
 on the side of your bed that not only is the alarm clock,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.400
 but it also makes your cup of tea in the morning.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.960
 - Yeah, it's the thing that makes your tea.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.240
 Everyone sort of had them in the '50s, '60s, '70s.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.960
 - Wow, that's right. - And the first ones

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.800
 were actually in 1891.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.640
 The first one was made.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.520
 It was called the Early Rises Friend.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.280
 And it was basically an alarm clock.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.600
 But apparently in the description of the patent,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.360
 you replace the spring of the clock with cat gut.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.280
 And when the alarm vibrated, the cat gut struck a match.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.240
 So it like pulled a match, it struck against the surface,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.720
 which lit some, you know, a bit of wick,

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.120
 oiled wick, which boiled water.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.400
 And then the boiled water would tip itself

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.400
 into a cup of tea.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.720
 It sounds a little bit like,

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.080
 I don't know if any of you guys ever played Mousetrap

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.600
 as kids, you know, that thing that just never works.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.840
 - Yeah, sounds like an OK Go video.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.680
 It's like a heat-robbing machine or whatever they're called.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.400
 - We've all found a reference that fits us,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.000
 apart from Anna here, so.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.360
 - Anna said Anna had Mousetrap.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.880
 - Mousetrap, Mousetrap. - OK, sorry.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.840
 - Yeah, I don't recall hearing anything from you, Andy.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.360
 You've been particularly silent for references on this one.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.640
 - Oh, dear.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.080
 - Agree with the rest of us, haven't you,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.480
 in this big old reference off.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.280
 (laughing)

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.320
 But anyway, tea's made about a quarter of households

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.360
 had them in the '70s.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.040
 And I've always wanted one.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.960
 And they were ruined according to various articles

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.480
 in the early '90s by Norma Major.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.880
 So, Norma Major in an interview, as in John Major.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.320
 - Can you just say who, yeah, yeah.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.160
 - Sorry, yes.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.000
 Just for international or younger listeners,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.120
 Norma Major was John Major,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.640
 Prime Minister John Major's wife.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.320
 And she said in an interview that her tea's made

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.400
 was the pride and joy of her bedroom

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.400
 and almost immediately sales of tea's made plummeted so far.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.160
 - I've gotta say, that's a bit of a slam on John Major

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.920
 to say that your tea's made is the pride

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.280
 and joy of your bedroom.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.480
 (laughing)

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.200
 - He was normally downstairs enjoying a curry.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.000
 - Hey, good luck getting that one international listener.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.360
 (laughing)

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.320
 - Google it, and then you'll have a good old laugh.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.160
 - It's very funny.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.740
 (upbeat music)

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:02.760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.880
 and that is Andy.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.800
 - My fact is that the ninth longest running

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.400
 British soap ever was designed exclusively to sell soap.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.600
 - Nice.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.720
 - And you mean soap, when I first read this fact,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.520
 I genuinely forgot the other meaning of the word soap.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.200
 So I just thought you meant a bar of soap.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.640
 The ninth longest running bar of soap

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.760
 was designed to sell soap.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.440
 And I thought, of course it bloody was.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.400
 (laughing)

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.960
 - Great point, very good point.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.800
 I do mean a soap opera, yeah.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.640
 So this is a spin-off,

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.080
 'cause last week we were talking about laundry.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.320
 And afterwards, I just,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.320
 I remembered that we'd spoken about Dazz briefly

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.600
 in the recording and I started reading about Dazz.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.120
 And I found out that for 18 years from 2002 to '19,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.320
 inclusive, they had a soap opera,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.320
 which was in advert form, which was about Dazz.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.240
 And they got soap opera stars to be in the Dazz adverts

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.120
 in similar roles to in the actual soaps they were in.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.160
 It's basically, you know, the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.080
 where everyone kind of meets all these characters

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.080
 from all over the place.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.120
 This is like that, 'cause they've got people from Corey,

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.640
 EastEnders, Brookside, Hollyoaks,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.400
 they're all in the same world mingling

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.000
 and interacting with each other.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.320
 It's very much the most ambitious crossover

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.360
 in television history, isn't it?

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.040
 - It is, it absolutely is.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.400
 It's called Cleaner Close.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.800
 - Does it count as a soap opera

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.160
 if it's actually an advert or not?

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.320
 - Well, what a great point, James.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.640
 And what a time to raise it.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.160
 The Wikipedia on it reports that episodes have a character

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.640
 who does not use Dazz, which causes them problems,

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.240
 which are solved by a character who uses Dazz.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.640
 So, I mean, I don't think anyone was waiting,

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.880
 tuning in each week.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.680
 It wasn't like it ran for a thousand episodes or anything.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.040
 - Well, you'd only get like a couple of episodes a year,

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.800
 wouldn't you, 'cause they'd rerun the adverts and stuff.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.320
 But fortunately, I don't think that is the dividing line

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.640
 between soap and non-soap.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.320
 And so I'm claiming that this is long-running soap.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.000
 - And what do they do in the ad breaks of the Dazz soap?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.040
 - They have extremely short ad breaks in those,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.480
 where they actually sell Purcell with another ad.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.880
 - So it's like a little Russian doll of soap operas.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.200
 How come we've never seen this?

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.160
 I've never seen this.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.520
 - I know it quite well, yeah.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.840
 - Yeah, I've never seen it.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.280
 - A lot of people who listen to this podcast

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.800
 will be very familiar with this advertising campaign,

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.760
 or I can clean a close.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.600
 - More people will have known it

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.160
 than will have read Annika Rennerna.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.080
 We're not gonna spoil her either this week, but,

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.920
 but it's really pleasing,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.440
 'cause this is back to the original days of soap operas,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.080
 which were sponsored by soap companies, soap manufacturers.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.920
 The very first ever soap opera, which started in 1930,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.680
 was sponsored by Parmoliv,

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.160
 who wanted ads for their super suds attached.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.040
 And the reasoning was these are for women working at home,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.600
 housewives, and what are they like?

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.840
 Well, they probably like soap.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.920
 So let's try and sell them soap while they listen

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.400
 and are at home.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.040
 - Do you know how Parmoliv got the name just as an aside?

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040
 - No.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.400
 - I think you can guess probably.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.240
 - All right.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.200
 - Was it founded by a woman called Olive,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.440
 who had huge, sweaty palms.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.840
 (laughing)

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840
 Always needed to wash them.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.720
 - Yeah, it's a good guess.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.200
 I reckon the people at home might have worked it out already,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.840
 but the two oils that it was made from

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.960
 were Parmol and Olive Oil.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.320
 - Oh yeah, that makes more sense than the hand thing.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.280
 - Yeah, that makes more sense, I'd like to say.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.040
 Just different, truer.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.240
 - But people hated soaps from the start, right?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.240
 There was never a heyday where soaps were considered

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.040
 a high culture thing.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.560
 They were railed against from that early 1930s.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.400
 They were 15 minutes long and most newspaper articles

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.760
 when they write about them say basically about four to five

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.360
 of those 15 minutes of these blimmin' adverts,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.440
 all of which start with, as you say, Andy,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.760
 ladies, have you tried XYZ?

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.600
 And they were sometimes called washboard weepers.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.840
 That was an alternative name for soaps in the '40s.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.120
 - But I think really it was snobbishness, wasn't it?

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.560
 And also the fact that they were aimed towards women

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.920
 and often made by women.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.160
 So like one of the real first amazing writers

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.040
 for soap operas was someone called Anna Phillips.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.040
 And she was incredibly, incredible writer.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.200
 She wrote two million words a year at her best.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.160
 - And she was often suggesting new colours

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.560
 for the Crayola Company, wasn't she?

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.400
 - Yes.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.720
 - A lot of her were lounges.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.080
 - She invented things like the cliffhanger ending.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.280
 That was her idea.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.440
 But she was kind of the queen of soap operas

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.720
 in the early, early days in the '30s.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.960
 - Yeah, she had a show which was called Painted Dreams,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.720
 which was the very first one that she did.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.000
 So that started airing in 1930.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.120
 And she was asked, can you come up with a daily show

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.760
 that would show the sort of home life of people?

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.840
 And as you say, it was sort of treated like,

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.280
 "Ugh, what is this lowbrow nonsense?"

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.960
 But actually, for the time, it was 1930,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.480
 the characters that she created

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.280
 were incredibly strong women on the show.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.880
 And there were virtually no regular male characters

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.200
 in it whatsoever.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.120
 So she really pushed forward this idea

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.480
 that women were more than what society was saying they were,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.240
 that they were much more, they were cleverer,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.120
 they were more ambitious.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.280
 And so that was sort of like a beautiful,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.720
 little secret movement to push women's rights.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.560
 - Yeah.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.000
 - But it must have made a difference

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.600
 because they were so popular straight away, weren't they?

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.880
 I think by like the, it started in 1930,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.880
 by 1940, 92% of programs on the radio were soaps, basically.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.080
 It was like 25 of the 30 top-rated programs were soaps.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.720
 So maybe they are the cause of women's lip.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.120
 - Well, they did have a lot to say for society

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.000
 because the person who came after Ernest Phillips

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.800
 was Agnes Nixon.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.560
 So she was in the '50s and '60s.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.720
 She was like the successor of Ernest Phillips.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.320
 And she not only wrote very strong characters,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.000
 but she also wrote about a lot of societal problems.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.040
 You know, these days, when you're so proper,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.520
 she'll have lots of, you know,

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.880
 echoing the problems of society, they'll do that.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.480
 And she was really the first one who decided to do that.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.200
 And there was one time where one of her characters

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.000
 had cervical cancer and they found it through a smear test.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.720
 And that really was the time that the taboo over smear tests

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.760
 really kind of was, obviously it's still there a little bit,

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.560
 but it was like, it was completely taboo before that.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.320
 And this really made a massive difference

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.560
 and loads more women got tested after that.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.920
 - That's very cool. - That was in 1962.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.840
 - Wow, didn't know they had smear tests back then.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.200
 - Yeah, early days.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.600
 - Another thing that Ernest Phillips innovated

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.960
 in the soap field was having an organ player.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.320
 And most soaps then just had an organ player

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.920
 as part of the regular employees

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.520
 whose job was just to give a "da da da da da da"

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.280
 in between scenes. - Did they do that?

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.840
 - I don't know if they played that specific piece,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.240
 but they did have, you know.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.000
 - There's TV shows in Australia,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.640
 the soaps like Home and Away and Neighbours are quite famous

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.480
 for giving us a lot of big stars that are now,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.360
 you know, Kylie Minot and so on,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.120
 sort of all got, you know, cut their teeth on that show.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.440
 And I didn't really-- - Sorry.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.000
 - Kylie is massive.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.800
 - Yeah, she's also has said I was the dog.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.880
 She's so big that most of us know what her surname is.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.640
 - Minot, guys. - Minot.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.280
 Like the fish, the small fish.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.400
 She's literally not a Minot.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.800
 She's a big fish. - Kylie Minot.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.560
 - She is quite petite though.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.480
 - I have been saying Minot my whole life.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.480
 - Well, she nicknamed,

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.920
 that would have been a good nickname for her at school

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.360
 'cause she was, she's so petite.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.400
 - For all I know, she was Minot.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.520
 Hasn't like, that's technically the correct way

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.800
 to pronounce it, but that's not the way

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.280
 anyone in the world is pronouncing it.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.080
 - No, you're right, now that he points it out,

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.440
 I do know that every other person who's ever said the name

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.880
 to me in my entire life has said it with the GUE,

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.240
 sort of really punctuated.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.560
 Migno, Migno.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.920
 (all laughing)

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.120
 Listen, whatever she's called,

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.560
 neighbors gave her to us.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.760
 And, well, I've lost my place now.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.800
 So basically, Corrie, Coronation Street,

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.120
 the street is responsible for quite a lot

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.920
 of big actors as well that we now have.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.680
 So people who sort of debuted on it

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.640
 include Sir Ben Kingsley.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.600
 He was a Coronation Street actor.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.440
 Yeah, Davy Jones of the Monkeys.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.520
 He came out of Coronation Street.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.680
 He had a little role in that.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.000
 And so did Joanna Lumley.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.760
 So, you know, yeah, the soaps are responsible

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.040
 for some of our biggest highbrow actors as well,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.240
 Kingsley and Lumley.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.160
 - Yeah, Davy Jones, he doesn't slot into that category.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.000
 - Not quite.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.160
 - He's the wild card.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.960
 - You can be promoted on soap operas.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.160
 So I really like this.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.720
 So there's a guy, there's an actor called Bill Tarny,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.880
 who is very famous in soap world.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.320
 He played Jack Duckworth, right?

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.560
 And he started out, he's Corrie, isn't he?

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.040
 - He started out as an extra.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.640
 And his job was to play someone who was just out of shot.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.480
 - What?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.680
 (all laughing)

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.520
 - You occasionally would see--

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.800
 - Is he playing the doggen?

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.640
 - You'd see one of his arms briefly

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.800
 and occasionally in a shot.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.320
 But you would never see anything else of him.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.160
 That was his role.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.000
 - Oh, come on.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.840
 - And then, he's true.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.360
 That was what he was initially cast as,

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.160
 was just someone else to show the someone else in the room.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.360
 - Did he have a really attractive arm or something?

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.040
 - He must have, because when he was promoted,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.560
 he then spent 31 years as a full body actor,

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.480
 as they're known in the biz.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.040
 And yeah, that's a pleasing thing,

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.520
 the pleasing career progression.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.960
 - So he was supposed to be just out of shot.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.440
 So it was the idea that he's someone

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.840
 for the other actors who are in shot to sort of look at.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.520
 So it's realistic that--

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.400
 - I think in a crowd scene with a pub or whatever,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.400
 you don't just have two people sitting there

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.640
 and you have to imagine that there's everyone else in the pub.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.440
 You know, you have maybe an establishing shot

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.600
 and then maybe you're next to someone at the pub,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.920
 so your arms up against theirs.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.040
 So you occasionally see his arm.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.400
 - But then he's in shot.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.800
 - Okay, his job was to be predominantly

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.400
 and almost always out of shot.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.440
 - But then actually, when he got the main role

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.560
 as Jack Duckworth, whenever he walked into a room,

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.600
 you would see his arm come in first.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.240
 (all laughing)

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.360
 - Here's Jack Duckworth, what he'll have to say.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.960
 - Well, it's that sexy move that I think people do it

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.520
 in like some musicals in Chicago or something.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.880
 A woman in fishnet tights would project her leg in first

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.920
 and then her body would follow.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.040
 Does he enter like that?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.160
 - Yeah, that's exactly how he does it.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.360
 He's always wearing a very nice watch.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360
 (all laughing)

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.940
 (upbeat music)

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:33.600
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.040
 That is Anna.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.200
 My fact this week is that if you take an hour long nap

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.360
 after listening to this show,

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.920
 you will remember five times as many facts from it.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.240
 - Wow.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.080
 - So do it.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.900
 - Cool.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.120
 - So five times more than we said on the show

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.080
 or where are these extra facts coming from?

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.320
 - Not everyone remembers every single fact

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.960
 as well you should know on this podcast.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.680
 (all laughing)

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.200
 - Yes, five times as many as if you don't take a nap.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.040
 - Yeah.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.280
 - So this, I really loved an app.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.400
 So I really enjoyed reading about this study

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.640
 and generally a lot of studies that have come out

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.800
 in the last couple of decades about how napping is great.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.200
 This one was from 2015.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.560
 It was quite a small cohort,

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.160
 but basically it gave participants 90 words to remember

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.200
 and then 120 word pairs.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.400
 So that's two random words paired together.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.160
 And so like milk taxi is the example they give in the study.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.000
 - Is that random?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.360
 - And, sorry?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.200
 - Is that random?

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.600
 - Milk taxi, you could make a link there.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.720
 - Yeah, well, I mean, there is of course the milk taxi

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.480
 that follows the teapot one around.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.440
 (all laughing)

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.400
 - In all subsequent studies,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.280
 they're gonna have to remove that word pair now.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.680
 We've ruined it for people.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.240
 'Cause yeah, they have to be so unrelated

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.040
 that you can't have a familiar connection,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.840
 which sort of allows you to cheat and remember it.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.400
 Anyway, they gave these 120 word pairs to people

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.440
 and then half the participants had to watch DVDs

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.440
 and the other half took naps for,

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.000
 it was an hour and a half in fact.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.040
 And the nappers afterwards were five times better,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.440
 remembering the word pairs

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.520
 than the ones who'd watched the DVD.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.920
 And in fact, I find this astonishing,

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.560
 the people who'd had the nap remembered exactly as much

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.440
 as they would have if they'd just been asked

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.560
 immediately afterwards.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.320
 So you know how, you know,

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.920
 as soon as a couple of hours have passed,

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.680
 then you forget the majority of stuff

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.840
 that you've immediately heard.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.080
 They remembered exactly the same amount

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.400
 as if they'd just been asked.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.840
 - I wonder if, so, Finella has a laptop

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.320
 that she was given by work

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.640
 and it was formatted by the people at her work

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.640
 and the password to log into the computer is catbus111.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.920
 I can say that it's lockdown.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.840
 No one's taking her computer, it's fine.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.360
 But immediately both of us went catbus.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.720
 What the hell is a catbus?

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.320
 Why would you ever use catbus?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.240
 And both of us have never forgotten it.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.640
 Like the conversation and the pairing of it

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.440
 was just so bizarre that it's a connection

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.280
 that's stuck in your head.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.080
 - Also another thing that's interesting, Dad,

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.680
 is now everyone listening to this will never forget it.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.440
 So when we are out of lockdown

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.720
 in the not too distant future, we hope

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.240
 that everyone will be able to steal your wife's laptop.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.040
 - I'll change it after this episode.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.600
 I'll reset the password.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.440
 - Try buscat, everyone.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.120
 - Two, two, two.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.400
 - My password is coolguy123

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.960
 because no one's ever caught me that.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.520
 - Two totally unassociated concepts.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.800
 That's what you need.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.800
 I quite like this study also

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.560
 because of the choice of DVDs that the participants were given.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.560
 So, like I said, some got to go to sleep,

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.960
 some had to watch these DVDs.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.400
 And it was two DVDs that lasted in total two hours.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.080
 One was called "Relaxing the Most Beautiful Landscapes on Earth."

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.480
 And it was just what it sounds like.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.680
 And both had only instrumental music.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.360
 And the other is called "Power Catzy."

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.640
 And it sounds like the maddest thing ever.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.680
 So it's only instrumental.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.800
 And it's this weird experimental film made in the 80s

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.080
 about the conflict in third world countries

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.680
 between traditional ways of life

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.120
 and the new ways of life introduced with industrialization

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.960
 but all shown in very surrealist instrumental form.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.440
 And so I'm kind of amazed that they managed to stay awake

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.840
 through that two hours.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.960
 - So yeah, I wonder if the study is about

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.400
 how good it is to nap to remember things

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.400
 or whether watching weird DVDs just really distract you.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.000
 It could be that, couldn't it?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.720
 If the DVD had been something else,

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.240
 like "Stop All My Mommles Shoots"

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.520
 or "Growing Ups 2" or something like that.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.120
 - "Stop All My Mommles Shoots."

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.320
 I think that's the second time you've ever referenced

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.640
 that extremely obscure Sylvester Stallone movie.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.800
 - We finally found the only film James has actually seen.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.120
 - I just watched it again and again and again.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.200
 And you guys know my memory for facts is extremely good.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.240
 So maybe if we'd given these guys

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.080
 "Stop All My Mommles Shoots" to watch.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.880
 - To be fair, if that had been the first film you'd seen,

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.720
 I could understand why you didn't watch any other film

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.000
 James had put a few years ago.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.080
 Because there's no point.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.800
 You know, why climb any other mountains

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.920
 when you started with Everest?

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.760
 You know?

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.400
 - Exactly.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.640
 By the way, I looked up

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.520
 whether there was such thing as a milk taxi.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.400
 I don't know if any of the rest of you did.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.240
 And this is a new product.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.280
 Well, actually it was made in 2005

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.640
 by a company called Holm and Lau.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.480
 And they revolutionized bucket feeding for calves

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.880
 by the invention of the milk taxi.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.440
 And it's almost like a bucket

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.520
 that kind of drives around the farm

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.280
 and goes to the calves

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.520
 and gives them exactly the right amount of feed

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.120
 and exactly the right amount of milk that they need.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.200
 It's a bit like a tea's made, but for cows.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.040
 - Wow.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.920
 - Is it like a robotic udder though?

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.600
 Because obviously they want an udder to suck a lad.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.360
 - I couldn't quite tell from the picture.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.560
 They look more like milk churns on wheels,

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.480
 but I couldn't quite tell.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.320
 But it is a thing.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.560
 So, you know.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.400
 - Wow.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.520
 - You could call it a tits made

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.160
 because it's flying around, keeping your milk.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.440
 - Yeah.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.480
 - God, how bizarre.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.160
 - Speaking of weird portmanteau words

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.800
 that I already regret saying.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.480
 Have you guys heard of the napatino?

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.200
 I'm sure you have in the course of this research.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.240
 - Napatino, what's that?

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.320
 - I haven't actually.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.240
 I can guess what it is,

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.120
 but also it sounds too much like the word nappy

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.000
 and would put me off.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.920
 - It's a practice, it's a habit, it's a behavior.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.240
 It's where you drink a coffee and then you have a nap.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.400
 And you have to take a brief nap

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.800
 because then you wake up super charged

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.800
 just as you come out of the sleep, the caffeine hits.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800
 It takes about 20 minutes.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.360
 - That's quite advanced, I think,

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.160
 'cause I'm a bit of a napper as well.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.720
 And I did read about the idea of having a coffee first

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.840
 and I tried it a few times,

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.360
 but if you can't get straight to sleep,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.840
 then the caffeine hits you

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.800
 just as you think you're about to fall asleep

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.960
 and you just have a massive high

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.040
 and you can't sleep anymore.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.880
 So I think you need to be--

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.720
 - Must be tense.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.000
 - Yeah, you need to be one of the nappers

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.560
 who can really kind of just go like a light immediately,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.880
 whereas I'm not really one of those.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.400
 It takes me a few minutes to get in.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.680
 - I've always thought that my dad invented that

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.000
 'cause I know, so I've read about that concept before,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.880
 but he always did it at car journeys when we were kids.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.160
 You'd stop in a service station, down a double espresso,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.000
 and then he was one of these--

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.640
 - And then fall asleep when driving home.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.480
 - Back by the wheel.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.520
 (laughing)

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.360
 - Look, you're parked.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.320
 It's actually incredibly boring for four children in the back.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.280
 You're in a parked car for 15 minutes,

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.400
 but it's just 15 solid minutes.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.000
 Wake up, and it's like, you know, your new woman.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.200
 - Did it work?

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.600
 - It worked like a dream, he claimed,

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.000
 but I'm with James.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.960
 I don't think I could fall asleep like that on command,

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.160
 and then it's just annoying.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.160
 - I can't, I think I could do that,

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.760
 but I don't drink coffee, so it's wasted.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.560
 - One way that I nap quite probably once a week

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.240
 is this is a good way of getting to sleep

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.640
 is 'cause I edit this podcast every week,

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.440
 I have to then listen back to it

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.760
 to kind of make sure that narratively

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.720
 it all makes sense from start to finish.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.000
 And I think a good way to do that

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.240
 is kind of lie down in bed while I'm listening to it.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.720
 And I usually get past about one fact,

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.680
 and then I'm gone, (laughing)

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.400
 and then I have to go all the way back to the start

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.240
 and do it again.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.800
 But I think like nothing to podcast is a thing, isn't it?

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.080
 And I read an article about this.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.640
 This was a guy called Craig Richard

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.920
 from Shenandoah University.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.560
 He wrote a book called Brain Tingles,

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.320
 which is about ASMR stuff.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.560
 And he said that human voice podcasts

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.200
 are quite a good way of getting to sleep

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:23.200
 as long as they contain a calm host voice, kindness,

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.200
 which means basically you're not just having

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.760
 to go at people all the time,

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.320
 and generally banal content.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.880
 That's the things that you need. (laughing)

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.080
 - Well, at least we've got one out of three.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.760
 (laughing)

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.200
 We're not kind and Dan's always stressed, but.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.120
 (laughing)

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.640
 - Hey, do you guys know where you are allowed

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.720
 to nap at the wheel?

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.040
 (laughing)

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.280
 - Driverless car.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.120
 - Oh, yeah.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.240
 - No, no, you're definitely not allowed to.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.080
 - Okay, definitely not.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.280
 - Oh, you're not, okay.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.120
 - So some kind of wheel, a ship's wheel.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.640
 - Ship's wheel, possibly.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.200
 I didn't actually look through all the possibilities.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.720
 - Maybe at the roulette table.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.800
 - Oh, yes.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.000
 - Fairly nice. - Wake up refreshed.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.320
 - Put it all on number 17.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.120
 - Yeah, wake up three hours later

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.680
 and it's landed on 17, 200 times,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.960
 and you own all the money in the world.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.480
 - Bad gambling advice, we know that thing is a fish.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.800
 Is it a water wheel?

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.480
 Wake up and you've got a loaf of bread made.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.840
 - Oh, Dan, Dan, Dan, Potter's wheel.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.040
 So you have hands there and then you just drop off,

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.640
 but you've made a perfect vase.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.880
 - A perfect cubicle teapot.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.400
 - Nope.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.240
 - No, okay.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.640
 - Please put us out of our misery for God's sake.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.480
 - Oh, no, no, there are more.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.640
 - I'm trying, I'm trying.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.760
 (laughing)

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.120
 Christ's sake, drive in five minutes.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.040
 - Go on, Andy.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.200
 I didn't have anything, I was just stalling

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.520
 so James could think of another wheel.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.880
 - I know, I'm thinking the wheel of fortune,

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.240
 the TV game show.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.800
 - It's not that either,

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.440
 it is in the cockpit as a pilot at the wheel of a plane.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.600
 - There's no wheel at a plane?

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.440
 Come on, how are we supposed to guess that?

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.360
 - Well, you're at the wheel, you're at the wheel,

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.320
 like you said that you're at the wheel.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.400
 - But wait a second, we've talked about this before,

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.240
 pilots sleeping before, and it's a problem.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.120
 They're definitely not allowed to do it, aren't they?

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.640
 - Well, so, they're not really,

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.480
 'cause there have been some horrible incidences,

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.000
 like for example, in 2008,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.960
 both pilots fell asleep at the wheel,

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.800
 and when they woke up,

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.040
 they just completely gone past

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.840
 where they were meant to land in Hawaii.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.000
 Just like, where are we?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.840
 Way past where we're meant to be.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.560
 But some countries, like Canada and Australia,

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.800
 allow for pilots to take naps in the cockpit.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.640
 So basically, it's really strict rules,

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.600
 but what they call it is a controlled rest in position,

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.960
 C-R-I-P, and the idea is that the pilot can sleep

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.200
 for no more than 40 minutes,

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.720
 must wake up at least half an hour

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.880
 before the descent of landing,

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.600
 and they have to sort of tell everyone,

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.840
 like, I'm gonna have a nap now,

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.200
 and then they can go down for a nap,

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.640
 sitting in their position without worry

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.320
 that they might affect the controls,

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.280
 as long as obviously they have a co-pilot next to them.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.120
 So yeah. - Okay.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.360
 - Wow, controlled rest in position,

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.400
 that's a very good euphemism for saying,

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.360
 having a little sis while you're at your seat, it's clever.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.640
 - There is another place where you used to be able

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.880
 and able to have a nap and no one would mind or object,

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.800
 and that was in the House of Lords in the UK.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:24.080
 So there was a convention until 2018, I believe,

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.880
 in the House of Lords that peers,

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.320
 members of the House of Lords are never sleeping,

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.480
 they are resting their eyes and they're closing their eyes

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.840
 and leaning back to really focus on the intellectual debate

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.800
 and the laws that they're debating.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.640
 And then that was a lovely convention.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.440
 And then in 2018, they were told off for sleeping

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.120
 in the chamber and kind of burst the bubble.

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.960
 - And then in 2019, they all ripped their eyelids off,

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.800
 didn't they?

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.200
 (laughing)

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.040
 - That's right.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.560
 - Did Buddha never have eyelids for the rest of his life?

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.360
 Sorry, I've been thinking about this ever since he said it.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.080
 (laughing)

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.600
 - They must have grown back, eh?

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.640
 - Did they grow back?

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.080
 - It's a really good point, Dan.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.400
 I don't think the myth says, but it should.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.000
 - But Buddha had all sorts of weird physical attributes

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.560
 that I think we've discussed before, didn't he?

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.920
 Like tentacles coming out of his earlobes or whatever.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.680
 I can't remember, you'll have to refer back.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.160
 Yeah, exactly. - Super long tongue.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160
 - If they would have grown back,

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.400
 then that kind of defeats the gesture that he made.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.040
 If he's just got another pair of eyelids under there,

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.120
 then I think that's a less impressive gesture

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.960
 to repent you falling asleep in your work.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.440
 - He probably didn't know he did at the time though.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.880
 When you do it for the first time, you can't be sure.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.720
 - That's true.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.000
 - I'll respect him for it.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.400
 - The snooker player, Ronnie O'Sullivan,

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.800
 he has been seen napping even during competitive matches.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.640
 - Yeah, he does.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.080
 - And he said his doctor advised him to do it.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.640
 But I really like this because obviously the nap in snooker

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.760
 is the direction of the cloth, isn't it?

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.600
 - Yeah.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.440
 - The bays.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.760
 So that's kind of pleasing.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.920
 - A lot of the other players think that he is doing it

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.480
 to try and out psych them.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.440
 It's like, 'cause when you play snooker,

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.440
 you're on the table or they're on the table.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.400
 And when they're playing,

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.720
 you're just kind of sat in your chair

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.120
 and there's nothing you can do.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.200
 But if you're sat there pretending to fall asleep

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.720
 and put in a flannel of your face like he does sometimes,

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.640
 then some people think that that's a bit bad form.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.480
 You know what I mean?

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.560
 - Well, get a nap on what you can.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.400
 It's the perfect chance.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.840
 It's fucking boring snooker.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.800
 And he knows it, so you might as well have a snooze.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.520
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.480
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.000
