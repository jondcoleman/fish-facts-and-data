00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:23,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:28,00:00:31,"Now, once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:33,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:33,00:00:37,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:40,00:00:44,"- Okay, my fact this week is that US Marines"
00:00:44,00:00:46,are considered to be so stupid
00:00:46,00:00:48,that members of the other armed forces
00:00:48,00:00:50,called them crayon eaters.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"This year, a Marine has invented an actual edible crayon."
00:00:56,00:01:00,"Now, does that prove the Marines are not stupid?"
00:01:00,00:01:01,- I think so.
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- Or does it prove that they are,"
00:01:03,00:01:06,and that they haven't understood the joke?
00:01:06,00:01:08,"- This guy, he's invented something."
00:01:08,00:01:09,"So that makes you smart, doesn't it?"
00:01:09,00:01:10,- Yeah.
00:01:10,00:01:11,- Does it draw?
00:01:11,00:01:12,It actually draws like a crayon.
00:01:12,00:01:13,It's not just an edible stick.
00:01:13,00:01:14,- Of course it does draw.
00:01:14,00:01:16,- He might have just taken a pepper army
00:01:16,00:01:19,and shoved a nib in it.
00:01:19,00:01:21,"Does that count as a crayon, a pepper army?"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"I mean, I suppose if you smeared it on the wall,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,you could get some kind of drawing out of it.
00:01:25,00:01:27,(laughing)
00:01:27,00:01:32,"No, so this is a guy called Frank Manto,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,and it was both him and his business partner
00:01:34,00:01:36,who's called Cassandra Gordon.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"And they decided in 2017,"
00:01:39,00:01:42,"having heard of this thing about being called crayon eaters,"
00:01:42,00:01:45,that they would decide to come up with a edible crayon.
00:01:45,00:01:49,"And they've got these things called crayons ready to eat,"
00:01:49,00:01:52,and they taste like delicious vanilla flavored chocolate.
00:01:52,00:01:54,And anyone can eat them.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"Don't give them to your pets,"
00:01:56,00:01:57,"'cause I think they have some chocolate in them,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,and pets aren't allowed to chocolate.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"And actually this guy called Frank Manto,"
00:02:01,00:02:05,he was using some crayons to color in a project once
00:02:05,00:02:07,when he was at a high school.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"And not when he was at high school,"
00:02:09,00:02:10,he was kind of--
00:02:10,00:02:11,"- I was gonna say,"
00:02:11,00:02:14,I mean he's got a lot of Marines reputation here.
00:02:14,00:02:17,"- And what happened was he put a crayon in his mouth,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"like to kind of, because he only had two hands"
00:02:19,00:02:21,"and he needed to hold one, so he put it in his mouth."
00:02:21,00:02:24,"And that was when he realized, wait a minute,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,"are there any edible crayons, actually?"
00:02:26,00:02:28,"And so then he got in touch with this lady called Cassandra,"
00:02:28,00:02:33,"who's a pastry chef, and she helped design this new product."
00:02:33,00:02:34,"- I bet that when he put the crayon in his mouth,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,immediately a Marines recruiting officer
00:02:36,00:02:37,"took Cassandra out the door and said,"
00:02:37,00:02:39,"you, you're the kind of guy we need."
00:02:39,00:02:41,(laughing)
00:02:41,00:02:46,- So they're currently trying to crowdfund the crayons
00:02:46,00:02:48,in order to go out these new edible crayons.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"So if anyone wants to check it out,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,"it's crayonsreadytoeat.com,"
00:02:52,00:02:55,"and they're looking to get $75,000."
00:02:55,00:03:00,"At the moment, they've got $5,750 as of recording,"
00:03:00,00:03:02,but you can go to their shop and buy a t-shirt.
00:03:02,00:03:05,So that is available right now.
00:03:05,00:03:07,- Is it an edible t-shirt?
00:03:07,00:03:08,- It is not an edible t-shirt.
00:03:08,00:03:09,(laughing)
00:03:09,00:03:11,"- It would be a real shame if today,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"the day that we are doing a comic relief marathon,"
00:03:13,00:03:16,"asking people to donate money to the best causes in the world,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,if actually all of their funds were redirected
00:03:18,00:03:20,to fund this edible crayon.
00:03:20,00:03:21,(laughing)
00:03:21,00:03:23,"- I just wanna say, if you have to choose one,"
00:03:23,00:03:24,just think really carefully.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"- Okay, look, comic relief for trying to feed the world,"
00:03:26,00:03:27,"don't they, huh?"
00:03:27,00:03:30,Better to do that than to send a lot of edible crayons
00:03:30,00:03:30,everywhere.
00:03:30,00:03:32,(laughing)
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- James, is it a pun on meals ready to eat?"
00:03:34,00:03:36,"'Cause that's what they call their US military supplies,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"isn't it, MREs?"
00:03:37,00:03:38,That's the kind of-
00:03:38,00:03:39,- It is.
00:03:39,00:03:41,- The meal rations you get in the field.
00:03:41,00:03:43,"- To be honest, I didn't know about that,"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"but now you said it, I mean, it definitely is, isn't it?"
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- Must be, yeah."
00:03:47,00:03:50,"It's even in the same packaging style, Andy."
00:03:50,00:03:52,"So it's like a ground bag, yeah."
00:03:52,00:03:53,It's got the font on it.
00:03:53,00:03:57,- And it's the idea that they'd be given
00:03:57,00:03:58,"to children or to Marines,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,"because obviously children tend to use crayons more,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,but Marines might need emergency supplies in the field.
00:04:02,00:04:04,"- They're not supposed to be emergency supplies,"
00:04:04,00:04:05,I don't think.
00:04:05,00:04:08,I don't think you replace them with the usual crayons
00:04:08,00:04:10,that Marines take in the field.
00:04:10,00:04:11,(laughing)
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- It's very boring, a lot of it is waiting around,"
00:04:13,00:04:15,but they've got to have something to entertain them.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"- Yeah, it's a funny product, like a-"
00:04:18,00:04:19,- I like it.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"- Okay, I love it."
00:04:20,00:04:23,"- It's an annual face to the abusers, right?"
00:04:23,00:04:23,To the insiders.
00:04:23,00:04:26,"- Yeah, exactly, why do they call Marines crayon eaters?"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"It's like, this is quite a new thing."
00:04:28,00:04:31,"The interview with Frank Manto that I saw,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,"he said that when he was in the Marine Corps,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,they never called them crayon eaters.
00:04:36,00:04:38,That was until 2002.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"They said they were known as jar heads, grunts,"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"ground pounders, bullet sponges,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,but they were never known as crayon eaters.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And I can only think, looking at those dates,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"that it's due to Ralph from The Simpsons,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,"who was a regular crayon eater,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,and famously supposed to be a bit dumb
00:04:53,00:04:55,"that they must have taken that, it must be."
00:04:55,00:04:57,"- You're so right, yeah."
00:04:57,00:04:58,There was a blog from another Marine
00:04:58,00:05:00,"about that nickname, Railing Against It,"
00:05:00,00:05:04,"not 'cause it's insulting, but because it's just so shit."
00:05:04,00:05:06,And I couldn't tell if it was like
00:05:06,00:05:07,"the Lady Doth Protest too much,"
00:05:07,00:05:10,"but it started out him saying,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,"you know, we always make fun of each other in the military,"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"so we call the Air Force, the Chair Force, very funny."
00:05:16,00:05:19,Coast Guard are puddle pirates.
00:05:19,00:05:22,"The list goes on, apparently, but he didn't."
00:05:22,00:05:23,He didn't.
00:05:23,00:05:28,But then he said that crayon eaters is just super lame.
00:05:28,00:05:30,Do you think that something as lame as crayon eater
00:05:30,00:05:32,is gonna offend a member of a tribe
00:05:32,00:05:35,whose trainees are taught to yell kill during training?
00:05:35,00:05:36,"- Yeah, well, he makes a point."
00:05:36,00:05:38,"- Well, he makes a point, but I think like you say,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,"he makes it a bit too strongly, doesn't he?"
00:05:40,00:05:43,"- The article is very, very funny."
00:05:43,00:05:45,"Just a couple of extracts, it's bullet point."
00:05:45,00:05:48,"It's like point one, first off, it's just kind of weak."
00:05:48,00:05:51,"Maybe we're just too dumb to understand the insult here,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"but quite frankly, it sucks, it's lame."
00:05:53,00:05:55,It's no better than a kindergarten insult.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"You might as well say, you poop your pants,"
00:05:57,00:06:00,at least there's some truth to that for the Marines.
00:06:00,00:06:00,"I mean, it's really--"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"- I mean, that seems to be a self, oh, there, doesn't it?"
00:06:04,00:06:05,At least we shit ourselves.
00:06:05,00:06:09,- Should we be calling them punts poopers instead?
00:06:09,00:06:12,"- You're right, he's shot himself in the foot"
00:06:12,00:06:14,"with that article, it's just more ammunition."
00:06:14,00:06:15,He shot himself in the pants.
00:06:15,00:06:18,- It doesn't seem like they had a tremendous reputation
00:06:18,00:06:20,"before if they were known as jarheads, grunts,"
00:06:20,00:06:21,and bullets bungers.
00:06:21,00:06:24,It's not as though the fine nickname they had before
00:06:24,00:06:25,has taken a backer.
00:06:25,00:06:27,- I reckon they probably like ground pounders
00:06:27,00:06:29,"'cause that implies running, you know,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,"you know, strong runners, maybe."
00:06:32,00:06:33,- That's true.
00:06:33,00:06:35,- Bullet bungers makes you sound pretty damn hardcore.
00:06:35,00:06:36,- Yeah.
00:06:36,00:06:37,"- Yes, that's true."
00:06:37,00:06:38,- I guess so.
00:06:38,00:06:42,- Or more like just people who have disposable in war.
00:06:42,00:06:43,- That's what it sounds like to me.
00:06:43,00:06:44,- It sounds other.
00:06:44,00:06:45,- Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:46,(laughing)
00:06:46,00:06:49,"- Do you know, if you have chewed off a bunch of crayon,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"but you've left some over, do you know what those are called?"
00:06:51,00:06:54,Those tiny little bits at the end that are sort of useless?
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- No, I don't know that."
00:06:56,00:06:57,- They're called left-olars.
00:06:57,00:06:58,- Left-olars.
00:06:58,00:07:01,"- Yeah, left-olars are very important"
00:07:01,00:07:03,because they can be collected and remoulded
00:07:03,00:07:05,"into new crayons, and that's a project"
00:07:05,00:07:07,that a guy called Brian Ware was doing.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"So for hospitals in the US, he would collect"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"all the endings, all those tiny little bits at the end,"
00:07:12,00:07:15,"and he has a new mold, and he would pour it in,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"he would melt it up, and he would remould crayons,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,and they go to hospitals for free.
00:07:19,00:07:19,So that's pretty cool.
00:07:19,00:07:22,"- God, I mean, I know hospital food is shit generally,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"but that is a bit beyond the pale, isn't it?"
00:07:25,00:07:26,That's their offering.
00:07:26,00:07:30,"- What was the name of that, the little end bits done?"
00:07:30,00:07:31,Did you say?
00:07:31,00:07:32,- Left-olars.
00:07:32,00:07:33,"- Left-olars, and that probably comes"
00:07:33,00:07:35,"from the ola of crayola, right?"
00:07:35,00:07:36,- That's right.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"- So the name crayola, right?"
00:07:38,00:07:39,I think this is amazing.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"The etymology of this word, it's so ridiculous."
00:07:42,00:07:44,"It was coined by Alice Binney,"
00:07:44,00:07:47,who was the wife of Edwin Binney.
00:07:47,00:07:50,"These two people kind of started the crayola company,"
00:07:50,00:07:53,"and she got the word from the French word cray,"
00:07:53,00:07:55,"meaning a stick of chalk,"
00:07:55,00:08:00,"and the English word oleaginous, meaning oily."
00:08:00,00:08:03,"So it means oily chalk, but I just love that."
00:08:03,00:08:06,"I mean, oleaginous is such an unusual word"
00:08:06,00:08:09,"to just think, well, I'm gonna make a kid's plaything"
00:08:09,00:08:10,out of this word.
00:08:10,00:08:11,- It's a stupid name.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"It's neither chalk nor oily, and in fact,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"the whole point of crayons, crayola crayons,"
00:08:16,00:08:19,is that it was the first type of crayon to not use oil.
00:08:19,00:08:21,It used wax instead.
00:08:21,00:08:24,So it does seem bizarre to me to then give it the oil name.
00:08:24,00:08:25,- It's not oleaginous.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"- Well, exactly."
00:08:27,00:08:28,"- But the Binney family in general,"
00:08:28,00:08:32,"they made, obviously they made millions out of crayons,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,"and the really nice thing is what the money was spent on,"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"because in 1986, the San Diego Museum of Art"
00:08:38,00:08:42,"got a world-class collection of art bequeathed to them,"
00:08:42,00:08:45,and that was the result of the Binney family millions.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"I think it was Edwin Binney III, who must have been,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,"I guess, grandson of the original Edwin Binney,"
00:08:49,00:08:52,he had bought this wonderful art collection.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"So crayons paid for a world-class art collection,"
00:08:55,00:08:56,which I think is a very nice--
00:08:56,00:08:59,"- That's all the arts are made of crayons, so."
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Yeah, it was only crayon art."
00:09:00,00:09:03,"It was really, no, I can't remember exactly what was in it,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,but it was really good stuff.
00:09:05,00:09:08,- Although people used to paint with proper crayons.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"- That's right, yeah."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Would you know 2012, up until 2012,"
00:09:12,00:09:15,the most expensive painting ever sold at auction
00:09:15,00:09:18,"was done by crayon, or rather pastels,"
00:09:18,00:09:22,"but you know, the same thing really."
00:09:22,00:09:24,"I know there's an oil and wax slight difference to it,"
00:09:24,00:09:25,but--
00:09:25,00:09:26,"- Yeah, and also reputationally,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,"if you say I've done a lovely pastel drawing,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"then people think, oh, you must really know what you're doing."
00:09:30,00:09:32,"If you say I've done a lovely crayon piece,"
00:09:32,00:09:33,"they think, five."
00:09:33,00:09:35,"- Interesting though, fruit pastels,"
00:09:35,00:09:40,began as a painting tool that tasted like fruit.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"- Oh, God, poor guy, it's already been invented."
00:09:42,00:09:45,"We should tell him, mate, they've done it."
00:09:45,00:09:46,The fruit pastels.
00:09:46,00:09:49,"The painting, by the way, was ""The Scream"" by Edvard Munch."
00:09:49,00:09:51,"- Oh, yeah."
00:09:51,00:09:53,"- He did one, yeah, 'cause he did a bunch of versions"
00:09:53,00:09:55,"of ""The Scream"" and one of them was on cardboard,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,"and it was done with these crayon-y pastels,"
00:09:57,00:10:02,and that sold for something like 119 million at the time.
00:10:02,00:10:03,It's now 23rd in the list
00:10:03,00:10:05,of the most expensive pieces of art
00:10:05,00:10:09,that have ever been sold with a da Vinci right at the top.
00:10:09,00:10:10,But yeah.
00:10:10,00:10:12,"- And also his name, Edvard Munch,"
00:10:12,00:10:15,comes from the fact that he used to eat his drawing equipment
00:10:15,00:10:16,"as soon as he was done, didn't he?"
00:10:16,00:10:17,- Yeah.
00:10:17,00:10:20,"- Crayola Vigurd at PR, I would say,"
00:10:20,00:10:23,"as a company, when then latest new color,"
00:10:23,00:10:26,"""Blootiful"" came to be."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"The company said it beat four other finalists,"
00:10:28,00:10:32,"so the other finalists were, ""Dreams come blue,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"""blue moon bliss, reach for the stars,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,"""star-spangled blue,"" they're the four that it beat."
00:10:37,00:10:40,"And they said that the company chose ""Blootiful"""
00:10:40,00:10:44,"from over 90,000 unique submissions."
00:10:44,00:10:46,"Someone read through 90,000 names,"
00:10:46,00:10:49,"and then there were 400,000 votes to decide the winner."
00:10:49,00:10:53,"- It's insane that you could have 90,000 unique names"
00:10:53,00:10:56,when the public have no ability
00:10:56,00:10:58,"to think of anything new, do they?"
00:10:58,00:11:01,"Basically, if they've got 90,000 unique ones,"
00:11:01,00:11:04,"then think of all the people who said ""bluey blue face,"""
00:11:04,00:11:07,"and add that to that number, and you're in the millions."
00:11:07,00:11:10,- So I think they can't have meant unique names.
00:11:10,00:11:12,They must have meant unique submissions from people.
00:11:12,00:11:14,Some people must have been coming up with the same ones.
00:11:14,00:11:15,- They must have been.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"- There aren't 90,000 sounds in the world."
00:11:17,00:11:20,(laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:23,"- But yeah, there's not 90,000 puns with the word ""blue,"""
00:11:23,00:11:25,and that's for sure.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Even you couldn't generate.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"- No, but they probably just had people just sausage stick,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"you know, it's probably just random submissions."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"- 90,000 is a lot of people."
00:11:36,00:11:40,That's really so many to be part of the base name.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"- It's kids, isn't it?"
00:11:41,00:11:42,It'd be schools that they're all submitting
00:11:42,00:11:45,"around America, I think it is."
00:11:45,00:11:46,- But it's crazy.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"I was looking through, I read this amazing site"
00:11:48,00:11:49,"that I wanna give a shout out to,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"which is Jenny's crayon collection site,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,and a woman called Jenny has gone through and cataloged
00:11:53,00:11:57,every single crayon that's ever been and ever been retired.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"I read through all the colors, obviously,"
00:11:59,00:12:02,and they prioritized bizarre things.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"So the initial ones are really obvious,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"like red, yellow, blue, brown,"
00:12:07,00:12:10,"but by the time you're in the 32 crayon box,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,you're getting Timber Wolf as a color.
00:12:13,00:12:18,"In the 48 box, you've got macaroni and cheese as a color,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,"and yet maroon and navy blue,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,you don't get them to the 96 box.
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Really?
00:12:23,00:12:26,"Wow, people in the navy must feel very bad about that."
00:12:26,00:12:28,"- Yeah, those puddle pirates."
00:12:29,00:12:32,"So, but one other thing about that,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,the color changes is the famous thing
00:12:34,00:12:37,when they changed the flesh color.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"So it used to be that Crayola had this color,"
00:12:40,00:12:43,"which was flesh, which was very much the same color"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"as a white person's skin,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,"but obviously that is extremely unwoken,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,not the right thing to do.
00:12:50,00:12:52,And there was a woman called June Handler.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"She was a scientist, and she realized"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"that when she was observing children,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,"they would often bully each other,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,like the white kids would bully the non-white kids
00:13:01,00:13:03,by saying you don't have any flesh
00:13:03,00:13:06,because you don't have the same color skin as this crayon.
00:13:06,00:13:10,"She wrote to Crayola, and Crayola, to their credit,"
00:13:10,00:13:13,"very, very quickly changed it, changed the color to peach."
00:13:13,00:13:16,And now they have a colors of the world crayons
00:13:16,00:13:19,"where you can, basically it's all the different skin type"
00:13:19,00:13:21,colors that you can get in one pack.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"It's pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- Yeah, good on you, Crayola."
00:13:24,00:13:25,Yeah.
00:13:25,00:13:26,"- Oh, good at PR."
00:13:26,00:13:27,I'm telling you.
00:13:27,00:13:30,- Did you read the list of internet crayons
00:13:30,00:13:32,that Crayola released in the 1990s?
00:13:32,00:13:34,"I mean, it's just the same colors all over again,"
00:13:34,00:13:36,but they were called things like
00:13:36,00:13:40,"web surfing blue, circuit board green,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"green dot com, just another green,"
00:13:42,00:13:47,"online orange, and my favorite, floppy yellow."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"- Oh, really?"
00:13:48,00:13:51,"Floppy yellow, that used to be my nickname at school,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,but I don't know why they called me that
00:13:53,00:13:55,'cause I used to ship myself all the time.
00:13:55,00:13:58,(upbeat music)
00:13:58,00:14:03,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,and that is my fact.
00:14:05,00:14:08,My fact this week is that the London Metropolitan Police
00:14:08,00:14:11,used to have a van called teapot one exclusively
00:14:11,00:14:14,to deliver cups of tea to officers stuck
00:14:14,00:14:15,at the scene of a crime.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"- Wow, that's awesome."
00:14:17,00:14:22,"- Yeah, so this sadly, I believe that teapot one"
00:14:22,00:14:25,and it's brother or sister teapot two
00:14:25,00:14:28,"are now decommissioned tragically,"
00:14:28,00:14:29,"they're no longer running,"
00:14:29,00:14:32,"and it's a shame because teapot one was this,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,"it looked kind of like a burger van that went around,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,but it had also the sort of regalia
00:14:37,00:14:39,"of a classic police car,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"and on the very front of it,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"written in capitals was teapot one,"
00:14:43,00:14:46,"and it would be called for, say example,"
00:14:46,00:14:47,if police were called to an area
00:14:47,00:14:49,"where they thought maybe a protest was,"
00:14:49,00:14:52,or if there was a big festival
00:14:52,00:14:54,"and they needed police on standby the whole time,"
00:14:54,00:14:57,this was the catering truck that would come by
00:14:57,00:14:58,"and top them up with tea,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,there would be other things like coffees
00:15:00,00:15:01,"and sandwiches and so on,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,but it was known as teapot one.
00:15:02,00:15:05,"- Am I correct in thinking that behind teapot one,"
00:15:05,00:15:07,"you would also get the milk motorbike,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,and that would bring the milk in the sidecar.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"- And you have the sugar scooter behind that, didn't you?"
00:15:12,00:15:14,(laughing)
00:15:14,00:15:15,- Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:18,"- Yeah, so it was basically the government privatized"
00:15:18,00:15:20,the catering of the Met Police after that
00:15:20,00:15:21,and put it out to tender.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"So this was the Met Police's own thing that they had,"
00:15:25,00:15:26,"but then the government said,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"""No, we'll be able to make it more efficient"
00:15:28,00:15:30,"if we put it out to other companies."""
00:15:30,00:15:34,"- If you ever want an argument against privatization,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,"the end of teapot one, is it?"
00:15:35,00:15:38,"- Well, I read one vlog about it where they said,"
00:15:38,00:15:41,"""Let's be honest, in the main, the food was shit."""
00:15:41,00:15:42,But that's not the issue here.
00:15:42,00:15:45,(laughing)
00:15:45,00:15:47,"Who else could give you a frozen pork pie,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,"a sandwich, an apple, and a cup of hot gray water"
00:15:50,00:15:54,at four o'clock in the morning and do it all with a smile.
00:15:54,00:15:56,So it's one of these things where everyone knew
00:15:56,00:15:58,"it was terrible, but it was their thing,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,and that's why they were upset about it.
00:16:00,00:16:01,- That is such a shame.
00:16:01,00:16:04,"When teapot was written across the front of it down,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,was it written backwards so that if you were in a car
00:16:06,00:16:10,"and it was going up with its sirens behind you, you could see?"
00:16:10,00:16:12,- And the siren was the kettle just whistling.
00:16:12,00:16:14,(laughing)
00:16:14,00:16:17,"- I think from the photo that I've seen,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"unless they've reversed the photo,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,it looks like it was a normal reading
00:16:22,00:16:23,"for if you were standing in front of it,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,so the correct way.
00:16:24,00:16:27,So before teapot one existed officially
00:16:27,00:16:30,"on the front of a van, it used to just be a call sign."
00:16:30,00:16:32,So police have all sorts of different call signs
00:16:32,00:16:35,for if they need certain types of units to come in.
00:16:35,00:16:37,So if there's rioting going on
00:16:37,00:16:39,"and they have a van full of riot police,"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"that call sign might be gold or silver,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"and they would know, okay, we need to send that van in."
00:16:44,00:16:46,"- It's good that they're quite different, isn't it?"
00:16:46,00:16:50,You don't want to accidentally send the tea lady in.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"- Especially, James, if you say, right,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,we need to kettle everybody at this point.
00:16:54,00:16:55,Get the teapot!
00:16:55,00:16:58,(laughing)
00:16:58,00:17:02,"- So I actually spoke to a former police officer to ask,"
00:17:02,00:17:05,do you know anything about where this came from?
00:17:05,00:17:07,"And by an astonishing coincidence,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,the person I spoke to is the person
00:17:09,00:17:12,who may have generated the call sign teapot one.
00:17:12,00:17:16,"His name is Stephen Colgan, he's a buddy of ours."
00:17:16,00:17:19,"He is a former QIL, he's been on the show before."
00:17:19,00:17:23,"And he told me that at the time when the call sign came out,"
00:17:23,00:17:26,he was an instructor at Met's Telecom and Wireless School.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"And one day, he created a temporary call sign,"
00:17:29,00:17:32,"teapot one, for the catering van."
00:17:32,00:17:35,"And it started getting used and started, it got stuck."
00:17:35,00:17:36,And his colleagues started doing the same.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"And then a second van came, which was teapot two."
00:17:39,00:17:41,He says it's quite possible
00:17:41,00:17:42,"that he wasn't the very first to use it,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,but he can't find any instances before
00:17:44,00:17:45,where anyone had done that.
00:17:45,00:17:47,And it was years after he left the police
00:17:47,00:17:49,that it became the call sign so much
00:17:49,00:17:52,that they eventually turned it into the van itself.
00:17:52,00:17:53,- Wicked.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- I was on a Reddit thread,"
00:17:54,00:17:56,"which asked a question that everyone's probably wondering,"
00:17:56,00:17:59,"which is, is it appropriate to offer police officers tea"
00:17:59,00:18:02,or coffee if they're outside on your property?
00:18:02,00:18:05,"Which, so most answers were from American people saying,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,this is the most British question I've ever heard being asked.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"And not only are you offering the police tea,"
00:18:10,00:18:13,but you're asking if that's polite to do it.
00:18:13,00:18:16,But the answer seems to be from various police officers
00:18:16,00:18:19,"who responded, they love tea, always right to offer."
00:18:19,00:18:21,Please don't be offended if we turn it down.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"Sometimes we're busy, even if we don't look busy."
00:18:24,00:18:27,But also there are some instances
00:18:27,00:18:28,where it may be considered a bribe.
00:18:28,00:18:31,And so they are going to be obliged to turn it down.
00:18:31,00:18:34,"- I was told, I was told when I worked in a hotel"
00:18:34,00:18:37,that when the police came for our regular fights
00:18:37,00:18:39,"and things that we had to call them for,"
00:18:39,00:18:42,that we weren't allowed to give them tea or biscuits
00:18:42,00:18:43,or anything like that.
00:18:43,00:18:44,We were told we weren't allowed to
00:18:44,00:18:46,because it was counted as a bribe.
00:18:46,00:18:47,And that was by the police.
00:18:47,00:18:49,But we still would ask them all the time
00:18:49,00:18:50,"because it's just polite, isn't it?"
00:18:50,00:18:51,It was like a cup of tea.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"But then probably about half of them would say,"
00:18:54,00:18:55,"no, we're not allowed."
00:18:55,00:18:58,"And then the other half would say, oh yeah, go on then."
00:18:58,00:19:01,And there was one time that I was working behind the bar
00:19:01,00:19:02,"and there was a massive fight,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"like a really, really massive fight going on."
00:19:05,00:19:05,And we called the police.
00:19:05,00:19:08,We kind of put all the shutters down and stuff.
00:19:08,00:19:10,And then eventually the police came.
00:19:10,00:19:10,I'll never forget it.
00:19:10,00:19:14,We gave him a cup of tea and he had like four massive guys
00:19:14,00:19:18,who he was kind of corraling out of the building
00:19:18,00:19:20,"with a cup of tea on the saucer,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,with a biscuit on the saucer all the way through.
00:19:23,00:19:25,And he didn't spill a single drop.
00:19:25,00:19:27,It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen.
00:19:27,00:19:29,"- No, that's amazing. - Badass."
00:19:29,00:19:35,- I did spot that the St. John Ambulance Twitter
00:19:35,00:19:37,"does say as of 28th of June, 2020,"
00:19:37,00:19:40,"that they have a vehicle called the teapot,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,which seems to still be running.
00:19:42,00:19:44,And that is used to deliver refreshments
00:19:44,00:19:47,"to hospital staff and medics and volunteers, so on."
00:19:47,00:19:50,So it is possible that despite the police teapot one
00:19:50,00:19:53,"being down, we still might have a teapot on the road,"
00:19:53,00:19:55,helping out hospital staff.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"- Thank God, as long as Britain has a teapot vehicle"
00:19:58,00:19:59,on the road somewhere.
00:19:59,00:20:03,"- Hey, like tea is very important to our country, Anna."
00:20:03,00:20:05,It's like what we were built on.
00:20:05,00:20:05,Absolutely.
00:20:05,00:20:08,- That's like the crows of Tower of London.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"If there's not a teapot van on the streets of London,"
00:20:12,00:20:13,England will fall.
00:20:13,00:20:14,"- In wartime, especially,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,we get very possessive about tea.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"In the Second World War, I don't think we've mentioned that."
00:20:19,00:20:22,"Well, first of all, once the Blitz came,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,all British tea stock was moved out of London.
00:20:24,00:20:26,And it was dispersed through the country
00:20:26,00:20:28,to 500 different locations.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"- Whoa, 500?"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"- That's, you're really making sure."
00:20:32,00:20:34,They can't get all 500.
00:20:34,00:20:37,"But also in 1942, Britain bought up"
00:20:37,00:20:40,the world's entire supply of black tea.
00:20:40,00:20:43,This is how much we realised we needed it
00:20:43,00:20:44,to get through the war.
00:20:44,00:20:47,It was all the tea on the European market.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"And it was largely for the North Africa desert campaigns,"
00:20:50,00:20:52,because apparently all their water
00:20:52,00:20:54,was transported in fuel containers.
00:20:54,00:20:55,So it tasted like oil.
00:20:55,00:20:59,So the only drink they would drink was tea.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"But yeah, they bought up all the tea, pretty much available."
00:21:01,00:21:04,- That's so funny. - To Europe.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"The Suffragette movement, tea was very important in that."
00:21:07,00:21:10,"There was a suffragette called Patricia Hall,"
00:21:10,00:21:13,who once said that the promise of a cup of tea
00:21:13,00:21:17,was a great inducement to get women to come to meetings.
00:21:17,00:21:19,And also a lot of the tea rooms in London
00:21:19,00:21:20,was where they would meet.
00:21:20,00:21:23,So there was one in particular on Oxford Street
00:21:23,00:21:25,"called Allen's Tea Rooms,"
00:21:25,00:21:28,where a lot of the early suffragette plans got made.
00:21:28,00:21:31,And this was run by a guy called Allen Liddle.
00:21:31,00:21:34,But Allen Liddle was actually a pseudonym
00:21:34,00:21:35,"for the person who actually run it,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,who was called Marguerite Liddle.
00:21:37,00:21:39,And her middle name was Allen.
00:21:39,00:21:43,"So she called it Allen's Tea Rooms after her middle name,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,'cause she was called Marguerite Allen Liddle.
00:21:45,00:21:48,And I can't work out whether the Allen
00:21:48,00:21:50,"as a middle name was fake completely,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,"or whether just by coincidence,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"she had a male-sounding middle name,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,and she could use it for this tea shop.
00:21:56,00:21:56,But yeah.
00:21:56,00:21:57,- That's hilarious.
00:21:57,00:21:59,- Was this sort of like how female authors
00:21:59,00:22:02,in the 19th century had to have male pseudonyms?
00:22:02,00:22:04,Was it like you weren't allowed to establish a tea room
00:22:04,00:22:05,unless you were a male?
00:22:05,00:22:09,- I think it was like to stop people from worrying
00:22:09,00:22:11,that this was a place where women were gonna hang out.
00:22:11,00:22:14,Because Helen Gordon Liddle was one of the people
00:22:14,00:22:17,"who went to Marguerite's Tea Room,"
00:22:17,00:22:20,and she was one of the very famous kind of suffragettes
00:22:20,00:22:23,"who wrote a book about, I think, about force feeding."
00:22:23,00:22:26,I think it was like the first account of women
00:22:26,00:22:28,being force fed in prisons and stuff.
00:22:28,00:22:29,So yeah.
00:22:29,00:22:32,"- So they went on to found Liddle, didn't they?"
00:22:32,00:22:33,"- Liddle, yeah."
00:22:33,00:22:35,"- Yeah, pretty good."
00:22:35,00:22:40,Do you guys know who invented tea?
00:22:40,00:22:43,- God? - What?
00:22:43,00:22:45,"- So close, so close, it was Buddha."
00:22:45,00:22:48,Yeah.
00:22:48,00:22:51,"There's an Indian legend that Buddha went to China,"
00:22:51,00:22:52,"and when he was there, he said, right,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"I'm gonna meditate for nine years now, okay?"
00:22:55,00:22:57,"He thought he was in for a long meditation,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,but he fell asleep.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"And when he woke up from his nice sleep,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"halfway through his nine years of meditating,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,he was so annoyed at his own weakness
00:23:05,00:23:07,"that he cut off his own eyelids,"
00:23:07,00:23:09,and he chucked them on the ground.
00:23:09,00:23:13,"And where they fell, a tree with eyelid-shaped leaves"
00:23:13,00:23:15,"sprang up in its place,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,and that was the first ever tea tree.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"- Oh, wow, I've never heard that."
00:23:19,00:23:22,"- Citation needed, but still, it's a nice story."
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:28,"- Tea pots, original tea pots came from China,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,"where tea came from,"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"and they became popular in the Ming dynasty,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,"but apparently, I read one source that said"
00:23:34,00:23:37,the Chinese people would carry them around with them
00:23:37,00:23:39,"and just drink straight from the nozzle,"
00:23:39,00:23:40,which kind of sounds like that.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- That does make, well, it would burn,"
00:23:42,00:23:44,"wouldn't it, if it was too hot?"
00:23:44,00:23:46,"I think that's the only thing that stops me from doing it,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,is that I'm worried that I've burned my mouth.
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Your lips are gonna blister.
00:23:49,00:23:52,- And was it known as the nozzle back in the day?
00:23:52,00:23:53,(laughing)
00:23:53,00:23:55,"- I'll be honest, in ancient China,"
00:23:55,00:23:56,"I don't think they even called it a spout,"
00:23:56,00:24:00,"I mean, they probably had their own word for it."
00:24:00,00:24:01,"- You're right, right."
00:24:01,00:24:04,- I don't think nozzle is a Mandarin etymology.
00:24:04,00:24:08,"- I read that on a lot of ships,"
00:24:08,00:24:09,"so sort of military ships,"
00:24:09,00:24:12,"that the tea pots you get there, they are cube shaped."
00:24:12,00:24:13,- Are they?
00:24:13,00:24:15,"- Yeah, they're rolling around and stuff."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"- Exactly, yeah, the cube tea pots."
00:24:17,00:24:22,"So it's, yeah, it's just a really cool tea pot shape."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"It's, sorry, cube shape."
00:24:24,00:24:27,It was invented by a guy called Robert Crawford Johnson.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"And it's still going, like it's a big cube tea pot's limited,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,it's a big thing.
00:24:32,00:24:34,"It's easy for storage as well, 'cause you can pack them up,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"you know, like those square watermelons that you get."
00:24:36,00:24:38,"- Yeah, but the nozzle's gonna get in the way,"
00:24:38,00:24:39,but I do see that point.
00:24:39,00:24:43,"But it's quite hard to make square ceramics, isn't it?"
00:24:43,00:24:46,"It's like, 'cause you have the joints"
00:24:46,00:24:48,"are really, really difficult to make them watertight."
00:24:48,00:24:51,"- Yeah, interestingly, it does not have a nozzle."
00:24:51,00:24:54,"- Which is interesting, which is why you can pack it, yeah."
00:24:54,00:24:56,- Does it have a handle?
00:24:56,00:24:58,"- It does have a handle, yeah."
00:24:58,00:24:59,"- 'Cause I was gonna say,"
00:24:59,00:25:02,"it's like I'm a little cubic tea pot, shorted out."
00:25:02,00:25:04,I don't have an handle and I don't have a nozzle.
00:25:04,00:25:06,(laughing)
00:25:06,00:25:10,"- So it's just, it sounds like they're boxes."
00:25:10,00:25:12,"- Yeah, it's a cardboard box."
00:25:12,00:25:14,(laughing)
00:25:14,00:25:18,"- And you write teapot on the side in crayon,"
00:25:18,00:25:21,"hung it on the ship, give it to the Marines."
00:25:21,00:25:22,- They'll know what to do with it.
00:25:22,00:25:23,(laughing)
00:25:23,00:25:27,- Do you know that the oldest petrol station in America
00:25:27,00:25:28,is shaped like a teapot?
00:25:28,00:25:31,- No.
00:25:31,00:25:35,"- So, this is at least claimed to be"
00:25:35,00:25:38,the oldest petrol station in the country.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"It's in Zilla, which is in Washington state,"
00:25:40,00:25:45,"and it opened in around 1920s, '21, '22, something like that."
00:25:45,00:25:47,And the reason it's shaped like a teapot
00:25:47,00:25:51,"is it's based on the teapot dome scandal,"
00:25:51,00:25:52,which was a bribery scandal
00:25:52,00:25:54,during the presidency of Warren Harding.
00:25:54,00:25:56,And there was an oil field
00:25:56,00:25:59,"that was known as the teapot dome oil field,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,and someone had been paying to get their hands
00:26:01,00:26:03,on this oil field.
00:26:03,00:26:06,And the teapot dome oil field was named
00:26:06,00:26:08,"after a teapot-shaped rock,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,which was in the middle of the field.
00:26:10,00:26:11,(laughing)
00:26:11,00:26:12,"And then that became the name of the scandal,"
00:26:12,00:26:16,which became the name of the first petrol station.
00:26:16,00:26:17,- Amazing. - Weird.
00:26:17,00:26:19,- You wouldn't guess a teapot-shaped petrol station
00:26:19,00:26:22,was associated with mass government corruption.
00:26:22,00:26:24,So that was what it was nodding towards.
00:26:24,00:26:26,You'd think they probably sell tea.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"- Yeah, they probably built it thinking,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,"""Oh, this'll be one in the eye for the government, won't it?"""
00:26:30,00:26:32,"Everyone will see this for hundreds of years,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,and the first thing they'll think
00:26:34,00:26:36,"is what an arsehole Warren Harding was,"
00:26:36,00:26:37,"but actually what everyone thinks is,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,"""Oh, that looks like a teapot."""
00:26:39,00:26:41,"- Sorry, do they call the nozzle the spout?"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"- Spout, yeah. (laughing)"
00:26:44,00:26:47,"- I know a completely random thing about Zilla,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"just to chuck in this very small town,"
00:26:49,00:26:50,"which is that they've got a church there,"
00:26:50,00:26:52,"the Church of God in Zilla,"
00:26:52,00:26:56,"and they have a giant 10-foot tall T-Rex out the front of it,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"or they used to, which is dubbed"
00:26:58,00:27:00,and known to the locals as Godzilla.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"- Oh, no way."
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- Yeah, and so it's become an attraction."
00:27:03,00:27:06,You go and see Godzilla at the Church of God.
00:27:06,00:27:09,- And what kind of corruption was that a metaphor for?
00:27:09,00:27:11,(laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:13,It was a lizard selling scandal
00:27:13,00:27:15,in the presidency of Taft.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"- It's quite confusing, 'cause Godzilla, am I right,"
00:27:19,00:27:20,is not a T-Rex.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"- Yep, you're raising a very obvious point."
00:27:23,00:27:24,(laughing)
00:27:24,00:27:26,"- Outch. - Yeah, very obvious."
00:27:26,00:27:28,- Fine. - I'm saying what I mean
00:27:28,00:27:30,is everyone was thinking it.
00:27:30,00:27:32,"- I speak for the people when I say,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,I wonder what happened to the Teasmaid.
00:27:35,00:27:37,Does anyone else ever wonder that?
00:27:37,00:27:38,- Sorry.
00:27:38,00:27:41,- You know the Teasmaids that our parents reminisce about?
00:27:41,00:27:43,- 2016 by the Metropolitan Police
00:27:43,00:27:46,when they decided to outsource the--
00:27:46,00:27:47,- That's the other--
00:27:47,00:27:49,- I don't know what a Teasmaid is.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"- So a Teasmaid was what,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,it's like a little thing that you have
00:27:52,00:27:54,"on the side of your bed that not only is the alarm clock,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,but it also makes your cup of tea in the morning.
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Yeah, it's the thing that makes your tea."
00:27:57,00:28:00,"Everyone sort of had them in the '50s, '60s, '70s."
00:28:00,00:28:01,"- Wow, that's right. - And the first ones"
00:28:01,00:28:03,were actually in 1891.
00:28:03,00:28:04,The first one was made.
00:28:04,00:28:06,It was called the Early Rises Friend.
00:28:06,00:28:09,And it was basically an alarm clock.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"But apparently in the description of the patent,"
00:28:11,00:28:14,you replace the spring of the clock with cat gut.
00:28:14,00:28:19,"And when the alarm vibrated, the cat gut struck a match."
00:28:19,00:28:22,"So it like pulled a match, it struck against the surface,"
00:28:22,00:28:25,"which lit some, you know, a bit of wick,"
00:28:25,00:28:28,"oiled wick, which boiled water."
00:28:28,00:28:30,And then the boiled water would tip itself
00:28:30,00:28:32,into a cup of tea.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"It sounds a little bit like,"
00:28:33,00:28:36,I don't know if any of you guys ever played Mousetrap
00:28:36,00:28:39,"as kids, you know, that thing that just never works."
00:28:39,00:28:41,"- Yeah, sounds like an OK Go video."
00:28:43,00:28:46,It's like a heat-robbing machine or whatever they're called.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"- We've all found a reference that fits us,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,"apart from Anna here, so."
00:28:50,00:28:52,- Anna said Anna had Mousetrap.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"- Mousetrap, Mousetrap. - OK, sorry."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"- Yeah, I don't recall hearing anything from you, Andy."
00:28:56,00:28:59,You've been particularly silent for references on this one.
00:28:59,00:29:00,"- Oh, dear."
00:29:00,00:29:02,"- Agree with the rest of us, haven't you,"
00:29:02,00:29:03,in this big old reference off.
00:29:03,00:29:06,(laughing)
00:29:06,00:29:08,"But anyway, tea's made about a quarter of households"
00:29:08,00:29:09,had them in the '70s.
00:29:09,00:29:11,And I've always wanted one.
00:29:11,00:29:14,And they were ruined according to various articles
00:29:14,00:29:17,in the early '90s by Norma Major.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"So, Norma Major in an interview, as in John Major."
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- Can you just say who, yeah, yeah."
00:29:21,00:29:22,"- Sorry, yes."
00:29:22,00:29:26,"Just for international or younger listeners,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Norma Major was John Major,"
00:29:27,00:29:28,Prime Minister John Major's wife.
00:29:28,00:29:31,And she said in an interview that her tea's made
00:29:31,00:29:33,was the pride and joy of her bedroom
00:29:33,00:29:36,and almost immediately sales of tea's made plummeted so far.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"- I've gotta say, that's a bit of a slam on John Major"
00:29:39,00:29:40,to say that your tea's made is the pride
00:29:40,00:29:42,and joy of your bedroom.
00:29:42,00:29:43,(laughing)
00:29:43,00:29:46,- He was normally downstairs enjoying a curry.
00:29:46,00:29:50,"- Hey, good luck getting that one international listener."
00:29:50,00:29:51,(laughing)
00:29:51,00:29:54,"- Google it, and then you'll have a good old laugh."
00:29:54,00:29:55,- It's very funny.
00:29:55,00:29:57,(upbeat music)
00:29:57,00:30:02,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,and that is Andy.
00:30:04,00:30:06,- My fact is that the ninth longest running
00:30:06,00:30:10,British soap ever was designed exclusively to sell soap.
00:30:10,00:30:12,- Nice.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- And you mean soap, when I first read this fact,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,I genuinely forgot the other meaning of the word soap.
00:30:16,00:30:18,So I just thought you meant a bar of soap.
00:30:18,00:30:19,The ninth longest running bar of soap
00:30:19,00:30:20,was designed to sell soap.
00:30:20,00:30:22,"And I thought, of course it bloody was."
00:30:22,00:30:23,(laughing)
00:30:23,00:30:24,"- Great point, very good point."
00:30:24,00:30:27,"I do mean a soap opera, yeah."
00:30:27,00:30:28,"So this is a spin-off,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,'cause last week we were talking about laundry.
00:30:30,00:30:31,"And afterwards, I just,"
00:30:31,00:30:34,I remembered that we'd spoken about Dazz briefly
00:30:34,00:30:36,in the recording and I started reading about Dazz.
00:30:36,00:30:40,"And I found out that for 18 years from 2002 to '19,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"inclusive, they had a soap opera,"
00:30:42,00:30:45,"which was in advert form, which was about Dazz."
00:30:45,00:30:49,And they got soap opera stars to be in the Dazz adverts
00:30:49,00:30:52,in similar roles to in the actual soaps they were in.
00:30:52,00:30:55,"It's basically, you know, the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,where everyone kind of meets all these characters
00:30:57,00:30:58,from all over the place.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"This is like that, 'cause they've got people from Corey,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"EastEnders, Brookside, Hollyoaks,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,they're all in the same world mingling
00:31:03,00:31:05,and interacting with each other.
00:31:05,00:31:07,It's very much the most ambitious crossover
00:31:07,00:31:09,"in television history, isn't it?"
00:31:09,00:31:12,"- It is, it absolutely is."
00:31:12,00:31:13,It's called Cleaner Close.
00:31:13,00:31:15,- Does it count as a soap opera
00:31:15,00:31:18,if it's actually an advert or not?
00:31:18,00:31:20,"- Well, what a great point, James."
00:31:20,00:31:21,And what a time to raise it.
00:31:21,00:31:26,The Wikipedia on it reports that episodes have a character
00:31:26,00:31:28,"who does not use Dazz, which causes them problems,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,which are solved by a character who uses Dazz.
00:31:31,00:31:34,"So, I mean, I don't think anyone was waiting,"
00:31:34,00:31:35,tuning in each week.
00:31:35,00:31:38,It wasn't like it ran for a thousand episodes or anything.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"- Well, you'd only get like a couple of episodes a year,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"wouldn't you, 'cause they'd rerun the adverts and stuff."
00:31:43,00:31:44,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:31:44,00:31:47,"But fortunately, I don't think that is the dividing line"
00:31:47,00:31:48,between soap and non-soap.
00:31:48,00:31:52,And so I'm claiming that this is long-running soap.
00:31:52,00:31:56,- And what do they do in the ad breaks of the Dazz soap?
00:31:56,00:31:59,"- They have extremely short ad breaks in those,"
00:31:59,00:32:02,where they actually sell Purcell with another ad.
00:32:02,00:32:06,- So it's like a little Russian doll of soap operas.
00:32:06,00:32:08,How come we've never seen this?
00:32:08,00:32:09,I've never seen this.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"- I know it quite well, yeah."
00:32:10,00:32:11,"- Yeah, I've never seen it."
00:32:11,00:32:13,- A lot of people who listen to this podcast
00:32:13,00:32:15,"will be very familiar with this advertising campaign,"
00:32:15,00:32:16,or I can clean a close.
00:32:16,00:32:18,- More people will have known it
00:32:18,00:32:21,than will have read Annika Rennerna.
00:32:21,00:32:24,"We're not gonna spoil her either this week, but,"
00:32:24,00:32:24,"but it's really pleasing,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,"'cause this is back to the original days of soap operas,"
00:32:26,00:32:30,"which were sponsored by soap companies, soap manufacturers."
00:32:30,00:32:33,"The very first ever soap opera, which started in 1930,"
00:32:33,00:32:36,"was sponsored by Parmoliv,"
00:32:36,00:32:40,who wanted ads for their super suds attached.
00:32:40,00:32:45,"And the reasoning was these are for women working at home,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,"housewives, and what are they like?"
00:32:46,00:32:47,"Well, they probably like soap."
00:32:47,00:32:50,So let's try and sell them soap while they listen
00:32:50,00:32:52,and are at home.
00:32:52,00:32:55,- Do you know how Parmoliv got the name just as an aside?
00:32:55,00:32:56,- No.
00:32:56,00:32:58,- I think you can guess probably.
00:32:58,00:32:59,- All right.
00:32:59,00:33:01,"- Was it founded by a woman called Olive,"
00:33:01,00:33:03,"who had huge, sweaty palms."
00:33:03,00:33:04,(laughing)
00:33:04,00:33:05,Always needed to wash them.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"- Yeah, it's a good guess."
00:33:08,00:33:11,"I reckon the people at home might have worked it out already,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,but the two oils that it was made from
00:33:13,00:33:15,were Parmol and Olive Oil.
00:33:15,00:33:18,"- Oh yeah, that makes more sense than the hand thing."
00:33:18,00:33:21,"- Yeah, that makes more sense, I'd like to say."
00:33:21,00:33:24,"Just different, truer."
00:33:25,00:33:27,"- But people hated soaps from the start, right?"
00:33:27,00:33:29,There was never a heyday where soaps were considered
00:33:29,00:33:32,a high culture thing.
00:33:32,00:33:35,They were railed against from that early 1930s.
00:33:35,00:33:38,They were 15 minutes long and most newspaper articles
00:33:38,00:33:40,when they write about them say basically about four to five
00:33:40,00:33:43,"of those 15 minutes of these blimmin' adverts,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,"all of which start with, as you say, Andy,"
00:33:45,00:33:48,"ladies, have you tried XYZ?"
00:33:48,00:33:52,And they were sometimes called washboard weepers.
00:33:52,00:33:55,That was an alternative name for soaps in the '40s.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"- But I think really it was snobbishness, wasn't it?"
00:33:58,00:34:00,And also the fact that they were aimed towards women
00:34:00,00:34:01,and often made by women.
00:34:01,00:34:06,So like one of the real first amazing writers
00:34:06,00:34:09,for soap operas was someone called Anna Phillips.
00:34:09,00:34:12,"And she was incredibly, incredible writer."
00:34:12,00:34:16,She wrote two million words a year at her best.
00:34:16,00:34:18,- And she was often suggesting new colours
00:34:18,00:34:19,"for the Crayola Company, wasn't she?"
00:34:19,00:34:20,- Yes.
00:34:20,00:34:22,- A lot of her were lounges.
00:34:22,00:34:26,- She invented things like the cliffhanger ending.
00:34:26,00:34:27,That was her idea.
00:34:27,00:34:29,But she was kind of the queen of soap operas
00:34:29,00:34:31,"in the early, early days in the '30s."
00:34:31,00:34:33,"- Yeah, she had a show which was called Painted Dreams,"
00:34:33,00:34:35,which was the very first one that she did.
00:34:35,00:34:38,So that started airing in 1930.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"And she was asked, can you come up with a daily show"
00:34:41,00:34:43,that would show the sort of home life of people?
00:34:43,00:34:45,"And as you say, it was sort of treated like,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"""Ugh, what is this lowbrow nonsense?"""
00:34:48,00:34:50,"But actually, for the time, it was 1930,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,the characters that she created
00:34:52,00:34:55,were incredibly strong women on the show.
00:34:55,00:34:57,And there were virtually no regular male characters
00:34:57,00:34:59,in it whatsoever.
00:34:59,00:35:02,So she really pushed forward this idea
00:35:02,00:35:05,"that women were more than what society was saying they were,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,"that they were much more, they were cleverer,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,they were more ambitious.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"And so that was sort of like a beautiful,"
00:35:11,00:35:14,little secret movement to push women's rights.
00:35:14,00:35:15,- Yeah.
00:35:15,00:35:17,- But it must have made a difference
00:35:17,00:35:19,"because they were so popular straight away, weren't they?"
00:35:19,00:35:22,"I think by like the, it started in 1930,"
00:35:22,00:35:27,"by 1940, 92% of programs on the radio were soaps, basically."
00:35:27,00:35:31,It was like 25 of the 30 top-rated programs were soaps.
00:35:31,00:35:34,So maybe they are the cause of women's lip.
00:35:34,00:35:38,"- Well, they did have a lot to say for society"
00:35:38,00:35:41,because the person who came after Ernest Phillips
00:35:41,00:35:42,was Agnes Nixon.
00:35:42,00:35:44,So she was in the '50s and '60s.
00:35:44,00:35:46,She was like the successor of Ernest Phillips.
00:35:46,00:35:49,"And she not only wrote very strong characters,"
00:35:49,00:35:53,but she also wrote about a lot of societal problems.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"You know, these days, when you're so proper,"
00:35:55,00:35:56,"she'll have lots of, you know,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"echoing the problems of society, they'll do that."
00:35:58,00:36:01,And she was really the first one who decided to do that.
00:36:01,00:36:04,And there was one time where one of her characters
00:36:04,00:36:08,had cervical cancer and they found it through a smear test.
00:36:08,00:36:12,And that really was the time that the taboo over smear tests
00:36:12,00:36:15,"really kind of was, obviously it's still there a little bit,"
00:36:15,00:36:18,"but it was like, it was completely taboo before that."
00:36:18,00:36:20,And this really made a massive difference
00:36:20,00:36:22,and loads more women got tested after that.
00:36:22,00:36:25,- That's very cool. - That was in 1962.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"- Wow, didn't know they had smear tests back then."
00:36:28,00:36:30,"- Yeah, early days."
00:36:30,00:36:32,- Another thing that Ernest Phillips innovated
00:36:32,00:36:34,in the soap field was having an organ player.
00:36:34,00:36:39,And most soaps then just had an organ player
00:36:39,00:36:42,as part of the regular employees
00:36:42,00:36:47,"whose job was just to give a ""da da da da da da"""
00:36:47,00:36:50,in between scenes. - Did they do that?
00:36:50,00:36:51,"- I don't know if they played that specific piece,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,"but they did have, you know."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"- There's TV shows in Australia,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,the soaps like Home and Away and Neighbours are quite famous
00:36:57,00:37:00,"for giving us a lot of big stars that are now,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,"you know, Kylie Minot and so on,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,"sort of all got, you know, cut their teeth on that show."
00:37:05,00:37:07,And I didn't really-- - Sorry.
00:37:07,00:37:09,- Kylie is massive.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"- Yeah, she's also has said I was the dog."
00:37:11,00:37:14,She's so big that most of us know what her surname is.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"- Minot, guys. - Minot."
00:37:16,00:37:18,"Like the fish, the small fish."
00:37:18,00:37:20,She's literally not a Minot.
00:37:20,00:37:22,She's a big fish. - Kylie Minot.
00:37:22,00:37:24,- She is quite petite though.
00:37:24,00:37:26,- I have been saying Minot my whole life.
00:37:26,00:37:27,"- Well, she nicknamed,"
00:37:27,00:37:28,that would have been a good nickname for her at school
00:37:28,00:37:30,"'cause she was, she's so petite."
00:37:30,00:37:32,"- For all I know, she was Minot."
00:37:32,00:37:34,"Hasn't like, that's technically the correct way"
00:37:34,00:37:35,"to pronounce it, but that's not the way"
00:37:35,00:37:37,anyone in the world is pronouncing it.
00:37:37,00:37:40,"- No, you're right, now that he points it out,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,I do know that every other person who's ever said the name
00:37:42,00:37:45,"to me in my entire life has said it with the GUE,"
00:37:45,00:37:48,sort of really punctuated.
00:37:48,00:37:49,"Migno, Migno."
00:37:49,00:37:51,(all laughing)
00:37:51,00:37:54,"Listen, whatever she's called,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,neighbors gave her to us.
00:37:56,00:37:59,"And, well, I've lost my place now."
00:37:59,00:38:02,"So basically, Corrie, Coronation Street,"
00:38:02,00:38:05,the street is responsible for quite a lot
00:38:05,00:38:06,of big actors as well that we now have.
00:38:06,00:38:09,So people who sort of debuted on it
00:38:09,00:38:11,include Sir Ben Kingsley.
00:38:11,00:38:13,He was a Coronation Street actor.
00:38:13,00:38:17,"Yeah, Davy Jones of the Monkeys."
00:38:17,00:38:20,He came out of Coronation Street.
00:38:20,00:38:21,He had a little role in that.
00:38:21,00:38:24,And so did Joanna Lumley.
00:38:24,00:38:26,"So, you know, yeah, the soaps are responsible"
00:38:26,00:38:30,"for some of our biggest highbrow actors as well,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,Kingsley and Lumley.
00:38:32,00:38:36,"- Yeah, Davy Jones, he doesn't slot into that category."
00:38:36,00:38:37,- Not quite.
00:38:37,00:38:38,- He's the wild card.
00:38:38,00:38:39,- You can be promoted on soap operas.
00:38:39,00:38:41,So I really like this.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"So there's a guy, there's an actor called Bill Tarny,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,who is very famous in soap world.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"He played Jack Duckworth, right?"
00:38:49,00:38:51,"And he started out, he's Corrie, isn't he?"
00:38:51,00:38:52,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:38:52,00:38:54,- He started out as an extra.
00:38:54,00:38:57,And his job was to play someone who was just out of shot.
00:38:57,00:38:58,- What?
00:38:58,00:39:00,(all laughing)
00:39:00,00:39:01,- You occasionally would see--
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Is he playing the doggen?
00:39:02,00:39:06,- You'd see one of his arms briefly
00:39:06,00:39:07,and occasionally in a shot.
00:39:07,00:39:09,But you would never see anything else of him.
00:39:09,00:39:10,That was his role.
00:39:10,00:39:11,"- Oh, come on."
00:39:11,00:39:11,"- And then, he's true."
00:39:11,00:39:13,"That was what he was initially cast as,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,was just someone else to show the someone else in the room.
00:39:15,00:39:18,- Did he have a really attractive arm or something?
00:39:18,00:39:20,"- He must have, because when he was promoted,"
00:39:20,00:39:23,"he then spent 31 years as a full body actor,"
00:39:23,00:39:24,as they're known in the biz.
00:39:24,00:39:27,"And yeah, that's a pleasing thing,"
00:39:27,00:39:28,the pleasing career progression.
00:39:28,00:39:30,- So he was supposed to be just out of shot.
00:39:30,00:39:32,So it was the idea that he's someone
00:39:32,00:39:34,for the other actors who are in shot to sort of look at.
00:39:34,00:39:36,So it's realistic that--
00:39:36,00:39:39,"- I think in a crowd scene with a pub or whatever,"
00:39:39,00:39:41,you don't just have two people sitting there
00:39:41,00:39:43,and you have to imagine that there's everyone else in the pub.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"You know, you have maybe an establishing shot"
00:39:45,00:39:47,"and then maybe you're next to someone at the pub,"
00:39:47,00:39:48,so your arms up against theirs.
00:39:48,00:39:50,So you occasionally see his arm.
00:39:50,00:39:51,- But then he's in shot.
00:39:51,00:39:53,"- Okay, his job was to be predominantly"
00:39:53,00:39:55,and almost always out of shot.
00:39:55,00:39:58,"- But then actually, when he got the main role"
00:39:58,00:40:02,"as Jack Duckworth, whenever he walked into a room,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,you would see his arm come in first.
00:40:04,00:40:06,(all laughing)
00:40:06,00:40:09,"- Here's Jack Duckworth, what he'll have to say."
00:40:09,00:40:11,"- Well, it's that sexy move that I think people do it"
00:40:11,00:40:14,in like some musicals in Chicago or something.
00:40:14,00:40:17,A woman in fishnet tights would project her leg in first
00:40:17,00:40:18,and then her body would follow.
00:40:18,00:40:20,Does he enter like that?
00:40:20,00:40:22,"- Yeah, that's exactly how he does it."
00:40:22,00:40:24,He's always wearing a very nice watch.
00:40:24,00:40:25,(all laughing)
00:40:25,00:40:27,(upbeat music)
00:40:27,00:40:33,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:40:33,00:40:35,That is Anna.
00:40:35,00:40:38,My fact this week is that if you take an hour long nap
00:40:38,00:40:39,"after listening to this show,"
00:40:39,00:40:42,you will remember five times as many facts from it.
00:40:42,00:40:44,- Wow.
00:40:44,00:40:45,- So do it.
00:40:45,00:40:45,- Cool.
00:40:45,00:40:48,- So five times more than we said on the show
00:40:48,00:40:51,or where are these extra facts coming from?
00:40:51,00:40:53,- Not everyone remembers every single fact
00:40:53,00:40:55,as well you should know on this podcast.
00:40:55,00:40:58,(all laughing)
00:40:58,00:41:01,"- Yes, five times as many as if you don't take a nap."
00:41:01,00:41:02,- Yeah.
00:41:02,00:41:04,"- So this, I really loved an app."
00:41:04,00:41:06,So I really enjoyed reading about this study
00:41:06,00:41:08,and generally a lot of studies that have come out
00:41:08,00:41:11,in the last couple of decades about how napping is great.
00:41:11,00:41:13,This one was from 2015.
00:41:13,00:41:14,"It was quite a small cohort,"
00:41:14,00:41:19,but basically it gave participants 90 words to remember
00:41:19,00:41:21,and then 120 word pairs.
00:41:21,00:41:24,So that's two random words paired together.
00:41:24,00:41:28,And so like milk taxi is the example they give in the study.
00:41:28,00:41:29,- Is that random?
00:41:29,00:41:30,"- And, sorry?"
00:41:30,00:41:31,- Is that random?
00:41:31,00:41:33,"- Milk taxi, you could make a link there."
00:41:33,00:41:35,"- Yeah, well, I mean, there is of course the milk taxi"
00:41:35,00:41:37,that follows the teapot one around.
00:41:37,00:41:39,(all laughing)
00:41:39,00:41:40,"- In all subsequent studies,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,they're gonna have to remove that word pair now.
00:41:42,00:41:43,We've ruined it for people.
00:41:43,00:41:45,"'Cause yeah, they have to be so unrelated"
00:41:45,00:41:47,"that you can't have a familiar connection,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,which sort of allows you to cheat and remember it.
00:41:49,00:41:52,"Anyway, they gave these 120 word pairs to people"
00:41:52,00:41:55,and then half the participants had to watch DVDs
00:41:55,00:41:58,"and the other half took naps for,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,it was an hour and a half in fact.
00:42:00,00:42:03,"And the nappers afterwards were five times better,"
00:42:03,00:42:04,remembering the word pairs
00:42:04,00:42:06,than the ones who'd watched the DVD.
00:42:06,00:42:08,"And in fact, I find this astonishing,"
00:42:08,00:42:12,the people who'd had the nap remembered exactly as much
00:42:12,00:42:14,as they would have if they'd just been asked
00:42:14,00:42:15,immediately afterwards.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"So you know how, you know,"
00:42:17,00:42:18,"as soon as a couple of hours have passed,"
00:42:18,00:42:20,then you forget the majority of stuff
00:42:20,00:42:21,that you've immediately heard.
00:42:21,00:42:23,They remembered exactly the same amount
00:42:23,00:42:24,as if they'd just been asked.
00:42:24,00:42:27,"- I wonder if, so, Finella has a laptop"
00:42:27,00:42:29,that she was given by work
00:42:29,00:42:31,and it was formatted by the people at her work
00:42:31,00:42:35,and the password to log into the computer is catbus111.
00:42:35,00:42:36,I can say that it's lockdown.
00:42:36,00:42:38,"No one's taking her computer, it's fine."
00:42:38,00:42:42,But immediately both of us went catbus.
00:42:42,00:42:43,What the hell is a catbus?
00:42:43,00:42:45,Why would you ever use catbus?
00:42:45,00:42:48,And both of us have never forgotten it.
00:42:48,00:42:50,Like the conversation and the pairing of it
00:42:50,00:42:52,was just so bizarre that it's a connection
00:42:52,00:42:53,that's stuck in your head.
00:42:53,00:42:55,"- Also another thing that's interesting, Dad,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,is now everyone listening to this will never forget it.
00:42:57,00:42:59,So when we are out of lockdown
00:42:59,00:43:01,"in the not too distant future, we hope"
00:43:01,00:43:05,that everyone will be able to steal your wife's laptop.
00:43:05,00:43:07,- I'll change it after this episode.
00:43:07,00:43:08,I'll reset the password.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"- Try buscat, everyone."
00:43:10,00:43:14,"- Two, two, two."
00:43:14,00:43:16,- My password is coolguy123
00:43:16,00:43:18,because no one's ever caught me that.
00:43:18,00:43:22,- Two totally unassociated concepts.
00:43:22,00:43:23,That's what you need.
00:43:23,00:43:27,I quite like this study also
00:43:27,00:43:31,because of the choice of DVDs that the participants were given.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"So, like I said, some got to go to sleep,"
00:43:34,00:43:35,some had to watch these DVDs.
00:43:35,00:43:39,And it was two DVDs that lasted in total two hours.
00:43:39,00:43:43,"One was called ""Relaxing the Most Beautiful Landscapes on Earth."""
00:43:43,00:43:45,And it was just what it sounds like.
00:43:45,00:43:47,And both had only instrumental music.
00:43:47,00:43:50,"And the other is called ""Power Catzy."""
00:43:50,00:43:53,And it sounds like the maddest thing ever.
00:43:53,00:43:55,So it's only instrumental.
00:43:55,00:43:58,And it's this weird experimental film made in the 80s
00:43:58,00:44:01,about the conflict in third world countries
00:44:01,00:44:02,between traditional ways of life
00:44:02,00:44:06,and the new ways of life introduced with industrialization
00:44:06,00:44:09,but all shown in very surrealist instrumental form.
00:44:09,00:44:13,And so I'm kind of amazed that they managed to stay awake
00:44:13,00:44:14,through that two hours.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"- So yeah, I wonder if the study is about"
00:44:18,00:44:21,how good it is to nap to remember things
00:44:21,00:44:25,or whether watching weird DVDs just really distract you.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"It could be that, couldn't it?"
00:44:27,00:44:28,"If the DVD had been something else,"
00:44:28,00:44:30,"like ""Stop All My Mommles Shoots"""
00:44:30,00:44:33,"or ""Growing Ups 2"" or something like that."
00:44:33,00:44:35,"- ""Stop All My Mommles Shoots."""
00:44:35,00:44:37,I think that's the second time you've ever referenced
00:44:37,00:44:40,that extremely obscure Sylvester Stallone movie.
00:44:40,00:44:44,- We finally found the only film James has actually seen.
00:44:44,00:44:48,- I just watched it again and again and again.
00:44:48,00:44:52,And you guys know my memory for facts is extremely good.
00:44:52,00:44:54,So maybe if we'd given these guys
00:44:54,00:44:56,"""Stop All My Mommles Shoots"" to watch."
00:44:56,00:44:58,"- To be fair, if that had been the first film you'd seen,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,I could understand why you didn't watch any other film
00:45:00,00:45:02,James had put a few years ago.
00:45:02,00:45:03,Because there's no point.
00:45:03,00:45:05,"You know, why climb any other mountains"
00:45:05,00:45:06,when you started with Everest?
00:45:06,00:45:07,You know?
00:45:07,00:45:09,- Exactly.
00:45:09,00:45:10,"By the way, I looked up"
00:45:10,00:45:12,whether there was such thing as a milk taxi.
00:45:12,00:45:14,I don't know if any of the rest of you did.
00:45:14,00:45:16,And this is a new product.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"Well, actually it was made in 2005"
00:45:18,00:45:20,by a company called Holm and Lau.
00:45:20,00:45:25,And they revolutionized bucket feeding for calves
00:45:25,00:45:27,by the invention of the milk taxi.
00:45:27,00:45:29,And it's almost like a bucket
00:45:29,00:45:31,that kind of drives around the farm
00:45:31,00:45:34,and goes to the calves
00:45:34,00:45:36,and gives them exactly the right amount of feed
00:45:36,00:45:39,and exactly the right amount of milk that they need.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"It's a bit like a tea's made, but for cows."
00:45:42,00:45:43,- Wow.
00:45:43,00:45:44,- Is it like a robotic udder though?
00:45:44,00:45:47,Because obviously they want an udder to suck a lad.
00:45:47,00:45:50,- I couldn't quite tell from the picture.
00:45:50,00:45:53,"They look more like milk churns on wheels,"
00:45:53,00:45:55,but I couldn't quite tell.
00:45:55,00:45:56,But it is a thing.
00:45:56,00:45:57,"So, you know."
00:45:57,00:45:58,- Wow.
00:45:58,00:45:59,- You could call it a tits made
00:45:59,00:46:02,"because it's flying around, keeping your milk."
00:46:02,00:46:03,- Yeah.
00:46:03,00:46:04,"- God, how bizarre."
00:46:04,00:46:06,- Speaking of weird portmanteau words
00:46:06,00:46:07,that I already regret saying.
00:46:07,00:46:10,Have you guys heard of the napatino?
00:46:10,00:46:12,I'm sure you have in the course of this research.
00:46:12,00:46:13,"- Napatino, what's that?"
00:46:13,00:46:14,- I haven't actually.
00:46:14,00:46:15,"I can guess what it is,"
00:46:15,00:46:17,but also it sounds too much like the word nappy
00:46:17,00:46:18,and would put me off.
00:46:18,00:46:19,"- It's a practice, it's a habit, it's a behavior."
00:46:19,00:46:23,It's where you drink a coffee and then you have a nap.
00:46:23,00:46:25,And you have to take a brief nap
00:46:25,00:46:27,because then you wake up super charged
00:46:27,00:46:29,"just as you come out of the sleep, the caffeine hits."
00:46:29,00:46:30,It takes about 20 minutes.
00:46:30,00:46:32,"- That's quite advanced, I think,"
00:46:32,00:46:34,'cause I'm a bit of a napper as well.
00:46:34,00:46:37,And I did read about the idea of having a coffee first
00:46:37,00:46:38,"and I tried it a few times,"
00:46:38,00:46:41,"but if you can't get straight to sleep,"
00:46:41,00:46:43,then the caffeine hits you
00:46:43,00:46:45,just as you think you're about to fall asleep
00:46:45,00:46:46,and you just have a massive high
00:46:46,00:46:48,and you can't sleep anymore.
00:46:48,00:46:48,So I think you need to be--
00:46:48,00:46:49,- Must be tense.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"- Yeah, you need to be one of the nappers"
00:46:51,00:46:53,"who can really kind of just go like a light immediately,"
00:46:53,00:46:54,whereas I'm not really one of those.
00:46:54,00:46:56,It takes me a few minutes to get in.
00:46:56,00:46:58,- I've always thought that my dad invented that
00:46:58,00:47:01,"'cause I know, so I've read about that concept before,"
00:47:01,00:47:02,but he always did it at car journeys when we were kids.
00:47:02,00:47:06,"You'd stop in a service station, down a double espresso,"
00:47:06,00:47:07,and then he was one of these--
00:47:07,00:47:08,- And then fall asleep when driving home.
00:47:08,00:47:09,- Back by the wheel.
00:47:09,00:47:11,(laughing)
00:47:11,00:47:12,"- Look, you're parked."
00:47:12,00:47:14,It's actually incredibly boring for four children in the back.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"You're in a parked car for 15 minutes,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,but it's just 15 solid minutes.
00:47:18,00:47:22,"Wake up, and it's like, you know, your new woman."
00:47:22,00:47:23,- Did it work?
00:47:23,00:47:24,"- It worked like a dream, he claimed,"
00:47:24,00:47:26,but I'm with James.
00:47:26,00:47:27,"I don't think I could fall asleep like that on command,"
00:47:27,00:47:29,and then it's just annoying.
00:47:29,00:47:31,"- I can't, I think I could do that,"
00:47:31,00:47:33,"but I don't drink coffee, so it's wasted."
00:47:33,00:47:36,- One way that I nap quite probably once a week
00:47:36,00:47:39,is this is a good way of getting to sleep
00:47:39,00:47:41,"is 'cause I edit this podcast every week,"
00:47:41,00:47:43,I have to then listen back to it
00:47:43,00:47:45,to kind of make sure that narratively
00:47:45,00:47:47,it all makes sense from start to finish.
00:47:47,00:47:49,And I think a good way to do that
00:47:49,00:47:51,is kind of lie down in bed while I'm listening to it.
00:47:51,00:47:53,"And I usually get past about one fact,"
00:47:53,00:47:56,"and then I'm gone, (laughing)"
00:47:56,00:47:58,and then I have to go all the way back to the start
00:47:58,00:47:59,and do it again.
00:47:59,00:48:02,"But I think like nothing to podcast is a thing, isn't it?"
00:48:02,00:48:05,And I read an article about this.
00:48:05,00:48:07,This was a guy called Craig Richard
00:48:07,00:48:09,from Shenandoah University.
00:48:09,00:48:11,"He wrote a book called Brain Tingles,"
00:48:11,00:48:13,which is about ASMR stuff.
00:48:13,00:48:15,And he said that human voice podcasts
00:48:15,00:48:18,are quite a good way of getting to sleep
00:48:18,00:48:23,"as long as they contain a calm host voice, kindness,"
00:48:23,00:48:25,which means basically you're not just having
00:48:25,00:48:26,"to go at people all the time,"
00:48:26,00:48:29,and generally banal content.
00:48:29,00:48:31,That's the things that you need. (laughing)
00:48:31,00:48:34,"- Well, at least we've got one out of three."
00:48:34,00:48:36,(laughing)
00:48:36,00:48:39,"We're not kind and Dan's always stressed, but."
00:48:39,00:48:41,(laughing)
00:48:41,00:48:43,"- Hey, do you guys know where you are allowed"
00:48:43,00:48:44,to nap at the wheel?
00:48:45,00:48:47,(laughing)
00:48:47,00:48:48,- Driverless car.
00:48:48,00:48:49,"- Oh, yeah."
00:48:49,00:48:51,"- No, no, you're definitely not allowed to."
00:48:51,00:48:52,"- Okay, definitely not."
00:48:52,00:48:53,"- Oh, you're not, okay."
00:48:53,00:48:56,"- So some kind of wheel, a ship's wheel."
00:48:56,00:48:57,"- Ship's wheel, possibly."
00:48:57,00:49:00,I didn't actually look through all the possibilities.
00:49:00,00:49:02,- Maybe at the roulette table.
00:49:02,00:49:03,"- Oh, yes."
00:49:03,00:49:05,- Fairly nice. - Wake up refreshed.
00:49:05,00:49:06,- Put it all on number 17.
00:49:06,00:49:08,"- Yeah, wake up three hours later"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"and it's landed on 17, 200 times,"
00:49:10,00:49:12,and you own all the money in the world.
00:49:12,00:49:15,"- Bad gambling advice, we know that thing is a fish."
00:49:15,00:49:16,Is it a water wheel?
00:49:16,00:49:18,Wake up and you've got a loaf of bread made.
00:49:18,00:49:20,"- Oh, Dan, Dan, Dan, Potter's wheel."
00:49:20,00:49:23,"So you have hands there and then you just drop off,"
00:49:23,00:49:24,but you've made a perfect vase.
00:49:24,00:49:26,- A perfect cubicle teapot.
00:49:26,00:49:29,- Nope.
00:49:29,00:49:30,"- No, okay."
00:49:30,00:49:31,- Please put us out of our misery for God's sake.
00:49:31,00:49:32,"- Oh, no, no, there are more."
00:49:32,00:49:34,"- I'm trying, I'm trying."
00:49:34,00:49:36,(laughing)
00:49:36,00:49:39,"Christ's sake, drive in five minutes."
00:49:39,00:49:42,"- Go on, Andy."
00:49:42,00:49:44,"I didn't have anything, I was just stalling"
00:49:44,00:49:45,so James could think of another wheel.
00:49:45,00:49:47,"- I know, I'm thinking the wheel of fortune,"
00:49:47,00:49:49,the TV game show.
00:49:49,00:49:52,"- It's not that either,"
00:49:52,00:49:57,it is in the cockpit as a pilot at the wheel of a plane.
00:49:57,00:49:58,- There's no wheel at a plane?
00:49:58,00:50:01,"Come on, how are we supposed to guess that?"
00:50:01,00:50:03,"- Well, you're at the wheel, you're at the wheel,"
00:50:03,00:50:05,like you said that you're at the wheel.
00:50:05,00:50:07,"- But wait a second, we've talked about this before,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,"pilots sleeping before, and it's a problem."
00:50:09,00:50:11,"They're definitely not allowed to do it, aren't they?"
00:50:11,00:50:14,"- Well, so, they're not really,"
00:50:14,00:50:16,"'cause there have been some horrible incidences,"
00:50:16,00:50:18,"like for example, in 2008,"
00:50:18,00:50:19,"both pilots fell asleep at the wheel,"
00:50:19,00:50:20,"and when they woke up,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,they just completely gone past
00:50:22,00:50:23,where they were meant to land in Hawaii.
00:50:23,00:50:25,"Just like, where are we?"
00:50:25,00:50:26,Way past where we're meant to be.
00:50:26,00:50:30,"But some countries, like Canada and Australia,"
00:50:30,00:50:33,allow for pilots to take naps in the cockpit.
00:50:33,00:50:36,"So basically, it's really strict rules,"
00:50:36,00:50:39,"but what they call it is a controlled rest in position,"
00:50:39,00:50:42,"C-R-I-P, and the idea is that the pilot can sleep"
00:50:42,00:50:44,"for no more than 40 minutes,"
00:50:44,00:50:45,must wake up at least half an hour
00:50:45,00:50:47,"before the descent of landing,"
00:50:47,00:50:49,"and they have to sort of tell everyone,"
00:50:49,00:50:50,"like, I'm gonna have a nap now,"
00:50:50,00:50:53,"and then they can go down for a nap,"
00:50:53,00:50:55,sitting in their position without worry
00:50:55,00:50:57,"that they might affect the controls,"
00:50:57,00:51:00,as long as obviously they have a co-pilot next to them.
00:51:00,00:51:01,So yeah. - Okay.
00:51:01,00:51:03,"- Wow, controlled rest in position,"
00:51:03,00:51:05,"that's a very good euphemism for saying,"
00:51:05,00:51:08,"having a little sis while you're at your seat, it's clever."
00:51:08,00:51:09,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:51:09,00:51:13,- There is another place where you used to be able
00:51:13,00:51:16,"and able to have a nap and no one would mind or object,"
00:51:16,00:51:19,and that was in the House of Lords in the UK.
00:51:19,00:51:24,"So there was a convention until 2018, I believe,"
00:51:24,00:51:26,"in the House of Lords that peers,"
00:51:26,00:51:30,"members of the House of Lords are never sleeping,"
00:51:30,00:51:33,they are resting their eyes and they're closing their eyes
00:51:33,00:51:36,and leaning back to really focus on the intellectual debate
00:51:36,00:51:39,and the laws that they're debating.
00:51:39,00:51:41,And then that was a lovely convention.
00:51:41,00:51:44,"And then in 2018, they were told off for sleeping"
00:51:44,00:51:46,in the chamber and kind of burst the bubble.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"- And then in 2019, they all ripped their eyelids off,"
00:51:48,00:51:49,didn't they?
00:51:49,00:51:52,(laughing)
00:51:52,00:51:53,- That's right.
00:51:53,00:51:54,- Did Buddha never have eyelids for the rest of his life?
00:51:54,00:51:56,"Sorry, I've been thinking about this ever since he said it."
00:51:56,00:51:58,(laughing)
00:51:58,00:51:59,"- They must have grown back, eh?"
00:51:59,00:52:00,- Did they grow back?
00:52:00,00:52:02,"- It's a really good point, Dan."
00:52:02,00:52:06,"I don't think the myth says, but it should."
00:52:06,00:52:09,- But Buddha had all sorts of weird physical attributes
00:52:09,00:52:10,"that I think we've discussed before, didn't he?"
00:52:10,00:52:12,Like tentacles coming out of his earlobes or whatever.
00:52:12,00:52:14,"I can't remember, you'll have to refer back."
00:52:14,00:52:16,"Yeah, exactly. - Super long tongue."
00:52:16,00:52:17,"- If they would have grown back,"
00:52:17,00:52:20,then that kind of defeats the gesture that he made.
00:52:20,00:52:22,"If he's just got another pair of eyelids under there,"
00:52:22,00:52:24,then I think that's a less impressive gesture
00:52:24,00:52:26,to repent you falling asleep in your work.
00:52:26,00:52:28,- He probably didn't know he did at the time though.
00:52:28,00:52:30,"When you do it for the first time, you can't be sure."
00:52:30,00:52:31,- That's true.
00:52:31,00:52:33,- I'll respect him for it.
00:52:33,00:52:35,"- The snooker player, Ronnie O'Sullivan,"
00:52:35,00:52:38,he has been seen napping even during competitive matches.
00:52:38,00:52:39,"- Yeah, he does."
00:52:39,00:52:41,- And he said his doctor advised him to do it.
00:52:41,00:52:44,But I really like this because obviously the nap in snooker
00:52:44,00:52:46,"is the direction of the cloth, isn't it?"
00:52:46,00:52:47,- Yeah.
00:52:47,00:52:48,- The bays.
00:52:48,00:52:50,So that's kind of pleasing.
00:52:50,00:52:53,- A lot of the other players think that he is doing it
00:52:53,00:52:55,to try and out psych them.
00:52:55,00:52:57,"It's like, 'cause when you play snooker,"
00:52:57,00:52:59,you're on the table or they're on the table.
00:52:59,00:53:00,"And when they're playing,"
00:53:00,00:53:01,you're just kind of sat in your chair
00:53:01,00:53:03,and there's nothing you can do.
00:53:03,00:53:05,But if you're sat there pretending to fall asleep
00:53:05,00:53:07,"and put in a flannel of your face like he does sometimes,"
00:53:07,00:53:10,then some people think that that's a bit bad form.
00:53:10,00:53:12,You know what I mean?
00:53:12,00:53:13,"- Well, get a nap on what you can."
00:53:13,00:53:14,It's the perfect chance.
00:53:14,00:53:15,It's fucking boring snooker.
00:53:15,00:53:19,"And he knows it, so you might as well have a snooze."
00:53:19,00:53:23,"- Okay, that's it."
00:53:23,00:53:24,That is all of our facts.
