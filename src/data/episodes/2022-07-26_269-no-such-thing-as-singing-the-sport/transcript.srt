00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (bluesing)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,400
 (bluesing)

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,700
 (speaking in foreign language)

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,760
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,680
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,520
 this week coming to you live from the Lowry in Salford.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,520
 (audience cheering)

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,740
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,640
 I am sitting here with Ani Chazinski,

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,120
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,600
 and in no particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,400
 Starting with fact number one,

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,160
 and that's my fact this week.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,800
 My fact is that in 17th century Europe,

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,420
 people used to sing each other the news.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,920
 (audience laughing)

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
 That's how they got the news.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,300
 It would be sung at their face.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,800
 ♪ There's been a theft ♪

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,600
 Like that, like that thing.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,440
 Yeah.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,280
 No, this is the thing.

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,480
 In the 17th century, illiteracy rates were so high

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,120
 that if they did publish newspapers,

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,960
 no one was really buying them because they couldn't read them.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,800
 So what they ended up doing was they were taking

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
 classic, classic ballads of the time,

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,480
 but then applying just the news of the data them.

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,240
 And so people would go on the streets

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,880
 and they would start singing the news

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,200
 and people would memorize the songs that they were singing

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,160
 and they would pass it on and pass it on.

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,840
 And that's how the news got around.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
 And so it was for everything from political news

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
 to sentimental stories, religious news,

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,320
 royal rumors, medical advice.

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,240
 Did they do like an unfindly at the end

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,280
 with a dog on a surfboard or something?

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,360
 (audience laughing)

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,480
 They did have a paywall.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,800
 So people plugged the ballads.

47
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
 So there were guys going around selling the ballads

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,760
 and they would sing them to the audience on the street

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,160
 going on to drum up interest,

50
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
 but they would not sing the last verse.

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
 So you didn't know how it ended.

52
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,080
 So there was a thing where it goes gray on the website,

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,640
 but that's an execution ballad.

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 How often was it?

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,920
 And he pulled his head out just in time.

56
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
 (audience laughing)

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
 Well, it is a bit like the internet today, isn't it?

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
 'Cause so they had these sheets

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,000
 that you could buy the sheet music if you wanted to

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,160
 and then you could share it on the streets by singing it

61
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,760
 and then it gave you ideas of morality

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,680
 and stuff like that.

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,000
 So it is a little bit like reading the news on the internet

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,040
 and then sharing it and then commenting on it.

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
 Yeah, yeah.

66
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,080
 Except it was just a lot more gruesome.

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
 I mean, they were kind of disgusting in their taste.

68
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
 I don't know if you've heard any of the news

69
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,440
 over the last few years.

70
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,600
 (audience laughing)

71
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,000
 The fact that I'm not on social media

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,280
 makes that an unreliable comment.

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
 But there was one.

74
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
 So there was a French song in fact,

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,600
 which was set to a really fun tune apparently.

76
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,120
 So they were like quite upbeat.

77
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,760
 And it was about a hugano whose execution got interrupted

78
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,960
 because the people thought that they weren't being harsh enough

79
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,320
 or just chopping his head off or hanging him, sorry,

80
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,240
 they were hanging him.

81
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,680
 And so the people dragged him to a dung heap

82
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,720
 and mutilated him and this ballad went,

83
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,040
 the little children all got together yelling

84
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,560
 and singing joyously, having a great time,

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
 pulling out his innards to throw them in the fire,

86
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
 removing his guts and organs

87
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
 and then a dog swallowed his heart.

88
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,720
 There you go, there you go.

89
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,320
 (audience laughing)

90
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 Doesn't even rhyme.

91
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,400
 (audience laughing)

92
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
 I think it rhymed in French to be there.

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,720
 But they used to as well, not just report the news,

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,880
 but in the execution ballads, this moral thing

95
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,720
 that James is talking about, they used to then do verses

96
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,520
 from the perspective of the person

97
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,600
 who was killed, guilty and her hanged.

98
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,800
 And that's where the moral would come in.

99
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
 They would suddenly, it was as if the news

100
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
 was reading a quote from someone,

101
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
 but that quote never existed.

102
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,760
 So they would be saying, oh, I lament what I did

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,200
 and I wish I had not done it.

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,720
 And oh, what a silly sausage I was.

105
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,400
 And that was the way of saying that everyone was upset

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,960
 about the crime they committed in a new show.

107
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
 This mortal life, I will depart

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,000
 to then a dog will swallow my heart.

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
 (audience laughing)

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,880
 And then you end.

111
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
 Yes?

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
 Yeah.

113
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
 That was really nice.

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
 That was really good.

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,400
 Born in the wrong century, mate.

116
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,960
 (audience laughing)

117
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,280
 And the nice thing was, it was tunes that everyone knew.

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
 So they used green sleeves for a load of ballads

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
 because you know, you couldn't say,

120
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,040
 you couldn't get people to sing a news

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,200
 if they didn't know the tune.

122
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,000
 That's so appropriate

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
 'cause didn't Henry VIII write that song?

124
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,600
 No.

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
 No, that is a myth.

126
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
 So it's completely...

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,960
 (audience laughing)

128
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
 Just a...

129
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,760
 No, no, no, there is a rumour that he did.

130
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,600
 Yeah.

131
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,960
 It was written around the same time as him.

132
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
 So he wrote it?

133
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
 I don't know.

134
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 (audience laughing)

135
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,680
 The thing is, if we think we have fake news now,

136
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
 I mean, this was out of control.

137
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,480
 So it was mostly kind of overheard gossip and rumours

138
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,120
 because so people having to sort of eavesdrop

139
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,800
 on diplomats and things like that

140
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,920
 and talk to people who talk to people who've been at court.

141
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,600
 And so there was even a proclamation in 1672,

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
 Charles II, in fact, issued a proclamation

143
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
 to restrain the spreading of false news,

144
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,160
 which is just very epresient.

145
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,160
 But there was even ballads about how they shouldn't write ballads

146
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,960
 that were so full of fake news.

147
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
 (audience laughing)

148
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
 A whole ballad that was taking the piss saying,

149
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,880
 "The all the ballads we hear these days

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,600
 are full of stories, stories, lies, and stories,

151
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,920
 a pox on your newsletters, they lie both and flatters,

152
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,840
 they are but a trap to weedle men in."

153
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,680
 Wow.

154
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
 There are some Manchester ones.

155
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,320
 It's so, I've read quite a few of them.

156
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,760
 And they include things like these are all ballads

157
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,880
 that were real, the spinners lamentation,

158
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,000
 Victoria Bridge on a Saturday night,

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,280
 and Johnny Green's trip from Oldham

160
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,000
 to see the Manchester Railway.

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,960
 (audience laughing)

162
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
 Sounds fun.

163
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,360
 I found a 17th century song, not telling the news,

164
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,800
 but just a ballad that survived the times.

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,320
 And the title of it is Kentish Dick

166
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,080
 or The Lusty Coachman of Westminster.

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,120
 And it was a story about a guy who moved to London

168
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,400
 and he would go around wooing women

169
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,960
 and he would trick them into believing

170
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,440
 that he was gonna be there for all of their life.

171
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,920
 And he would sleep with them and they might get pregnant

172
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,280
 and they thought they had a whole life with them

173
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,560
 and then he would just disappear

174
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,400
 and the whole song was teaching a moral

175
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,040
 and it has a line in it where the town seeks to sever from him

176
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
 that unruly limb.

177
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
 (audience laughing)

178
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,640
 Yeah.

179
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,960
 And then he was just called Kentish after that, wasn't he?

180
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,440
 (audience laughing)

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,480
 Do you know that under the town police

182
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,520
 clause is active 1847?

183
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
 It's still an offense to publicly sing

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,480
 any profane or obscene song or ballad in the street.

185
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
 - Is it?

186
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,440
 - Yeah, so you're not allowed to do it.

187
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
 - Oh.

188
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
 - So Andy, sorry.

189
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
 I don't know.

190
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,640
 - We could have performed Citizens' Arrest on

191
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,440
 all the people of Newcastle last night.

192
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,640
 (audience laughing)

193
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,400
 - And when I was looking that up, I found this,

194
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,760
 this isn't on topic at all,

195
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,280
 but I found out that there is a pub in Whitehall in London

196
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,080
 called the Silver Cross Pub,

197
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,720
 which is technically the nation's only legal brothel.

198
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
 - Really?

199
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,520
 - Because it was given a license by Charles I,

200
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
 which has never been revoked.

201
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,680
 - What did he mean?

202
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,160
 - And they have an upstairs room that you could hire.

203
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
 - Yeah.

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
 (audience laughing)

205
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
 - Just another fact.

206
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,600
 (audience laughing)

207
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,400
 - That's actually the sponsor for this week's podcast.

208
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,240
 - I was looking at some other ballads and what they were written for.

209
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,840
 So a lot of them, maybe the most popular type

210
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,480
 were drinking songs, and they were used to be plastered up in pubs.

211
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,440
 So, and this is particularly in Britain and England, especially.

212
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,120
 So in England, ballads were written on single sides,

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
 because they had to be used as wallpaper in various pubs.

214
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
 Whereas in the continent, they were double sided,

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
 because they were pamphlets.

216
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,920
 But they had these drinking ballads

217
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,680
 and I read one of them, which was at the end of every verse,

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
 it would say, "Oh, we've had this one drink now, bring us another."

219
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,280
 So every verse was, "You had to down your drink and get another one."

220
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,120
 And they had 13 verses.

221
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,640
 So one song, you had to drink 13 pints.

222
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,880
 - Whoa.

223
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,200
 - There were quite a lot of heartbreak balance as well.

224
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
 That was another big genre.

225
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,240
 So I am a bachelor, isn't it sad?

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,800
 It was the title of one of them, or "Each has a lover but me."

227
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
 Daddy come home.

228
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,440
 I don't think that is actually a single one.

229
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,040
 Jack and his nuts, possibly a relation of Kentish dick.

230
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,840
 And my favorite is Nancy, I have lost my wig.

231
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
 Well, great song.

232
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 That's awesome.

233
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
 You were saying Anna about how they got these ballads

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
 and they put them on the wall in the pub.

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,680
 They'd often put it on the doorpost of the inn,

236
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,280
 and they used to call that posting.

237
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,240
 And that's how we eventually get the phrase

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
 posting a message on the internet.

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,840
 It's from the same story.

240
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,560
 - You kidding. - Wow.

241
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
 - Wow.

242
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,480
 - So you basically, you had posting things

243
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,040
 on the posts outside the pub,

244
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,160
 and then you went to, like, newspapers were called the post,

245
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,640
 and then you would have postal services,

246
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,520
 and then you had posting internet things.

247
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
 - Oh, that's awesome.

248
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
 - The phrase, dick pick, comes from Kentish dick.

249
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
 - It used to be, he would do a woodcut of his penis.

250
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
 (laughing)

251
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
 - Don't say cut.

252
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
 (laughing)

253
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
 - Don't say wood.

254
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,960
 (laughing)

255
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,000
 - Thought very wrong.

256
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

257
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,560
 and that is Andy.

258
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,280
 - My fact is, that pound for pound,

259
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,840
 a 33 gram finch can bite you 320 times harder

260
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,320
 than a T-Rex could.

261
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,120
 (laughing)

262
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,640
 - Yeah, but pound for pound, actually.

263
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
 (laughing)

264
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
 So there's not many pounds in a finch, is there?

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,920
 - No.

266
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,160
 - There's a line of T-Rex.

267
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
 - That's true.

268
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So this is, like, it's good news in various ways,

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,640
 because it turns out the finches are small

270
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,800
 and T-Rexes are all dead.

271
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,280
 So, in a way, we're fine.

272
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,120
 - Swim, win.

273
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
 - Yeah, win, win.

274
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,000
 But this is a study that has just been done

275
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,280
 into bite force, and it's, you know,

276
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,440
 we know roughly what the T-Rex could jump.

277
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,840
 So, if it bit you, it was the equivalent

278
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,360
 of 13 grand pianos landing on you.

279
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
 (laughing)

280
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,760
 - Yeah.

281
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
 - That's a brilliant cartoon, isn't it?

282
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,600
 (laughing)

283
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
 - I'm like, I'm Bill.

284
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 (laughing)

285
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,840
 - So they could bite really, really hard.

286
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
 There's no one disputing that.

287
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,960
 But there's, there's, there's, the study has measured

288
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,080
 hundreds of different animals' bite strength,

289
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,720
 and this tiny finch, the Galapagos finch,

290
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,880
 has a very powerful bite, relative to its body size.

291
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,560
 So, yeah.

292
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,480
 I read that it's, the, if a finch was scaled up

293
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,280
 to a T-Rex's size, its bite would be 320 times stronger

294
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,840
 than that of a T-Rex.

295
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,360
 And a T-Rex had a bite force of 12,800 pounds.

296
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,080
 So, the finch would have a bite force of four million pounds.

297
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,920
 - Whoa.

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,560
 - And a rocket has five million pounds of thrust.

299
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
 - Wow.

300
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
 So, I don't think this is realistic, and yeah.

301
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
 - I'm just so concerned now

302
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,080
 that someone involved with Jurassic Park 29, or wherever we are,

303
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,640
 is listening, and is like, I've got the climactic moment

304
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
 to the next, Bill.

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,840
 (laughing)

306
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
 Giant finch thunder zone.

307
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 (laughing)

308
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,400
 Just swallows the T-Rex.

309
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,880
 - That's what the author said, that this is Reading University,

310
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,240
 and they said, "The King of the Dinosaurs

311
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,160
 would be no match for a finch in a fight

312
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,680
 if they were the same size."

313
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,400
 (laughing)

314
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,520
 - Oh my God, the idea of finch size T-Rex is very huge.

315
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,360
 - Yeah.

316
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,520
 - Well, you do, they do know what baby T-Rex's look like now.

317
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,880
 - So they just write small T-Rexes?

318
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
 - Yeah, pretty much.

319
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,560
 - Right.

320
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,480
 - No, they've done a picture of what they might look like,

321
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
 and they're really cute and fluffy,

322
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,120
 and they had normal length dams

323
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
 compared to the T-Rexes have small arms,

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,040
 but they have no more.

325
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,160
 And so, at some stage in their puberty,

326
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,200
 their arms just became small.

327
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,040
 - Wow.

328
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,840
 - Well, they keep growing, but their arms have stopped.

329
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
 - Yeah.

330
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,560
 (laughing)

331
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

332
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,200
 - Well, all their arms have become small.

333
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
 It's like, it's--

334
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
 - It's so relative, I think.

335
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,160
 - It's one of them, it's so relative.

336
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,920
 (laughing)

337
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,760
 - So it's a pinch, but if it bit me on my finger,

338
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 what would that feel like?

339
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,240
 - Your hand would explode.

340
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,080
 - What did?

341
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,480
 - It would hardly hurt at all.

342
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,320
 - Not at all, really.

343
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
 - And the thing is, basically,

344
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,880
 it's the thing with ants being able

345
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,040
 to carry massive things, isn't it?

346
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
 If things are small, it's much easier for them

347
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,600
 to do things in impressive ways.

348
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,760
 - That's true.

349
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
 - Sorry, I was kidding.

350
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,560
 (laughing)

351
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,880
 - That's my Tinder profile.

352
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,400
 (laughing)

353
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,760
 - But you don't understand.

354
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,920
 - Pound for pound, this is like average sex.

355
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
 With a T-Rex.

356
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,080
 (laughing)

357
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,920
 - Good.

358
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,720
 Well, that under things that aren't gonna work.

359
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,680
 (laughing)

360
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,360
 But they have just looked into T-Rex adolescence

361
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,520
 and discovered some quite interesting stuff about it.

362
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,160
 So they have adolescence kind of like humans.

363
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,200
 They have found out how old T-Rexes would grow too,

364
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,160
 is about 28, and the adolescence happened

365
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
 between 14 and 18.

366
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
 And that's where they just had their massive growth spurt.

367
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,680
 And the way they can tell this is

368
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,640
 'cause they look at the growth rings on them.

369
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,040
 So they study growth rings on ribs.

370
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,440
 And they have mineral deposits that lay down

371
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,800
 every year as they grow.

372
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,280
 And so then you can count, you know,

373
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,200
 at what point they grew a lot suddenly.

374
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,560
 - So they're like trees?

375
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,760
 - That's the analogy I was going for, yeah.

376
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,280
 (laughing)

377
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,800
 - I was looking in, there's a museum,

378
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,760
 which is the Museum of Astrius.

379
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,760
 And it's in Spain, and they have a model of a T-Rex.

380
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,120
 And it's the weirdest thing.

381
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,280
 And this is a museum that they invite children to

382
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,400
 and adults and it's a family day out.

383
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,200
 And the structure of it is,

384
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,240
 they're showing two T-Rexes mid-copulation.

385
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,200
 They're having sex.

386
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,320
 So the female T-Rexes, it's a doggie style,

387
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,880
 basically, position of these two giant skeletons.

388
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
 And the weird thing is, there's no reason for it

389
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,000
 because we don't even know how they have sex.

390
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
 There's just no point.

391
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
 They're just speculating that that's what it is.

392
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,840
 But when you go in there,

393
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 there's a T-Rex taking another T-Rex from behind.

394
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
 It's crazy.

395
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
 (laughing)

396
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,760
 - They have started playing feathers on the museum,

397
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,680
 which I appreciate.

398
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,440
 I went to a natural history museum in Tasmania recently

399
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,360
 'cause you know, they discovered

400
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
 that most dinosaurs had feathers.

401
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
 And so they've had to go back through

402
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,480
 all the old bloody museums and pin feathers

403
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
 to all their exhibits.

404
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,440
 And they're doing it.

405
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,120
 - Do you know that T-Rexes got mouthfulses?

406
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
 - No, really. - Yeah, they did.

407
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,320
 So they looked at microbes in coprolites in T-Rex poo

408
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,760
 and they found that they had the same kind of microbes

409
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,840
 as birds get and it gives their mouthfulses.

410
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,240
 So we think that probably T-Rexes had mouthfulses.

411
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,160
 - That's amazing.

412
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,800
 - So finches, yeah.

413
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,920
 So this is a thing also about adolescence, actually.

414
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
 Adolescent finches.

415
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,400
 So teenage finches, they learn how to sing zebra finches.

416
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,880
 They learn how to sing from their fathers

417
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,240
 and they get taught this incredibly complicated set of tunes.

418
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,360
 But we have recently discovered.

419
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,520
 So most animals learn kind of by road,

420
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,160
 they just listen and repeat, listen and repeat.

421
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,920
 What's really rare in the animal kingdom

422
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,720
 is learning via social cues.

423
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,280
 So if I was singing my song and my father

424
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,560
 sort of gave a sign of approval or disapproval

425
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,320
 and you know, that's how they do it.

426
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,360
 But they don't learn from their fathers.

427
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
 They learn from their mothers

428
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
 and the way they learn is

429
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,640
 their mothers kind of give the signs of finding them attractive.

430
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,640
 So they do what's called fluffing up,

431
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,960
 which is a signal that a female likes a male song.

432
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,080
 And basically the young finches sing.

433
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,360
 And if they get the song close to their father's song,

434
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,400
 the mum fluffes up.

435
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
 And it's basically she's saying,

436
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,080
 that's just how your father wooed me.

437
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
 - That's quite a nice.

438
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,040
 That's like a mum sending their son

439
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,680
 after the proms sorting out his hair before he leaves

440
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
 or something.

441
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,080
 - But making it look exactly like his father's hair

442
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,280
 and saying, I'll find this attractive

443
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,520
 and I want you to look like it.

444
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,280
 - It's a combination of sweet and creepy, yeah.

445
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
 - It's back to the future, isn't it?

446
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
 - That's back to the future.

447
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,840
 - They also, when they're tiny the finches,

448
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,080
 they have a very amazing ability for feeding at night.

449
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,040
 These are the baby finches and they lose this as they get older.

450
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,640
 They have these little nodules that glow in the dark.

451
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,560
 They're these blue nodules that suddenly glow

452
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,200
 so that when the mother is looking to feed them,

453
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
 she can specify which ones are where

454
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,080
 and not lose any food in the process.

455
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,920
 How cool is that?

456
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,080
 - That's amazing.

457
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 - They glow in the dark.

458
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,000
 - On their singing, they have another very clever thing

459
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,880
 they do when they sing, which is,

460
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,200
 have started to happen since global warming became a thing.

461
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,240
 And this is that zebra finches sing to the embryos

462
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,560
 in their eggs.

463
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,200
 So the mothers will sing into their eggs

464
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,760
 and their singing will be a warning

465
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,840
 about the temperature outside.

466
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,400
 And this tells the embryo inside the egg

467
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,320
 how much or how little to grow.

468
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,720
 So if it's getting hot outside, which it often is now,

469
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,040
 then the zebra finch sings a song to its embryo's going

470
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,560
 is pretty warm out here.

471
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,720
 That's amazing.

472
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
 Don't grow too big.

473
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
 There's been an armed robbery in Gemstone.

474
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,400
 I was just going to say, we've had them sing in the news.

475
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
 Now we're having them sing in the weather.

476
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
 We just need someone sing in the spot and we're there.

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,160
 [LAUGHTER]

478
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,040
 And the vampire finches, do you know who's going to snuggle those guys?

479
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,840
 They have very sharp beaks and they pick at the skin of boobies

480
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,560
 and they drink the blood out of these booby birds

481
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,600
 and it even breaks into the booby eggs and drinks the contents.

482
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
 And sometimes it does it with humans.

483
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,840
 Sometimes it will try and peck on a human

484
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,120
 and try and get at the blood as well.

485
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,880
 But not the human eggs?

486
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
 No.

487
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,800
 That's a very difficult thing to do, isn't it?

488
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,120
 I don't know how it's got there.

489
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,800
 You've got bigger things to worry about.

490
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,720
 A low process of trust gaining over the months.

491
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,240
 You start with the boobies.

492
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,720
 This fact is also about biting.

493
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
 I've found a couple of things about biting.

494
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
 This is just a bit of a useful thing to know.

495
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,440
 And it's something that science is looking into at the moment

496
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,240
 because I think it can be applied in the long term

497
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,920
 to mosquito sprays.

498
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,960
 But mosquitoes, if a mosquito is biting you,

499
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,920
 if you slap your arm or wherever it's biting,

500
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,400
 if you slap there, it sends vibrations up through to mosquito.

501
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
 And when they leap off, they associate the smell

502
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,600
 that you have with what just happened there,

503
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 the fear that they might be killed.

504
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,160
 And the reason that mosquito is land on us

505
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,480
 is they're attracted to a smell.

506
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,920
 And they remember the smell.

507
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,800
 So it turns out that if you do that,

508
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,400
 you're going to put the mosquito off for 24 hours.

509
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,520
 That same mosquito won't come back and land on you.

510
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,720
 It might be a different one, but it will think,

511
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,000
 I might get killed if I go back to that smell.

512
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,040
 Remember the smell of your body.

513
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,560
 Exactly.

514
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,640
 So they think that's a threat.

515
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,560
 I can't go back there.

516
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,640
 That might kill me.

517
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,440
 So all mosquito products at the moment

518
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,120
 are trying to work out how they can get what we manage

519
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,920
 to do with our pheromones and our body smell into that

520
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,520
 in order to stop.

521
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,160
 But next time you've got mosquitoes around,

522
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
 just slap yourself a lot.

523
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,080
 And you'll be all of your body.

524
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,560
 Just slap yourself silly.

525
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,640
 And yeah.

526
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,280
 But it kind of implies that the next mosquito repellents

527
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,320
 are just going to be lots of little slappers

528
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
 that we have to pin to our bodies.

529
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,400
 I can't lay little mouse traps all over us,

530
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
 constantly smacking us.

531
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,640
 I'd rather be bitten.

532
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
 OK.

533
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,800
 That's firstly.

534
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,760
 For everyone else, it lasts for 24 hours.

535
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,400
 That's pretty good.

536
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,120
 Yeah.

537
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,600
 Do you know what makes-- so humans, we have a certain bike

538
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,040
 question.

539
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,840
 We have quite a strong bite.

540
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,800
 But do you know we probably could bite much harder than we do.

541
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,120
 But what would you think holds us back?

542
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,880
 What do you think determines how hard we bite?

543
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,000
 How good our muscles are in our jaws.

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,800
 So--

545
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
 I say willpower.

546
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,320
 So I think--

547
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,120
 James is wrong, Andy's more wrong.

548
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,560
 This is--

549
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,040
 That's a dreamy girl for the three-time.

550
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,640
 I just think socially it looks awkward

551
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
 if you're biting harder than--

552
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,680
 we have a winner.

553
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,800
 There we go.

554
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,240
 No, this is an experiment that was done

555
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,280
 by a guy called Dr. G. E. Black.

556
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,960
 This was actually in 1933.

557
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
 It was a long time ago.

558
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,080
 But he invented what he called a nathodinomometer.

559
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,680
 And this was basically-- he put some rubber pads on the steel

560
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
 instrument he designed.

561
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,120
 And he got 1,000 people to bite down on it.

562
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
 And he worked out that the restrictive factor

563
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
 on how hard you can bite is not your jaw strength.

564
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,280
 It's your teeth.

565
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,560
 So the people stopped biting when they said my teeth really

566
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,280
 hurt.

567
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
 And actually, if you think about it,

568
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
 when your jaw more power than your teeth

569
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,080
 are able to withstand.

570
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,920
 So if you just man up and deal with the tooth pain--

571
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,760
 Willpower.

572
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,880
 That's what it says.

573
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
 Yeah.

574
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,760
 Yep, you're right.

575
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,880
 I amend my response.

576
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,720
 You're correct.

577
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
 Thank you.

578
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,320
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

579
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,000
 And that is James.

580
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,120
 OK, my fact this week is that the most polluted city

581
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,560
 in the world is Kanpur.

582
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,440
 It is nicknamed the Manchester of the East.

583
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
 [LAUGHTER]

584
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
 I've lost them, guys.

585
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
 Unbelievably risky.

586
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,440
 What do you think, Amy?

587
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,800
 So I mean, this is true.

588
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,240
 It's their particles in the air.

589
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,880
 It's especially particles with a diameter of less

590
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,920
 than 2.5 micrometers, which basically means soot.

591
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,600
 And it's because of the tanning industry.

592
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,560
 There's a local wind called the Lou of Kanpur, which

593
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,280
 gives them really bad dust storms.

594
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
 And it's, yeah, it's really, really bad.

595
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,960
 But the reason that they call it the Manchester of the East

596
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
 is because, obviously, Manchester

597
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,520
 used to have extremely bad pollution.

598
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
 And also, it's kind of an industrial town.

599
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,440
 A Manchester is one of the most famous industrial towns,

600
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,240
 because it's such a great city.

601
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,840
 Nice.

602
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,080
 [LAUGHTER]

603
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,840
 Good.

604
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,600
 It's kind of bad.

605
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 Yeah.

606
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,840
 A great back track.

607
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,640
 You say Manchester used to have quite bad pollution.

608
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,240
 Let's face it, it still does.

609
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,480
 So I actually thought this would be a thing where we went,

610
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,200
 oh, and it's such a misnomer, because Manchester's fine now.

611
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,800
 And if you look at air pollution rates,

612
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
 I always thought London was the worst.

613
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,480
 But actually, topping the list from last year

614
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,800
 is Port Talbot in Wales, because they've got big steelworks.

615
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,520
 And then second is not, in fact, Manchester.

616
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,680
 It is where we are right now, which is sulphur.

617
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,840
 Scumthorpe and sulphur, joint second.

618
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,760
 And do you know what's third?

619
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,400
 This is really where the third most polluted place in Britain.

620
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,880
 No.

621
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,280
 Gibraltar.

622
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 What?

623
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,160
 [LAUGHTER]

624
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,840
 Well, I'm sure it won't be for long.

625
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,320
 [LAUGHTER]

626
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,160
 That is because half of the world's sea trade

627
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
 goes through the Gibraltar strait.

628
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,120
 And so all of those polluting particles coming from the sea.

629
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,800
 And they have no countryside around there.

630
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,480
 It's just that literally that little rock.

631
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,640
 Yeah, exactly.

632
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
 It just pulls in there.

633
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,520
 Those poor monkeys.

634
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,440
 So the term acid rain was coined in Manchester in 1872.

635
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,640
 Friedrich Engels, who I lived here for a little while,

636
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,280
 he described it as a place of filth

637
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,040
 ruin and inhabits a bullness.

638
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,200
 And he described it as hell on earth.

639
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,400
 But in fairness at the time, it was when Manchester

640
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,480
 was really growing.

641
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,080
 And people had come over from Ireland.

642
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,040
 And the cotton mills had just started.

643
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,040
 And it was not a great place to live unlike now.

644
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,440
 And so, although having said that,

645
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,560
 there was a pub for every 139 residents of Manchester.

646
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,120
 Nice.

647
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,080
 Wow.

648
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,360
 And one in 40 of the city's population

649
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,120
 was arrested for drunkenness within a single year.

650
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
 Wow.

651
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,360
 [APPLAUSE]

652
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,920
 That's very good.

653
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,680
 I found a different thing that Engels observed when he was in town.

654
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,920
 1845, he was around.

655
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,440
 He was amazed to discover that there

656
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,880
 were flourishing pigries in every back street in the city.

657
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,360
 Yes, still.

658
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,120
 You haven't been around today.

659
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,160
 Yeah, but it was very useful.

660
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,240
 And in fact, that was the case all over the country.

661
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,480
 It wasn't just Manchester.

662
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,040
 Is it a pigery just where you're farming pigs?

663
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,560
 It's a pig.

664
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
 It's a pig.

665
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,440
 It's whatever tiny space you keep a pig in as a pigery.

666
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,960
 It depends on the presence or absence of a pig.

667
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,640
 If hasn't got a pig in there, it's just a small yard.

668
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,200
 Are you claiming that if you've got one pig,

669
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,080
 you've got a pigery?

670
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,880
 Yes.

671
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 Really?

672
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,320
 No, it's not a thriving pigery, is it?

673
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,960
 I would say it's on its last leg.

674
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
 It's a struggling pigery.

675
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
 Yeah, but it's a very good waste disposal unit.

676
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,520
 All rubbish goes into the pig and the pig eats everything.

677
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,480
 And then you eat the pig.

678
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,920
 Yeah, perfect.

679
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,200
 It's a slightly slow way of eating lots of rubbish, basically.

680
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
 [LAUGHTER]

681
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
 Just on city nicknames, this--

682
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,960
 so this is about a city nickname.

683
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,760
 And Manchester used to be called Cottonopolis.

684
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,000
 And you say it wasn't a good place to be,

685
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,840
 but it's always very much swings around about.

686
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,360
 So in the 19th century, it was also extremely wealthy

687
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,920
 and kind of an awesome place to be, because you could make money.

688
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,400
 But I was reading an account of someone

689
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,760
 who was traveling around Manchester for the first time

690
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,680
 in the mid-19th century and loving it and, you know,

691
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
 saying, you know, it's so brilliant

692
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,040
 and people are all about the cotton mills.

693
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,240
 And he kept on asking to be shown round a cotton mill,

694
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,760
 like given a tourist visitor tour.

695
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,520
 And they would never let him, because they

696
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,640
 were so paranoid about everyone else stealing their technology,

697
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,160
 because they had the best cotton technology they went and out in.

698
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,640
 In 1871, 32% of all the cotton in the world

699
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,560
 was made in Manchester.

700
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,400
 Oh, wow.

701
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,560
 On the planet, a whole planet.

702
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,200
 I just say that's incredible.

703
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,920
 So there were gangs as well, because obviously lots of people

704
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,240
 moving from the country to the city, lots of people

705
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,120
 in a cramped space, you get gangs.

706
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,520
 And are the people familiar with the skuttlers?

707
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,440
 Is that a thing still?

708
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,280
 Not still.

709
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,880
 OK.

710
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,000
 They are not thriving.

711
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,680
 It's like the Piggory.

712
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,680
 But they were a gang who really plagued the city in the late 19th century.

713
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,080
 And they had a very distinctive look.

714
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,560
 They had a fringe, which was called a donkey fringe.

715
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,080
 And they had neck-achiefs, which told you which gang they were in,

716
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,000
 which was quite smart.

717
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,920
 So you could see the stripes of the spots.

718
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,200
 And so, oh, you were that gang.

719
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,960
 But the way they started, the skuttlers,

720
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,560
 it started with a historical reenactment society that got out of hand.

721
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,200
 No.

722
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,920
 So it's a historical, Andrew Davis has written a book about this.

723
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,000
 This is what it says about the book.

724
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,160
 Davis has identified the trigger point for skuttling

725
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,800
 as arising from the reception of the Franco-Prussian wall

726
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,840
 by the schoolboys of ancodes.

727
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
 Young boys recreated the battles on the streets of ancodes

728
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,560
 using the categories of Catholic French and Protestant Russian

729
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,160
 to reflect their own legences.

730
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,600
 The game very quickly evolved into a widespread folk for street battles.

731
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,560
 And it just turned into gang warfare.

732
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,120
 Wow.

733
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,080
 The worst place to go was on Deansgate, wasn't it?

734
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,640
 That was where they all hung out.

735
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
 OK.

736
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,120
 And the absolute worst place was a hovel

737
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,920
 on the corner of Harbin Street and Deansgate,

738
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,000
 which today is a Wagababas.

739
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
 [LAUGHTER]

740
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,560
 Oh, wow.

741
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,040
 I've only gone downhill.

742
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,880
 I have a sort of modern Manchester fact.

743
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
 I imagine everyone here will know this.

744
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
 So apologies to the crowd here.

745
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
 But people at home and overseas won't know this.

746
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,760
 But we all know Manchester United and Man City as the football teams.

747
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,480
 And in 2011, they were awarded the third-ever annual Jelly

748
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,240
 Dona Award for--

749
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,440
 it's done by the accredited language services.

750
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,840
 They award the best translation errors each year.

751
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,000
 And when the Man City Stadium was the Etihad Stadium,

752
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,960
 Etihad in Arabic means United.

753
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,760
 And--

754
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
 No.

755
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,800
 Yeah.

756
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
 Oh, my goodness.

757
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,200
 Yeah.

758
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,720
 So Man City suddenly were playing in the Etihad.

759
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,040
 That's such a good fact.

760
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,720
 I love it.

761
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,040
 You know, Xi Jinping came to Manchester in 2015

762
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
 and visited Man City.

763
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,960
 And he visited the stadium.

764
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,920
 And he was given a copy of the rules of football as a gift,

765
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,000
 because football was something that was invented in England.

766
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,080
 And so he was given a copy of the rules that were drawn up

767
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,440
 in 1863.

768
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,440
 And in exchange, Xi Jinping gave us a copper representation

769
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,760
 of a figure playing Kuzhu, the football-esque sport invented

770
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,200
 in China 2,000 years ago.

771
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,680
 Wow.

772
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,640
 Feels like a bit of a slam.

773
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,040
 Just on world leaders, do you know that Manchester United

774
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,000
 was literally hours away from being

775
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,600
 owned by Colonel Gaddafi?

776
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,080
 Really?

777
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,600
 Yeah.

778
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,440
 So not the whole thing, but a huge percentage, 29.9%.

779
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,840
 It was the guy who broke the deal to the Glazer family

780
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,160
 who did take over.

781
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,640
 He said it was hours away from not going to them

782
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,560
 and going to Gaddafi instead.

783
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,320
 Bad luck, guys.

784
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
 What might have been?

785
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,440
 OK.

786
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,720
 It is time for a final fact of the show.

787
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,680
 And that is Chazinsky.

788
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,840
 My fight is that dogs over 35 centimeters tall

789
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,400
 are banned from Beijing.

790
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,360
 There's a high restriction.

791
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,320
 They all get measured.

792
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,240
 If they're too tall, they've got to go.

793
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,080
 So China has this bizarre history with dog laws.

794
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,240
 And this one was passed in 2003.

795
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,840
 And it was about what breeds of dogs and what kind of dogs

796
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,880
 are allowed in Beijing in the center of Beijing, really.

797
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,760
 And then in bits of the rural districts,

798
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,040
 if you're taller than 35 centimeters and a dog, not allowed,

799
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,640
 if you are on a list of 41 breeds that they listed,

800
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,320
 you're not allowed.

801
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,440
 So like setters, greyhounds, mastiffs,

802
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,600
 holding the sheep dogs.

803
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,560
 There's really huge shaggy things.

804
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,160
 Band, collies, also called a band.

805
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,920
 Dogs, Dalmatian, all the classics.

806
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,600
 Chow Chows, which I had a chow-chow and a chow-chow

807
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,960
 is a Chinese dog.

808
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,440
 So that's weird.

809
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
 I thought chow-chows were quite small.

810
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
 No, chow-chows, they're like the Chewbacca looking guys.

811
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,520
 Oh, right.

812
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 OK.

813
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,120
 And they used to be warrior dogs for the Chinese armies.

814
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,600
 And so they're very revered there.

815
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,280
 So that's bizarre that they're on that list.

816
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,680
 But could you get your dog to, for example, sit?

817
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,920
 So it's shorter than 35 centimeters tall.

818
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,720
 Oh, yeah.

819
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,440
 It won't change your height when you sit down, like--

820
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,800
 But they could do that wiping bum shuffle that they do,

821
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,320
 and just walk like that.

822
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,520
 What about-- you could give it a haircut.

823
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,400
 So you could-- I bet if you shaved a sheep dog,

824
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,480
 there's tiny under all that.

825
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,720
 The whole point is that these breeds

826
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,240
 are banned no matter how tall they are.

827
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,040
 No, but I reckon you wouldn't recognize a sheep dog

828
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,440
 if it was completely shaved with all of that.

829
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,080
 There are some breeds that would be allowed

830
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,200
 if they're under 35, but no, if they're over 35.

831
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
 So you could shave them.

832
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,520
 But if you're right on that cusp,

833
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,120
 I don't know if they'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

834
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
 There was a crackdown.

835
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
 They cracked down properly on this in 2014,

836
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,680
 and there were all these owners of pets that were suddenly told

837
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,640
 they were outlawed, who were having a bit of a disaster.

838
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
 The government said, why don't you just give your pets away

839
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,480
 to shelters?

840
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,920
 And obviously, people didn't do that.

841
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,200
 Because that's a way thing to do to your dog of 10 years.

842
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,800
 But there is a lot of luxury stuff for pets.

843
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,840
 So there's this weird division between the Chinese government,

844
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,160
 which is cracking down on animals.

845
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,640
 And then there are lots of tiny dogs,

846
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
 and those are treated very luxuriously.

847
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,440
 It's a really popular thing in China.

848
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:24,940
 Yeah.

849
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,960
 So there are play centres just for dogs,

850
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,280
 which have got indoor swimming pools, and ball pits,

851
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,120
 and obstacle courses.

852
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,520
 There's pet acupuncture.

853
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,080
 That's quite a big thing.

854
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,880
 And there's-- there are dog hotels which

855
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,000
 have dogs cinemas in.

856
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,320
 Yeah.

857
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,440
 And the film's especially designed for dogs eyesight.

858
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,560
 I don't know what that means.

859
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,640
 So I think they see stuff, more frames per second than us,

860
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,840
 about twice as many.

861
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,080
 So maybe they have many more frames per second in the film.

862
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,280
 So this is why dogs don't get very captivated by television.

863
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,880
 It's one reason, isn't it?

864
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,440
 Other reasons that they're very, very stupid animals.

865
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,360
 But it looks to them, I guess there is a photographs

866
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,120
 one after the other.

867
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
 So I guess this is--

868
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,640
 Yeah.

869
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
 So if you suddenly fast forward a movie on your TV,

870
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,480
 are they like, whoa, what is this?

871
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,080
 In Dorset, there is a spa hotel for guinea pigs.

872
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,600
 What is that in tail?

873
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,280
 Well, for 16 pounds, you can get a pedicure.

874
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,080
 16.

875
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,000
 16.

876
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,720
 That's pretty good.

877
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,080
 Well, you need to pay for the hotel,

878
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
 but this is just an extra on the side thing.

879
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,560
 Oh, sorry.

880
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,240
 I thought this was a nice B&B for a guinea pig.

881
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:36,040
 Well, they don't eat much B, and they don't need a very big B.

882
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,440
 So for your 16 pounds anyway, you get a pedicure.

883
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,520
 You get two washes with lice shampoo, anti-lice shampoo.

884
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,840
 You get a haircut, a towel dry, a massage,

885
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,400
 while watching a movie, and a snooze.

886
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,440
 Wow.

887
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,640
 You have to pay for a snooze.

888
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,560
 That is a rip off.

889
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,360
 But, yeah, in China, people are very into their dogs,

890
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,920
 but they worked out recently that the city dwelling

891
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,040
 millennials are responsible for 70% of pet spending

892
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,560
 in China, which is actually quite weird,

893
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,800
 because millennials are-- it's basically

894
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,480
 people born in their 80s and 90s, which

895
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
 is pretty young to be spending a lot on pets.

896
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
 But they think it's because they've been--

897
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,120
 this is what the economist said.

898
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,200
 They've been lured away from their families and friends

899
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,520
 by jobs in the big cities, meaning they're incredibly

900
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,040
 lonely at this point.

901
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,760
 A lot of people single.

902
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,400
 The air is very bad outside, as previously discussed.

903
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
 And it's extremely easy to stay inside and just watch stuff

904
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,520
 on the internet.

905
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,920
 It's nice to have someone with you when you do that.

906
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,160
 And by the way, there are 200 million unmarried people

907
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,000
 in their 20s and 30s in China, which

908
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,360
 is-- if you think about that as a proportion of world population,

909
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,480
 it's a lot of single people.

910
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,360
 200 billion in 20s and 30s.

911
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,960
 Yeah.

912
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,160
 Wow.

913
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,800
 Single.

914
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,360
 Yeah.

915
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,200
 It's a lot.

916
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
 They're all sitting there with their dogs inside.

917
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,560
 This woman said, I live alone.

918
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,880
 And it's nice to have little Yui waiting,

919
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,600
 all happy to see me when I get home.

920
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,840
 And she said, this is-- she flipped through

921
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,760
 photos of cats on her iPhone.

922
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,440
 I just feel like there's a social problem

923
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,400
 that we need to address.

924
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
 Yeah.

925
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,760
 Just some dog sizes in Japan.

926
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,800
 I was being told earlier by Ash Gardner, who wrote our theme

927
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,160
 tune, when he was in Japan, there were parks there.

928
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
 And I started googling this after he said it.

929
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,960
 Yo-yo, Guy Park.

930
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,720
 It's in Japan.

931
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,800
 And what they have is they want to make sure

932
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,600
 that dogs that go to the park have a great experience.

933
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,320
 So there is a weight and size category for dogs,

934
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,280
 of which bit of the park they go to.

935
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,760
 So they separate the big dogs from the little dogs.

936
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,200
 And the little dogs and the medium dogs hang out together.

937
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,000
 And they all play.

938
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,120
 And the big dogs have to go to another section.

939
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,720
 So they separate it to no fights break out amongst the dogs.

940
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,000
 I think that sounds a bit sort of like, size-ist.

941
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,960
 I think that sounds good.

942
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
 That's segregation.

943
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,560
 Segregation.

944
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,520
 You post segregation?

945
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,040
 No.

946
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,960
 [LAUGHTER]

947
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,680
 That was just like very big dogs, or it's more ones.

948
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,480
 Look, never mind.

949
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,440
 Never has anyone backed out from a nightmare so quickly.

950
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,960
 Dogs are much less clever than humans like to think.

951
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,040
 So there are lots of people who think

952
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,720
 that dogs are very, very clever.

953
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,160
 And the science doesn't really bear it out, unfortunately.

954
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,560
 And I can feel the room slipping away, as I say this.

955
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,480
 But-- so dogs, for example, can't recognize themselves

956
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,880
 in mirrors, which some animals can do.

957
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,960
 And on lots of measures, they're about the same as pigeons.

958
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,360
 And they can't fly, either.

959
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,600
 And they can't even fly useless.

960
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,320
 But the doctor who carried out this work, Brita Osthaus,

961
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,840
 she did work about 10 years ago, which

962
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,680
 showed the dogs were cleverer than cats.

963
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,320
 And she got a big backlash then from all the cat owners,

964
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,080
 saying, my cat says cleverer is any dog.

965
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,720
 And now she's done this research.

966
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,480
 She's got a backlash from dog owners.

967
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,320
 And when she published this study, and it was printed

968
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
 over the times, there was lots of backlash

969
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 at the comments section.

970
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,200
 One times, Brita wrote, we once had a beagle who

971
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,040
 could open the refrigerator with his paws.

972
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
 Case closed.

973
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,360
 [LAUGHTER]

974
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,080
 Just on the idea of having small dogs,

975
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,960
 there is concern to be had when you do hang out

976
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,000
 with just small dogs.

977
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,800
 In America, recently, there was a warning

978
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,440
 when there was a big storm that hit Cleveland,

979
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,040
 with 50 mile an hour winds there.

980
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,760
 The weather bureau released a statement saying,

981
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,800
 can everyone please be careful?

982
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,160
 These winds are huge.

983
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,520
 And things that can happen are trash cans will go missing.

984
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,640
 Trees will fall.

985
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
 And dogs will go flying.

986
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,680
 And yeah, they did a small dog warning.

987
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,000
 And it's the idea that when the winds pick up so high,

988
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,800
 they get lobbed off into the air.

989
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,880
 And if you're not holding on to them by leash,

990
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,680
 they will disappear.

991
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,560
 And if you are holding on to them by leash,

992
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,800
 you've got an amazing kite.

993
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
 Yeah.

994
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 [LAUGHTER]

995
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,120
 [LAUGHTER]

996
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,160
 Now, they did do this slightly tongue-in-cheek,

997
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,680
 but it is based on real incidences

998
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
 that have happened in America.

999
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,640
 Stories that you can read up on, for example, a 72-year-old couple,

1000
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,240
 or a 72-year-old lady called Dorothy Ottley,

1001
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,600
 she lost her chihuahua.

1002
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,720
 Sorry, he's good to her.

1003
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 He's good to her.

1004
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,960
 Come on.

1005
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,680
 And she lost her chihuahua toto in a ton of ease, isn't it?

1006
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,920
 She live in Kansas.

1007
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1008
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,200
 [LAUGHTER]

1009
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,680
 Wow, did you have to notice that?

1010
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,720
 No, it was a 6-pound chihuahua called Tinkerbell.

1011
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,720
 And they are mixing their movies here.

1012
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,600
 Yeah, this is cross-jogger movie.

1013
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,640
 They were walking around in a 70-mile-an-hour wind

1014
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,120
 came and it picked Tinkerbell up, and it took her off in the wind.

1015
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,280
 And they couldn't find her.

1016
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,760
 And what they actually ended up doing

1017
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
 is that they hired a pet psychic called Laurie.

1018
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
 OK.

1019
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,160
 Right.

1020
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,560
 Well, they had my sympathy for a good long time there.

1021
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,760
 Laurie said, you have to stop looking in lowlands,

1022
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,320
 where you think--

1023
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,520
 Was Laurie a pet who was also a psychic?

1024
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,440
 No, no, no, she was a psychic of pets.

1025
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,640
 And she was also a third-generation psychic.

1026
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,120
 So she was the granddaughter of original psychic.

1027
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,360
 Yeah, it was all because of that.

1028
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,120
 There's a lot of nepotism in psychic, isn't there?

1029
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,360
 My father was a fraud.

1030
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,320
 My grandfather was a fraud.

1031
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,160
 And so she said to them, you need to look up.

1032
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,040
 And so the volunteers started looking outside of the swamp

1033
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,720
 and up the hill.

1034
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,920
 And they found Tinkerbell.

1035
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,720
 And so my point is that you will lose a dog in the wind.

1036
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
 Right.

1037
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1038
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,120
 OK, that is it.

1039
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,400
 That is all of our facts.
