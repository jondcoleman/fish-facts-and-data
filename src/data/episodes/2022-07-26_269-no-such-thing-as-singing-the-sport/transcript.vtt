00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 (bluesing)

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.320
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.400
 (bluesing)

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.700
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.760
 (upbeat music)

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.680
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.520
 this week coming to you live from the Lowry in Salford.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.520
 (audience cheering)

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.740
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.640
 I am sitting here with Ani Chazinski,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.120
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.600
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400
 Starting with fact number one,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.160
 and that's my fact this week.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.800
 My fact is that in 17th century Europe,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.420
 people used to sing each other the news.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.920
 (audience laughing)

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.440
 That's how they got the news.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.300
 It would be sung at their face.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 ♪ There's been a theft ♪

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.600
 Like that, like that thing.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.440
 Yeah.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 No, this is the thing.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.480
 In the 17th century, illiteracy rates were so high

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.120
 that if they did publish newspapers,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 no one was really buying them because they couldn't read them.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.800
 So what they ended up doing was they were taking

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 classic, classic ballads of the time,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.480
 but then applying just the news of the data them.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.240
 And so people would go on the streets

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880
 and they would start singing the news

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.200
 and people would memorize the songs that they were singing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.160
 and they would pass it on and pass it on.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.840
 And that's how the news got around.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.000
 And so it was for everything from political news

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.040
 to sentimental stories, religious news,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.320
 royal rumors, medical advice.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.240
 Did they do like an unfindly at the end

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.280
 with a dog on a surfboard or something?

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.360
 (audience laughing)

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480
 They did have a paywall.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.800
 So people plugged the ballads.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 So there were guys going around selling the ballads

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.760
 and they would sing them to the audience on the street

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.160
 going on to drum up interest,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200
 but they would not sing the last verse.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.560
 So you didn't know how it ended.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
 So there was a thing where it goes gray on the website,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.640
 but that's an execution ballad.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 How often was it?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.920
 And he pulled his head out just in time.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.720
 (audience laughing)

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.280
 Well, it is a bit like the internet today, isn't it?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520
 'Cause so they had these sheets

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.000
 that you could buy the sheet music if you wanted to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.160
 and then you could share it on the streets by singing it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760
 and then it gave you ideas of morality

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.680
 and stuff like that.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.000
 So it is a little bit like reading the news on the internet

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.040
 and then sharing it and then commenting on it.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.080
 Except it was just a lot more gruesome.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.360
 I mean, they were kind of disgusting in their taste.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.560
 I don't know if you've heard any of the news

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.440
 over the last few years.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.600
 (audience laughing)

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.000
 The fact that I'm not on social media

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.280
 makes that an unreliable comment.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.240
 But there was one.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.080
 So there was a French song in fact,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.600
 which was set to a really fun tune apparently.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120
 So they were like quite upbeat.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.760
 And it was about a hugano whose execution got interrupted

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.960
 because the people thought that they weren't being harsh enough

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.320
 or just chopping his head off or hanging him, sorry,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.240
 they were hanging him.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.680
 And so the people dragged him to a dung heap

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.720
 and mutilated him and this ballad went,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 the little children all got together yelling

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.560
 and singing joyously, having a great time,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.960
 pulling out his innards to throw them in the fire,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.960
 removing his guts and organs

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.760
 and then a dog swallowed his heart.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.720
 There you go, there you go.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.320
 (audience laughing)

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320
 Doesn't even rhyme.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.400
 (audience laughing)

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.600
 I think it rhymed in French to be there.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.720
 But they used to as well, not just report the news,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.880
 but in the execution ballads, this moral thing

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 that James is talking about, they used to then do verses

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.520
 from the perspective of the person

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.600
 who was killed, guilty and her hanged.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.800
 And that's where the moral would come in.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.520
 They would suddenly, it was as if the news

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.800
 was reading a quote from someone,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.760
 but that quote never existed.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.760
 So they would be saying, oh, I lament what I did

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.200
 and I wish I had not done it.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.720
 And oh, what a silly sausage I was.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.400
 And that was the way of saying that everyone was upset

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.960
 about the crime they committed in a new show.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.920
 This mortal life, I will depart

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.000
 to then a dog will swallow my heart.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.040
 (audience laughing)

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.880
 And then you end.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.720
 Yes?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.560
 Yeah.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560
 That was really nice.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.840
 That was really good.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 Born in the wrong century, mate.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.960
 (audience laughing)

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.280
 And the nice thing was, it was tunes that everyone knew.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.000
 So they used green sleeves for a load of ballads

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.880
 because you know, you couldn't say,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.040
 you couldn't get people to sing a news

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.200
 if they didn't know the tune.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.000
 That's so appropriate

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.760
 'cause didn't Henry VIII write that song?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.600
 No.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.440
 No, that is a myth.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440
 So it's completely...

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.960
 (audience laughing)

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.800
 Just a...

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.760
 No, no, no, there is a rumour that he did.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.600
 Yeah.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.960
 It was written around the same time as him.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.800
 So he wrote it?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.640
 I don't know.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.640
 (audience laughing)

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.680
 The thing is, if we think we have fake news now,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.160
 I mean, this was out of control.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.480
 So it was mostly kind of overheard gossip and rumours

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.120
 because so people having to sort of eavesdrop

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.800
 on diplomats and things like that

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.920
 and talk to people who talk to people who've been at court.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.600
 And so there was even a proclamation in 1672,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.240
 Charles II, in fact, issued a proclamation

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.120
 to restrain the spreading of false news,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.160
 which is just very epresient.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
 But there was even ballads about how they shouldn't write ballads

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.960
 that were so full of fake news.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.720
 (audience laughing)

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.040
 A whole ballad that was taking the piss saying,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.880
 "The all the ballads we hear these days

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.600
 are full of stories, stories, lies, and stories,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.920
 a pox on your newsletters, they lie both and flatters,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.840
 they are but a trap to weedle men in."

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.680
 Wow.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.360
 There are some Manchester ones.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.320
 It's so, I've read quite a few of them.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.760
 And they include things like these are all ballads

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.880
 that were real, the spinners lamentation,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.000
 Victoria Bridge on a Saturday night,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.280
 and Johnny Green's trip from Oldham

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.000
 to see the Manchester Railway.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.960
 (audience laughing)

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 Sounds fun.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.360
 I found a 17th century song, not telling the news,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.800
 but just a ballad that survived the times.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.320
 And the title of it is Kentish Dick

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.080
 or The Lusty Coachman of Westminster.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.120
 And it was a story about a guy who moved to London

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.400
 and he would go around wooing women

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.960
 and he would trick them into believing

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.440
 that he was gonna be there for all of their life.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.920
 And he would sleep with them and they might get pregnant

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.280
 and they thought they had a whole life with them

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.560
 and then he would just disappear

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.400
 and the whole song was teaching a moral

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.040
 and it has a line in it where the town seeks to sever from him

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.560
 that unruly limb.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.640
 Yeah.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.960
 And then he was just called Kentish after that, wasn't he?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.440
 (audience laughing)

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.480
 Do you know that under the town police

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.520
 clause is active 1847?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.840
 It's still an offense to publicly sing

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.480
 any profane or obscene song or ballad in the street.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320
 - Is it?

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.440
 - Yeah, so you're not allowed to do it.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.280
 - Oh.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.120
 - So Andy, sorry.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.120
 I don't know.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.640
 - We could have performed Citizens' Arrest on

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440
 all the people of Newcastle last night.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.640
 (audience laughing)

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.400
 - And when I was looking that up, I found this,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.760
 this isn't on topic at all,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.280
 but I found out that there is a pub in Whitehall in London

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.080
 called the Silver Cross Pub,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.720
 which is technically the nation's only legal brothel.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.560
 - Really?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.520
 - Because it was given a license by Charles I,

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.440
 which has never been revoked.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.680
 - What did he mean?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.160
 - And they have an upstairs room that you could hire.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.000
 - Yeah.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.400
 (audience laughing)

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.240
 - Just another fact.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.600
 (audience laughing)

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.400
 - That's actually the sponsor for this week's podcast.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.240
 - I was looking at some other ballads and what they were written for.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.840
 So a lot of them, maybe the most popular type

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.480
 were drinking songs, and they were used to be plastered up in pubs.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.440
 So, and this is particularly in Britain and England, especially.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.120
 So in England, ballads were written on single sides,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.440
 because they had to be used as wallpaper in various pubs.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.120
 Whereas in the continent, they were double sided,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.280
 because they were pamphlets.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.920
 But they had these drinking ballads

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.680
 and I read one of them, which was at the end of every verse,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.360
 it would say, "Oh, we've had this one drink now, bring us another."

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.280
 So every verse was, "You had to down your drink and get another one."

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.120
 And they had 13 verses.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.640
 So one song, you had to drink 13 pints.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.880
 - Whoa.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.200
 - There were quite a lot of heartbreak balance as well.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.680
 That was another big genre.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.240
 So I am a bachelor, isn't it sad?

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.800
 It was the title of one of them, or "Each has a lover but me."

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.600
 Daddy come home.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.440
 I don't think that is actually a single one.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.040
 Jack and his nuts, possibly a relation of Kentish dick.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.840
 And my favorite is Nancy, I have lost my wig.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.280
 Well, great song.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280
 That's awesome.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.240
 You were saying Anna about how they got these ballads

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.080
 and they put them on the wall in the pub.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.680
 They'd often put it on the doorpost of the inn,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.280
 and they used to call that posting.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.240
 And that's how we eventually get the phrase

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.000
 posting a message on the internet.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.840
 It's from the same story.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.560
 - You kidding. - Wow.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560
 - Wow.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.480
 - So you basically, you had posting things

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.040
 on the posts outside the pub,

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.160
 and then you went to, like, newspapers were called the post,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.640
 and then you would have postal services,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.520
 and then you had posting internet things.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.200
 - Oh, that's awesome.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.720
 - The phrase, dick pick, comes from Kentish dick.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.560
 - It used to be, he would do a woodcut of his penis.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.120
 (laughing)

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120
 - Don't say cut.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.520
 (laughing)

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.520
 - Don't say wood.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.960
 (laughing)

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.000
 - Thought very wrong.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.560
 and that is Andy.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.280
 - My fact is, that pound for pound,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.840
 a 33 gram finch can bite you 320 times harder

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.320
 than a T-Rex could.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.120
 (laughing)

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.640
 - Yeah, but pound for pound, actually.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.240
 (laughing)

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.760
 So there's not many pounds in a finch, is there?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.920
 - No.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.160
 - There's a line of T-Rex.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.000
 - That's true.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 So this is, like, it's good news in various ways,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.640
 because it turns out the finches are small

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.800
 and T-Rexes are all dead.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.280
 So, in a way, we're fine.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.120
 - Swim, win.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.960
 - Yeah, win, win.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.000
 But this is a study that has just been done

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.280
 into bite force, and it's, you know,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.440
 we know roughly what the T-Rex could jump.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.840
 So, if it bit you, it was the equivalent

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.360
 of 13 grand pianos landing on you.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.600
 (laughing)

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.760
 - Yeah.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.400
 - That's a brilliant cartoon, isn't it?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.600
 (laughing)

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600
 - I'm like, I'm Bill.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600
 (laughing)

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.840
 - So they could bite really, really hard.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.360
 There's no one disputing that.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.960
 But there's, there's, there's, the study has measured

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.080
 hundreds of different animals' bite strength,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.720
 and this tiny finch, the Galapagos finch,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.880
 has a very powerful bite, relative to its body size.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.560
 So, yeah.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.480
 I read that it's, the, if a finch was scaled up

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.280
 to a T-Rex's size, its bite would be 320 times stronger

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.840
 than that of a T-Rex.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.360
 And a T-Rex had a bite force of 12,800 pounds.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.080
 So, the finch would have a bite force of four million pounds.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.920
 - Whoa.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.560
 - And a rocket has five million pounds of thrust.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.400
 - Wow.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.600
 So, I don't think this is realistic, and yeah.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.040
 - I'm just so concerned now

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.080
 that someone involved with Jurassic Park 29, or wherever we are,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.640
 is listening, and is like, I've got the climactic moment

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.760
 to the next, Bill.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.840
 (laughing)

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920
 Giant finch thunder zone.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.920
 (laughing)

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.400
 Just swallows the T-Rex.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.880
 - That's what the author said, that this is Reading University,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.240
 and they said, "The King of the Dinosaurs

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.160
 would be no match for a finch in a fight

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.680
 if they were the same size."

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.400
 (laughing)

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.520
 - Oh my God, the idea of finch size T-Rex is very huge.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.360
 - Yeah.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.520
 - Well, you do, they do know what baby T-Rex's look like now.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.880
 - So they just write small T-Rexes?

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.720
 - Yeah, pretty much.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.560
 - Right.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.480
 - No, they've done a picture of what they might look like,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.920
 and they're really cute and fluffy,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.120
 and they had normal length dams

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.200
 compared to the T-Rexes have small arms,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.040
 but they have no more.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.160
 And so, at some stage in their puberty,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.200
 their arms just became small.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.040
 - Wow.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.840
 - Well, they keep growing, but their arms have stopped.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.680
 - Yeah.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.560
 (laughing)

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.200
 - Well, all their arms have become small.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.040
 It's like, it's--

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040
 - It's so relative, I think.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.160
 - It's one of them, it's so relative.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.920
 (laughing)

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.760
 - So it's a pinch, but if it bit me on my finger,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760
 what would that feel like?

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.240
 - Your hand would explode.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.080
 - What did?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.480
 - It would hardly hurt at all.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320
 - Not at all, really.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.480
 - And the thing is, basically,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.880
 it's the thing with ants being able

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.040
 to carry massive things, isn't it?

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.800
 If things are small, it's much easier for them

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.600
 to do things in impressive ways.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.760
 - That's true.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.960
 - Sorry, I was kidding.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.560
 (laughing)

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.880
 - That's my Tinder profile.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.400
 (laughing)

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.760
 - But you don't understand.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.920
 - Pound for pound, this is like average sex.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.920
 With a T-Rex.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.080
 (laughing)

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.920
 - Good.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.720
 Well, that under things that aren't gonna work.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.680
 (laughing)

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.360
 But they have just looked into T-Rex adolescence

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.520
 and discovered some quite interesting stuff about it.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.160
 So they have adolescence kind of like humans.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.200
 They have found out how old T-Rexes would grow too,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.160
 is about 28, and the adolescence happened

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.600
 between 14 and 18.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.240
 And that's where they just had their massive growth spurt.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.680
 And the way they can tell this is

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.640
 'cause they look at the growth rings on them.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.040
 So they study growth rings on ribs.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.440
 And they have mineral deposits that lay down

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.800
 every year as they grow.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.280
 And so then you can count, you know,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.200
 at what point they grew a lot suddenly.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.560
 - So they're like trees?

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.760
 - That's the analogy I was going for, yeah.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.280
 (laughing)

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.800
 - I was looking in, there's a museum,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.760
 which is the Museum of Astrius.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.760
 And it's in Spain, and they have a model of a T-Rex.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.120
 And it's the weirdest thing.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.280
 And this is a museum that they invite children to

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.400
 and adults and it's a family day out.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.200
 And the structure of it is,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.240
 they're showing two T-Rexes mid-copulation.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.200
 They're having sex.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.320
 So the female T-Rexes, it's a doggie style,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.880
 basically, position of these two giant skeletons.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.120
 And the weird thing is, there's no reason for it

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.000
 because we don't even know how they have sex.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.480
 There's just no point.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.560
 They're just speculating that that's what it is.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.840
 But when you go in there,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.840
 there's a T-Rex taking another T-Rex from behind.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.680
 It's crazy.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680
 (laughing)

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.760
 - They have started playing feathers on the museum,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.680
 which I appreciate.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.440
 I went to a natural history museum in Tasmania recently

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.360
 'cause you know, they discovered

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.440
 that most dinosaurs had feathers.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.560
 And so they've had to go back through

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.480
 all the old bloody museums and pin feathers

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.880
 to all their exhibits.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.440
 And they're doing it.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.120
 - Do you know that T-Rexes got mouthfulses?

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.920
 - No, really. - Yeah, they did.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.320
 So they looked at microbes in coprolites in T-Rex poo

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.760
 and they found that they had the same kind of microbes

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.840
 as birds get and it gives their mouthfulses.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.240
 So we think that probably T-Rexes had mouthfulses.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.160
 - That's amazing.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.800
 - So finches, yeah.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.920
 So this is a thing also about adolescence, actually.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.880
 Adolescent finches.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.400
 So teenage finches, they learn how to sing zebra finches.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.880
 They learn how to sing from their fathers

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.240
 and they get taught this incredibly complicated set of tunes.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.360
 But we have recently discovered.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.520
 So most animals learn kind of by road,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.160
 they just listen and repeat, listen and repeat.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.920
 What's really rare in the animal kingdom

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.720
 is learning via social cues.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.280
 So if I was singing my song and my father

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.560
 sort of gave a sign of approval or disapproval

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.320
 and you know, that's how they do it.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.360
 But they don't learn from their fathers.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.040
 They learn from their mothers

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.440
 and the way they learn is

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.640
 their mothers kind of give the signs of finding them attractive.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.640
 So they do what's called fluffing up,

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.960
 which is a signal that a female likes a male song.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.080
 And basically the young finches sing.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.360
 And if they get the song close to their father's song,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.400
 the mum fluffes up.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.800
 And it's basically she's saying,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.080
 that's just how your father wooed me.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080
 - That's quite a nice.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.040
 That's like a mum sending their son

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.680
 after the proms sorting out his hair before he leaves

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.520
 or something.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.080
 - But making it look exactly like his father's hair

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.280
 and saying, I'll find this attractive

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.520
 and I want you to look like it.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.280
 - It's a combination of sweet and creepy, yeah.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.880
 - It's back to the future, isn't it?

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.720
 - That's back to the future.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.840
 - They also, when they're tiny the finches,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.080
 they have a very amazing ability for feeding at night.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.040
 These are the baby finches and they lose this as they get older.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.640
 They have these little nodules that glow in the dark.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.560
 They're these blue nodules that suddenly glow

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.200
 so that when the mother is looking to feed them,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.200
 she can specify which ones are where

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.080
 and not lose any food in the process.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.920
 How cool is that?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.080
 - That's amazing.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080
 - They glow in the dark.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.000
 - On their singing, they have another very clever thing

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.880
 they do when they sing, which is,

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.200
 have started to happen since global warming became a thing.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.240
 And this is that zebra finches sing to the embryos

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.560
 in their eggs.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.200
 So the mothers will sing into their eggs

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.760
 and their singing will be a warning

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.840
 about the temperature outside.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.400
 And this tells the embryo inside the egg

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.320
 how much or how little to grow.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.720
 So if it's getting hot outside, which it often is now,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.040
 then the zebra finch sings a song to its embryo's going

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.560
 is pretty warm out here.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.720
 That's amazing.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.320
 Don't grow too big.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.800
 There's been an armed robbery in Gemstone.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.400
 I was just going to say, we've had them sing in the news.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.680
 Now we're having them sing in the weather.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.000
 We just need someone sing in the spot and we're there.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.040
 And the vampire finches, do you know who's going to snuggle those guys?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.840
 They have very sharp beaks and they pick at the skin of boobies

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:07.560
 and they drink the blood out of these booby birds

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.600
 and it even breaks into the booby eggs and drinks the contents.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.800
 And sometimes it does it with humans.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.840
 Sometimes it will try and peck on a human

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.120
 and try and get at the blood as well.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.880
 But not the human eggs?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.280
 No.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.800
 That's a very difficult thing to do, isn't it?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.120
 I don't know how it's got there.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.800
 You've got bigger things to worry about.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.720
 A low process of trust gaining over the months.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.240
 You start with the boobies.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.720
 This fact is also about biting.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.640
 I've found a couple of things about biting.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.160
 This is just a bit of a useful thing to know.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.440
 And it's something that science is looking into at the moment

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.240
 because I think it can be applied in the long term

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.920
 to mosquito sprays.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.960
 But mosquitoes, if a mosquito is biting you,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.920
 if you slap your arm or wherever it's biting,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.400
 if you slap there, it sends vibrations up through to mosquito.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.280
 And when they leap off, they associate the smell

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.600
 that you have with what just happened there,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.600
 the fear that they might be killed.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.160
 And the reason that mosquito is land on us

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.480
 is they're attracted to a smell.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.920
 And they remember the smell.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.800
 So it turns out that if you do that,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.400
 you're going to put the mosquito off for 24 hours.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.520
 That same mosquito won't come back and land on you.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.720
 It might be a different one, but it will think,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.000
 I might get killed if I go back to that smell.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.040
 Remember the smell of your body.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.560
 Exactly.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.640
 So they think that's a threat.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.560
 I can't go back there.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.640
 That might kill me.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.440
 So all mosquito products at the moment

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.120
 are trying to work out how they can get what we manage

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.920
 to do with our pheromones and our body smell into that

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.520
 in order to stop.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.160
 But next time you've got mosquitoes around,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.160
 just slap yourself a lot.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.080
 And you'll be all of your body.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.560
 Just slap yourself silly.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.640
 And yeah.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.280
 But it kind of implies that the next mosquito repellents

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.320
 are just going to be lots of little slappers

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.120
 that we have to pin to our bodies.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.400
 I can't lay little mouse traps all over us,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.440
 constantly smacking us.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.640
 I'd rather be bitten.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640
 OK.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.800
 That's firstly.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.760
 For everyone else, it lasts for 24 hours.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.400
 That's pretty good.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.120
 Yeah.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.600
 Do you know what makes-- so humans, we have a certain bike

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.040
 question.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.840
 We have quite a strong bite.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.800
 But do you know we probably could bite much harder than we do.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.120
 But what would you think holds us back?

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.880
 What do you think determines how hard we bite?

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.000
 How good our muscles are in our jaws.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.800
 So--

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.880
 I say willpower.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.320
 So I think--

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.120
 James is wrong, Andy's more wrong.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.560
 This is--

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.040
 That's a dreamy girl for the three-time.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.640
 I just think socially it looks awkward

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.640
 if you're biting harder than--

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.680
 we have a winner.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.800
 There we go.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.240
 No, this is an experiment that was done

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.280
 by a guy called Dr. G. E. Black.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.960
 This was actually in 1933.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.160
 It was a long time ago.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.080
 But he invented what he called a nathodinomometer.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.680
 And this was basically-- he put some rubber pads on the steel

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.520
 instrument he designed.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.120
 And he got 1,000 people to bite down on it.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.200
 And he worked out that the restrictive factor

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.360
 on how hard you can bite is not your jaw strength.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.280
 It's your teeth.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.560
 So the people stopped biting when they said my teeth really

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.280
 hurt.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.720
 And actually, if you think about it,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.360
 when your jaw more power than your teeth

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.080
 are able to withstand.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.920
 So if you just man up and deal with the tooth pain--

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.760
 Willpower.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.880
 That's what it says.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.960
 Yeah.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.760
 Yep, you're right.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.880
 I amend my response.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.720
 You're correct.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720
 Thank you.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.320
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.000
 And that is James.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.120
 OK, my fact this week is that the most polluted city

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.560
 in the world is Kanpur.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.440
 It is nicknamed the Manchester of the East.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.960
 I've lost them, guys.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.160
 Unbelievably risky.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.440
 What do you think, Amy?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.800
 So I mean, this is true.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.240
 It's their particles in the air.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.880
 It's especially particles with a diameter of less

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.920
 than 2.5 micrometers, which basically means soot.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.600
 And it's because of the tanning industry.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.560
 There's a local wind called the Lou of Kanpur, which

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.280
 gives them really bad dust storms.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.280
 And it's, yeah, it's really, really bad.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.960
 But the reason that they call it the Manchester of the East

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.280
 is because, obviously, Manchester

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.520
 used to have extremely bad pollution.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.400
 And also, it's kind of an industrial town.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.440
 A Manchester is one of the most famous industrial towns,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.240
 because it's such a great city.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.840
 Nice.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:09.840
 Good.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.600
 It's kind of bad.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600
 Yeah.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.840
 A great back track.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.640
 You say Manchester used to have quite bad pollution.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.240
 Let's face it, it still does.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.480
 So I actually thought this would be a thing where we went,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.200
 oh, and it's such a misnomer, because Manchester's fine now.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.800
 And if you look at air pollution rates,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.200
 I always thought London was the worst.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.480
 But actually, topping the list from last year

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.800
 is Port Talbot in Wales, because they've got big steelworks.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.520
 And then second is not, in fact, Manchester.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.680
 It is where we are right now, which is sulphur.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.840
 Scumthorpe and sulphur, joint second.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.760
 And do you know what's third?

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.400
 This is really where the third most polluted place in Britain.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:51.880
 No.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.280
 Gibraltar.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.280
 What?

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.840
 Well, I'm sure it won't be for long.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.160
 That is because half of the world's sea trade

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.880
 goes through the Gibraltar strait.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.120
 And so all of those polluting particles coming from the sea.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.800
 And they have no countryside around there.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.480
 It's just that literally that little rock.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.000
 It just pulls in there.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.520
 Those poor monkeys.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.440
 So the term acid rain was coined in Manchester in 1872.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.640
 Friedrich Engels, who I lived here for a little while,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.280
 he described it as a place of filth

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.040
 ruin and inhabits a bullness.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.200
 And he described it as hell on earth.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.400
 But in fairness at the time, it was when Manchester

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.480
 was really growing.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.080
 And people had come over from Ireland.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.040
 And the cotton mills had just started.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.040
 And it was not a great place to live unlike now.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.440
 And so, although having said that,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.560
 there was a pub for every 139 residents of Manchester.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.120
 Nice.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.080
 Wow.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.360
 And one in 40 of the city's population

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.120
 was arrested for drunkenness within a single year.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120
 Wow.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.360
 [APPLAUSE]

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.920
 That's very good.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.680
 I found a different thing that Engels observed when he was in town.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.920
 1845, he was around.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.440
 He was amazed to discover that there

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.880
 were flourishing pigries in every back street in the city.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.360
 Yes, still.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.120
 You haven't been around today.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.160
 Yeah, but it was very useful.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.240
 And in fact, that was the case all over the country.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.480
 It wasn't just Manchester.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.040
 Is it a pigery just where you're farming pigs?

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.560
 It's a pig.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.560
 It's a pig.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.440
 It's whatever tiny space you keep a pig in as a pigery.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.960
 It depends on the presence or absence of a pig.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.640
 If hasn't got a pig in there, it's just a small yard.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.200
 Are you claiming that if you've got one pig,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.080
 you've got a pigery?

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.880
 Yes.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880
 Really?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.320
 No, it's not a thriving pigery, is it?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.960
 I would say it's on its last leg.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.120
 It's a struggling pigery.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.440
 Yeah, but it's a very good waste disposal unit.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.520
 All rubbish goes into the pig and the pig eats everything.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.480
 And then you eat the pig.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.920
 Yeah, perfect.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.200
 It's a slightly slow way of eating lots of rubbish, basically.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.200
 Just on city nicknames, this--

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.960
 so this is about a city nickname.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.760
 And Manchester used to be called Cottonopolis.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.000
 And you say it wasn't a good place to be,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.840
 but it's always very much swings around about.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.360
 So in the 19th century, it was also extremely wealthy

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.920
 and kind of an awesome place to be, because you could make money.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.400
 But I was reading an account of someone

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.760
 who was traveling around Manchester for the first time

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.680
 in the mid-19th century and loving it and, you know,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.000
 saying, you know, it's so brilliant

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.040
 and people are all about the cotton mills.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.240
 And he kept on asking to be shown round a cotton mill,

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.760
 like given a tourist visitor tour.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.520
 And they would never let him, because they

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.640
 were so paranoid about everyone else stealing their technology,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.160
 because they had the best cotton technology they went and out in.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.640
 In 1871, 32% of all the cotton in the world

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.560
 was made in Manchester.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.400
 Oh, wow.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.560
 On the planet, a whole planet.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.200
 I just say that's incredible.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.920
 So there were gangs as well, because obviously lots of people

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.240
 moving from the country to the city, lots of people

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.120
 in a cramped space, you get gangs.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.520
 And are the people familiar with the skuttlers?

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.440
 Is that a thing still?

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.280
 Not still.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.880
 OK.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.000
 They are not thriving.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.680
 It's like the Piggory.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.680
 But they were a gang who really plagued the city in the late 19th century.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.080
 And they had a very distinctive look.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.560
 They had a fringe, which was called a donkey fringe.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.080
 And they had neck-achiefs, which told you which gang they were in,

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.000
 which was quite smart.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.920
 So you could see the stripes of the spots.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.200
 And so, oh, you were that gang.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.960
 But the way they started, the skuttlers,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.560
 it started with a historical reenactment society that got out of hand.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.200
 No.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.920
 So it's a historical, Andrew Davis has written a book about this.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.000
 This is what it says about the book.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.160
 Davis has identified the trigger point for skuttling

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.800
 as arising from the reception of the Franco-Prussian wall

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.840
 by the schoolboys of ancodes.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.000
 Young boys recreated the battles on the streets of ancodes

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.560
 using the categories of Catholic French and Protestant Russian

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.160
 to reflect their own legences.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.600
 The game very quickly evolved into a widespread folk for street battles.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.560
 And it just turned into gang warfare.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.120
 Wow.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.080
 The worst place to go was on Deansgate, wasn't it?

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.640
 That was where they all hung out.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640
 OK.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.120
 And the absolute worst place was a hovel

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.920
 on the corner of Harbin Street and Deansgate,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.000
 which today is a Wagababas.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.560
 Oh, wow.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.040
 I've only gone downhill.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.880
 I have a sort of modern Manchester fact.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.960
 I imagine everyone here will know this.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.400
 So apologies to the crowd here.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.640
 But people at home and overseas won't know this.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.760
 But we all know Manchester United and Man City as the football teams.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.480
 And in 2011, they were awarded the third-ever annual Jelly

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.240
 Dona Award for--

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.440
 it's done by the accredited language services.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.840
 They award the best translation errors each year.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.000
 And when the Man City Stadium was the Etihad Stadium,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.960
 Etihad in Arabic means United.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.760
 And--

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.760
 No.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.800
 Yeah.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.000
 Oh, my goodness.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.200
 Yeah.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.720
 So Man City suddenly were playing in the Etihad.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.040
 That's such a good fact.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.720
 I love it.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.040
 You know, Xi Jinping came to Manchester in 2015

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.720
 and visited Man City.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.960
 And he visited the stadium.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.920
 And he was given a copy of the rules of football as a gift,

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.000
 because football was something that was invented in England.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.080
 And so he was given a copy of the rules that were drawn up

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.440
 in 1863.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.440
 And in exchange, Xi Jinping gave us a copper representation

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.760
 of a figure playing Kuzhu, the football-esque sport invented

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.200
 in China 2,000 years ago.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.680
 Wow.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.640
 Feels like a bit of a slam.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.040
 Just on world leaders, do you know that Manchester United

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.000
 was literally hours away from being

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.600
 owned by Colonel Gaddafi?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.080
 Really?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.600
 Yeah.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.440
 So not the whole thing, but a huge percentage, 29.9%.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.840
 It was the guy who broke the deal to the Glazer family

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.160
 who did take over.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.640
 He said it was hours away from not going to them

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.560
 and going to Gaddafi instead.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.320
 Bad luck, guys.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.640
 What might have been?

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.440
 OK.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.720
 It is time for a final fact of the show.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.680
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.840
 My fight is that dogs over 35 centimeters tall

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.400
 are banned from Beijing.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.360
 There's a high restriction.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.320
 They all get measured.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.240
 If they're too tall, they've got to go.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.080
 So China has this bizarre history with dog laws.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.240
 And this one was passed in 2003.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.840
 And it was about what breeds of dogs and what kind of dogs

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.880
 are allowed in Beijing in the center of Beijing, really.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.760
 And then in bits of the rural districts,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.040
 if you're taller than 35 centimeters and a dog, not allowed,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.640
 if you are on a list of 41 breeds that they listed,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.320
 you're not allowed.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.440
 So like setters, greyhounds, mastiffs,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.600
 holding the sheep dogs.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.560
 There's really huge shaggy things.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.160
 Band, collies, also called a band.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.920
 Dogs, Dalmatian, all the classics.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.600
 Chow Chows, which I had a chow-chow and a chow-chow

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.960
 is a Chinese dog.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.440
 So that's weird.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.200
 I thought chow-chows were quite small.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.840
 No, chow-chows, they're like the Chewbacca looking guys.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.520
 Oh, right.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520
 OK.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.120
 And they used to be warrior dogs for the Chinese armies.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.600
 And so they're very revered there.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.280
 So that's bizarre that they're on that list.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.680
 But could you get your dog to, for example, sit?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.920
 So it's shorter than 35 centimeters tall.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.440
 It won't change your height when you sit down, like--

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.800
 But they could do that wiping bum shuffle that they do,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.320
 and just walk like that.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.520
 What about-- you could give it a haircut.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.400
 So you could-- I bet if you shaved a sheep dog,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.480
 there's tiny under all that.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.720
 The whole point is that these breeds

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.240
 are banned no matter how tall they are.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.040
 No, but I reckon you wouldn't recognize a sheep dog

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.440
 if it was completely shaved with all of that.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.080
 There are some breeds that would be allowed

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.200
 if they're under 35, but no, if they're over 35.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.200
 So you could shave them.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.520
 But if you're right on that cusp,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.120
 I don't know if they'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120
 There was a crackdown.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.960
 They cracked down properly on this in 2014,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.680
 and there were all these owners of pets that were suddenly told

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.640
 they were outlawed, who were having a bit of a disaster.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.640
 The government said, why don't you just give your pets away

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.480
 to shelters?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.920
 And obviously, people didn't do that.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.200
 Because that's a way thing to do to your dog of 10 years.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.800
 But there is a lot of luxury stuff for pets.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.840
 So there's this weird division between the Chinese government,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.160
 which is cracking down on animals.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.640
 And then there are lots of tiny dogs,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.640
 and those are treated very luxuriously.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.440
 It's a really popular thing in China.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:24.940
 Yeah.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.960
 So there are play centres just for dogs,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.280
 which have got indoor swimming pools, and ball pits,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.120
 and obstacle courses.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.520
 There's pet acupuncture.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.080
 That's quite a big thing.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.880
 And there's-- there are dog hotels which

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.000
 have dogs cinemas in.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.320
 Yeah.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.440
 And the film's especially designed for dogs eyesight.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.560
 I don't know what that means.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.640
 So I think they see stuff, more frames per second than us,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.840
 about twice as many.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.080
 So maybe they have many more frames per second in the film.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.280
 So this is why dogs don't get very captivated by television.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.880
 It's one reason, isn't it?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.440
 Other reasons that they're very, very stupid animals.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.360
 But it looks to them, I guess there is a photographs

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.120
 one after the other.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120
 So I guess this is--

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:04.640
 Yeah.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.640
 So if you suddenly fast forward a movie on your TV,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.480
 are they like, whoa, what is this?

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:15.080
 In Dorset, there is a spa hotel for guinea pigs.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.600
 What is that in tail?

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.280
 Well, for 16 pounds, you can get a pedicure.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.080
 16.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.000
 16.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.720
 That's pretty good.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.080
 Well, you need to pay for the hotel,

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.080
 but this is just an extra on the side thing.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.560
 Oh, sorry.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.240
 I thought this was a nice B&B for a guinea pig.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:36.040
 Well, they don't eat much B, and they don't need a very big B.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.440
 So for your 16 pounds anyway, you get a pedicure.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.520
 You get two washes with lice shampoo, anti-lice shampoo.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.840
 You get a haircut, a towel dry, a massage,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.400
 while watching a movie, and a snooze.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.440
 Wow.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.640
 You have to pay for a snooze.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.560
 That is a rip off.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.360
 But, yeah, in China, people are very into their dogs,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.920
 but they worked out recently that the city dwelling

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.040
 millennials are responsible for 70% of pet spending

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.560
 in China, which is actually quite weird,

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.800
 because millennials are-- it's basically

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.480
 people born in their 80s and 90s, which

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.840
 is pretty young to be spending a lot on pets.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.640
 But they think it's because they've been--

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.120
 this is what the economist said.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.200
 They've been lured away from their families and friends

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.520
 by jobs in the big cities, meaning they're incredibly

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.040
 lonely at this point.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.760
 A lot of people single.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.400
 The air is very bad outside, as previously discussed.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.800
 And it's extremely easy to stay inside and just watch stuff

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.520
 on the internet.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.920
 It's nice to have someone with you when you do that.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.160
 And by the way, there are 200 million unmarried people

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.000
 in their 20s and 30s in China, which

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.360
 is-- if you think about that as a proportion of world population,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.480
 it's a lot of single people.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.360
 200 billion in 20s and 30s.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:43.960
 Yeah.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.160
 Wow.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:44.800
 Single.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.360
 Yeah.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.200
 It's a lot.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.800
 They're all sitting there with their dogs inside.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.560
 This woman said, I live alone.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.880
 And it's nice to have little Yui waiting,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.600
 all happy to see me when I get home.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.840
 And she said, this is-- she flipped through

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.760
 photos of cats on her iPhone.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.440
 I just feel like there's a social problem

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.400
 that we need to address.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400
 Yeah.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.760
 Just some dog sizes in Japan.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.800
 I was being told earlier by Ash Gardner, who wrote our theme

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.160
 tune, when he was in Japan, there were parks there.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.160
 And I started googling this after he said it.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.960
 Yo-yo, Guy Park.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.720
 It's in Japan.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.800
 And what they have is they want to make sure

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.600
 that dogs that go to the park have a great experience.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.320
 So there is a weight and size category for dogs,

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.280
 of which bit of the park they go to.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.760
 So they separate the big dogs from the little dogs.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.200
 And the little dogs and the medium dogs hang out together.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.000
 And they all play.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.120
 And the big dogs have to go to another section.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.720
 So they separate it to no fights break out amongst the dogs.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.000
 I think that sounds a bit sort of like, size-ist.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.960
 I think that sounds good.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.760
 That's segregation.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.560
 Segregation.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.520
 You post segregation?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.040
 No.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.680
 That was just like very big dogs, or it's more ones.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.480
 Look, never mind.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.440
 Never has anyone backed out from a nightmare so quickly.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.960
 Dogs are much less clever than humans like to think.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.040
 So there are lots of people who think

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.720
 that dogs are very, very clever.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.160
 And the science doesn't really bear it out, unfortunately.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.560
 And I can feel the room slipping away, as I say this.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.480
 But-- so dogs, for example, can't recognize themselves

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.880
 in mirrors, which some animals can do.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.960
 And on lots of measures, they're about the same as pigeons.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.360
 And they can't fly, either.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.600
 And they can't even fly useless.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.320
 But the doctor who carried out this work, Brita Osthaus,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.840
 she did work about 10 years ago, which

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.680
 showed the dogs were cleverer than cats.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.320
 And she got a big backlash then from all the cat owners,

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.080
 saying, my cat says cleverer is any dog.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.720
 And now she's done this research.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.480
 She's got a backlash from dog owners.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.320
 And when she published this study, and it was printed

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.000
 over the times, there was lots of backlash

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 at the comments section.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.200
 One times, Brita wrote, we once had a beagle who

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.040
 could open the refrigerator with his paws.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 Case closed.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.080
 Just on the idea of having small dogs,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.960
 there is concern to be had when you do hang out

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.000
 with just small dogs.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.800
 In America, recently, there was a warning

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.440
 when there was a big storm that hit Cleveland,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.040
 with 50 mile an hour winds there.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.760
 The weather bureau released a statement saying,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.800
 can everyone please be careful?

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.160
 These winds are huge.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.520
 And things that can happen are trash cans will go missing.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.640
 Trees will fall.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.560
 And dogs will go flying.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.680
 And yeah, they did a small dog warning.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.000
 And it's the idea that when the winds pick up so high,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.800
 they get lobbed off into the air.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.880
 And if you're not holding on to them by leash,

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.680
 they will disappear.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.560
 And if you are holding on to them by leash,

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.800
 you've got an amazing kite.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 Yeah.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.160
 Now, they did do this slightly tongue-in-cheek,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.680
 but it is based on real incidences

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.880
 that have happened in America.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.640
 Stories that you can read up on, for example, a 72-year-old couple,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.240
 or a 72-year-old lady called Dorothy Ottley,

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.600
 she lost her chihuahua.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.720
 Sorry, he's good to her.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720
 He's good to her.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.960
 Come on.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.680
 And she lost her chihuahua toto in a ton of ease, isn't it?

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.920
 She live in Kansas.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.680
 Wow, did you have to notice that?

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.720
 No, it was a 6-pound chihuahua called Tinkerbell.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.720
 And they are mixing their movies here.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.600
 Yeah, this is cross-jogger movie.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.640
 They were walking around in a 70-mile-an-hour wind

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.120
 came and it picked Tinkerbell up, and it took her off in the wind.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.280
 And they couldn't find her.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.760
 And what they actually ended up doing

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.320
 is that they hired a pet psychic called Laurie.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320
 OK.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.160
 Right.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.560
 Well, they had my sympathy for a good long time there.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.760
 Laurie said, you have to stop looking in lowlands,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.320
 where you think--

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.520
 Was Laurie a pet who was also a psychic?

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.440
 No, no, no, she was a psychic of pets.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.640
 And she was also a third-generation psychic.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.120
 So she was the granddaughter of original psychic.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.360
 Yeah, it was all because of that.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.120
 There's a lot of nepotism in psychic, isn't there?

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.360
 My father was a fraud.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.320
 My grandfather was a fraud.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.160
 And so she said to them, you need to look up.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.040
 And so the volunteers started looking outside of the swamp

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.720
 and up the hill.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.920
 And they found Tinkerbell.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.720
 And so my point is that you will lose a dog in the wind.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.720
 Right.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.120
 OK, that is it.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.400
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.040
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.840

 I don't know how to end.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.120

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.960

 Yep, or you can go to our group account, which is at no such thing.

 You can go to our website as well.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.840
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.000
 We have everything up there from all of our previous episodes

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.280

 Thank you so much, sulfur.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.480
 You've been awesome.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.360
 We'll see you again.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.800
 Good night.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.960
