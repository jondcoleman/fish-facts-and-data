00:00:10,00:00:13,(upbeat music)
00:00:13,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:23,this week coming to you live from the Lowry in Salford.
00:00:23,00:00:26,(audience cheering)
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:33,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Ani Chazinski,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:40,00:00:43,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:43,00:00:46,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:46,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,and that's my fact this week.
00:00:50,00:00:53,"My fact is that in 17th century Europe,"
00:00:53,00:00:56,people used to sing each other the news.
00:00:56,00:00:57,(audience laughing)
00:00:57,00:00:59,That's how they got the news.
00:00:59,00:01:01,It would be sung at their face.
00:01:01,00:01:03,♪ There's been a theft ♪
00:01:03,00:01:05,"Like that, like that thing."
00:01:05,00:01:06,Yeah.
00:01:06,00:01:07,"No, this is the thing."
00:01:07,00:01:10,"In the 17th century, illiteracy rates were so high"
00:01:10,00:01:12,"that if they did publish newspapers,"
00:01:12,00:01:14,no one was really buying them because they couldn't read them.
00:01:14,00:01:16,So what they ended up doing was they were taking
00:01:16,00:01:19,"classic, classic ballads of the time,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,but then applying just the news of the data them.
00:01:22,00:01:24,And so people would go on the streets
00:01:24,00:01:25,and they would start singing the news
00:01:25,00:01:28,and people would memorize the songs that they were singing
00:01:28,00:01:30,and they would pass it on and pass it on.
00:01:30,00:01:31,And that's how the news got around.
00:01:31,00:01:34,And so it was for everything from political news
00:01:34,00:01:37,"to sentimental stories, religious news,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"royal rumors, medical advice."
00:01:39,00:01:41,Did they do like an unfindly at the end
00:01:41,00:01:43,with a dog on a surfboard or something?
00:01:43,00:01:45,(audience laughing)
00:01:45,00:01:47,They did have a paywall.
00:01:47,00:01:49,So people plugged the ballads.
00:01:49,00:01:51,So there were guys going around selling the ballads
00:01:51,00:01:54,and they would sing them to the audience on the street
00:01:54,00:01:56,"going on to drum up interest,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,but they would not sing the last verse.
00:01:58,00:01:59,So you didn't know how it ended.
00:01:59,00:02:02,"So there was a thing where it goes gray on the website,"
00:02:02,00:02:03,but that's an execution ballad.
00:02:03,00:02:04,How often was it?
00:02:04,00:02:06,And he pulled his head out just in time.
00:02:06,00:02:08,(audience laughing)
00:02:08,00:02:11,"Well, it is a bit like the internet today, isn't it?"
00:02:11,00:02:13,'Cause so they had these sheets
00:02:13,00:02:16,that you could buy the sheet music if you wanted to
00:02:16,00:02:19,and then you could share it on the streets by singing it
00:02:19,00:02:21,and then it gave you ideas of morality
00:02:21,00:02:22,and stuff like that.
00:02:22,00:02:25,So it is a little bit like reading the news on the internet
00:02:25,00:02:27,and then sharing it and then commenting on it.
00:02:27,00:02:27,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:27,00:02:30,Except it was just a lot more gruesome.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"I mean, they were kind of disgusting in their taste."
00:02:32,00:02:33,I don't know if you've heard any of the news
00:02:33,00:02:34,over the last few years.
00:02:34,00:02:35,(audience laughing)
00:02:35,00:02:37,The fact that I'm not on social media
00:02:37,00:02:39,makes that an unreliable comment.
00:02:39,00:02:40,But there was one.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"So there was a French song in fact,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,which was set to a really fun tune apparently.
00:02:44,00:02:46,So they were like quite upbeat.
00:02:46,00:02:48,And it was about a hugano whose execution got interrupted
00:02:48,00:02:50,because the people thought that they weren't being harsh enough
00:02:50,00:02:53,"or just chopping his head off or hanging him, sorry,"
00:02:53,00:02:54,they were hanging him.
00:02:54,00:02:56,And so the people dragged him to a dung heap
00:02:56,00:02:59,"and mutilated him and this ballad went,"
00:02:59,00:03:02,the little children all got together yelling
00:03:02,00:03:04,"and singing joyously, having a great time,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"pulling out his innards to throw them in the fire,"
00:03:06,00:03:08,removing his guts and organs
00:03:08,00:03:10,and then a dog swallowed his heart.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"There you go, there you go."
00:03:12,00:03:14,(audience laughing)
00:03:14,00:03:15,Doesn't even rhyme.
00:03:15,00:03:17,(audience laughing)
00:03:17,00:03:19,I think it rhymed in French to be there.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"But they used to as well, not just report the news,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"but in the execution ballads, this moral thing"
00:03:24,00:03:27,"that James is talking about, they used to then do verses"
00:03:27,00:03:29,from the perspective of the person
00:03:29,00:03:31,"who was killed, guilty and her hanged."
00:03:31,00:03:33,And that's where the moral would come in.
00:03:33,00:03:35,"They would suddenly, it was as if the news"
00:03:35,00:03:36,"was reading a quote from someone,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,but that quote never existed.
00:03:38,00:03:41,"So they would be saying, oh, I lament what I did"
00:03:41,00:03:43,and I wish I had not done it.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"And oh, what a silly sausage I was."
00:03:45,00:03:50,And that was the way of saying that everyone was upset
00:03:50,00:03:51,about the crime they committed in a new show.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"This mortal life, I will depart"
00:03:53,00:03:56,to then a dog will swallow my heart.
00:03:56,00:03:57,(audience laughing)
00:03:57,00:03:57,And then you end.
00:03:57,00:03:58,Yes?
00:03:58,00:03:59,Yeah.
00:03:59,00:04:00,That was really nice.
00:04:00,00:04:01,That was really good.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"Born in the wrong century, mate."
00:04:03,00:04:04,(audience laughing)
00:04:04,00:04:07,"And the nice thing was, it was tunes that everyone knew."
00:04:07,00:04:10,So they used green sleeves for a load of ballads
00:04:10,00:04:11,"because you know, you couldn't say,"
00:04:11,00:04:13,you couldn't get people to sing a news
00:04:13,00:04:14,if they didn't know the tune.
00:04:14,00:04:15,That's so appropriate
00:04:15,00:04:16,'cause didn't Henry VIII write that song?
00:04:16,00:04:17,No.
00:04:17,00:04:18,"No, that is a myth."
00:04:18,00:04:19,So it's completely...
00:04:19,00:04:20,(audience laughing)
00:04:20,00:04:21,Just a...
00:04:21,00:04:23,"No, no, no, there is a rumour that he did."
00:04:23,00:04:24,Yeah.
00:04:24,00:04:25,It was written around the same time as him.
00:04:25,00:04:26,So he wrote it?
00:04:26,00:04:27,I don't know.
00:04:27,00:04:28,(audience laughing)
00:04:28,00:04:30,"The thing is, if we think we have fake news now,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,"I mean, this was out of control."
00:04:32,00:04:35,So it was mostly kind of overheard gossip and rumours
00:04:35,00:04:38,because so people having to sort of eavesdrop
00:04:38,00:04:39,on diplomats and things like that
00:04:39,00:04:41,and talk to people who talk to people who've been at court.
00:04:41,00:04:45,"And so there was even a proclamation in 1672,"
00:04:45,00:04:48,"Charles II, in fact, issued a proclamation"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"to restrain the spreading of false news,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,which is just very epresient.
00:04:53,00:04:57,But there was even ballads about how they shouldn't write ballads
00:04:57,00:04:58,that were so full of fake news.
00:04:58,00:05:00,(audience laughing)
00:05:00,00:05:03,"A whole ballad that was taking the piss saying,"
00:05:03,00:05:04,"""The all the ballads we hear these days"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"are full of stories, stories, lies, and stories,"
00:05:07,00:05:11,"a pox on your newsletters, they lie both and flatters,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,"they are but a trap to weedle men in."""
00:05:13,00:05:14,Wow.
00:05:14,00:05:16,There are some Manchester ones.
00:05:16,00:05:19,"It's so, I've read quite a few of them."
00:05:19,00:05:21,And they include things like these are all ballads
00:05:21,00:05:24,"that were real, the spinners lamentation,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,"Victoria Bridge on a Saturday night,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,and Johnny Green's trip from Oldham
00:05:30,00:05:32,to see the Manchester Railway.
00:05:32,00:05:33,(audience laughing)
00:05:33,00:05:34,Sounds fun.
00:05:34,00:05:38,"I found a 17th century song, not telling the news,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,but just a ballad that survived the times.
00:05:40,00:05:43,And the title of it is Kentish Dick
00:05:43,00:05:48,or The Lusty Coachman of Westminster.
00:05:48,00:05:52,And it was a story about a guy who moved to London
00:05:52,00:05:54,and he would go around wooing women
00:05:54,00:05:55,and he would trick them into believing
00:05:55,00:05:58,that he was gonna be there for all of their life.
00:05:58,00:06:00,And he would sleep with them and they might get pregnant
00:06:00,00:06:02,and they thought they had a whole life with them
00:06:02,00:06:03,and then he would just disappear
00:06:03,00:06:06,and the whole song was teaching a moral
00:06:06,00:06:10,and it has a line in it where the town seeks to sever from him
00:06:10,00:06:11,that unruly limb.
00:06:11,00:06:12,(audience laughing)
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yeah.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"And then he was just called Kentish after that, wasn't he?"
00:06:15,00:06:19,(audience laughing)
00:06:19,00:06:21,Do you know that under the town police
00:06:21,00:06:23,clause is active 1847?
00:06:23,00:06:25,It's still an offense to publicly sing
00:06:25,00:06:29,any profane or obscene song or ballad in the street.
00:06:29,00:06:30,- Is it?
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- Yeah, so you're not allowed to do it."
00:06:31,00:06:32,- Oh.
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- So Andy, sorry."
00:06:33,00:06:34,I don't know.
00:06:34,00:06:35,- We could have performed Citizens' Arrest on
00:06:35,00:06:37,all the people of Newcastle last night.
00:06:37,00:06:39,(audience laughing)
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- And when I was looking that up, I found this,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,"this isn't on topic at all,"
00:06:42,00:06:45,but I found out that there is a pub in Whitehall in London
00:06:45,00:06:47,"called the Silver Cross Pub,"
00:06:47,00:06:50,which is technically the nation's only legal brothel.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- Really?
00:06:51,00:06:53,"- Because it was given a license by Charles I,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,which has never been revoked.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- What did he mean?
00:06:56,00:06:59,- And they have an upstairs room that you could hire.
00:06:59,00:07:00,- Yeah.
00:07:00,00:07:01,(audience laughing)
00:07:01,00:07:02,- Just another fact.
00:07:02,00:07:04,(audience laughing)
00:07:04,00:07:07,- That's actually the sponsor for this week's podcast.
00:07:07,00:07:11,- I was looking at some other ballads and what they were written for.
00:07:11,00:07:14,"So a lot of them, maybe the most popular type"
00:07:14,00:07:19,"were drinking songs, and they were used to be plastered up in pubs."
00:07:19,00:07:22,"So, and this is particularly in Britain and England, especially."
00:07:22,00:07:25,"So in England, ballads were written on single sides,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,because they had to be used as wallpaper in various pubs.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"Whereas in the continent, they were double sided,"
00:07:29,00:07:30,because they were pamphlets.
00:07:30,00:07:31,But they had these drinking ballads
00:07:31,00:07:35,"and I read one of them, which was at the end of every verse,"
00:07:35,00:07:39,"it would say, ""Oh, we've had this one drink now, bring us another."""
00:07:39,00:07:42,"So every verse was, ""You had to down your drink and get another one."""
00:07:42,00:07:44,And they had 13 verses.
00:07:44,00:07:48,"So one song, you had to drink 13 pints."
00:07:48,00:07:49,- Whoa.
00:07:49,00:07:53,- There were quite a lot of heartbreak balance as well.
00:07:53,00:07:54,That was another big genre.
00:07:54,00:07:58,"So I am a bachelor, isn't it sad?"
00:07:58,00:08:02,"It was the title of one of them, or ""Each has a lover but me."""
00:08:02,00:08:03,Daddy come home.
00:08:03,00:08:07,I don't think that is actually a single one.
00:08:07,00:08:12,"Jack and his nuts, possibly a relation of Kentish dick."
00:08:12,00:08:15,"And my favorite is Nancy, I have lost my wig."
00:08:15,00:08:17,"Well, great song."
00:08:17,00:08:18,That's awesome.
00:08:18,00:08:20,You were saying Anna about how they got these ballads
00:08:20,00:08:22,and they put them on the wall in the pub.
00:08:22,00:08:24,"They'd often put it on the doorpost of the inn,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,and they used to call that posting.
00:08:26,00:08:28,And that's how we eventually get the phrase
00:08:28,00:08:30,posting a message on the internet.
00:08:30,00:08:30,It's from the same story.
00:08:30,00:08:32,- You kidding. - Wow.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- Wow.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- So you basically, you had posting things"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"on the posts outside the pub,"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"and then you went to, like, newspapers were called the post,"
00:08:40,00:08:41,"and then you would have postal services,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,and then you had posting internet things.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Oh, that's awesome."
00:08:45,00:08:48,"- The phrase, dick pick, comes from Kentish dick."
00:08:48,00:08:52,"- It used to be, he would do a woodcut of his penis."
00:08:52,00:08:55,(laughing)
00:08:55,00:08:56,- Don't say cut.
00:08:56,00:08:57,(laughing)
00:08:57,00:08:58,- Don't say wood.
00:08:58,00:09:00,(laughing)
00:09:00,00:09:02,- Thought very wrong.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,and that is Andy.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"- My fact is, that pound for pound,"
00:09:09,00:09:13,a 33 gram finch can bite you 320 times harder
00:09:13,00:09:15,than a T-Rex could.
00:09:15,00:09:18,(laughing)
00:09:18,00:09:19,"- Yeah, but pound for pound, actually."
00:09:19,00:09:21,(laughing)
00:09:21,00:09:23,"So there's not many pounds in a finch, is there?"
00:09:23,00:09:24,- No.
00:09:24,00:09:26,- There's a line of T-Rex.
00:09:26,00:09:27,- That's true.
00:09:27,00:09:32,"So this is, like, it's good news in various ways,"
00:09:32,00:09:34,because it turns out the finches are small
00:09:34,00:09:35,and T-Rexes are all dead.
00:09:35,00:09:38,"So, in a way, we're fine."
00:09:38,00:09:39,"- Swim, win."
00:09:39,00:09:39,"- Yeah, win, win."
00:09:39,00:09:43,But this is a study that has just been done
00:09:43,00:09:46,"into bite force, and it's, you know,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,we know roughly what the T-Rex could jump.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"So, if it bit you, it was the equivalent"
00:09:51,00:09:54,of 13 grand pianos landing on you.
00:09:54,00:09:55,(laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:56,- Yeah.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"- That's a brilliant cartoon, isn't it?"
00:09:58,00:09:59,(laughing)
00:09:59,00:10:00,"- I'm like, I'm Bill."
00:10:00,00:10:01,(laughing)
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- So they could bite really, really hard."
00:10:02,00:10:04,There's no one disputing that.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"But there's, there's, there's, the study has measured"
00:10:06,00:10:09,"hundreds of different animals' bite strength,"
00:10:09,00:10:12,"and this tiny finch, the Galapagos finch,"
00:10:12,00:10:15,"has a very powerful bite, relative to its body size."
00:10:15,00:10:17,"So, yeah."
00:10:17,00:10:21,"I read that it's, the, if a finch was scaled up"
00:10:21,00:10:25,"to a T-Rex's size, its bite would be 320 times stronger"
00:10:25,00:10:26,than that of a T-Rex.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"And a T-Rex had a bite force of 12,800 pounds."
00:10:31,00:10:35,"So, the finch would have a bite force of four million pounds."
00:10:35,00:10:35,- Whoa.
00:10:35,00:10:39,- And a rocket has five million pounds of thrust.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Wow.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"So, I don't think this is realistic, and yeah."
00:10:43,00:10:45,- I'm just so concerned now
00:10:45,00:10:48,"that someone involved with Jurassic Park 29, or wherever we are,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"is listening, and is like, I've got the climactic moment"
00:10:50,00:10:51,"to the next, Bill."
00:10:51,00:10:52,(laughing)
00:10:52,00:10:54,Giant finch thunder zone.
00:10:54,00:10:55,(laughing)
00:10:55,00:10:57,Just swallows the T-Rex.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"- That's what the author said, that this is Reading University,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,"and they said, ""The King of the Dinosaurs"
00:11:01,00:11:03,would be no match for a finch in a fight
00:11:03,00:11:04,"if they were the same size."""
00:11:04,00:11:06,(laughing)
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- Oh my God, the idea of finch size T-Rex is very huge."
00:11:09,00:11:10,- Yeah.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"- Well, you do, they do know what baby T-Rex's look like now."
00:11:13,00:11:14,- So they just write small T-Rexes?
00:11:14,00:11:15,"- Yeah, pretty much."
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Right.
00:11:16,00:11:19,"- No, they've done a picture of what they might look like,"
00:11:19,00:11:20,"and they're really cute and fluffy,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,and they had normal length dams
00:11:23,00:11:25,"compared to the T-Rexes have small arms,"
00:11:25,00:11:26,but they have no more.
00:11:26,00:11:28,"And so, at some stage in their puberty,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,their arms just became small.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- Wow.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"- Well, they keep growing, but their arms have stopped."
00:11:32,00:11:33,- Yeah.
00:11:33,00:11:35,(laughing)
00:11:35,00:11:36,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:11:36,00:11:38,"- Well, all their arms have become small."
00:11:38,00:11:39,"It's like, it's--"
00:11:39,00:11:40,"- It's so relative, I think."
00:11:40,00:11:41,"- It's one of them, it's so relative."
00:11:41,00:11:42,(laughing)
00:11:42,00:11:45,"- So it's a pinch, but if it bit me on my finger,"
00:11:45,00:11:46,what would that feel like?
00:11:46,00:11:48,- Your hand would explode.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- What did?
00:11:49,00:11:51,- It would hardly hurt at all.
00:11:51,00:11:52,"- Not at all, really."
00:11:52,00:11:53,"- And the thing is, basically,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,it's the thing with ants being able
00:11:55,00:11:57,"to carry massive things, isn't it?"
00:11:57,00:11:58,"If things are small, it's much easier for them"
00:11:58,00:12:00,to do things in impressive ways.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- That's true.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"- Sorry, I was kidding."
00:12:02,00:12:05,(laughing)
00:12:05,00:12:08,- That's my Tinder profile.
00:12:08,00:12:11,(laughing)
00:12:11,00:12:12,- But you don't understand.
00:12:12,00:12:14,"- Pound for pound, this is like average sex."
00:12:14,00:12:15,With a T-Rex.
00:12:15,00:12:18,(laughing)
00:12:18,00:12:24,- Good.
00:12:24,00:12:26,"Well, that under things that aren't gonna work."
00:12:26,00:12:28,(laughing)
00:12:28,00:12:31,But they have just looked into T-Rex adolescence
00:12:31,00:12:33,and discovered some quite interesting stuff about it.
00:12:33,00:12:36,So they have adolescence kind of like humans.
00:12:36,00:12:39,"They have found out how old T-Rexes would grow too,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"is about 28, and the adolescence happened"
00:12:41,00:12:42,between 14 and 18.
00:12:42,00:12:45,And that's where they just had their massive growth spurt.
00:12:45,00:12:46,And the way they can tell this is
00:12:46,00:12:48,'cause they look at the growth rings on them.
00:12:48,00:12:52,So they study growth rings on ribs.
00:12:52,00:12:54,And they have mineral deposits that lay down
00:12:54,00:12:55,every year as they grow.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"And so then you can count, you know,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,at what point they grew a lot suddenly.
00:12:59,00:13:01,- So they're like trees?
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- That's the analogy I was going for, yeah."
00:13:03,00:13:05,(laughing)
00:13:05,00:13:08,"- I was looking in, there's a museum,"
00:13:08,00:13:11,which is the Museum of Astrius.
00:13:11,00:13:16,"And it's in Spain, and they have a model of a T-Rex."
00:13:16,00:13:18,And it's the weirdest thing.
00:13:18,00:13:20,And this is a museum that they invite children to
00:13:20,00:13:22,and adults and it's a family day out.
00:13:22,00:13:25,"And the structure of it is,"
00:13:25,00:13:29,they're showing two T-Rexes mid-copulation.
00:13:29,00:13:30,They're having sex.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"So the female T-Rexes, it's a doggie style,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,"basically, position of these two giant skeletons."
00:13:36,00:13:39,"And the weird thing is, there's no reason for it"
00:13:39,00:13:41,because we don't even know how they have sex.
00:13:41,00:13:42,There's just no point.
00:13:42,00:13:44,They're just speculating that that's what it is.
00:13:44,00:13:45,"But when you go in there,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,there's a T-Rex taking another T-Rex from behind.
00:13:48,00:13:49,It's crazy.
00:13:49,00:13:50,(laughing)
00:13:50,00:13:52,"- They have started playing feathers on the museum,"
00:13:52,00:13:53,which I appreciate.
00:13:53,00:13:56,I went to a natural history museum in Tasmania recently
00:13:56,00:13:57,"'cause you know, they discovered"
00:13:57,00:13:59,that most dinosaurs had feathers.
00:13:59,00:14:00,And so they've had to go back through
00:14:00,00:14:03,all the old bloody museums and pin feathers
00:14:03,00:14:04,to all their exhibits.
00:14:04,00:14:06,And they're doing it.
00:14:06,00:14:09,- Do you know that T-Rexes got mouthfulses?
00:14:09,00:14:10,"- No, really. - Yeah, they did."
00:14:10,00:14:14,So they looked at microbes in coprolites in T-Rex poo
00:14:14,00:14:16,and they found that they had the same kind of microbes
00:14:16,00:14:19,as birds get and it gives their mouthfulses.
00:14:19,00:14:22,So we think that probably T-Rexes had mouthfulses.
00:14:22,00:14:23,- That's amazing.
00:14:23,00:14:25,"- So finches, yeah."
00:14:25,00:14:27,"So this is a thing also about adolescence, actually."
00:14:27,00:14:28,Adolescent finches.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"So teenage finches, they learn how to sing zebra finches."
00:14:32,00:14:33,They learn how to sing from their fathers
00:14:33,00:14:37,and they get taught this incredibly complicated set of tunes.
00:14:37,00:14:39,But we have recently discovered.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"So most animals learn kind of by road,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"they just listen and repeat, listen and repeat."
00:14:43,00:14:44,What's really rare in the animal kingdom
00:14:44,00:14:47,is learning via social cues.
00:14:47,00:14:51,So if I was singing my song and my father
00:14:51,00:14:53,sort of gave a sign of approval or disapproval
00:14:53,00:14:55,"and you know, that's how they do it."
00:14:55,00:14:57,But they don't learn from their fathers.
00:14:57,00:14:59,They learn from their mothers
00:14:59,00:15:01,and the way they learn is
00:15:01,00:15:05,their mothers kind of give the signs of finding them attractive.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"So they do what's called fluffing up,"
00:15:09,00:15:12,which is a signal that a female likes a male song.
00:15:12,00:15:15,And basically the young finches sing.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"And if they get the song close to their father's song,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,the mum fluffes up.
00:15:19,00:15:20,"And it's basically she's saying,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,that's just how your father wooed me.
00:15:23,00:15:24,- That's quite a nice.
00:15:24,00:15:26,That's like a mum sending their son
00:15:26,00:15:28,after the proms sorting out his hair before he leaves
00:15:28,00:15:29,or something.
00:15:29,00:15:32,- But making it look exactly like his father's hair
00:15:32,00:15:34,"and saying, I'll find this attractive"
00:15:34,00:15:35,and I want you to look like it.
00:15:35,00:15:38,"- It's a combination of sweet and creepy, yeah."
00:15:38,00:15:39,"- It's back to the future, isn't it?"
00:15:39,00:15:40,- That's back to the future.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"- They also, when they're tiny the finches,"
00:15:44,00:15:48,they have a very amazing ability for feeding at night.
00:15:48,00:15:51,These are the baby finches and they lose this as they get older.
00:15:51,00:15:53,They have these little nodules that glow in the dark.
00:15:53,00:15:56,They're these blue nodules that suddenly glow
00:15:56,00:15:58,"so that when the mother is looking to feed them,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,she can specify which ones are where
00:16:00,00:16:02,and not lose any food in the process.
00:16:02,00:16:02,How cool is that?
00:16:02,00:16:04,- That's amazing.
00:16:04,00:16:05,- They glow in the dark.
00:16:05,00:16:09,"- On their singing, they have another very clever thing"
00:16:09,00:16:10,"they do when they sing, which is,"
00:16:10,00:16:14,have started to happen since global warming became a thing.
00:16:14,00:16:17,And this is that zebra finches sing to the embryos
00:16:17,00:16:18,in their eggs.
00:16:18,00:16:21,So the mothers will sing into their eggs
00:16:21,00:16:23,and their singing will be a warning
00:16:23,00:16:25,about the temperature outside.
00:16:25,00:16:28,And this tells the embryo inside the egg
00:16:28,00:16:30,how much or how little to grow.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"So if it's getting hot outside, which it often is now,"
00:16:33,00:16:36,then the zebra finch sings a song to its embryo's going
00:16:36,00:16:37,is pretty warm out here.
00:16:37,00:16:38,That's amazing.
00:16:38,00:16:40,Don't grow too big.
00:16:40,00:16:42,There's been an armed robbery in Gemstone.
00:16:42,00:16:46,"I was just going to say, we've had them sing in the news."
00:16:46,00:16:47,Now we're having them sing in the weather.
00:16:47,00:16:50,We just need someone sing in the spot and we're there.
00:16:50,00:16:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:53,00:16:57,"And the vampire finches, do you know who's going to snuggle those guys?"
00:16:57,00:17:00,They have very sharp beaks and they pick at the skin of boobies
00:17:00,00:17:07,and they drink the blood out of these booby birds
00:17:07,00:17:10,and it even breaks into the booby eggs and drinks the contents.
00:17:10,00:17:11,And sometimes it does it with humans.
00:17:11,00:17:13,Sometimes it will try and peck on a human
00:17:13,00:17:15,and try and get at the blood as well.
00:17:15,00:17:16,But not the human eggs?
00:17:16,00:17:18,No.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"That's a very difficult thing to do, isn't it?"
00:17:20,00:17:23,I don't know how it's got there.
00:17:23,00:17:24,You've got bigger things to worry about.
00:17:24,00:17:27,A low process of trust gaining over the months.
00:17:27,00:17:31,You start with the boobies.
00:17:31,00:17:36,This fact is also about biting.
00:17:36,00:17:38,I've found a couple of things about biting.
00:17:38,00:17:42,This is just a bit of a useful thing to know.
00:17:42,00:17:44,And it's something that science is looking into at the moment
00:17:44,00:17:47,because I think it can be applied in the long term
00:17:47,00:17:48,to mosquito sprays.
00:17:48,00:17:52,"But mosquitoes, if a mosquito is biting you,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,"if you slap your arm or wherever it's biting,"
00:17:55,00:18:00,"if you slap there, it sends vibrations up through to mosquito."
00:18:00,00:18:03,"And when they leap off, they associate the smell"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"that you have with what just happened there,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,the fear that they might be killed.
00:18:07,00:18:09,And the reason that mosquito is land on us
00:18:09,00:18:10,is they're attracted to a smell.
00:18:10,00:18:11,And they remember the smell.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"So it turns out that if you do that,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,you're going to put the mosquito off for 24 hours.
00:18:16,00:18:18,That same mosquito won't come back and land on you.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"It might be a different one, but it will think,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,I might get killed if I go back to that smell.
00:18:23,00:18:24,Remember the smell of your body.
00:18:24,00:18:24,Exactly.
00:18:24,00:18:25,So they think that's a threat.
00:18:25,00:18:26,I can't go back there.
00:18:26,00:18:27,That might kill me.
00:18:27,00:18:29,So all mosquito products at the moment
00:18:29,00:18:32,are trying to work out how they can get what we manage
00:18:32,00:18:35,to do with our pheromones and our body smell into that
00:18:35,00:18:36,in order to stop.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"But next time you've got mosquitoes around,"
00:18:38,00:18:39,just slap yourself a lot.
00:18:39,00:18:41,And you'll be all of your body.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Just slap yourself silly.
00:18:42,00:18:43,And yeah.
00:18:43,00:18:46,But it kind of implies that the next mosquito repellents
00:18:46,00:18:48,are just going to be lots of little slappers
00:18:48,00:18:50,that we have to pin to our bodies.
00:18:50,00:18:52,"I can't lay little mouse traps all over us,"
00:18:52,00:18:53,constantly smacking us.
00:18:53,00:18:54,I'd rather be bitten.
00:18:54,00:18:55,OK.
00:18:55,00:18:56,That's firstly.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"For everyone else, it lasts for 24 hours."
00:18:59,00:19:00,That's pretty good.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Yeah.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"Do you know what makes-- so humans, we have a certain bike"
00:19:04,00:19:05,question.
00:19:05,00:19:06,We have quite a strong bite.
00:19:06,00:19:10,But do you know we probably could bite much harder than we do.
00:19:10,00:19:12,But what would you think holds us back?
00:19:12,00:19:13,What do you think determines how hard we bite?
00:19:13,00:19:16,How good our muscles are in our jaws.
00:19:16,00:19:16,So--
00:19:16,00:19:17,I say willpower.
00:19:17,00:19:20,So I think--
00:19:20,00:19:22,"James is wrong, Andy's more wrong."
00:19:22,00:19:23,This is--
00:19:23,00:19:26,That's a dreamy girl for the three-time.
00:19:26,00:19:27,I just think socially it looks awkward
00:19:27,00:19:30,if you're biting harder than--
00:19:30,00:19:31,we have a winner.
00:19:31,00:19:32,There we go.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"No, this is an experiment that was done"
00:19:34,00:19:36,by a guy called Dr. G. E. Black.
00:19:36,00:19:37,This was actually in 1933.
00:19:37,00:19:39,It was a long time ago.
00:19:39,00:19:43,But he invented what he called a nathodinomometer.
00:19:43,00:19:45,And this was basically-- he put some rubber pads on the steel
00:19:45,00:19:46,instrument he designed.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"And he got 1,000 people to bite down on it."
00:19:49,00:19:51,And he worked out that the restrictive factor
00:19:51,00:19:53,on how hard you can bite is not your jaw strength.
00:19:53,00:19:54,It's your teeth.
00:19:54,00:19:56,So the people stopped biting when they said my teeth really
00:19:56,00:19:57,hurt.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"And actually, if you think about it,"
00:19:58,00:20:01,when your jaw more power than your teeth
00:20:01,00:20:03,are able to withstand.
00:20:03,00:20:05,So if you just man up and deal with the tooth pain--
00:20:05,00:20:06,Willpower.
00:20:06,00:20:07,That's what it says.
00:20:07,00:20:08,Yeah.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"Yep, you're right."
00:20:09,00:20:10,I amend my response.
00:20:10,00:20:11,You're correct.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Thank you.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:20:15,00:20:17,And that is James.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"OK, my fact this week is that the most polluted city"
00:20:20,00:20:22,in the world is Kanpur.
00:20:22,00:20:25,It is nicknamed the Manchester of the East.
00:20:25,00:20:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:28,00:20:30,"I've lost them, guys."
00:20:30,00:20:32,Unbelievably risky.
00:20:32,00:20:34,"What do you think, Amy?"
00:20:34,00:20:35,"So I mean, this is true."
00:20:35,00:20:37,It's their particles in the air.
00:20:37,00:20:39,It's especially particles with a diameter of less
00:20:39,00:20:43,"than 2.5 micrometers, which basically means soot."
00:20:43,00:20:46,And it's because of the tanning industry.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"There's a local wind called the Lou of Kanpur, which"
00:20:49,00:20:51,gives them really bad dust storms.
00:20:51,00:20:53,"And it's, yeah, it's really, really bad."
00:20:53,00:20:55,But the reason that they call it the Manchester of the East
00:20:55,00:20:57,"is because, obviously, Manchester"
00:20:57,00:20:59,used to have extremely bad pollution.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"And also, it's kind of an industrial town."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"A Manchester is one of the most famous industrial towns,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,because it's such a great city.
00:21:06,00:21:06,Nice.
00:21:06,00:21:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:09,00:21:09,Good.
00:21:09,00:21:10,It's kind of bad.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:14,A great back track.
00:21:14,00:21:17,You say Manchester used to have quite bad pollution.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"Let's face it, it still does."
00:21:19,00:21:21,"So I actually thought this would be a thing where we went,"
00:21:21,00:21:25,"oh, and it's such a misnomer, because Manchester's fine now."
00:21:25,00:21:28,"And if you look at air pollution rates,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,I always thought London was the worst.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"But actually, topping the list from last year"
00:21:33,00:21:36,"is Port Talbot in Wales, because they've got big steelworks."
00:21:36,00:21:40,"And then second is not, in fact, Manchester."
00:21:40,00:21:44,"It is where we are right now, which is sulphur."
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Scumthorpe and sulphur, joint second."
00:21:46,00:21:47,And do you know what's third?
00:21:47,00:21:51,This is really where the third most polluted place in Britain.
00:21:51,00:21:51,No.
00:21:51,00:21:53,Gibraltar.
00:21:53,00:21:54,What?
00:21:54,00:21:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:56,00:21:57,"Well, I'm sure it won't be for long."
00:21:57,00:22:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:01,00:22:04,That is because half of the world's sea trade
00:22:04,00:22:05,goes through the Gibraltar strait.
00:22:05,00:22:09,And so all of those polluting particles coming from the sea.
00:22:09,00:22:10,And they have no countryside around there.
00:22:10,00:22:12,It's just that literally that little rock.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:13,00:22:15,It just pulls in there.
00:22:15,00:22:17,Those poor monkeys.
00:22:17,00:22:22,So the term acid rain was coined in Manchester in 1872.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"Friedrich Engels, who I lived here for a little while,"
00:22:25,00:22:28,he described it as a place of filth
00:22:28,00:22:31,ruin and inhabits a bullness.
00:22:31,00:22:34,And he described it as hell on earth.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"But in fairness at the time, it was when Manchester"
00:22:36,00:22:37,was really growing.
00:22:37,00:22:39,And people had come over from Ireland.
00:22:39,00:22:41,And the cotton mills had just started.
00:22:41,00:22:45,And it was not a great place to live unlike now.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"And so, although having said that,"
00:22:47,00:22:51,there was a pub for every 139 residents of Manchester.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Nice.
00:22:52,00:22:54,Wow.
00:22:54,00:22:56,And one in 40 of the city's population
00:22:56,00:22:59,was arrested for drunkenness within a single year.
00:22:59,00:23:00,Wow.
00:23:00,00:23:03,[APPLAUSE]
00:23:03,00:23:04,That's very good.
00:23:04,00:23:08,I found a different thing that Engels observed when he was in town.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"1845, he was around."
00:23:09,00:23:11,He was amazed to discover that there
00:23:11,00:23:14,were flourishing pigries in every back street in the city.
00:23:14,00:23:15,"Yes, still."
00:23:15,00:23:18,You haven't been around today.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"Yeah, but it was very useful."
00:23:20,00:23:22,"And in fact, that was the case all over the country."
00:23:22,00:23:23,It wasn't just Manchester.
00:23:23,00:23:26,Is it a pigery just where you're farming pigs?
00:23:26,00:23:26,It's a pig.
00:23:26,00:23:27,It's a pig.
00:23:27,00:23:30,It's whatever tiny space you keep a pig in as a pigery.
00:23:30,00:23:34,It depends on the presence or absence of a pig.
00:23:34,00:23:38,"If hasn't got a pig in there, it's just a small yard."
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Are you claiming that if you've got one pig,"
00:23:40,00:23:41,you've got a pigery?
00:23:41,00:23:41,Yes.
00:23:41,00:23:42,Really?
00:23:42,00:23:45,"No, it's not a thriving pigery, is it?"
00:23:45,00:23:46,I would say it's on its last leg.
00:23:46,00:23:49,It's a struggling pigery.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"Yeah, but it's a very good waste disposal unit."
00:23:51,00:23:54,All rubbish goes into the pig and the pig eats everything.
00:23:54,00:23:56,And then you eat the pig.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Yeah, perfect."
00:23:57,00:24:01,"It's a slightly slow way of eating lots of rubbish, basically."
00:24:01,00:24:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:04,00:24:09,"Just on city nicknames, this--"
00:24:09,00:24:11,so this is about a city nickname.
00:24:11,00:24:13,And Manchester used to be called Cottonopolis.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"And you say it wasn't a good place to be,"
00:24:15,00:24:16,but it's always very much swings around about.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"So in the 19th century, it was also extremely wealthy"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"and kind of an awesome place to be, because you could make money."
00:24:21,00:24:25,But I was reading an account of someone
00:24:25,00:24:27,who was traveling around Manchester for the first time
00:24:27,00:24:30,"in the mid-19th century and loving it and, you know,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"saying, you know, it's so brilliant"
00:24:32,00:24:34,and people are all about the cotton mills.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"And he kept on asking to be shown round a cotton mill,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,like given a tourist visitor tour.
00:24:39,00:24:41,"And they would never let him, because they"
00:24:41,00:24:43,"were so paranoid about everyone else stealing their technology,"
00:24:43,00:24:47,because they had the best cotton technology they went and out in.
00:24:47,00:24:51,"In 1871, 32% of all the cotton in the world"
00:24:51,00:24:53,was made in Manchester.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Oh, wow."
00:24:54,00:24:55,"On the planet, a whole planet."
00:24:55,00:24:57,I just say that's incredible.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"So there were gangs as well, because obviously lots of people"
00:25:00,00:25:03,"moving from the country to the city, lots of people"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"in a cramped space, you get gangs."
00:25:05,00:25:08,And are the people familiar with the skuttlers?
00:25:08,00:25:09,Is that a thing still?
00:25:09,00:25:10,Not still.
00:25:10,00:25:11,OK.
00:25:11,00:25:14,They are not thriving.
00:25:14,00:25:16,It's like the Piggory.
00:25:16,00:25:20,But they were a gang who really plagued the city in the late 19th century.
00:25:20,00:25:22,And they had a very distinctive look.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"They had a fringe, which was called a donkey fringe."
00:25:24,00:25:28,"And they had neck-achiefs, which told you which gang they were in,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,which was quite smart.
00:25:29,00:25:30,So you could see the stripes of the spots.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"And so, oh, you were that gang."
00:25:32,00:25:34,"But the way they started, the skuttlers,"
00:25:34,00:25:38,it started with a historical reenactment society that got out of hand.
00:25:38,00:25:41,No.
00:25:41,00:25:45,"So it's a historical, Andrew Davis has written a book about this."
00:25:45,00:25:48,This is what it says about the book.
00:25:48,00:25:50,Davis has identified the trigger point for skuttling
00:25:50,00:25:52,as arising from the reception of the Franco-Prussian wall
00:25:52,00:25:54,by the schoolboys of ancodes.
00:25:54,00:25:58,Young boys recreated the battles on the streets of ancodes
00:25:58,00:26:00,using the categories of Catholic French and Protestant Russian
00:26:00,00:26:02,to reflect their own legences.
00:26:02,00:26:07,The game very quickly evolved into a widespread folk for street battles.
00:26:07,00:26:09,And it just turned into gang warfare.
00:26:09,00:26:11,Wow.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"The worst place to go was on Deansgate, wasn't it?"
00:26:13,00:26:14,That was where they all hung out.
00:26:14,00:26:15,OK.
00:26:15,00:26:17,And the absolute worst place was a hovel
00:26:17,00:26:19,"on the corner of Harbin Street and Deansgate,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,which today is a Wagababas.
00:26:22,00:26:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Oh, wow."
00:26:25,00:26:28,I've only gone downhill.
00:26:28,00:26:30,I have a sort of modern Manchester fact.
00:26:30,00:26:32,I imagine everyone here will know this.
00:26:32,00:26:34,So apologies to the crowd here.
00:26:34,00:26:36,But people at home and overseas won't know this.
00:26:36,00:26:40,But we all know Manchester United and Man City as the football teams.
00:26:40,00:26:44,"And in 2011, they were awarded the third-ever annual Jelly"
00:26:44,00:26:47,Dona Award for--
00:26:47,00:26:49,it's done by the accredited language services.
00:26:49,00:26:53,They award the best translation errors each year.
00:26:53,00:26:59,"And when the Man City Stadium was the Etihad Stadium,"
00:26:59,00:27:02,Etihad in Arabic means United.
00:27:02,00:27:03,And--
00:27:03,00:27:05,No.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Yeah.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"Oh, my goodness."
00:27:08,00:27:08,Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:12,So Man City suddenly were playing in the Etihad.
00:27:12,00:27:14,That's such a good fact.
00:27:14,00:27:14,I love it.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"You know, Xi Jinping came to Manchester in 2015"
00:27:17,00:27:18,and visited Man City.
00:27:18,00:27:19,And he visited the stadium.
00:27:19,00:27:23,"And he was given a copy of the rules of football as a gift,"
00:27:23,00:27:27,because football was something that was invented in England.
00:27:27,00:27:29,And so he was given a copy of the rules that were drawn up
00:27:29,00:27:30,in 1863.
00:27:30,00:27:34,"And in exchange, Xi Jinping gave us a copper representation"
00:27:34,00:27:37,"of a figure playing Kuzhu, the football-esque sport invented"
00:27:37,00:27:40,"in China 2,000 years ago."
00:27:40,00:27:41,Wow.
00:27:41,00:27:43,Feels like a bit of a slam.
00:27:43,00:27:47,"Just on world leaders, do you know that Manchester United"
00:27:47,00:27:49,was literally hours away from being
00:27:49,00:27:51,owned by Colonel Gaddafi?
00:27:51,00:27:52,Really?
00:27:52,00:27:52,Yeah.
00:27:52,00:27:56,"So not the whole thing, but a huge percentage, 29.9%."
00:27:56,00:28:00,It was the guy who broke the deal to the Glazer family
00:28:00,00:28:02,who did take over.
00:28:02,00:28:04,He said it was hours away from not going to them
00:28:04,00:28:07,and going to Gaddafi instead.
00:28:07,00:28:08,"Bad luck, guys."
00:28:08,00:28:10,What might have been?
00:28:10,00:28:11,OK.
00:28:11,00:28:13,It is time for a final fact of the show.
00:28:13,00:28:15,And that is Chazinsky.
00:28:15,00:28:18,My fight is that dogs over 35 centimeters tall
00:28:18,00:28:20,are banned from Beijing.
00:28:20,00:28:22,There's a high restriction.
00:28:22,00:28:23,They all get measured.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"If they're too tall, they've got to go."
00:28:25,00:28:29,So China has this bizarre history with dog laws.
00:28:29,00:28:32,And this one was passed in 2003.
00:28:32,00:28:34,And it was about what breeds of dogs and what kind of dogs
00:28:34,00:28:37,"are allowed in Beijing in the center of Beijing, really."
00:28:37,00:28:39,"And then in bits of the rural districts,"
00:28:39,00:28:45,"if you're taller than 35 centimeters and a dog, not allowed,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,"if you are on a list of 41 breeds that they listed,"
00:28:48,00:28:49,you're not allowed.
00:28:49,00:28:52,"So like setters, greyhounds, mastiffs,"
00:28:52,00:28:53,holding the sheep dogs.
00:28:53,00:28:55,There's really huge shaggy things.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"Band, collies, also called a band."
00:28:58,00:29:00,"Dogs, Dalmatian, all the classics."
00:29:00,00:29:04,"Chow Chows, which I had a chow-chow and a chow-chow"
00:29:04,00:29:05,is a Chinese dog.
00:29:05,00:29:07,So that's weird.
00:29:07,00:29:09,I thought chow-chows were quite small.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"No, chow-chows, they're like the Chewbacca looking guys."
00:29:11,00:29:12,"Oh, right."
00:29:12,00:29:13,OK.
00:29:13,00:29:17,And they used to be warrior dogs for the Chinese armies.
00:29:17,00:29:18,And so they're very revered there.
00:29:18,00:29:20,So that's bizarre that they're on that list.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"But could you get your dog to, for example, sit?"
00:29:22,00:29:24,So it's shorter than 35 centimeters tall.
00:29:24,00:29:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:25,00:29:29,"It won't change your height when you sit down, like--"
00:29:29,00:29:31,"But they could do that wiping bum shuffle that they do,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,and just walk like that.
00:29:33,00:29:34,What about-- you could give it a haircut.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"So you could-- I bet if you shaved a sheep dog,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,there's tiny under all that.
00:29:39,00:29:41,The whole point is that these breeds
00:29:41,00:29:43,are banned no matter how tall they are.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"No, but I reckon you wouldn't recognize a sheep dog"
00:29:45,00:29:48,if it was completely shaved with all of that.
00:29:48,00:29:50,There are some breeds that would be allowed
00:29:50,00:29:52,"if they're under 35, but no, if they're over 35."
00:29:52,00:29:53,So you could shave them.
00:29:53,00:29:54,"But if you're right on that cusp,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,I don't know if they'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
00:29:56,00:29:57,There was a crackdown.
00:29:57,00:29:58,"They cracked down properly on this in 2014,"
00:29:58,00:30:01,and there were all these owners of pets that were suddenly told
00:30:01,00:30:04,"they were outlawed, who were having a bit of a disaster."
00:30:04,00:30:06,"The government said, why don't you just give your pets away"
00:30:06,00:30:07,to shelters?
00:30:07,00:30:08,"And obviously, people didn't do that."
00:30:08,00:30:11,Because that's a way thing to do to your dog of 10 years.
00:30:11,00:30:13,But there is a lot of luxury stuff for pets.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"So there's this weird division between the Chinese government,"
00:30:15,00:30:17,which is cracking down on animals.
00:30:17,00:30:20,"And then there are lots of tiny dogs,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,and those are treated very luxuriously.
00:30:22,00:30:24,It's a really popular thing in China.
00:30:24,00:30:24,Yeah.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"So there are play centres just for dogs,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,"which have got indoor swimming pools, and ball pits,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,and obstacle courses.
00:30:31,00:30:32,There's pet acupuncture.
00:30:32,00:30:34,That's quite a big thing.
00:30:34,00:30:35,And there's-- there are dog hotels which
00:30:35,00:30:38,have dogs cinemas in.
00:30:38,00:30:38,Yeah.
00:30:38,00:30:41,And the film's especially designed for dogs eyesight.
00:30:41,00:30:44,I don't know what that means.
00:30:44,00:30:47,"So I think they see stuff, more frames per second than us,"
00:30:47,00:30:48,about twice as many.
00:30:48,00:30:51,So maybe they have many more frames per second in the film.
00:30:51,00:30:54,So this is why dogs don't get very captivated by television.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"It's one reason, isn't it?"
00:30:56,00:31:00,"Other reasons that they're very, very stupid animals."
00:31:00,00:31:02,"But it looks to them, I guess there is a photographs"
00:31:02,00:31:03,one after the other.
00:31:03,00:31:04,So I guess this is--
00:31:04,00:31:04,Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"So if you suddenly fast forward a movie on your TV,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,"are they like, whoa, what is this?"
00:31:09,00:31:15,"In Dorset, there is a spa hotel for guinea pigs."
00:31:15,00:31:16,What is that in tail?
00:31:16,00:31:20,"Well, for 16 pounds, you can get a pedicure."
00:31:20,00:31:21,16.
00:31:21,00:31:22,16.
00:31:22,00:31:22,That's pretty good.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"Well, you need to pay for the hotel,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,but this is just an extra on the side thing.
00:31:26,00:31:26,"Oh, sorry."
00:31:26,00:31:29,I thought this was a nice B&B for a guinea pig.
00:31:29,00:31:36,"Well, they don't eat much B, and they don't need a very big B."
00:31:36,00:31:39,"So for your 16 pounds anyway, you get a pedicure."
00:31:39,00:31:43,"You get two washes with lice shampoo, anti-lice shampoo."
00:31:43,00:31:46,"You get a haircut, a towel dry, a massage,"
00:31:46,00:31:49,"while watching a movie, and a snooze."
00:31:49,00:31:50,Wow.
00:31:50,00:31:51,You have to pay for a snooze.
00:31:51,00:31:55,That is a rip off.
00:31:55,00:31:58,"But, yeah, in China, people are very into their dogs,"
00:31:58,00:32:02,but they worked out recently that the city dwelling
00:32:02,00:32:06,millennials are responsible for 70% of pet spending
00:32:06,00:32:07,"in China, which is actually quite weird,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,because millennials are-- it's basically
00:32:08,00:32:10,"people born in their 80s and 90s, which"
00:32:10,00:32:12,is pretty young to be spending a lot on pets.
00:32:12,00:32:14,But they think it's because they've been--
00:32:14,00:32:16,this is what the economist said.
00:32:16,00:32:18,They've been lured away from their families and friends
00:32:18,00:32:20,"by jobs in the big cities, meaning they're incredibly"
00:32:20,00:32:22,lonely at this point.
00:32:22,00:32:23,A lot of people single.
00:32:23,00:32:27,"The air is very bad outside, as previously discussed."
00:32:27,00:32:29,And it's extremely easy to stay inside and just watch stuff
00:32:29,00:32:30,on the internet.
00:32:30,00:32:32,It's nice to have someone with you when you do that.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"And by the way, there are 200 million unmarried people"
00:32:36,00:32:38,"in their 20s and 30s in China, which"
00:32:38,00:32:40,"is-- if you think about that as a proportion of world population,"
00:32:40,00:32:41,it's a lot of single people.
00:32:41,00:32:43,200 billion in 20s and 30s.
00:32:43,00:32:43,Yeah.
00:32:43,00:32:44,Wow.
00:32:44,00:32:44,Single.
00:32:44,00:32:45,Yeah.
00:32:45,00:32:46,It's a lot.
00:32:46,00:32:47,They're all sitting there with their dogs inside.
00:32:47,00:32:49,"This woman said, I live alone."
00:32:49,00:32:51,"And it's nice to have little Yui waiting,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,all happy to see me when I get home.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"And she said, this is-- she flipped through"
00:32:54,00:32:56,photos of cats on her iPhone.
00:32:56,00:32:58,I just feel like there's a social problem
00:32:58,00:32:59,that we need to address.
00:32:59,00:33:00,Yeah.
00:33:00,00:33:03,Just some dog sizes in Japan.
00:33:03,00:33:07,"I was being told earlier by Ash Gardner, who wrote our theme"
00:33:07,00:33:11,"tune, when he was in Japan, there were parks there."
00:33:11,00:33:13,And I started googling this after he said it.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Yo-yo, Guy Park."
00:33:14,00:33:15,It's in Japan.
00:33:15,00:33:17,And what they have is they want to make sure
00:33:17,00:33:20,that dogs that go to the park have a great experience.
00:33:20,00:33:24,"So there is a weight and size category for dogs,"
00:33:24,00:33:26,of which bit of the park they go to.
00:33:26,00:33:28,So they separate the big dogs from the little dogs.
00:33:28,00:33:31,And the little dogs and the medium dogs hang out together.
00:33:31,00:33:32,And they all play.
00:33:32,00:33:34,And the big dogs have to go to another section.
00:33:34,00:33:38,So they separate it to no fights break out amongst the dogs.
00:33:38,00:33:42,"I think that sounds a bit sort of like, size-ist."
00:33:42,00:33:42,I think that sounds good.
00:33:42,00:33:43,That's segregation.
00:33:43,00:33:44,Segregation.
00:33:44,00:33:45,You post segregation?
00:33:45,00:33:46,No.
00:33:46,00:33:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:48,00:33:51,"That was just like very big dogs, or it's more ones."
00:33:51,00:33:54,"Look, never mind."
00:33:54,00:33:58,Never has anyone backed out from a nightmare so quickly.
00:33:58,00:34:02,Dogs are much less clever than humans like to think.
00:34:02,00:34:05,So there are lots of people who think
00:34:05,00:34:06,"that dogs are very, very clever."
00:34:06,00:34:09,"And the science doesn't really bear it out, unfortunately."
00:34:09,00:34:12,"And I can feel the room slipping away, as I say this."
00:34:12,00:34:15,"But-- so dogs, for example, can't recognize themselves"
00:34:15,00:34:17,"in mirrors, which some animals can do."
00:34:17,00:34:21,"And on lots of measures, they're about the same as pigeons."
00:34:21,00:34:24,"And they can't fly, either."
00:34:24,00:34:26,And they can't even fly useless.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"But the doctor who carried out this work, Brita Osthaus,"
00:34:29,00:34:30,"she did work about 10 years ago, which"
00:34:30,00:34:32,showed the dogs were cleverer than cats.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"And she got a big backlash then from all the cat owners,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"saying, my cat says cleverer is any dog."
00:34:37,00:34:38,And now she's done this research.
00:34:38,00:34:41,She's got a backlash from dog owners.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"And when she published this study, and it was printed"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"over the times, there was lots of backlash"
00:34:46,00:34:47,at the comments section.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"One times, Brita wrote, we once had a beagle who"
00:34:49,00:34:53,could open the refrigerator with his paws.
00:34:53,00:34:54,Case closed.
00:34:54,00:34:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:56,00:34:59,"Just on the idea of having small dogs,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,there is concern to be had when you do hang out
00:35:01,00:35:03,with just small dogs.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"In America, recently, there was a warning"
00:35:05,00:35:08,"when there was a big storm that hit Cleveland,"
00:35:08,00:35:11,with 50 mile an hour winds there.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"The weather bureau released a statement saying,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,can everyone please be careful?
00:35:15,00:35:17,These winds are huge.
00:35:17,00:35:21,And things that can happen are trash cans will go missing.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Trees will fall.
00:35:22,00:35:24,And dogs will go flying.
00:35:24,00:35:27,"And yeah, they did a small dog warning."
00:35:27,00:35:31,"And it's the idea that when the winds pick up so high,"
00:35:31,00:35:32,they get lobbed off into the air.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"And if you're not holding on to them by leash,"
00:35:34,00:35:36,they will disappear.
00:35:36,00:35:38,"And if you are holding on to them by leash,"
00:35:38,00:35:39,you've got an amazing kite.
00:35:39,00:35:40,Yeah.
00:35:40,00:35:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:43,00:35:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:46,00:35:48,"Now, they did do this slightly tongue-in-cheek,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,but it is based on real incidences
00:35:50,00:35:51,that have happened in America.
00:35:51,00:35:56,"Stories that you can read up on, for example, a 72-year-old couple,"
00:35:56,00:35:59,"or a 72-year-old lady called Dorothy Ottley,"
00:35:59,00:36:00,she lost her chihuahua.
00:36:00,00:36:01,"Sorry, he's good to her."
00:36:01,00:36:02,He's good to her.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Come on.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"And she lost her chihuahua toto in a ton of ease, isn't it?"
00:36:06,00:36:07,She live in Kansas.
00:36:07,00:36:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:09,00:36:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:14,00:36:15,"Wow, did you have to notice that?"
00:36:15,00:36:18,"No, it was a 6-pound chihuahua called Tinkerbell."
00:36:18,00:36:22,And they are mixing their movies here.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"Yeah, this is cross-jogger movie."
00:36:24,00:36:29,They were walking around in a 70-mile-an-hour wind
00:36:29,00:36:33,"came and it picked Tinkerbell up, and it took her off in the wind."
00:36:33,00:36:34,And they couldn't find her.
00:36:34,00:36:35,And what they actually ended up doing
00:36:35,00:36:38,is that they hired a pet psychic called Laurie.
00:36:38,00:36:39,OK.
00:36:39,00:36:40,Right.
00:36:40,00:36:43,"Well, they had my sympathy for a good long time there."
00:36:43,00:36:46,"Laurie said, you have to stop looking in lowlands,"
00:36:46,00:36:47,where you think--
00:36:47,00:36:50,Was Laurie a pet who was also a psychic?
00:36:50,00:36:52,"No, no, no, she was a psychic of pets."
00:36:52,00:36:54,And she was also a third-generation psychic.
00:36:54,00:36:58,So she was the granddaughter of original psychic.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Yeah, it was all because of that."
00:36:59,00:37:02,"There's a lot of nepotism in psychic, isn't there?"
00:37:02,00:37:03,My father was a fraud.
00:37:03,00:37:06,My grandfather was a fraud.
00:37:06,00:37:08,"And so she said to them, you need to look up."
00:37:08,00:37:11,And so the volunteers started looking outside of the swamp
00:37:11,00:37:11,and up the hill.
00:37:11,00:37:12,And they found Tinkerbell.
00:37:12,00:37:16,And so my point is that you will lose a dog in the wind.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Right.
00:37:17,00:37:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:20,00:37:22,"OK, that is it."
00:37:22,00:37:23,That is all of our facts.
