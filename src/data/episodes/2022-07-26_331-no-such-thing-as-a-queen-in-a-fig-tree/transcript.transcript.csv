00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:27,00:00:32,Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Czenski and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:32,00:00:38,with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:38,00:00:42,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:00:42,00:00:47,My fact this week is that the Holy Roman Emperor once made every citizen of Milan
00:00:47,00:00:51,pluck a fig from a mules genitals with their teeth.
00:00:53,00:01:00,"Okay. The sandwich to unpack here. Yeah, my main question is about the dynamic of"
00:01:00,00:01:05,as in how do you get a fig into a mules genitals? Like which bit of the genitals is it going into?
00:01:05,00:01:10,Oh well I'm so glad you've asked both of those questions actually because I do need to be more
00:01:10,00:01:15,specific. I believe it was the anus according to most sources which we're counting as part of the
00:01:15,00:01:19,"genitals. Is that a genital? Yeah, I definitely not. No way. It's called a genitals. You can't"
00:01:19,00:01:26,"generate new life. Sorry. Anna, we've got a lot of explaining to do. Right. You could tuck it"
00:01:26,00:01:33,between the penis and the ball bag I suppose. Can I just say I thought it was a female mule no?
00:01:33,00:01:39,"Yeah, I thought it was going in the vagina of the mule. Yes. Wow. Some sources say genitals,"
00:01:39,00:01:46,some sources say anus basically. Was there one mule which stood in for every citizen of Milan?
00:01:46,00:01:51,"Because that's a huge queue. It's a long queue, right. You'd have to set up a city-wide system."
00:01:51,00:01:54,"They didn't do this over one day, Andy. This wasn't like a..."
00:01:54,00:01:58,This was a years-long process. It's like jury duty.
00:01:58,00:02:06,"That's it, yeah. You get a letter. Oh man. What is it? You're going to war? No, worse."
00:02:06,00:02:15,"Okay, look. I have one more question. All right, great. I think it's more important."
00:02:15,00:02:18,He's the Holy Roman Emperor. Why is he doing this kind of shit?
00:02:18,00:02:26,"Didn't have much on. Didn't have much on. No, this was Milan. It was causing him,"
00:02:26,00:02:31,"Frederick I, Frederick Barbarossa, a lot of problems. This was 1162 and it was all full of"
00:02:31,00:02:38,"uprisings. Basically, he sent his wife went to visit Milan and the people of Milan"
00:02:38,00:02:42,"disliked Frederick so much that they humiliated his wife, tied her to a mule and made her ride"
00:02:42,00:02:49,"backwards on this mule around the city. He, Fred, was like, ""You humiliated my wife to make up for"
00:02:49,00:02:54,"it. I'm going to make you all do this thing."" Actually, in answer to your very good question,"
00:02:54,00:02:59,"Andy, about how you get the fig into the mules, anus, or vagina, sources differ,"
00:02:59,00:03:05,you would have to put it back into the genital with your tea so they have to block it out and
00:03:05,00:03:09,then return it. That was my other question. Do you get to eat the fig afterwards?
00:03:09,00:03:12,"I'm afraid, I think it's the same fig. That's true, massive fig expenditure."
00:03:12,00:03:16,"That's true. Oh, yeah. You don't want to be at the back of that queue with a manky fig."
00:03:16,00:03:22,"That would be disgusting. Anna, in fairness to the people of Milan, they were being"
00:03:22,00:03:28,sieged by the Holy Roman Emperor at the time. It wasn't like they just humiliated his wife just
00:03:28,00:03:32,because they didn't like him. It was more because he was attacking their city.
00:03:32,00:03:37,"It was bigger than that, yeah. He was besieging their city. He was having a lot of problems at"
00:03:37,00:03:41,"the time with various cities he was supposed to rule. Yeah, the Milanese did not like him."
00:03:41,00:03:47,"Actually, as part of this uprising, the three wise men were moved. Milan was known for having"
00:03:47,00:03:55,"the skulls of the three wise men. Then, when Frederick one beat them down, he had the skulls"
00:03:55,00:04:00,"removed and moved to Cologne Cathedral, and they're still there today. It's quite amazing."
00:04:00,00:04:04,"This is like 1,000 years ago, almost. I think if everyone was doing it, I would have no problem"
00:04:04,00:04:10,"in doing the fig challenge. I mean, it would feel like the ice bucket challenge."
00:04:10,00:04:14,"They were actually also raising money for charity, weren't they?"
00:04:14,00:04:19,"It was a donkey sanctuary, in fact. You had to nominate five people to remove"
00:04:19,00:04:24,"the fig from the mules genitals afterwards. Maybe there was a sense of solidarity amongst them,"
00:04:24,00:04:28,because they'd all suffered together. What they had to do was they had to get it out with their
00:04:28,00:04:32,"teeth and then take it to the executioner, who was the person who would have beheaded them"
00:04:32,00:04:38,"if they failed. Then they had to say, ""Echo il ficko,"" as in, ""Look, here's the fig,"" and then"
00:04:38,00:04:43,"they had to replace it. Apparently, in Milan, after that, sticking your thumb between your"
00:04:43,00:04:47,"middle finger and your index finger, I guess, like I'm doing right now,"
00:04:47,00:04:52,"is a sign of it's called ""known as making the fig,"" or it was known as making the fig,"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"and it was an insult based on this. That's still an insult, quite a lot"
00:04:57,00:05:02,"around the world, actually, doing the fig, because it looks a bit like a vagina. If you do it,"
00:05:02,00:05:10,"that's why. And it's still in Russia, for instance, if you do that. It doesn't mean"
00:05:10,00:05:15,"like a really, really bad insult these days. It's just a bit like giving the V's kind of thing."
00:05:15,00:05:20,"It does mean your mother's vagina. In Madagascar, I read that if you went like that,"
00:05:20,00:05:24,"you are going, ""It's not screw you. It's your mother's vagina."""
00:05:24,00:05:29,"I can't speak for Madagascar, but I've had it done to me in Russia. That's all I can say."
00:05:31,00:05:34,"Because my father-in-law did it to me, and apparently it's not a massive insult."
00:05:34,00:05:38,"It doesn't mean get away from my daughter. Sure, that's what Polina told you."
00:05:38,00:05:41,"He was actually complimenting you, Jack."
00:05:41,00:05:48,"This is a, there's a weird thing, because in Italy, there's a really weird linguistic"
00:05:48,00:05:54,"confusion, right? Because if you say, I hope I get this right, ""Bella fico"" means nice fig,"
00:05:54,00:06:00,"but ""Bella figa"" means beautiful women's genitals. So there's a weird verbal link between the two"
00:06:00,00:06:05,"as well. And the BBC, a really old BBC talk board, had a thing about someone who'd been"
00:06:05,00:06:10,"trying to order figs in Italy, and they said, ""I started off by asking how old was the figae,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,"how much I loved it when it was fresh, as long as it wasn't too old, how I loved to eat it,"
00:06:14,00:06:19,"and on and on. The lady was clearly shocked, but I kept going on and on trying to explain how much"
00:06:19,00:06:25,"I liked it."" Jesus. It's very much got genital associations around the world, hasn't it? And"
00:06:25,00:06:30,"it looks like a, famously like a, look, we all know what it looks like, guys. We don't need to,"
00:06:30,00:06:36,"and he's going to that. Can I just, I just wanted to say one more thing I really enjoyed about this"
00:06:36,00:06:42,"besieging that Frederick was doing, because I didn't know about this. So he was really into"
00:06:42,00:06:47,"underground warfare. So when he was besieging Kramer, which he besieged before Milan and Milan,"
00:06:47,00:06:52,"he dug a lot of tunnels. And I didn't realize in medieval times, tunnel warfare was a huge deal."
00:06:52,00:06:58,"So you're besieging a city and you dig a tunnel underneath, and then you counter mine from the"
00:06:58,00:07:03,"other end, as in you dig your tunnel and you would meet in the middle. And then two enemies on,"
00:07:03,00:07:09,it would have to be big enough to take you on horseback. And then the two enemies meet in this
00:07:09,00:07:14,tunnel. The horses would go down into the tunnel and they'd meet on horseback. And this was a means
00:07:14,00:07:18,"of combat. And loads of people did it. So Agincourt, they had a lot of these. They were dug by the"
00:07:18,00:07:25,"Welsh miners. Honestly, so what happens is you've got two armies coming at each other. And it is"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"big enough to get a horse down, but only one horse. So it means that the person at the front of your"
00:07:30,00:07:36,"battle can only fight against the person at the front of their battle. And then whoever wins that,"
00:07:36,00:07:40,then fights against the next person in the queue. And you just keep going down and going down until
00:07:40,00:07:46,"that. It's like playing conkers, basically. It's extraordinary. And the other thing is that"
00:07:46,00:07:49,"you would have these tunnels going towards the city, but you might also dig a tunnel"
00:07:49,00:07:55,underneath the other person's tunnel so that they kind of fall through it and then get trapped and
00:07:55,00:08:00,"then you can kill them. And I read once that that's where the word ""under mine"" comes from, although"
00:08:00,00:08:08,"I'm not sure if that's right. That's very famous for having a very impressive fight in one, apparently."
00:08:08,00:08:13,And something else you could do if they dug a tunnel under yours and popped out on your side.
00:08:13,00:08:18,They often had big tubs of boiling urine and water that they'd throw on you as you emerged.
00:08:18,00:08:23,You could only come out one at a time. I can't believe they met each other though. You would
00:08:23,00:08:26,"assume it would be a bit like, you know, when you close your eyes and you have to get your index"
00:08:26,00:08:31,fingers to touch each other and they miss. I would assume it must have been so awful at the time.
00:08:31,00:08:35,You can hear each other digging underground if you keep quiet. You can hear the noise.
00:08:35,00:08:40,"Each team had a golden mould, didn't they, which could hear where the other team was coming in."
00:08:42,00:08:48,"Above the gates of Milan, until the 1500s, there was a work of art showing a woman lifting her"
00:08:48,00:08:53,"skirt and clipping her pubic hair with a large pair of shears. So whenever you went to Milan,"
00:08:53,00:08:58,"this is the first thing you would see. And no one really knew why it was there,"
00:08:58,00:09:03,but they think that probably it dates from this particular siege by Frederick Barbarossa.
00:09:03,00:09:10,"And it could be that when Barbarossa was attacking the city, one of the women at the"
00:09:10,00:09:15,walls did this and they decided to memorialise it. It could be because Milan asked for some
00:09:15,00:09:21,"money from the Empress Lea Bissa, who was in Constantinople at the time, and was extremely"
00:09:21,00:09:27,wealthy and really important Empress. And they wanted money from her to try and stop
00:09:27,00:09:31,Frederick from attacking the city. But she said no. And so they did this picture of the woman
00:09:31,00:09:37,as kind of an insult to her. But no one really knows why it was there. But then it got taken down
00:09:37,00:09:43,by Cardinal Carlo Baremio in the 1500s because he wanted his eyes only to gaze on the stars of
00:09:43,00:09:50,"heaven. As opposed to the towering genitals and pubic hair over giant women, I suppose that's"
00:09:50,00:09:55,"very not. He didn't include that part in the quote, but of course he would have said it."
00:09:55,00:10:01,"Implied. Barbarossa, by the way, died because he didn't want to queue. He hated queuing."
00:10:02,00:10:07,That's like you. You hate queuing. I hate queuing because I always think at the front of it I'm
00:10:07,00:10:13,going to have to pluck a fig from a mules vagina. But they were going to cross the river and he
00:10:13,00:10:17,didn't want to queue. So he went across the river in a bit where you're not supposed to. He didn't
00:10:17,00:10:22,"want to go over the bridge or whatever. And he drowned. Oh, Barbie. I've read a bunch of theories"
00:10:22,00:10:28,"about how he died, which I think that's the sort of most accepted version of it. But it is shrouded"
00:10:28,00:10:33,in a bit of mystery. And one of the most confusing things that I read was that it was a foot of
00:10:33,00:10:38,"water, which is very hard to drown in. Supposedly that could have happened because he was wearing"
00:10:38,00:10:43,such heavy armour that he was just pulled down. And there was also theories of fatigue
00:10:43,00:10:48,that he had actually gone just for a wash and that he was so tired that the sun just kind of
00:10:48,00:10:53,"just he lost energy. But yeah, what a way to go. The Nazis thought he was still alive because there's"
00:10:53,00:11:01,like an ancient idea that he's like King Arthur and he lives in a mountain. And whenever Germany's
00:11:01,00:11:06,"about to fall, he'll come out and save everyone. And he can't leave at the moment because his"
00:11:06,00:11:13,"beard is stuck in a table. So it's grown through the table and he doesn't have scissors, but he"
00:11:13,00:11:18,"does have a boy who's loose, who he sends out to check how Germany's doing every so often. So he'll"
00:11:18,00:11:21,"just wave him out and he'll come back. Is this real? It's not right. Well, according to the Nazis,"
00:11:21,00:11:28,"it was real. They would have been so disappointed if he came out and said, ""Right, don't worry,"
00:11:28,00:11:33,"Germany's going to be safe. All I need is 250,000 mules. I need a large queuing system and I need"
00:11:33,00:11:39,"a bunch of figs."" But then of course, that's why they called, you'll know, and the Operation"
00:11:39,00:11:45,"Barbarossa, which was the attack on the Soviet Union that was named after him because he was such a"
00:11:45,00:11:51,top guy according to the Nazis. And also another Operation Barbarossa where they killed all the
00:11:51,00:11:56,"intellectuals. That was also named after him. I can't believe the sentence was just said,"
00:11:56,00:12:03,"""Who believes us? The Nazis and Dan."" That's not something I want to be informed about."
00:12:03,00:12:08,"But can I just say that by saying who believes us, the Nazis and Dan, I'm saying that you're not a"
00:12:08,00:12:15,"Nazi. Otherwise, I would say the Nazis, including Dan, who is also a Nazi. He just shows similar"
00:12:15,00:12:22,"ideas and believes. Do you know what happened to Barbarossa after he died? Oh, what? He got"
00:12:22,00:12:27,his beard stuck in a table somewhere. He's still waiting for those shears from that poor pubic-haired
00:12:27,00:12:31,"woman. If you don't believe the theory of Dan and his Nazi buddies, then this is what happened to him."
00:12:31,00:12:38,"So his body was apparently, they tried to preserve it in vinegar. Again, like a conker,"
00:12:38,00:12:44,but it didn't work. And he was buried in three different places. This sounds like such a difficult
00:12:44,00:12:49,"confusing burial process, because his flesh was put in the Church of St Peter and Antioch,"
00:12:49,00:12:55,"his bones in the Cathedral of Tyre, and his heart and inner organs in another church that was in"
00:12:55,00:13:02,"Tarsus. But that's a rough gig, having to separate the flesh from the bones. You wouldn't want the"
00:13:02,00:13:06,"flesh, I think. Oh, no. I was just going to say, I think the Antioch's got a raw deal, because that's"
00:13:06,00:13:12,"just a pile of grossness, isn't it? Speaking of flesh, Ficks have flesh. So shall we talk about"
00:13:12,00:13:20,"Ficks? Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Why not? They're very, very important. Up to 70% of the animal life in"
00:13:20,00:13:27,"the rainforest depends on fig trees, because they're so high in energy. They fruit loads of times"
00:13:27,00:13:32,"every year. They grow really well in that kind of environment. And basically, they're eaten by"
00:13:32,00:13:36,"lots of things, and then those things are eaten by lots of things, et cetera, et cetera. So without"
00:13:36,00:13:43,"Ficks, we wouldn't have lots of other rainforest-y stuff. We wouldn't be here today."
00:13:43,00:13:48,"They're amazing, aren't they? I'd never looked into Ficks before. So I read a quote from Charles"
00:13:48,00:13:54,"Dickens, which he said, ""Train up a fig tree in the way it should go, and when you are old, sit under"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"the shade of it."" And the idea is that you can push them into a territory, and that's the direction"
00:13:59,00:14:05,"they'll grow, which is a thing that happens. A lot of people end up making bridges out of Ficks by"
00:14:05,00:14:11,"positioning the direction, and they grow across these sort of river passes, and that's your fig"
00:14:11,00:14:15,"bridge, which has just naturally grown. It's astonishing. The photos are amazing, if anyone"
00:14:15,00:14:19,"wants to see. Yeah, it's mostly, it's in North India, isn't it? And it's basically suspension"
00:14:19,00:14:24,"bridges, which massively pre-date our suspension bridges. And they're so long. I think the longest"
00:14:24,00:14:31,"is over 50 meters long, and over 500 years old, because they do, yeah, they've got these incredibly"
00:14:31,00:14:36,"strong roots that kind of, they weave around each other. And I think a lot of the bridges"
00:14:36,00:14:39,have a handrail. They will have trained some of the routes to grow into a handrail as well.
00:14:39,00:14:45,"Amazing. It's a long wait for your bridge, though, isn't it, when you've commissioned a guy?"
00:14:45,00:14:47,"Yeah, Frederick would not have had the patience to wait for that bridge."
00:14:47,00:14:54,"So Ficks, yeah, they are, Ficks themselves are extraordinary as well in the way that they breed."
00:14:54,00:15:00,"Every fig that you eat has at least one corpse in it, probably lots of corpses inside it."
00:15:00,00:15:03,"Is that all of the figs that you eat, like the ones from the supermarket?"
00:15:03,00:15:06,"Oh, technically, probably every fig you eat doesn't have a corpse in it, because these"
00:15:06,00:15:11,days they're often done artificially. But if you're eating a fig that has been naturally
00:15:11,00:15:16,"propagated, it's got at least one corpse in it. Because the way they breed is an extraordinary"
00:15:16,00:15:21,"way where every fig, and there are, I think there are more than 750 species of fig, has its own"
00:15:21,00:15:27,specific fig wasp. And the way the figs are pollinated is that a female wasp will burrow
00:15:27,00:15:33,"inside the fig. And weirdly, a fig is an inside out flower. So the flower is on the inside,"
00:15:33,00:15:38,"the bit that needs pollinating, burrows inside the fig, and then she lays her eggs, and then they"
00:15:38,00:15:43,"spawn, and then they shag each other and fertilize each other. And then the males,"
00:15:43,00:15:48,"the male siblings, crawl up and make a little tunnel out of the fig so the females can escape."
00:15:48,00:15:52,"And then the males die, sacrifice themselves, females fly off, and then they go and pollinate"
00:15:52,00:15:56,"the next fig. Beautiful, a beautiful story. It's amazing. It's so cool."
00:15:56,00:16:03,"You've kind of glossed over the incest bit, because a lot of the wasps that hatch are siblings."
00:16:03,00:16:09,"Reasonably, I think, to gloss over that bit. I think all of them are siblings, are they not?"
00:16:09,00:16:12,"No, they're not, because you can get several different wasps crawling inside a fig,"
00:16:12,00:16:17,"which will then die, but they will have laid their eggs around inside the little seed bits."
00:16:17,00:16:24,It's not frowned upon in the fig wasp world in the same way it is for us. And that's why there
00:16:24,00:16:28,"are lots of corpses often, is that the ladies kill each other, don't they? Because if more than one"
00:16:28,00:16:35,"mother gets inside, then they have a duel to the death very often. To make sure that only one"
00:16:35,00:16:40,"mother can lay her eggs. But then the poor mums of figs amputate their wings as they go in,"
00:16:40,00:16:44,right? So the mothers can never leave. So they're doomed. And then tenor as well.
00:16:44,00:16:50,"Have you heard of Mike Shanahan? Oh, yes. Only right."
00:16:50,00:16:57,"Yeah, yeah. He came on our radio show a few years ago. He is amazing. He knows more about figs"
00:16:57,00:17:00,"than anyone I've met knows about any other subjects, apart from perhaps"
00:17:00,00:17:04,Erica McAllister and flies. That's the only other person I can compare him to.
00:17:04,00:17:12,"Yeah, or Dan Schreiber and Nazi sacred myths, far from those guys. So yeah, he's written this book"
00:17:12,00:17:17,"called God's Wasps and Stranglers, which is unbelievable. I've only read a chapter of it,"
00:17:17,00:17:21,"but it is so interesting. If you're interested in figs, this is the"
00:17:21,00:17:26,"book to read on the subject, basically. I actually found something that I think Mr."
00:17:26,00:17:32,"Shanahan got wrong in his book. Yeah. Well, it was just we were talking about royals and we're"
00:17:32,00:17:38,"talking about, so Barbarossa and the fig. I found a modern royal that was associated with the fig,"
00:17:38,00:17:43,"which is Queen Elizabeth II, who was asleep in a fig tree when she found out she became queen."
00:17:44,00:17:51,"Excuse me. Sorry. Our current queen was asleep in a fig tree. She was famously in Africa, wasn't"
00:17:51,00:17:57,"she, when she found out and it was a tree house, was it? I think exactly. No, didn't she crawled"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"inside a fig? That's right. Unfortunately, she lost her wings and antennae on the way,"
00:18:00,00:18:05,"but a nearby aquari was able to pry her out. Yeah, but let's gloss over the incest for a second."
00:18:05,00:18:14,"She, yeah, she was staying in a tree house and the story, the sentences that she went up the tree"
00:18:14,00:18:20,"princess and she came down a queen. But I think that they actually found out quite,"
00:18:20,00:18:25,quite some 40 kilometers away from the actual tree where they were staying because they were out and
00:18:25,00:18:30,"about and Philip delivered it in a sort of cabin. So it's not quite true that she was in a fig tree,"
00:18:30,00:18:36,which would have been fantastic. Wow. That's so many preconceptions shattered there. Everyone at
00:18:36,00:18:46,"home has to adjust the whole belief system. Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:18:46,00:18:51,"Okay, my fact this week is that library books can set on fire if you put them in the microwave."
00:18:51,00:18:58,"It's ruined many a dinner for me, certainly. All my cookbooks have gone up in flames."
00:18:58,00:19:02,"That's when it says cookbook, it doesn't mean cook this book."
00:19:04,00:19:10,"This is more of a public service announcement than a fact and it comes via a library in Michigan,"
00:19:10,00:19:15,"the Kent District Library, that's asking people to stop microwaving their books to prevent the"
00:19:15,00:19:21,"spread of coronavirus. And that is because they contain a little chip in them, which is a kind"
00:19:21,00:19:25,"of chip we've mentioned before called an RFID chip, which is what you get in your roaster card or in"
00:19:25,00:19:32,your contactless credit card or in your massive seal that you use to spy on the United States if
00:19:32,00:19:37,you're a roaster. And they're in also in these library books and they're made of metal. And if
00:19:37,00:19:42,"you put metal in the microwave, a lot of the time it will set on fire and people have been doing this"
00:19:42,00:19:47,with library books and they've tweeted a load of pictures of very burnt library books where people
00:19:47,00:19:53,"have been trying to sterilize them. So these chips, you can't put them in the microwave."
00:19:53,00:19:58,"Are they oven chips? Very nice. Very good. But no, don't put them in the oven either."
00:19:58,00:20:01,"It's a very funny joke, Hannah, but this is not a funny matter."
00:20:01,00:20:06,It's not a laughing matter. Got it. I didn't know people have been doing this.
00:20:06,00:20:11,"Yeah. Well, they don't fully know why they're doing it as well, as in the article that I read"
00:20:11,00:20:15,sort of suggested that they're a bit bemused. It's not as if there was a ginormous moment on
00:20:15,00:20:20,"the internet where everyone said, ""Do this to clean it."" So some things popped up on a site"
00:20:20,00:20:23,somewhere where enough people in Michigan have seen it and done it.
00:20:23,00:20:29,"Yeah. I mean, there is a fair amount of logic behind it, isn't it? Microwaves, in theory,"
00:20:29,00:20:34,"could kill viruses, I suppose, and bacteria. Yeah, they heat things up really high temperatures."
00:20:34,00:20:38,But it's just that's not what they're made for. So don't put stuff in the microwave
00:20:38,00:20:41,that's not made to go in a microwave. That's basically the tip.
00:20:41,00:20:46,Yeah. We think the best way to sterilize books is probably just to leave them for a couple of
00:20:46,00:20:49,"days, don't we? And most libraries just now leave them for two or three days."
00:20:49,00:20:57,"Yeah. So COVID-19 will die after a certain number of days. I think in perfect lab conditions,"
00:20:57,00:21:03,"it's kind of over a week. But in real life, you're not living in a bell jar with a perfect"
00:21:03,00:21:08,"amount of air and no UV light and stuff like that. So if you leave a library book for a few days,"
00:21:08,00:21:13,"it should sterilize by itself. They did discuss, I think, UV-like treatment,"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"because people kept on saying, ""Could you treat things with UV?"" And it was pointed out as well"
00:21:16,00:21:21,as being quite carcinogenic. So you don't want it to be expensive. You would need to treat every
00:21:21,00:21:27,single page of a book. So it would involve shining UV. Imagine getting more on peace back.
00:21:27,00:21:32,That's going to take two or three hours to UV treat. And it's not like you can just get a little
00:21:32,00:21:39,"UV torch and just shine it on and that'll kill it. You need a special, very high energy UV light"
00:21:39,00:21:45,in order to kill viruses. I was looking into sort of library scares and things like this.
00:21:45,00:21:50,"And that was a really interesting account of worry about reading contagion. In fact,"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"there's a book about it called ""Reading Contagion"" because it was reported in 1911"
00:21:55,00:21:59,"in a library journal that books seem well adapted for carrying smallpox, measles,"
00:21:59,00:22:05,"scarlet fever, trochoma, ditheria, erycephalus, dysentery, typhoid, antipirkyloces."
00:22:05,00:22:07,"Erycephalus, really? Erycephalus is in there, yeah."
00:22:07,00:22:12,That's it again. Erycephalus. Can I just explain that while we're laughing at that?
00:22:12,00:22:17,"So I'll probably cut this out. But in our live show last year, we had a spelling competition"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"where Andy would say very unusual words and Dan would try and pronounce them,"
00:22:21,00:22:26,"and then the audience would try and spell them. And Erycephalus was one of those,"
00:22:26,00:22:30,"and I'd never heard the word before that gig, and now it seems to come up virtually every week."
00:22:30,00:22:33,"It's following us around. And I'm still saying it, Erycephalus."
00:22:33,00:22:40,And this was a fear because some readers would lick their fingers as they were turning pages.
00:22:40,00:22:45,"So people got very worried about this. And there was one scientist who decided to experiment on it,"
00:22:45,00:22:50,"and he did it by taking public library books, cutting out the dirtiest bits,"
00:22:50,00:22:53,"I mean the physically dirtiest bits, not the rudest bits in the book,"
00:22:53,00:22:57,"so that he'd have much wear. And then he would soak the pages in saline solution,"
00:22:57,00:23:03,"then he would spin that liquid with the sort of gloopy matter from the library books in it,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,then he would inject that saline solution into guinea pigs.
00:23:06,00:23:12,"And amazingly, all the guinea pigs died. All 40 of the guinea pigs he tried and undied."
00:23:12,00:23:18,"That's evidence that they're catching germs in the book, rather than just that he just injected"
00:23:18,00:23:22,"them with saline solution. Well, they did die of proper things, but it turns out,"
00:23:22,00:23:27,"I mean, if no one reads library books like that, no one does that with library books."
00:23:27,00:23:31,"No, no, it would be an unusual thing to do. And also, they don't let you return them after you've"
00:23:31,00:23:35,"whisked your washing machine, injected yourself with parts of them."
00:23:35,00:23:41,"Well, do you know in Boston, the Boston Library, how they clean their books when they get returned?"
00:23:41,00:23:46,They have a mini book-sized car wash that they send the books through.
00:23:46,00:23:51,"So it's got all these compartments, it's on a conveyor belt, and it can do 12 books a minute."
00:23:51,00:23:55,"They don't use it on the extremely rare books, it's just for more modern books,"
00:23:55,00:24:00,"and it's a dusting system as they come through, spinning brush bars and so on."
00:24:00,00:24:03,"You can watch videos of it online, and that's how they clean their books."
00:24:03,00:24:07,"That's not to sterilize them or anything, is it? That's to get rid of all the dust and..."
00:24:07,00:24:10,"Yes, but anything that's returned just for maintenance, basically."
00:24:10,00:24:12,"But yes, not sterilization."
00:24:12,00:24:17,"There was this scare about book germs, seemed to go on for a long time."
00:24:17,00:24:23,"So it started in the 1870s, I think, and it lasted, as you say, well, until the 20th century."
00:24:23,00:24:28,"And in 1907, there was a law in the UK passed that said if anyone was ill,"
00:24:28,00:24:32,you were not allowed to borrow a book from a library or return a book to a library.
00:24:32,00:24:38,"And they tried, yeah, all sorts of experiments to figure out if they were spreading germs,"
00:24:38,00:24:41,"didn't they? They got lots of doctors involved. There was another one,"
00:24:41,00:24:46,"as well as the guinea pig one, where they had monkeys drink milk off a germy book,"
00:24:46,00:24:49,and then see if anything went wrong with them.
00:24:49,00:24:54,"Again, difficult to return that monkey poo-drenched, milky book to the library afterwards."
00:24:55,00:25:01,"I wonder if that law from 1907 still holds or not. Probably not the same law,"
00:25:01,00:25:06,"but I'm pretty sure there's a law that's around now that if you have plague, for instance,"
00:25:06,00:25:11,"and you get in a taxi by law, you have to announce it to the taxi driver before you go anywhere."
00:25:11,00:25:16,And I think it's the same public health act that those two things are from.
00:25:16,00:25:20,So I wonder if you have to announce to a librarian that you have a certain illness
00:25:20,00:25:23,before you give your library books back. I don't know.
00:25:23,00:25:27,"Because it was basically someone died, didn't they? There was a Nebraska librarian that died"
00:25:27,00:25:33,"of tuberculosis, and that kind of made everyone think, oh, shit, there could be something in this."
00:25:33,00:25:38,But do you know the Spanish flu from 1918 or 1919?
00:25:38,00:25:43,They thought that that could travel on telegraph wires because a load of telegraph operators got
00:25:43,00:25:48,"the disease at the same time. But obviously, it was because they were all in a room together."
00:25:50,00:25:54,"There was also one where a load of bank tellers in a bank got sick at the same time,"
00:25:54,00:25:58,"and they thought that maybe it had come with the money. So it was like,"
00:25:58,00:26:03,they thought that whatever was coming into that building might have been what caused the illness
00:26:03,00:26:05,rather than one of the people giving it to everyone else.
00:26:05,00:26:12,"Hey, when we were on tour last year in America, we were in New York,"
00:26:12,00:26:16,"and I went to the New York Public Library, and it is stunning. Have you guys been"
00:26:16,00:26:21,"when we were there or been any other time? It's really, it's just this majestic building,"
00:26:21,00:26:26,and I saw that they had a lot of sort of relics of literature in there. So I started looking into
00:26:26,00:26:32,"it, see what else they have. And there's some great things about it. For example, there was one"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"customer, as it were, someone who came every day and sat at the same desk for 52 years,"
00:26:37,00:26:44,"and that was from 1923 to 1975. And it was the guy, it was a man called Norbert Pearlroth,"
00:26:44,00:26:49,who was the head researcher for Ripley's Believe It or Not. And he used to sit in that library
00:26:49,00:26:55,every single day or most days at the same desk doing his research. And because the research
00:26:55,00:27:00,"available in that library is astonishing, they have the largest collection of restaurant menus"
00:27:00,00:27:07,"in the world, for example. They have 40,000 restaurant menus, and it's used by chefs all"
00:27:07,00:27:12,over the world to sort of find old ideas for what they can do with their menus. But it's also used
00:27:12,00:27:18,"by biologists, marine biologists, to study fish populations to see if there was a spike in what"
00:27:18,00:27:23,"was being eaten in the restaurants around New York at the time. Yeah, so it's used for sort of"
00:27:23,00:27:30,understanding ecology as well. There's one library designer who designed libraries like the Qatar
00:27:30,00:27:35,"National Library, which is incredible. And also the Seattle Library, which is quite famous,"
00:27:35,00:27:40,I think it has a spiral of ongoing books. So you walk from the bottom to the top and the library
00:27:40,00:27:46,"shelves never end. Anyway, this architect is called, he's a Dutch guy called Rem Coolhouse."
00:27:46,00:27:52,I think his name. It's Coolhouse. What a name for an architect. What a great name.
00:27:52,00:27:58,"Hey, Coolhouse, Coolhouse. Yeah, I hope he just hears that all the time."
00:27:58,00:28:03,"Just as this fact was about microwaving library books, I've got one thing on"
00:28:03,00:28:07,microwaves. I was looking for interesting microwave stories and things you shouldn't
00:28:07,00:28:14,"microwave. And in 2017, there was a man who had to be freed by firefighters after cementing"
00:28:14,00:28:21,"his own head into a microwave. He was called Jay Swingler, 22, from the UK. He and his friends,"
00:28:21,00:28:25,"they mixed up seven bags of polyfiller and they poured it around his head inside the microwave,"
00:28:25,00:28:31,"which was protected by a plastic bag. It wasn't stupid. All right. And unaccountably,"
00:28:31,00:28:36,then dried and they couldn't get him out. They tried for an hour and a half to get him out
00:28:36,00:28:43,before calling the fire brigade. This was all for YouTube and the emergency services turned up
00:28:43,00:28:48,and they sort of chipped the microwave apart. They destroyed the microwave and they then didn't
00:28:48,00:28:53,"find him very generously because they assessed that he had been at risk of dying. Sorry, I thought"
00:28:53,00:28:59,you said they didn't find him. Yeah. They just keep chipping and chipping. He must be in here somewhere.
00:28:59,00:29:05,And I was later interviewed and he said he hadn't wasted the emergency services time
00:29:05,00:29:09,"because they saved my life, whereas I say that he did waste their time."
00:29:09,00:29:16,"There was an interview with Robert Pattinson earlier this year in April with GQ,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,which I assume they must have done over Zoom or over Skype or something because
00:29:19,00:29:25,he's in a house which appears to be a like a hired house rather than his own.
00:29:25,00:29:30,"And while they're interviewing him, he's making some pasta in the microwave."
00:29:31,00:29:38,"Now, he has come up with a new way of making pasta. It's a bit like a pop tart,"
00:29:38,00:29:42,but you make your pasta and then you put a load of American cheese and sugar
00:29:42,00:29:48,with it and then you cover it in cornflakes. And apparently it's the most delicious thing
00:29:48,00:29:54,that Robert Pattinson has ever eaten. So he's making this while he's being interviewed by GQ
00:29:54,00:30:01,and they're asking him about it and he puts all the cornflakes on the outside and then he puts
00:30:01,00:30:08,"it all in tinfoil and he says, ""Are you allowed to put tinfoil in the oven?"" And the GQ guy says,"
00:30:08,00:30:12,"""Yeah, you can put tinfoil in the oven. You're just not allowed to put it in a microwave."""
00:30:12,00:30:17,"And then Robert Pattinson goes, ""I think this is an oven."" And so then he puts his"
00:30:17,00:30:23,"like pop tart thing in what he thinks is an oven, but which is actually a microwave."
00:30:23,00:30:27,"And they're still doing the interview at this point. And then about a couple of minutes later,"
00:30:27,00:30:33,the whole thing explodes. The microwave explodes and all the electricity goes off
00:30:33,00:30:39,"in Robert Pattinson's house. And I've got to say, this is the best interview I've ever read"
00:30:39,00:30:43,in my whole life. And has anyone checked on Robert Pattinson recently because I'm a bit worried
00:30:43,00:30:51,"about it? My brother-in-law, Charbell, works in hotels and he once got a call up to a room"
00:30:51,00:30:56,"because the guy who was up there had ordered room service, had his food, but clearly hadn't"
00:30:56,00:31:02,"finished eating it. So he called Charbell up, Charbell entered the room and he said,"
00:31:02,00:31:06,"""I need your help. I was trying to reheat my food, but I can't get it back out of the microwave."""
00:31:06,00:31:13,But what he'd done was put it into the safe. And he'd locked his Bolognese or whatever he had.
00:31:13,00:31:20,That's fine. So the code was probably three minutes or whatever. That's so funny.
00:31:24,00:31:31,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that one of the kings of Leon"
00:31:31,00:31:37,was called Alfonso the slobberer. The kings of where they're still going. What do you mean was?
00:31:37,00:31:42,"Yeah. Well, I'm glad you pointed that out. Obviously kings of Leon, great band, three of them,"
00:31:42,00:31:47,Jared and two others. None of them is called Alfonso the slobberer. It turns out that before
00:31:47,00:31:52,"the band even thought about forming, there was a kingdom called Leon. And that's what they're"
00:31:52,00:31:58,very cleverly referring to in their name. And Leon is in the... It was a huge chunk of the
00:31:58,00:32:04,"Iberian Peninsula, so Northwest Spain and what is now Portugal too. And it had a king in the"
00:32:04,00:32:11,mid to late 12th century called Alfonso. And Alfonso was an angry guy. He would have fits of
00:32:11,00:32:16,rage that made him foam at the mouth. And that's why he got his charming nickname Alfonso the slobberer.
00:32:17,00:32:24,"Wow. We do know a bit more about him. We know he married his cousin twice, not the same cousin,"
00:32:24,00:32:29,"different cousins. So he had a type. And annulled them because of it, right? It's so bizarre that"
00:32:29,00:32:33,"you can make that mistake. Like he marries a cousin and then he had, I think, three children with the"
00:32:33,00:32:38,"first one. And then suddenly it was like, oh, damn it, it's incest, not allowed to do it. So it had"
00:32:38,00:32:43,"to be annulled. And then did the same thing again, had five children with the next one. Annulled again."
00:32:43,00:32:46,I think the second one might have been his first cousin once removed.
00:32:46,00:32:52,"Yes, you're right. It was. But I didn't know this. It's so interesting. I had no idea how strict the"
00:32:52,00:32:56,"rules on incest actually were at certain points in history. Well, we usually gloss over the incest on"
00:32:56,00:33:05,"this podcast. So the church had banned marriages for relations up to seven degrees removed,"
00:33:05,00:33:10,"which meant that you had to count seven generations back. And it was illegal to,"
00:33:10,00:33:14,"I mean, who on earth knows seven generations back? It meant it was illegal to marry anyone closer than"
00:33:14,00:33:18,"your seventh cousin. So it must have been an enormous hassle. If you fancy someone,"
00:33:18,00:33:21,"you had to really trace, you had to go on, who do you think you are?"
00:33:21,00:33:32,"Alfonso also formed the Cortes de Leon in 1188, which brought together all the nobles in that"
00:33:32,00:33:36,area. And some people say it was the first parliament in the history of Western Europe.
00:33:36,00:33:41,So that's one good thing you might have done. There were quite a few kings of Leon
00:33:41,00:33:48,"over the years. Henry the impotent, he was one. He was supposedly impotent as a result of a curse"
00:33:48,00:33:56,by the Bishop of Toledo. The curse was called frigidi et malificiati. And it's quite a common curse
00:33:56,00:34:01,that you would do in medieval times where you would like make someone impotent just by reading
00:34:01,00:34:08,"out this curse. Although he did have a daughter, so it might not have worked. Although the argument"
00:34:08,00:34:12,"was, if he'd had this curse, it can't possibly be his daughter. So he must have"
00:34:12,00:34:17,been someone else's child. It's always around it. Maybe the curse wears off after a while.
00:34:17,00:34:22,"Alfonso could have done with a bit of that curse. I mean, he had eight children within his two"
00:34:22,00:34:27,marriages and then he had another 10 children outside his marriages. There you go. He needed
00:34:27,00:34:34,"a bit of frigidiati et malificiati or whatever. I read another guy, another king, who was in"
00:34:34,00:34:40,"the 10th century called DeSancho. Sancho the fat, he was known as. Yes, he was also King of Leon,"
00:34:40,00:34:46,"wasn't he? Yeah, King of Leon. Interesting story. He basically was said to have been so overweight"
00:34:46,00:34:51,that it made it hard for him to walk. He couldn't ride a horse. He couldn't pick up a sword.
00:34:51,00:34:58,And so he lost the throne as a result. He was disposed as a sort of weak king. And his grandmother
00:34:58,00:35:05,"took him to a doctor. And the story goes is that the doctor sewed his lips shut, except for a tiny"
00:35:05,00:35:11,"little hole to put a straw through to give him what was effectively the first weight loss diet,"
00:35:11,00:35:16,which was you can only drink stuff through this straw as your food. And he eventually lost half
00:35:16,00:35:21,of his weight to the point where he could ride a horse again and pick up a sword. And he regained
00:35:21,00:35:31,the throne because he came back as a strong king. He was immediately deposed because of his speech
00:35:31,00:35:40,impediment. At least he wasn't slubbering with that little hole. He did have a serious problem
00:35:40,00:35:45,"though. I think the contemporary accounts say that he was, well, in today's measurements,"
00:35:45,00:35:51,"is 38 stone, which is too heavy. No horse can take that. And I quite like that the guy,"
00:35:51,00:35:58,"it was just such a testament to what a mixed place Europe was then that his grandmother walked him,"
00:35:58,00:36:03,"sort of wobbled him along to a Jewish doctor, this guy was, who worked for the Muslim ruler,"
00:36:03,00:36:09,"Abdul Rahman. And obviously he was Christian. It was such a melting pot. And yeah, cured him."
00:36:09,00:36:14,And it's good because he replaced or don't know the wicked. It sounds like if it's between the fat
00:36:14,00:36:19,"and the wicked, you'd probably go the fat, wouldn't you? Yeah, unless it was like a really kind"
00:36:19,00:36:27,"of positive thing like wicked. Yeah. And also, I suppose Sancho could be fat with a pH. He might"
00:36:27,00:36:33,"have just dropped some heavy beats. Yeah, true. They were all DJs, the Kings of Leon. Oh yeah,"
00:36:33,00:36:38,"if they were all DJs, then what about Bermuda the Goutie? I don't want to watch his set."
00:36:38,00:36:43,"There were quite a few Queens of Leon, as well as the Kings of Leon. Joanna the Mad,"
00:36:43,00:36:51,"she was one of them. She was married to Philip the Handsome. She really liked Philip the Handsome,"
00:36:51,00:36:58,but unfortunately he died. And then she kind of lived with his coffin and would open up the coffin
00:36:58,00:37:03,every now and then so she could kiss his feet. That's why they called her Joanna the Mad.
00:37:03,00:37:07,"Actually, Alfonso the Slobberer wanted to leave his kingdom to his two daughters,"
00:37:07,00:37:12,"so Sancho and Dolce. He left officially after he died. He left it to his two daughters,"
00:37:12,00:37:18,"but basically the people of Leon were not really up for female leaders. And the daughters, and I"
00:37:18,00:37:22,"think I would have done exactly the same thing, weren't really up for having a big fight about it."
00:37:22,00:37:28,"So basically they met with their half-brother's mum. So these three women met and they negotiated,"
00:37:28,00:37:32,"look, we'll give this chap the kingdom and can we just have a bunch of castles and some money?"
00:37:32,00:37:37,And it was called the Pax of the Mothers. They just went and lived the life of Riley somewhere.
00:37:37,00:37:41,"Yeah, it's a good call. Because being a king or queen in those days..."
00:37:41,00:37:44,Very stressful. And the nicknames alone would have done you in.
00:37:44,00:37:53,"You got some more nicknames? Yeah, I found a few. I strayed off territory a bit away from"
00:37:53,00:37:58,Leon and I just went to other regal nicknames. So there was a Byzantine emperor who was called
00:37:58,00:38:06,Constantine the name of shit. Copra Nimos is what that was at the time. And it's allegedly because
00:38:06,00:38:12,"he shat in the font during his baptism. Oh, yeah. I know. So it's kind of a clever joke, actually."
00:38:12,00:38:17,"It is a bit like someone at school, like being on a school trip and having to shit in a bag"
00:38:17,00:38:22,"and being called shitbag for the rest of school. For the rest of the rain, they're rain as emperor"
00:38:22,00:38:27,as well. Terrible. Yeah. But that would have happened when they were like less than one or
00:38:27,00:38:31,"just for a baptism. I'm not saying it's fair, Dan. I'm not saying it's fair, but I am saying it's"
00:38:31,00:38:36,funny. James II of England was known as James the bishop or something. Was he by the Irish?
00:38:36,00:38:41,"I think the Irish called him that or something. Yeah, because they wanted him to hang around and"
00:38:41,00:38:45,"fight for them. And then he fled to France, quite famously disappeared and just gave up the throne"
00:38:45,00:38:49,"to William of Orange. So they were like, well, you're a piece of shit. That's how he went down."
00:38:49,00:38:55,"I have a quick study about nicknames in general. Oh, yeah. So there was a study by Queen Mary"
00:38:55,00:39:00,University and they were looking into nicknames and online dating and how you can make yourself
00:39:00,00:39:06,"most effective, which I know is not of any special interest to any of you three. Well,"
00:39:06,00:39:10,"I just need to know, on my Tinder profile, should I call myself James the slobber or not?"
00:39:10,00:39:15,"Right, exactly. So they studied loads of different research papers. They studied"
00:39:15,00:39:21,"like lots and lots and lots of previous papers on online attraction. And it's quite funny, just"
00:39:22,00:39:27,"the things they found out or the headline results were quite obvious, seeming things."
00:39:27,00:39:32,So they found that nicknames with negative connotations like little or bug are linked with
00:39:32,00:39:38,inferiority. So you shouldn't pick them. And they said playful screen names were good. So
00:39:38,00:39:45,"the name fun to be with, that's the number two. And then the letter B was universally attractive,"
00:39:45,00:39:51,they claimed. They also said pick something near the beginning of the alphabet. Because if like
00:39:51,00:39:55,"all sensible people, you arrange your dating profiles you're looking at in alphabetical order,"
00:39:55,00:39:57,you don't want to be lost in the bottom of the pile.
00:39:57,00:40:02,So does that mean you should call yourself Andy?
00:40:02,00:40:11,"Like in the Edinburgh Festival programme. You always have like the A, A, A, A company show."
00:40:11,00:40:12,Exactly like that.
00:40:12,00:40:15,"Cause they're either gouty, not getting any dates."
00:40:15,00:40:19,I've just got a few more nicknames I found of rulers throughout history.
00:40:20,00:40:25,"So there's, you know, so many, Manuel the sausage maker, Wilfred the hairy,"
00:40:25,00:40:29,Half Dan the bad entertainer. That's not a good one.
00:40:29,00:40:30,"No, come on."
00:40:30,00:40:32,Yeah. King Dan.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"Actually is your online nickname, isn't it?"
00:40:34,00:40:40,"So yeah, he was from Norway. He was the son of Einstein the fart."
00:40:40,00:40:47,"And yeah, so he was very generous paying his soldiers, but he was very bad in providing food"
00:40:47,00:40:49,and entertainment for them.
00:40:49,00:40:51,You buy your own food and entertainment if you've got a good salary.
00:40:51,00:40:55,Borrowed Half Dan.
00:40:55,00:41:01,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that's my fact."
00:41:01,00:41:05,My fact this week is that there is a Chinese poem made up of 92 characters
00:41:05,00:41:12,"in which every word is pronounced sh. The poem is called the lion eating poet in the Stonedan,"
00:41:12,00:41:15,"or sh, sh, sh, sh, sh."
00:41:15,00:41:16,Sure.
00:41:16,00:41:23,"Now, for any Mandarin listeners out there, just to quickly say, I grew up in Hong Kong"
00:41:23,00:41:27,"and I was taught Mandarin throughout school, but I have a foreign Mandarin accent."
00:41:27,00:41:31,So apologies if I butchered that slightly. It's a very hard sentence to say.
00:41:31,00:41:33,The poem is even harder to say.
00:41:33,00:41:36,"Dan, that is an easy sentence to say."
00:41:36,00:41:37,"Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure."
00:41:37,00:41:38,Charlie is the one that we could know.
00:41:38,00:41:40,"No, because you're saying it with one tone."
00:41:40,00:41:41,And it's tonally.
00:41:41,00:41:43,"You just sound like a librarian there, James."
00:41:44,00:41:47,"Wait a minute. So when you said it, it sounded to me, to my ears,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,it sounded like they were all the same tone.
00:41:49,00:41:50,"Sure, sure."
00:41:50,00:41:52,So sure is neutral.
00:41:52,00:41:54,Sure is the downward.
00:41:54,00:41:57,Sure is the upward and sure.
00:41:57,00:42:01,"So those are four different sure's that you could be saying as a result,"
00:42:01,00:42:05,"which is why it's it's if you say this poem out loud,"
00:42:05,00:42:07,"even the best Chinese speaker saying it out loud,"
00:42:07,00:42:10,"no one will know what they're saying because despite the four tones,"
00:42:10,00:42:15,"you can still have about 15 different words which have that tone of sure,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,for let's say going on the upward sound.
00:42:17,00:42:21,So it is totally bemusing to listen to it out loud.
00:42:21,00:42:22,Isn't it true?
00:42:22,00:42:23,It works in character form.
00:42:23,00:42:24,Isn't it true?
00:42:24,00:42:26,"I might be wrong about this because obviously,"
00:42:26,00:42:27,"I don't know anything about this language,"
00:42:27,00:42:31,"but is it not true that in classic Chinese, it works way better?"
00:42:31,00:42:35,"And in modern Mandarin and modern Cantonese,"
00:42:35,00:42:36,it really doesn't work at all.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"Yeah, that's right."
00:42:37,00:42:43,"Yeah, but the cool thing about classical Chinese that I never knew this is that it's"
00:42:43,00:42:46,"quite similar to modern standard Arabic today,"
00:42:46,00:42:50,but the way classical Chinese was used from about sort of the eighth century
00:42:50,00:42:52,until about 100 years ago.
00:42:52,00:42:56,It was that it was a way to communicate between people who didn't speak the same language.
00:42:56,00:43:00,"So the like China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam,"
00:43:00,00:43:03,"all these areas in East Asia spoke different languages,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,but they all wrote in classical Chinese.
00:43:05,00:43:08,"And so they have this thing called brush talk,"
00:43:08,00:43:10,"where if you met a foreigner, you couldn't chat to them,"
00:43:10,00:43:12,but you could pass notes.
00:43:12,00:43:14,And so you'd meet a foreigner and you'd do brush talk.
00:43:14,00:43:16,"So I mean, it must have been extremely arduous,"
00:43:16,00:43:17,"taken a lot longer,"
00:43:17,00:43:20,but you could just have a secret passing notes in class chat.
00:43:20,00:43:20,Wow.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"That's pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:43:22,00:43:23,"It's like when you go to an airport,"
00:43:23,00:43:26,and the word for parking is the same in every country.
00:43:26,00:43:29,It's like if everything was like that.
00:43:29,00:43:30,Exactly.
00:43:30,00:43:34,Could I quickly give a bit of a brief explanation about this poem
00:43:34,00:43:35,and the author of it?
00:43:35,00:43:40,"Because this was written by a man called Yuan Run Chao,"
00:43:40,00:43:42,and he's an incredible guy.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"He wrote it in the 1930s,"
00:43:44,00:43:48,and it was done as a sort of linguistic demonstration
00:43:48,00:43:54,to show that you could manage to stretch out this one word into a 92-word poem.
00:43:54,00:43:56,He was an amazing character.
00:43:56,00:44:00,"He moved over to America to study mathematics and physics at Cornell University,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,and he eventually did philosophy at Harvard.
00:44:03,00:44:05,And he became a huge influence
00:44:05,00:44:08,within the world of Chinese language for the Western world.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"So when he was back in China,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"if Bertrand Russell came over,"
00:44:12,00:44:13,he would act as his interpreter.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"Back in America,"
00:44:15,00:44:17,he recorded the standard Chinese pronunciation
00:44:17,00:44:19,gramophone records that people would get
00:44:19,00:44:21,that would be distributed nationally.
00:44:21,00:44:24,So people would understand a unified pronunciation
00:44:24,00:44:25,of Chinese and America.
00:44:25,00:44:27,He translated Alice in Wonderland.
00:44:27,00:44:30,He wrote pop hits back in China.
00:44:30,00:44:33,"I mean, he was this incredible character."
00:44:33,00:44:35,"Have you heard his pop hit, by the way?"
00:44:35,00:44:36,"I haven't, actually."
00:44:36,00:44:38,"And weirdly, he wrote the music, not the lyrics for it."
00:44:38,00:44:42,It's not exactly the Kings of Leon.
00:44:42,00:44:48,"Yeah, 1930s Chinese pop is not what you'd expect."
00:44:48,00:44:49,"Very repetitive lyrics, isn't it?"
00:44:49,00:44:54,It's like the too unlimited of its time.
00:44:54,00:44:58,His wife was amazing.
00:44:58,00:45:02,"His wife invented stir fry, which is quite amazing."
00:45:02,00:45:05,She wrote a book called How to Cook and Eat in Chinese
00:45:05,00:45:09,"in 1946, which went through loads and loads of editions."
00:45:09,00:45:10,What a specific title for a book.
00:45:10,00:45:14,It must have had a very quick sell-by date.
00:45:14,00:45:14,It was.
00:45:14,00:45:17,It was like the book of the year 2019.
00:45:17,00:45:18,No one bought it after that year.
00:45:18,00:45:22,But she wrote a load of techniques
00:45:22,00:45:24,that they used to cook in China.
00:45:24,00:45:29,But her terms are now used quite commonly in America.
00:45:29,00:45:31,So the term stir fry was invented by her
00:45:31,00:45:33,"and her daughter as well, who did a lot of the translation."
00:45:33,00:45:37,What's quite interesting and ironic
00:45:37,00:45:40,is that people use this poem as an argument
00:45:40,00:45:44,against writing the Chinese language in the Roman characters.
00:45:44,00:45:47,Because it's way more complicated than that.
00:45:47,00:45:50,"And if you start putting them into Latin characters,"
00:45:50,00:45:52,then you just can't get the nuances.
00:45:52,00:45:55,"But of course, this guy, Yuan Ren Chao,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,he was very much pro translation.
00:45:57,00:45:59,He was a translator.
00:45:59,00:46:01,So it's quite ironic that that has been used as an argument.
00:46:01,00:46:04,But it is true that it's so hard to write down in Roman script.
00:46:04,00:46:07,So there was actually someone who wrote beneath a YouTube video
00:46:07,00:46:09,who was Taiwanese and I think was talking about
00:46:09,00:46:11,language spoken in Fujian.
00:46:11,00:46:15,And said that the sentence grandfather hit his head
00:46:15,00:46:18,on a metal tin and grandfather felt giddy
00:46:18,00:46:22,is the word gong written eight times basically.
00:46:22,00:46:25,So like gong is grandfather and then various other...
00:46:25,00:46:26,Wow.
00:46:26,00:46:27,So much fun word play.
00:46:27,00:46:28,That's such a common word.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"Wait, which language did you say that was, Anna?"
00:46:30,00:46:33,That was in Taiwanese and in Fujian.
00:46:33,00:46:37,And I spent about an hour this morning trying to practice
00:46:37,00:46:41,"the sentence, ""The horse is slow, mother tells off the horse."""
00:46:41,00:46:43,Is it all ma's?
00:46:43,00:46:44,"Yeah, I think it's like"
00:46:45,00:46:48,"ma, ma, ma, ma, ma."
00:46:48,00:46:49,"How does that sound, Dan?"
00:46:49,00:46:50,Nonsense.
00:46:50,00:46:55,"Well, it would sound nonsense anyway, as is the point of the sure, sure, sure."
00:46:55,00:46:58,Like it's impossible to grip onto.
00:46:58,00:47:01,"You need to see that written in order to go,"
00:47:01,00:47:04,"""Okay, ma, mother, ma, horse, ma, slow."""
00:47:04,00:47:06,That's where that would make sense for you.
00:47:06,00:47:07,That's why it's so hard.
00:47:07,00:47:10,Have you heard of the Hmong language of Vietnam?
00:47:10,00:47:11,Yeah.
00:47:11,00:47:13,That's got eight tones in it.
00:47:13,00:47:14,Whoa.
00:47:14,00:47:15,Yeah.
00:47:15,00:47:19,"So the word ""Paul,"" depending on what you're putting,"
00:47:19,00:47:20,"where you're putting the tone,"
00:47:20,00:47:24,"can mean either ""female,"" ""throw,"" ""thorn,"" ""pancreas,"""
00:47:24,00:47:26,"""to see,"" or ""paternal grandmother."""
00:47:26,00:47:29,"So if you want to say,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,"""I can see my paternal grandmother's pancreas."""
00:47:31,00:47:37,"They are brilliant, these little kind of oddities, though, aren't they?"
00:47:37,00:47:40,Because most languages around the world have something like that.
00:47:40,00:47:44,"So in the Ojibwe language of Canada,"
00:47:44,00:47:47,"which was one of the biggest First Nations languages,"
00:47:47,00:47:52,"there's a phrase, ""Gada, na, na, na, ah, na, na,"""
00:47:52,00:47:56,"which means we should really go and get Anna, shouldn't we?"
00:47:56,00:47:56,No.
00:47:56,00:47:57,Yeah.
00:47:57,00:47:59,So I think we might start using that one
00:47:59,00:48:02,whenever Anna's late to the hotel lobby before we start.
00:48:02,00:48:03,"Can you say it again, James?"
00:48:03,00:48:07,"It's ""Gada, na, na, na, ah, na, na."""
00:48:07,00:48:10,"I'm going to start singing that at the end of ""Hey Jude."""
00:48:10,00:48:14,"Every time someone sings ""Hey Jude,"""
00:48:14,00:48:16,"that turns up going, ""What? What? I'm here."""
00:48:16,00:48:22,"The drummer of the band, Emperor Yes, that plays our theme tune,"
00:48:22,00:48:25,"he had a song that he put out called ""Aneek,"""
00:48:25,00:48:27,who was someone who used to do our sound checks
00:48:27,00:48:29,for a fish and record our sound.
00:48:29,00:48:32,"He named the song ""Aneek"" after ""Aneek,"""
00:48:32,00:48:37,and it got picked up by Apple and was used in an advert in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
00:48:37,00:48:39,"It was a very popular song,"
00:48:39,00:48:43,and what happens a lot over there is that people use their phone and Shazam
00:48:43,00:48:45,"to find out the name of the song,"
00:48:45,00:48:47,and so they knew that was going to happen.
00:48:47,00:48:48,"And after it had been sold,"
00:48:48,00:48:51,"it had been pointed out that the name ""Aneek"""
00:48:51,00:48:53,"in Arabic translates as ""I fuck,"""
00:48:53,00:48:59,"and Apple was suddenly pushing a big song of their advert with ""I fuck."""
00:48:59,00:49:02,So Adam had to desperately change the title of the song
00:49:02,00:49:04,"so that by the time it went out and Shazam'd,"
00:49:04,00:49:07,it was a different song and he managed to do it
00:49:07,00:49:09,within the space of 24 hours before it went out.
00:49:09,00:49:10,Wow.
00:49:10,00:49:13,"But yeah, he almost caused international chaos with it."
00:49:13,00:49:20,"Okay, that's it."
