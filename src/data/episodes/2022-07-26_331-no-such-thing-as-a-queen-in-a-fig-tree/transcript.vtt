00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.760
 Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.640
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Czenski and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.600
 My fact this week is that the Holy Roman Emperor once made every citizen of Milan

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.200
 pluck a fig from a mules genitals with their teeth.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.320
 Okay. The sandwich to unpack here. Yeah, my main question is about the dynamic of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.520
 as in how do you get a fig into a mules genitals? Like which bit of the genitals is it going into?

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.160
 Oh well I'm so glad you've asked both of those questions actually because I do need to be more

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.440
 specific. I believe it was the anus according to most sources which we're counting as part of the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.760
 genitals. Is that a genital? Yeah, I definitely not. No way. It's called a genitals. You can't

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.720
 generate new life. Sorry. Anna, we've got a lot of explaining to do. Right. You could tuck it

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.280
 between the penis and the ball bag I suppose. Can I just say I thought it was a female mule no?

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.760
 Yeah, I thought it was going in the vagina of the mule. Yes. Wow. Some sources say genitals,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.400
 some sources say anus basically. Was there one mule which stood in for every citizen of Milan?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.760
 Because that's a huge queue. It's a long queue, right. You'd have to set up a city-wide system.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.400
 They didn't do this over one day, Andy. This wasn't like a...

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.080
 This was a years-long process. It's like jury duty.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.800
 That's it, yeah. You get a letter. Oh man. What is it? You're going to war? No, worse.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 Okay, look. I have one more question. All right, great. I think it's more important.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 He's the Holy Roman Emperor. Why is he doing this kind of shit?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.720
 Didn't have much on. Didn't have much on. No, this was Milan. It was causing him,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.920
 Frederick I, Frederick Barbarossa, a lot of problems. This was 1162 and it was all full of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.720
 uprisings. Basically, he sent his wife went to visit Milan and the people of Milan

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.960
 disliked Frederick so much that they humiliated his wife, tied her to a mule and made her ride

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.120
 backwards on this mule around the city. He, Fred, was like, "You humiliated my wife to make up for

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.480
 it. I'm going to make you all do this thing." Actually, in answer to your very good question,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.520
 Andy, about how you get the fig into the mules, anus, or vagina, sources differ,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.920
 you would have to put it back into the genital with your tea so they have to block it out and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.360
 then return it. That was my other question. Do you get to eat the fig afterwards?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.720
 I'm afraid, I think it's the same fig. That's true, massive fig expenditure.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.880
 That's true. Oh, yeah. You don't want to be at the back of that queue with a manky fig.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.960
 That would be disgusting. Anna, in fairness to the people of Milan, they were being

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.960
 sieged by the Holy Roman Emperor at the time. It wasn't like they just humiliated his wife just

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.960
 because they didn't like him. It was more because he was attacking their city.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.760
 It was bigger than that, yeah. He was besieging their city. He was having a lot of problems at

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.760
 the time with various cities he was supposed to rule. Yeah, the Milanese did not like him.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.760
 Actually, as part of this uprising, the three wise men were moved. Milan was known for having

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.360
 the skulls of the three wise men. Then, when Frederick one beat them down, he had the skulls

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.320
 removed and moved to Cologne Cathedral, and they're still there today. It's quite amazing.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.560
 This is like 1,000 years ago, almost. I think if everyone was doing it, I would have no problem

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.320
 in doing the fig challenge. I mean, it would feel like the ice bucket challenge.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.080
 They were actually also raising money for charity, weren't they?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.200
 It was a donkey sanctuary, in fact. You had to nominate five people to remove

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.800
 the fig from the mules genitals afterwards. Maybe there was a sense of solidarity amongst them,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 because they'd all suffered together. What they had to do was they had to get it out with their

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.880
 teeth and then take it to the executioner, who was the person who would have beheaded them

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.240
 if they failed. Then they had to say, "Echo il ficko," as in, "Look, here's the fig," and then

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.920
 they had to replace it. Apparently, in Milan, after that, sticking your thumb between your

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.040
 middle finger and your index finger, I guess, like I'm doing right now,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.640
 is a sign of it's called "known as making the fig," or it was known as making the fig,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.120
 and it was an insult based on this. That's still an insult, quite a lot

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.640
 around the world, actually, doing the fig, because it looks a bit like a vagina. If you do it,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.800
 that's why. And it's still in Russia, for instance, if you do that. It doesn't mean

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.200
 like a really, really bad insult these days. It's just a bit like giving the V's kind of thing.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.800
 It does mean your mother's vagina. In Madagascar, I read that if you went like that,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.560
 you are going, "It's not screw you. It's your mother's vagina."

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.040
 I can't speak for Madagascar, but I've had it done to me in Russia. That's all I can say.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.480
 Because my father-in-law did it to me, and apparently it's not a massive insult.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.320
 It doesn't mean get away from my daughter. Sure, that's what Polina told you.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.840
 He was actually complimenting you, Jack.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.960
 This is a, there's a weird thing, because in Italy, there's a really weird linguistic

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.480
 confusion, right? Because if you say, I hope I get this right, "Bella fico" means nice fig,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.080
 but "Bella figa" means beautiful women's genitals. So there's a weird verbal link between the two

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.680
 as well. And the BBC, a really old BBC talk board, had a thing about someone who'd been

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.720
 trying to order figs in Italy, and they said, "I started off by asking how old was the figae,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.960
 how much I loved it when it was fresh, as long as it wasn't too old, how I loved to eat it,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.360
 and on and on. The lady was clearly shocked, but I kept going on and on trying to explain how much

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.120
 I liked it." Jesus. It's very much got genital associations around the world, hasn't it? And

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.160
 it looks like a, famously like a, look, we all know what it looks like, guys. We don't need to,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.640
 and he's going to that. Can I just, I just wanted to say one more thing I really enjoyed about this

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.080
 besieging that Frederick was doing, because I didn't know about this. So he was really into

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.280
 underground warfare. So when he was besieging Kramer, which he besieged before Milan and Milan,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.800
 he dug a lot of tunnels. And I didn't realize in medieval times, tunnel warfare was a huge deal.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.640
 So you're besieging a city and you dig a tunnel underneath, and then you counter mine from the

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.760
 other end, as in you dig your tunnel and you would meet in the middle. And then two enemies on,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.200
 it would have to be big enough to take you on horseback. And then the two enemies meet in this

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.560
 tunnel. The horses would go down into the tunnel and they'd meet on horseback. And this was a means

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.880
 of combat. And loads of people did it. So Agincourt, they had a lot of these. They were dug by the

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.600
 Welsh miners. Honestly, so what happens is you've got two armies coming at each other. And it is

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.960
 big enough to get a horse down, but only one horse. So it means that the person at the front of your

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.080
 battle can only fight against the person at the front of their battle. And then whoever wins that,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.800
 then fights against the next person in the queue. And you just keep going down and going down until

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.000
 that. It's like playing conkers, basically. It's extraordinary. And the other thing is that

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.920
 you would have these tunnels going towards the city, but you might also dig a tunnel

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.440
 underneath the other person's tunnel so that they kind of fall through it and then get trapped and

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.400
 then you can kill them. And I read once that that's where the word "under mine" comes from, although

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:08.160
 I'm not sure if that's right. That's very famous for having a very impressive fight in one, apparently.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.040
 And something else you could do if they dug a tunnel under yours and popped out on your side.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.960
 They often had big tubs of boiling urine and water that they'd throw on you as you emerged.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.040
 You could only come out one at a time. I can't believe they met each other though. You would

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.480
 assume it would be a bit like, you know, when you close your eyes and you have to get your index

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.360
 fingers to touch each other and they miss. I would assume it must have been so awful at the time.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.440
 You can hear each other digging underground if you keep quiet. You can hear the noise.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.720
 Each team had a golden mould, didn't they, which could hear where the other team was coming in.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.080
 Above the gates of Milan, until the 1500s, there was a work of art showing a woman lifting her

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.200
 skirt and clipping her pubic hair with a large pair of shears. So whenever you went to Milan,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.080
 this is the first thing you would see. And no one really knew why it was there,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.600
 but they think that probably it dates from this particular siege by Frederick Barbarossa.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.240
 And it could be that when Barbarossa was attacking the city, one of the women at the

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.200
 walls did this and they decided to memorialise it. It could be because Milan asked for some

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.440
 money from the Empress Lea Bissa, who was in Constantinople at the time, and was extremely

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.040
 wealthy and really important Empress. And they wanted money from her to try and stop

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.680
 Frederick from attacking the city. But she said no. And so they did this picture of the woman

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.120
 as kind of an insult to her. But no one really knows why it was there. But then it got taken down

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.680
 by Cardinal Carlo Baremio in the 1500s because he wanted his eyes only to gaze on the stars of

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:50.160
 heaven. As opposed to the towering genitals and pubic hair over giant women, I suppose that's

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.360
 very not. He didn't include that part in the quote, but of course he would have said it.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.680
 Implied. Barbarossa, by the way, died because he didn't want to queue. He hated queuing.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.120
 That's like you. You hate queuing. I hate queuing because I always think at the front of it I'm

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.200
 going to have to pluck a fig from a mules vagina. But they were going to cross the river and he

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.200
 didn't want to queue. So he went across the river in a bit where you're not supposed to. He didn't

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.560
 want to go over the bridge or whatever. And he drowned. Oh, Barbie. I've read a bunch of theories

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.080
 about how he died, which I think that's the sort of most accepted version of it. But it is shrouded

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.040
 in a bit of mystery. And one of the most confusing things that I read was that it was a foot of

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.160
 water, which is very hard to drown in. Supposedly that could have happened because he was wearing

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.360
 such heavy armour that he was just pulled down. And there was also theories of fatigue

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.480
 that he had actually gone just for a wash and that he was so tired that the sun just kind of

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.680
 just he lost energy. But yeah, what a way to go. The Nazis thought he was still alive because there's

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:01.520
 like an ancient idea that he's like King Arthur and he lives in a mountain. And whenever Germany's

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.240
 about to fall, he'll come out and save everyone. And he can't leave at the moment because his

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.520
 beard is stuck in a table. So it's grown through the table and he doesn't have scissors, but he

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.320
 does have a boy who's loose, who he sends out to check how Germany's doing every so often. So he'll

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.920
 just wave him out and he'll come back. Is this real? It's not right. Well, according to the Nazis,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.160
 it was real. They would have been so disappointed if he came out and said, "Right, don't worry,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.920
 Germany's going to be safe. All I need is 250,000 mules. I need a large queuing system and I need

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.760
 a bunch of figs." But then of course, that's why they called, you'll know, and the Operation

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.200
 Barbarossa, which was the attack on the Soviet Union that was named after him because he was such a

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.040
 top guy according to the Nazis. And also another Operation Barbarossa where they killed all the

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.320
 intellectuals. That was also named after him. I can't believe the sentence was just said,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.520
 "Who believes us? The Nazis and Dan." That's not something I want to be informed about.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.560
 But can I just say that by saying who believes us, the Nazis and Dan, I'm saying that you're not a

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.280
 Nazi. Otherwise, I would say the Nazis, including Dan, who is also a Nazi. He just shows similar

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:22.320
 ideas and believes. Do you know what happened to Barbarossa after he died? Oh, what? He got

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.120
 his beard stuck in a table somewhere. He's still waiting for those shears from that poor pubic-haired

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.760
 woman. If you don't believe the theory of Dan and his Nazi buddies, then this is what happened to him.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.080
 So his body was apparently, they tried to preserve it in vinegar. Again, like a conker,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.880
 but it didn't work. And he was buried in three different places. This sounds like such a difficult

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.600
 confusing burial process, because his flesh was put in the Church of St Peter and Antioch,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.120
 his bones in the Cathedral of Tyre, and his heart and inner organs in another church that was in

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:02.320
 Tarsus. But that's a rough gig, having to separate the flesh from the bones. You wouldn't want the

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.080
 flesh, I think. Oh, no. I was just going to say, I think the Antioch's got a raw deal, because that's

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:12.960
 just a pile of grossness, isn't it? Speaking of flesh, Ficks have flesh. So shall we talk about

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:20.560
 Ficks? Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Why not? They're very, very important. Up to 70% of the animal life in

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.520
 the rainforest depends on fig trees, because they're so high in energy. They fruit loads of times

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.960
 every year. They grow really well in that kind of environment. And basically, they're eaten by

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.960
 lots of things, and then those things are eaten by lots of things, et cetera, et cetera. So without

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.440
 Ficks, we wouldn't have lots of other rainforest-y stuff. We wouldn't be here today.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.800
 They're amazing, aren't they? I'd never looked into Ficks before. So I read a quote from Charles

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.000
 Dickens, which he said, "Train up a fig tree in the way it should go, and when you are old, sit under

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.440
 the shade of it." And the idea is that you can push them into a territory, and that's the direction

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.840
 they'll grow, which is a thing that happens. A lot of people end up making bridges out of Ficks by

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.520
 positioning the direction, and they grow across these sort of river passes, and that's your fig

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.520
 bridge, which has just naturally grown. It's astonishing. The photos are amazing, if anyone

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.600
 wants to see. Yeah, it's mostly, it's in North India, isn't it? And it's basically suspension

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.800
 bridges, which massively pre-date our suspension bridges. And they're so long. I think the longest

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.760
 is over 50 meters long, and over 500 years old, because they do, yeah, they've got these incredibly

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.320
 strong roots that kind of, they weave around each other. And I think a lot of the bridges

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.840
 have a handrail. They will have trained some of the routes to grow into a handrail as well.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.040
 Amazing. It's a long wait for your bridge, though, isn't it, when you've commissioned a guy?

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.760
 Yeah, Frederick would not have had the patience to wait for that bridge.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.080
 So Ficks, yeah, they are, Ficks themselves are extraordinary as well in the way that they breed.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.720
 Every fig that you eat has at least one corpse in it, probably lots of corpses inside it.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.600
 Is that all of the figs that you eat, like the ones from the supermarket?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.960
 Oh, technically, probably every fig you eat doesn't have a corpse in it, because these

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.120
 days they're often done artificially. But if you're eating a fig that has been naturally

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.240
 propagated, it's got at least one corpse in it. Because the way they breed is an extraordinary

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.760
 way where every fig, and there are, I think there are more than 750 species of fig, has its own

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.920
 specific fig wasp. And the way the figs are pollinated is that a female wasp will burrow

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.200
 inside the fig. And weirdly, a fig is an inside out flower. So the flower is on the inside,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.720
 the bit that needs pollinating, burrows inside the fig, and then she lays her eggs, and then they

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.200
 spawn, and then they shag each other and fertilize each other. And then the males,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.400
 the male siblings, crawl up and make a little tunnel out of the fig so the females can escape.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.400
 And then the males die, sacrifice themselves, females fly off, and then they go and pollinate

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.800
 the next fig. Beautiful, a beautiful story. It's amazing. It's so cool.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:03.200
 You've kind of glossed over the incest bit, because a lot of the wasps that hatch are siblings.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.040
 Reasonably, I think, to gloss over that bit. I think all of them are siblings, are they not?

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.880
 No, they're not, because you can get several different wasps crawling inside a fig,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.440
 which will then die, but they will have laid their eggs around inside the little seed bits.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:24.240
 It's not frowned upon in the fig wasp world in the same way it is for us. And that's why there

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.320
 are lots of corpses often, is that the ladies kill each other, don't they? Because if more than one

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:35.200
 mother gets inside, then they have a duel to the death very often. To make sure that only one

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.880
 mother can lay her eggs. But then the poor mums of figs amputate their wings as they go in,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.800
 right? So the mothers can never leave. So they're doomed. And then tenor as well.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.000
 Have you heard of Mike Shanahan? Oh, yes. Only right.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.040
 Yeah, yeah. He came on our radio show a few years ago. He is amazing. He knows more about figs

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.800
 than anyone I've met knows about any other subjects, apart from perhaps

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.480
 Erica McAllister and flies. That's the only other person I can compare him to.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:12.160
 Yeah, or Dan Schreiber and Nazi sacred myths, far from those guys. So yeah, he's written this book

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.760
 called God's Wasps and Stranglers, which is unbelievable. I've only read a chapter of it,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.280
 but it is so interesting. If you're interested in figs, this is the

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.240
 book to read on the subject, basically. I actually found something that I think Mr.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.560
 Shanahan got wrong in his book. Yeah. Well, it was just we were talking about royals and we're

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.560
 talking about, so Barbarossa and the fig. I found a modern royal that was associated with the fig,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.520
 which is Queen Elizabeth II, who was asleep in a fig tree when she found out she became queen.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:51.120
 Excuse me. Sorry. Our current queen was asleep in a fig tree. She was famously in Africa, wasn't

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.120
 she, when she found out and it was a tree house, was it? I think exactly. No, didn't she crawled

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.400
 inside a fig? That's right. Unfortunately, she lost her wings and antennae on the way,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.040
 but a nearby aquari was able to pry her out. Yeah, but let's gloss over the incest for a second.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:14.240
 She, yeah, she was staying in a tree house and the story, the sentences that she went up the tree

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:20.640
 princess and she came down a queen. But I think that they actually found out quite,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.040
 quite some 40 kilometers away from the actual tree where they were staying because they were out and

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.960
 about and Philip delivered it in a sort of cabin. So it's not quite true that she was in a fig tree,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.160
 which would have been fantastic. Wow. That's so many preconceptions shattered there. Everyone at

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:46.640
 home has to adjust the whole belief system. Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.440
 Okay, my fact this week is that library books can set on fire if you put them in the microwave.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:58.080
 It's ruined many a dinner for me, certainly. All my cookbooks have gone up in flames.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.000
 That's when it says cookbook, it doesn't mean cook this book.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.000
 This is more of a public service announcement than a fact and it comes via a library in Michigan,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.520
 the Kent District Library, that's asking people to stop microwaving their books to prevent the

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.360
 spread of coronavirus. And that is because they contain a little chip in them, which is a kind

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.840
 of chip we've mentioned before called an RFID chip, which is what you get in your roaster card or in

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.160
 your contactless credit card or in your massive seal that you use to spy on the United States if

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.520
 you're a roaster. And they're in also in these library books and they're made of metal. And if

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.720
 you put metal in the microwave, a lot of the time it will set on fire and people have been doing this

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.920
 with library books and they've tweeted a load of pictures of very burnt library books where people

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:53.040
 have been trying to sterilize them. So these chips, you can't put them in the microwave.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.240
 Are they oven chips? Very nice. Very good. But no, don't put them in the oven either.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.600
 It's a very funny joke, Hannah, but this is not a funny matter.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.000
 It's not a laughing matter. Got it. I didn't know people have been doing this.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.360
 Yeah. Well, they don't fully know why they're doing it as well, as in the article that I read

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.440
 sort of suggested that they're a bit bemused. It's not as if there was a ginormous moment on

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.160
 the internet where everyone said, "Do this to clean it." So some things popped up on a site

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.920
 somewhere where enough people in Michigan have seen it and done it.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.680
 Yeah. I mean, there is a fair amount of logic behind it, isn't it? Microwaves, in theory,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.320
 could kill viruses, I suppose, and bacteria. Yeah, they heat things up really high temperatures.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.720
 But it's just that's not what they're made for. So don't put stuff in the microwave

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.680
 that's not made to go in a microwave. That's basically the tip.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.560
 Yeah. We think the best way to sterilize books is probably just to leave them for a couple of

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.760
 days, don't we? And most libraries just now leave them for two or three days.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:57.520
 Yeah. So COVID-19 will die after a certain number of days. I think in perfect lab conditions,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.680
 it's kind of over a week. But in real life, you're not living in a bell jar with a perfect

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.480
 amount of air and no UV light and stuff like that. So if you leave a library book for a few days,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.280
 it should sterilize by itself. They did discuss, I think, UV-like treatment,

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.960
 because people kept on saying, "Could you treat things with UV?" And it was pointed out as well

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.600
 as being quite carcinogenic. So you don't want it to be expensive. You would need to treat every

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.520
 single page of a book. So it would involve shining UV. Imagine getting more on peace back.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.720
 That's going to take two or three hours to UV treat. And it's not like you can just get a little

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:39.040
 UV torch and just shine it on and that'll kill it. You need a special, very high energy UV light

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:45.360
 in order to kill viruses. I was looking into sort of library scares and things like this.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.400
 And that was a really interesting account of worry about reading contagion. In fact,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.120
 there's a book about it called "Reading Contagion" because it was reported in 1911

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.280
 in a library journal that books seem well adapted for carrying smallpox, measles,

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.200
 scarlet fever, trochoma, ditheria, erycephalus, dysentery, typhoid, antipirkyloces.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.440
 Erycephalus, really? Erycephalus is in there, yeah.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.560
 That's it again. Erycephalus. Can I just explain that while we're laughing at that?

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.840
 So I'll probably cut this out. But in our live show last year, we had a spelling competition

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.920
 where Andy would say very unusual words and Dan would try and pronounce them,

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.480
 and then the audience would try and spell them. And Erycephalus was one of those,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.880
 and I'd never heard the word before that gig, and now it seems to come up virtually every week.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.680
 It's following us around. And I'm still saying it, Erycephalus.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.960
 And this was a fear because some readers would lick their fingers as they were turning pages.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.840
 So people got very worried about this. And there was one scientist who decided to experiment on it,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.240
 and he did it by taking public library books, cutting out the dirtiest bits,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.280
 I mean the physically dirtiest bits, not the rudest bits in the book,

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.520
 so that he'd have much wear. And then he would soak the pages in saline solution,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.360
 then he would spin that liquid with the sort of gloopy matter from the library books in it,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.320
 then he would inject that saline solution into guinea pigs.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.400
 And amazingly, all the guinea pigs died. All 40 of the guinea pigs he tried and undied.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.160
 That's evidence that they're catching germs in the book, rather than just that he just injected

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.880
 them with saline solution. Well, they did die of proper things, but it turns out,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.520
 I mean, if no one reads library books like that, no one does that with library books.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.360
 No, no, it would be an unusual thing to do. And also, they don't let you return them after you've

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.840
 whisked your washing machine, injected yourself with parts of them.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:41.040
 Well, do you know in Boston, the Boston Library, how they clean their books when they get returned?

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.480
 They have a mini book-sized car wash that they send the books through.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.040
 So it's got all these compartments, it's on a conveyor belt, and it can do 12 books a minute.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.440
 They don't use it on the extremely rare books, it's just for more modern books,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.240
 and it's a dusting system as they come through, spinning brush bars and so on.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.120
 You can watch videos of it online, and that's how they clean their books.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.040
 That's not to sterilize them or anything, is it? That's to get rid of all the dust and...

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.640
 Yes, but anything that's returned just for maintenance, basically.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.320
 But yes, not sterilization.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.760
 There was this scare about book germs, seemed to go on for a long time.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.600
 So it started in the 1870s, I think, and it lasted, as you say, well, until the 20th century.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.400
 And in 1907, there was a law in the UK passed that said if anyone was ill,

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.480
 you were not allowed to borrow a book from a library or return a book to a library.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:38.240
 And they tried, yeah, all sorts of experiments to figure out if they were spreading germs,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.120
 didn't they? They got lots of doctors involved. There was another one,

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.880
 as well as the guinea pig one, where they had monkeys drink milk off a germy book,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.680
 and then see if anything went wrong with them.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.960
 Again, difficult to return that monkey poo-drenched, milky book to the library afterwards.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.520
 I wonder if that law from 1907 still holds or not. Probably not the same law,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.880
 but I'm pretty sure there's a law that's around now that if you have plague, for instance,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.760
 and you get in a taxi by law, you have to announce it to the taxi driver before you go anywhere.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.720
 And I think it's the same public health act that those two things are from.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.720
 So I wonder if you have to announce to a librarian that you have a certain illness

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.600
 before you give your library books back. I don't know.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.760
 Because it was basically someone died, didn't they? There was a Nebraska librarian that died

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.360
 of tuberculosis, and that kind of made everyone think, oh, shit, there could be something in this.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.320
 But do you know the Spanish flu from 1918 or 1919?

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.280
 They thought that that could travel on telegraph wires because a load of telegraph operators got

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.640
 the disease at the same time. But obviously, it was because they were all in a room together.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.960
 There was also one where a load of bank tellers in a bank got sick at the same time,

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.400
 and they thought that maybe it had come with the money. So it was like,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.520
 they thought that whatever was coming into that building might have been what caused the illness

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.920
 rather than one of the people giving it to everyone else.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:12.160
 Hey, when we were on tour last year in America, we were in New York,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.480
 and I went to the New York Public Library, and it is stunning. Have you guys been

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.120
 when we were there or been any other time? It's really, it's just this majestic building,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.720
 and I saw that they had a lot of sort of relics of literature in there. So I started looking into

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.240
 it, see what else they have. And there's some great things about it. For example, there was one

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.360
 customer, as it were, someone who came every day and sat at the same desk for 52 years,

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:44.720
 and that was from 1923 to 1975. And it was the guy, it was a man called Norbert Pearlroth,

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.680
 who was the head researcher for Ripley's Believe It or Not. And he used to sit in that library

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.200
 every single day or most days at the same desk doing his research. And because the research

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.480
 available in that library is astonishing, they have the largest collection of restaurant menus

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:07.200
 in the world, for example. They have 40,000 restaurant menus, and it's used by chefs all

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.960
 over the world to sort of find old ideas for what they can do with their menus. But it's also used

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.000
 by biologists, marine biologists, to study fish populations to see if there was a spike in what

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.440
 was being eaten in the restaurants around New York at the time. Yeah, so it's used for sort of

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:30.000
 understanding ecology as well. There's one library designer who designed libraries like the Qatar

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.520
 National Library, which is incredible. And also the Seattle Library, which is quite famous,

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.720
 I think it has a spiral of ongoing books. So you walk from the bottom to the top and the library

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.720
 shelves never end. Anyway, this architect is called, he's a Dutch guy called Rem Coolhouse.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.160
 I think his name. It's Coolhouse. What a name for an architect. What a great name.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.320
 Hey, Coolhouse, Coolhouse. Yeah, I hope he just hears that all the time.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.040
 Just as this fact was about microwaving library books, I've got one thing on

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.200
 microwaves. I was looking for interesting microwave stories and things you shouldn't

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:14.400
 microwave. And in 2017, there was a man who had to be freed by firefighters after cementing

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:21.200
 his own head into a microwave. He was called Jay Swingler, 22, from the UK. He and his friends,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.920
 they mixed up seven bags of polyfiller and they poured it around his head inside the microwave,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.920
 which was protected by a plastic bag. It wasn't stupid. All right. And unaccountably,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.240
 then dried and they couldn't get him out. They tried for an hour and a half to get him out

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:43.040
 before calling the fire brigade. This was all for YouTube and the emergency services turned up

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.400
 and they sort of chipped the microwave apart. They destroyed the microwave and they then didn't

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.120
 find him very generously because they assessed that he had been at risk of dying. Sorry, I thought

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:59.040
 you said they didn't find him. Yeah. They just keep chipping and chipping. He must be in here somewhere.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:05.600
 And I was later interviewed and he said he hadn't wasted the emergency services time

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.280
 because they saved my life, whereas I say that he did waste their time.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:16.000
 There was an interview with Robert Pattinson earlier this year in April with GQ,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.520
 which I assume they must have done over Zoom or over Skype or something because

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:25.520
 he's in a house which appears to be a like a hired house rather than his own.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.720
 And while they're interviewing him, he's making some pasta in the microwave.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:38.160
 Now, he has come up with a new way of making pasta. It's a bit like a pop tart,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.880
 but you make your pasta and then you put a load of American cheese and sugar

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.560
 with it and then you cover it in cornflakes. And apparently it's the most delicious thing

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.720
 that Robert Pattinson has ever eaten. So he's making this while he's being interviewed by GQ

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:01.040
 and they're asking him about it and he puts all the cornflakes on the outside and then he puts

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:08.640
 it all in tinfoil and he says, "Are you allowed to put tinfoil in the oven?" And the GQ guy says,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.720
 "Yeah, you can put tinfoil in the oven. You're just not allowed to put it in a microwave."

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.760
 And then Robert Pattinson goes, "I think this is an oven." And so then he puts his

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.680
 like pop tart thing in what he thinks is an oven, but which is actually a microwave.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.680
 And they're still doing the interview at this point. And then about a couple of minutes later,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.280
 the whole thing explodes. The microwave explodes and all the electricity goes off

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:39.040
 in Robert Pattinson's house. And I've got to say, this is the best interview I've ever read

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.600
 in my whole life. And has anyone checked on Robert Pattinson recently because I'm a bit worried

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.440
 about it? My brother-in-law, Charbell, works in hotels and he once got a call up to a room

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.800
 because the guy who was up there had ordered room service, had his food, but clearly hadn't

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.160
 finished eating it. So he called Charbell up, Charbell entered the room and he said,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.560
 "I need your help. I was trying to reheat my food, but I can't get it back out of the microwave."

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:13.680
 But what he'd done was put it into the safe. And he'd locked his Bolognese or whatever he had.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:20.800
 That's fine. So the code was probably three minutes or whatever. That's so funny.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that one of the kings of Leon

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.120
 was called Alfonso the slobberer. The kings of where they're still going. What do you mean was?

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.080
 Yeah. Well, I'm glad you pointed that out. Obviously kings of Leon, great band, three of them,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.600
 Jared and two others. None of them is called Alfonso the slobberer. It turns out that before

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.560
 the band even thought about forming, there was a kingdom called Leon. And that's what they're

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.400
 very cleverly referring to in their name. And Leon is in the... It was a huge chunk of the

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.720
 Iberian Peninsula, so Northwest Spain and what is now Portugal too. And it had a king in the

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:11.600
 mid to late 12th century called Alfonso. And Alfonso was an angry guy. He would have fits of

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.720
 rage that made him foam at the mouth. And that's why he got his charming nickname Alfonso the slobberer.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:24.160
 Wow. We do know a bit more about him. We know he married his cousin twice, not the same cousin,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.360
 different cousins. So he had a type. And annulled them because of it, right? It's so bizarre that

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.840
 you can make that mistake. Like he marries a cousin and then he had, I think, three children with the

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.640
 first one. And then suddenly it was like, oh, damn it, it's incest, not allowed to do it. So it had

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.360
 to be annulled. And then did the same thing again, had five children with the next one. Annulled again.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.800
 I think the second one might have been his first cousin once removed.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.240
 Yes, you're right. It was. But I didn't know this. It's so interesting. I had no idea how strict the

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.720
 rules on incest actually were at certain points in history. Well, we usually gloss over the incest on

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:05.760
 this podcast. So the church had banned marriages for relations up to seven degrees removed,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.000
 which meant that you had to count seven generations back. And it was illegal to,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.240
 I mean, who on earth knows seven generations back? It meant it was illegal to marry anyone closer than

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.480
 your seventh cousin. So it must have been an enormous hassle. If you fancy someone,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.200
 you had to really trace, you had to go on, who do you think you are?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:32.400
 Alfonso also formed the Cortes de Leon in 1188, which brought together all the nobles in that

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.400
 area. And some people say it was the first parliament in the history of Western Europe.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.680
 So that's one good thing you might have done. There were quite a few kings of Leon

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.640
 over the years. Henry the impotent, he was one. He was supposedly impotent as a result of a curse

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:56.240
 by the Bishop of Toledo. The curse was called frigidi et malificiati. And it's quite a common curse

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.600
 that you would do in medieval times where you would like make someone impotent just by reading

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:08.400
 out this curse. Although he did have a daughter, so it might not have worked. Although the argument

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.800
 was, if he'd had this curse, it can't possibly be his daughter. So he must have

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.280
 been someone else's child. It's always around it. Maybe the curse wears off after a while.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.720
 Alfonso could have done with a bit of that curse. I mean, he had eight children within his two

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.040
 marriages and then he had another 10 children outside his marriages. There you go. He needed

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:34.000
 a bit of frigidiati et malificiati or whatever. I read another guy, another king, who was in

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.080
 the 10th century called DeSancho. Sancho the fat, he was known as. Yes, he was also King of Leon,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:46.800
 wasn't he? Yeah, King of Leon. Interesting story. He basically was said to have been so overweight

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.920
 that it made it hard for him to walk. He couldn't ride a horse. He couldn't pick up a sword.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:58.880
 And so he lost the throne as a result. He was disposed as a sort of weak king. And his grandmother

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:05.600
 took him to a doctor. And the story goes is that the doctor sewed his lips shut, except for a tiny

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.120
 little hole to put a straw through to give him what was effectively the first weight loss diet,

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.960
 which was you can only drink stuff through this straw as your food. And he eventually lost half

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.360
 of his weight to the point where he could ride a horse again and pick up a sword. And he regained

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:31.600
 the throne because he came back as a strong king. He was immediately deposed because of his speech

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:40.160
 impediment. At least he wasn't slubbering with that little hole. He did have a serious problem

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.200
 though. I think the contemporary accounts say that he was, well, in today's measurements,

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:51.920
 is 38 stone, which is too heavy. No horse can take that. And I quite like that the guy,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:58.240
 it was just such a testament to what a mixed place Europe was then that his grandmother walked him,

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.840
 sort of wobbled him along to a Jewish doctor, this guy was, who worked for the Muslim ruler,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:09.040
 Abdul Rahman. And obviously he was Christian. It was such a melting pot. And yeah, cured him.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.000
 And it's good because he replaced or don't know the wicked. It sounds like if it's between the fat

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.440
 and the wicked, you'd probably go the fat, wouldn't you? Yeah, unless it was like a really kind

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:27.520
 of positive thing like wicked. Yeah. And also, I suppose Sancho could be fat with a pH. He might

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.040
 have just dropped some heavy beats. Yeah, true. They were all DJs, the Kings of Leon. Oh yeah,

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:38.480
 if they were all DJs, then what about Bermuda the Goutie? I don't want to watch his set.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.760
 There were quite a few Queens of Leon, as well as the Kings of Leon. Joanna the Mad,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:51.520
 she was one of them. She was married to Philip the Handsome. She really liked Philip the Handsome,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:58.160
 but unfortunately he died. And then she kind of lived with his coffin and would open up the coffin

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.360
 every now and then so she could kiss his feet. That's why they called her Joanna the Mad.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.680
 Actually, Alfonso the Slobberer wanted to leave his kingdom to his two daughters,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.160
 so Sancho and Dolce. He left officially after he died. He left it to his two daughters,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.480
 but basically the people of Leon were not really up for female leaders. And the daughters, and I

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.880
 think I would have done exactly the same thing, weren't really up for having a big fight about it.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.720
 So basically they met with their half-brother's mum. So these three women met and they negotiated,

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.320
 look, we'll give this chap the kingdom and can we just have a bunch of castles and some money?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.600
 And it was called the Pax of the Mothers. They just went and lived the life of Riley somewhere.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.760
 Yeah, it's a good call. Because being a king or queen in those days...

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.960
 Very stressful. And the nicknames alone would have done you in.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:53.200
 You got some more nicknames? Yeah, I found a few. I strayed off territory a bit away from

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.960
 Leon and I just went to other regal nicknames. So there was a Byzantine emperor who was called

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:06.320
 Constantine the name of shit. Copra Nimos is what that was at the time. And it's allegedly because

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.720
 he shat in the font during his baptism. Oh, yeah. I know. So it's kind of a clever joke, actually.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.680
 It is a bit like someone at school, like being on a school trip and having to shit in a bag

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.560
 and being called shitbag for the rest of school. For the rest of the rain, they're rain as emperor

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.600
 as well. Terrible. Yeah. But that would have happened when they were like less than one or

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.200
 just for a baptism. I'm not saying it's fair, Dan. I'm not saying it's fair, but I am saying it's

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.000
 funny. James II of England was known as James the bishop or something. Was he by the Irish?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.040
 I think the Irish called him that or something. Yeah, because they wanted him to hang around and

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.120
 fight for them. And then he fled to France, quite famously disappeared and just gave up the throne

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.360
 to William of Orange. So they were like, well, you're a piece of shit. That's how he went down.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.680
 I have a quick study about nicknames in general. Oh, yeah. So there was a study by Queen Mary

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.960
 University and they were looking into nicknames and online dating and how you can make yourself

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.000
 most effective, which I know is not of any special interest to any of you three. Well,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.560
 I just need to know, on my Tinder profile, should I call myself James the slobber or not?

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.680
 Right, exactly. So they studied loads of different research papers. They studied

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.600
 like lots and lots and lots of previous papers on online attraction. And it's quite funny, just

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.200
 the things they found out or the headline results were quite obvious, seeming things.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.320
 So they found that nicknames with negative connotations like little or bug are linked with

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:38.320
 inferiority. So you shouldn't pick them. And they said playful screen names were good. So

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:45.040
 the name fun to be with, that's the number two. And then the letter B was universally attractive,

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:51.200
 they claimed. They also said pick something near the beginning of the alphabet. Because if like

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.120
 all sensible people, you arrange your dating profiles you're looking at in alphabetical order,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.760
 you don't want to be lost in the bottom of the pile.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.080
 So does that mean you should call yourself Andy?

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:11.120
 Like in the Edinburgh Festival programme. You always have like the A, A, A, A company show.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.320
 Exactly like that.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.120
 Cause they're either gouty, not getting any dates.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.840
 I've just got a few more nicknames I found of rulers throughout history.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.040
 So there's, you know, so many, Manuel the sausage maker, Wilfred the hairy,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.600
 Half Dan the bad entertainer. That's not a good one.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.640
 No, come on.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.400
 Yeah. King Dan.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.160
 Actually is your online nickname, isn't it?

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:40.160
 So yeah, he was from Norway. He was the son of Einstein the fart.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:47.680
 And yeah, so he was very generous paying his soldiers, but he was very bad in providing food

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.200
 and entertainment for them.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.840
 You buy your own food and entertainment if you've got a good salary.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.840
 Borrowed Half Dan.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:01.600
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that's my fact.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.760
 My fact this week is that there is a Chinese poem made up of 92 characters

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:12.400
 in which every word is pronounced sh. The poem is called the lion eating poet in the Stonedan,

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.280
 or sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.640
 Sure.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:23.360
 Now, for any Mandarin listeners out there, just to quickly say, I grew up in Hong Kong

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.120
 and I was taught Mandarin throughout school, but I have a foreign Mandarin accent.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.680
 So apologies if I butchered that slightly. It's a very hard sentence to say.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.360
 The poem is even harder to say.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.080
 Dan, that is an easy sentence to say.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.520
 Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.800
 Charlie is the one that we could know.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.880
 No, because you're saying it with one tone.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.600
 And it's tonally.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.520
 You just sound like a librarian there, James.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.520
 Wait a minute. So when you said it, it sounded to me, to my ears,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.200
 it sounded like they were all the same tone.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.800
 Sure, sure.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.640
 So sure is neutral.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.560
 Sure is the downward.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.760
 Sure is the upward and sure.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.040
 So those are four different sure's that you could be saying as a result,

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.280
 which is why it's it's if you say this poem out loud,

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.200
 even the best Chinese speaker saying it out loud,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.560
 no one will know what they're saying because despite the four tones,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.440
 you can still have about 15 different words which have that tone of sure,

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.840
 for let's say going on the upward sound.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.760
 So it is totally bemusing to listen to it out loud.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.000
 Isn't it true?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.520
 It works in character form.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.160
 Isn't it true?

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.000
 I might be wrong about this because obviously,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.440
 I don't know anything about this language,

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.760
 but is it not true that in classic Chinese, it works way better?

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.280
 And in modern Mandarin and modern Cantonese,

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.640
 it really doesn't work at all.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.920
 Yeah, that's right.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.200
 Yeah, but the cool thing about classical Chinese that I never knew this is that it's

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.080
 quite similar to modern standard Arabic today,

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.960
 but the way classical Chinese was used from about sort of the eighth century

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.400
 until about 100 years ago.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.480
 It was that it was a way to communicate between people who didn't speak the same language.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.240
 So the like China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.040
 all these areas in East Asia spoke different languages,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.440
 but they all wrote in classical Chinese.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.000
 And so they have this thing called brush talk,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.560
 where if you met a foreigner, you couldn't chat to them,

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.000
 but you could pass notes.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 And so you'd meet a foreigner and you'd do brush talk.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.320
 So I mean, it must have been extremely arduous,

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.440
 taken a lot longer,

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.560
 but you could just have a secret passing notes in class chat.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:20.960
 Wow.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.080
 That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.360
 It's like when you go to an airport,

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.160
 and the word for parking is the same in every country.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.680
 It's like if everything was like that.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.320
 Exactly.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.160
 Could I quickly give a bit of a brief explanation about this poem

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.600
 and the author of it?

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.240
 Because this was written by a man called Yuan Run Chao,

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.960
 and he's an incredible guy.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.480
 He wrote it in the 1930s,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.000
 and it was done as a sort of linguistic demonstration

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.320
 to show that you could manage to stretch out this one word into a 92-word poem.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.560
 He was an amazing character.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.880
 He moved over to America to study mathematics and physics at Cornell University,

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.280
 and he eventually did philosophy at Harvard.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.120
 And he became a huge influence

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.960
 within the world of Chinese language for the Western world.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.800
 So when he was back in China,

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.080
 if Bertrand Russell came over,

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.920
 he would act as his interpreter.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.040
 Back in America,

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.360
 he recorded the standard Chinese pronunciation

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.040
 gramophone records that people would get

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.280
 that would be distributed nationally.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.000
 So people would understand a unified pronunciation

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.600
 of Chinese and America.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.920
 He translated Alice in Wonderland.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.960
 He wrote pop hits back in China.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.120
 I mean, he was this incredible character.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.040
 Have you heard his pop hit, by the way?

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.320
 I haven't, actually.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.560
 And weirdly, he wrote the music, not the lyrics for it.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.160
 It's not exactly the Kings of Leon.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:48.080
 Yeah, 1930s Chinese pop is not what you'd expect.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.760
 Very repetitive lyrics, isn't it?

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.240
 It's like the too unlimited of its time.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.160
 His wife was amazing.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.960
 His wife invented stir fry, which is quite amazing.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.920
 She wrote a book called How to Cook and Eat in Chinese

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.440
 in 1946, which went through loads and loads of editions.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.880
 What a specific title for a book.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.080
 It must have had a very quick sell-by date.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:14.720
 It was.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.200
 It was like the book of the year 2019.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.640
 No one bought it after that year.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.160
 But she wrote a load of techniques

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.960
 that they used to cook in China.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.040
 But her terms are now used quite commonly in America.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.440
 So the term stir fry was invented by her

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.680
 and her daughter as well, who did a lot of the translation.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.280
 What's quite interesting and ironic

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.320
 is that people use this poem as an argument

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.640
 against writing the Chinese language in the Roman characters.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.040
 Because it's way more complicated than that.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.000
 And if you start putting them into Latin characters,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.480
 then you just can't get the nuances.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.360
 But of course, this guy, Yuan Ren Chao,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.680
 he was very much pro translation.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.040
 He was a translator.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.760
 So it's quite ironic that that has been used as an argument.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.320
 But it is true that it's so hard to write down in Roman script.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.200
 So there was actually someone who wrote beneath a YouTube video

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.600
 who was Taiwanese and I think was talking about

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.680
 language spoken in Fujian.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.840
 And said that the sentence grandfather hit his head

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.640
 on a metal tin and grandfather felt giddy

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.240
 is the word gong written eight times basically.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.920
 So like gong is grandfather and then various other...

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.800
 Wow.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.680
 So much fun word play.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.560
 That's such a common word.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.480
 Wait, which language did you say that was, Anna?

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.680
 That was in Taiwanese and in Fujian.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.280
 And I spent about an hour this morning trying to practice

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.520
 the sentence, "The horse is slow, mother tells off the horse."

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.280
 Is it all ma's?

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.960
 Yeah, I think it's like

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.320
 ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.760
 How does that sound, Dan?

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.880
 Nonsense.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.760
 Well, it would sound nonsense anyway, as is the point of the sure, sure, sure.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.320
 Like it's impossible to grip onto.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.280
 You need to see that written in order to go,

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.160
 "Okay, ma, mother, ma, horse, ma, slow."

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.880
 That's where that would make sense for you.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.920
 That's why it's so hard.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.560
 Have you heard of the Hmong language of Vietnam?

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.600
 Yeah.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.760
 That's got eight tones in it.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.880
 Whoa.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.600
 Yeah.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.120
 So the word "Paul," depending on what you're putting,

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.720
 where you're putting the tone,

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.720
 can mean either "female," "throw," "thorn," "pancreas,"

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.880
 "to see," or "paternal grandmother."

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.120
 So if you want to say,

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.440
 "I can see my paternal grandmother's pancreas."

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:37.840
 They are brilliant, these little kind of oddities, though, aren't they?

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.720
 Because most languages around the world have something like that.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.400
 So in the Ojibwe language of Canada,

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.680
 which was one of the biggest First Nations languages,

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.960
 there's a phrase, "Gada, na, na, na, ah, na, na,"

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.000
 which means we should really go and get Anna, shouldn't we?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.560
 No.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.200
 Yeah.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.120
 So I think we might start using that one

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.480
 whenever Anna's late to the hotel lobby before we start.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.680
 Can you say it again, James?

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.200
 It's "Gada, na, na, na, ah, na, na."

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.160
 I'm going to start singing that at the end of "Hey Jude."

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.160
 Every time someone sings "Hey Jude,"

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.800
 that turns up going, "What? What? I'm here."

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.160
 The drummer of the band, Emperor Yes, that plays our theme tune,

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.280
 he had a song that he put out called "Aneek,"

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.280
 who was someone who used to do our sound checks

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.120
 for a fish and record our sound.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.560
 He named the song "Aneek" after "Aneek,"

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.600
 and it got picked up by Apple and was used in an advert in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.520
 It was a very popular song,

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.520
 and what happens a lot over there is that people use their phone and Shazam

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.360
 to find out the name of the song,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.200
 and so they knew that was going to happen.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.480
 And after it had been sold,

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.200
 it had been pointed out that the name "Aneek"

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.600
 in Arabic translates as "I fuck,"

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:59.600
 and Apple was suddenly pushing a big song of their advert with "I fuck."

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.800
 So Adam had to desperately change the title of the song

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.960
 so that by the time it went out and Shazam'd,

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.120
 it was a different song and he managed to do it

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.360
 within the space of 24 hours before it went out.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.400
 Wow.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.760
 But yeah, he almost caused international chaos with it.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:20.320
 Okay, that's it.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.280
 That's all of our facts.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.720
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.320
