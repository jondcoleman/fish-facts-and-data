00:00:00,00:00:07,"Hi everyone, it is New Year's Eve if you're hearing this on the day that this episode"
00:00:07,00:00:16,"drops. Wow, 2021, what a year, eh? Phew, dear goodness. Well, we got through it, we got"
00:00:16,00:00:21,through it and 2022 I'm sure will hold lots and lots of exciting things for all of you
00:00:21,00:00:29,"people and all of us as well. So what do we have for you this week? Well, we have a compilation"
00:00:29,00:00:35,"of outtakes from our latest tour. We like to think that we are the pros, we've been doing"
00:00:35,00:00:41,"this for 400 episodes, we've been doing it for almost 8 years, surely everything is so"
00:00:41,00:00:46,"slick that nothing ever goes wrong. Well, if you've actually been to one of our shows,"
00:00:46,00:00:51,you know that things quite often do go wrong. Sometimes we say things that we can't possibly
00:00:51,00:00:56,"put out on the podcast, unless I very heavily censor them. Sometimes it's a really good"
00:00:56,00:01:01,fact and it just doesn't quite fit in the final edit. Sometimes the set just falls to pieces
00:01:01,00:01:05,all around us and so what I've done is I've collected all those things together and put
00:01:05,00:01:13,them into a compilation of all the craziest bits from the last few months of touring fish.
00:01:13,00:01:18,Really hope you enjoy it. We'll be back with a normal episode for the first show of 2022
00:01:18,00:01:35,for the time being. Hope you enjoy the show on with the podcast.
00:01:35,00:01:41,Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. My name is Dan Schreiber
00:01:41,00:01:46,"and I'm sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Hawken and"
00:01:46,00:01:51,once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last
00:01:51,00:01:57,seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that
00:01:57,00:02:04,is James. Did you not bring your microphone? Do you know I'm so relieved about that because
00:02:04,00:02:09,"I forgot to bring my drinks on. All right, you two go off cover. Should we start again?"
00:02:09,00:02:16,"So it turns out unbelievable. Listeners at home, James forgot to bring his microphone"
00:02:16,00:02:21,"and I forgot to bring her drink. I can't work out which is worse. I'm here, Dan. Thank"
00:02:21,00:02:27,"you, Andy. Dan, I don't think anyone's noticed. I think if we go straight to me, Dan, though."
00:02:27,00:02:32,It's hilarious you didn't bring your microphone. I think what's funny is it was only when I
00:02:32,00:02:37,was speaking. I started speaking and my voice is a lot quieter than normal. And you started
00:02:37,00:02:44,"looking at your empty hands and you were like, what? Amazing. Absolute pros. Eight years"
00:02:44,00:02:51,"you've been doing this. Okay, it's time for fact number one and that is James. Okay,"
00:02:51,00:03:00,my fact this week. It's gonna make no sense in the edit when this show goes out. His real
00:03:00,00:03:07,"name is not Caravaggio. Yeah, he's actually called Michelangelo, but that name was taken."
00:03:07,00:03:14,"So he had to resort to where he was born. So Leonardo da Vinci, that's not his surname,"
00:03:14,00:03:20,"it's of Vinci. That's where he's born. Same thing with Caravaggio. Michelangelo, Merisida,"
00:03:20,00:03:25,"Caravaggio, of Caravaggio. So that just became his nickname. And do you know why he was called"
00:03:25,00:03:32,"Michelangelo? No. It's because he was born, we think probably, on the 29th of December,"
00:03:32,00:03:39,"which was the feast of the Archangel, Michel, which is also my birthday. Wait, your birthday"
00:03:39,00:03:43,"is not 29th of December. September. Oh, did you say September? You said December. Yeah."
00:03:43,00:03:53,"But by the time the edit goes out, I won't have done. Is there a reason why clownfish"
00:03:53,00:03:58,are so good to experiment on? Do we know? I'm actually not sure. We probably mentioned
00:03:58,00:04:02,"it at some point in our 300 podcast, so you should go back and check. Just kind of funny."
00:04:02,00:04:07,"Yeah. Good looking. Yeah. Photogenic. You can fit a load of clownfish in the same car,"
00:04:07,00:04:12,which is useful for research purposes. That's something. And do you know why he was called
00:04:12,00:04:20,"Michelangelo? No. It's because he was born, we think probably, on the 29th of September,"
00:04:20,00:04:27,"which was the feast of the Archangel, Michel, which is also my birthday. I was looking into,"
00:04:27,00:04:30,I was just looking into names of dentists. There's always that thing that if you're called
00:04:30,00:04:35,"Dennis, you're going to be a dentist, you know, more. There's the idea, and there's been"
00:04:35,00:04:40,"lots of studies to show that Dennis or Denise, you'll be a dentist. And so I found a few"
00:04:40,00:04:46,names where it does feel like you're being pulled into it. So Rachel B. Pullin was one.
00:04:46,00:04:55,"And then in Rutland, there is a dentistry that are called Dennis and Deneth Stental Practice."
00:04:55,00:05:06,What? You said that again. Denteth and denteth. Denteth. D-E-N-T-I-T-H and denteth. But when
00:05:06,00:05:12,"they get their braces off, they're going to have to change the name, aren't they? So good."
00:05:12,00:05:19,"In the 1960s, some women were taught how to breastfeed using sock puppets. Sock puppets."
00:05:19,00:05:25,"So they would, I mean, we're just doing the sock puppet symbol. Yeah. Well, there were"
00:05:25,00:05:30,knitted nitted breasts as well. So there were knitted sock puppets and then knitted breasts
00:05:30,00:05:34,to kind of demonstrate how the baby latches on. So the sock puppet would suck on the knitted
00:05:34,00:05:39,"breast as opposed to the real breast? Yes, that's right. Like a weird punch and judy show?"
00:05:39,00:05:42,"It's a very weird punch and judy show. In fact, I told one of our colleagues this in"
00:05:42,00:05:46,"the office the other day, and immediately he said punch and booby. Yeah."
00:05:46,00:05:53,"There was also an advent Christmas clock, wasn't there, which had 24 hands on it. And"
00:05:53,00:06:00,so you would move the hand. 24 hands? Yeah. I'm sorry. 24 spots for the hand to move
00:06:00,00:06:04,on. And so you would move it each day. And that was a primitive version of the eye talent.
00:06:04,00:06:08,Your clock will be so cheap. You just want 24 hands on a clock. Just look at the relevant
00:06:08,00:06:11,hand to know what the time is.
00:06:11,00:06:17,Do you remember the time when they asked if they could put our podcast on British Airways
00:06:17,00:06:22,"flights? Yes. Oh, yeah. And they said, well, can you go back through your first 100 episodes"
00:06:22,00:06:26,and remove? We don't want anyone's where you mentioned plane crashes. And it turned out
00:06:26,00:06:31,we mentioned it in every single episode. Yeah. It was bizarre. It was truly bizarre.
00:06:31,00:06:37,"It was so weird. Yeah. It was weird. We've already done it in this one. Yeah. Do you know,"
00:06:37,00:06:44,"can I just say a non-orgasm thing to do with llamas, which is that llamas, there was a"
00:06:44,00:06:50,"photo that was taken in the 20s, which led to an international incident where Tibetan"
00:06:50,00:06:56,"monks, or monks, I think they were Tibet, were flown over. And there was a photo taken"
00:06:56,00:07:02,"of them with llamas. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And this calls, so a llama with a llama was the idea"
00:07:02,00:07:06,"that the British did when they brought them over. And it led to big problems because,"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"so this was part of publicity for a 1924 film, which was filmed by a guy called Captain John"
00:07:11,00:07:16,"Noll, who provided, for me, the greatest fact that I think I've ever brought to this show,"
00:07:16,00:07:22,which is he said that it's easier to escape a female yeti than it is a male yeti because
00:07:22,00:07:26,"female yetis have such long dangling boobs that before they can chase you, they need to"
00:07:26,00:07:30,"chuck them over the shoulders and tie them like a scarf. Otherwise, they might trip on"
00:07:30,00:07:35,"them as they're chasing you. And then the time it takes them to do all that, you can"
00:07:35,00:07:40,escape. So that's Captain John Noll who said that. And he was responsible for bringing
00:07:40,00:07:47,the llamas to meet the lamas. Yeah. So he was the official filmmaker on the Mallory Expedition.
00:07:47,00:07:51,"He's the one who filmed the whole thing. He made it into a big movie. And it was a, you"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"know, a Hollywood nominated movie. And it's still to the say, it's a classic. But the"
00:07:55,00:08:00,publicity that he did is what actually banned any more attempts from happening on Mount
00:08:00,00:08:05,"Everest, because the authorities were so furious about the way that the religion was parodied"
00:08:05,00:08:10,by having llamas next to llama. We weren't allowed to go back to Mount Everest for ages.
00:08:10,00:08:16,That's interesting. That happened when I tried to put some bananas in some pajamas. It's
00:08:16,00:08:21,also happened to me. Who are you? Who's the parodying? The bananas or the pajamas? I don't
00:08:21,00:08:26,know. I haven't got that far. I'm working on the joke. Here's one really weird thing.
00:08:26,00:08:30,I don't know if we can do this in the UK. I unfortunately found this way too late in
00:08:30,00:08:34,"the day to research this a bit more. But in other countries, this definitely happens."
00:08:34,00:08:39,"So imagine you're at home, right? Everyone and the bins have just gone out. And suddenly"
00:08:39,00:08:45,you realize that you accidentally threw away or must have lost something really precious
00:08:45,00:08:50,"in the trash. Yeah. Right. So what you can do and the story that I was reading about,"
00:08:50,00:08:55,"it's in a bunch of places, but in Montgomery County in Maryland, you can call up your local"
00:08:55,00:09:01,"trash place. And if the truck is still doing its rounds, they will separate the truck into"
00:09:01,00:09:06,"a different area when it gets the dump, dump the entire contents out and you can come in"
00:09:06,00:09:12,to go through all the trash to find your lost thing. So it's a 10 ton pile of trash basically.
00:09:12,00:09:19,They let you go in it. What would it have to be? Do you think? A wedding ring or a passport
00:09:19,00:09:24,"if you were leaving the country? Like things, a child can throw away a thing, right? Yeah."
00:09:24,00:09:27,"A child's teddy. If I lost one of my teddies in the bin when I was four, my parents would"
00:09:27,00:09:33,"have both been in that rubbish dump for hours looking for it. Yeah. And on the FAQs, when"
00:09:33,00:09:37,"you read their site for doing it, it says time available to work. And it says, we must"
00:09:37,00:09:42,"clear out all trash that comes into the transfer station before our day is over. Therefore,"
00:09:42,00:09:50,we can give you a limited time of 30 minutes. We've had a few kind of TV formats that we've
00:09:50,00:09:55,"been pitching in the past. This is a TV show, waiting to be made, isn't it? 30 minutes."
00:09:55,00:10:00,"You're going to find your teddy in a whole bunch of shit. Yeah. And they sort of go,"
00:10:00,00:10:06,you might just notice your own personal black bag that you threw away amongst the 10 tons
00:10:06,00:10:10,"of black bags. Yeah, if you label them. Yeah, of course. I mean, don't you label yours?"
00:10:10,00:10:17,"You're so labelled in, don't you? We've got to move on in a second. I've just got one"
00:10:17,00:10:21,more thing. I was looking into the telescopes and I was looking into numbers behind them.
00:10:21,00:10:27,"So this is a bit of a tangent. There's a number called Graham's number, which is so big that"
00:10:27,00:10:31,"if you could imagine it properly, it would cause a black hole to form inside your head."
00:10:31,00:10:37,"What? No. Yes. That's just not what I understand about black holes. That's bullshit. No, it's"
00:10:37,00:10:42,"not bullshit. It's real. Black holes form, right, when there's an enormously heavy mass,"
00:10:42,00:10:47,"huge mass in a very small space, right? Yeah. This number is so big, there are so many digits"
00:10:47,00:10:52,"in it, that if the smallest measurable space, a plank volume, was a digit and you had the"
00:10:52,00:10:57,"entire observable universe to write with, you couldn't write it. Therefore, if in your"
00:10:57,00:11:03,"head you could conceptualise every single one of those digits, a black hole would form"
00:11:03,00:11:09,in your head and destroy you. Wow. I've received an unexpectedly small amount of pushback on
00:11:09,00:11:16,that fact. I'm thrilled. I'm not surprised you didn't get that job on countdown. I'm
00:11:16,00:11:20,sure you guys know there's a plant that lives entirely off bat poo. We only realised this
00:11:20,00:11:25,recently. It's a pitcher plant. You know those plants that are carnivorous and they're like
00:11:25,00:11:29,"champagne glasses, champagne flutes, and then insects fall into them and they eat them,"
00:11:29,00:11:33,but it was really confusing researchers because they weren't trapping any insects. They didn't
00:11:33,00:11:37,"have enough of the liquid in them. They were too big, but what researchers kept finding"
00:11:37,00:11:43,"was that whole families of bats were nesting inside them. Turns out they've adapted, they've"
00:11:43,00:11:48,"evolved to just become the home for hardwicks, woolly bats. This is in Borneo and they eat"
00:11:48,00:11:55,their guano. They attract them by basically they're shaped like this parabolic dish. Bats
00:11:55,00:11:59,give out their sonar and then these pitcher plants are the only ones that are shaped perfectly
00:11:59,00:12:03,"to reflect that sonar straight back to the bat. That's amazing. Then they're like, ""Okay,"
00:12:03,00:12:07,"cool. That's the core of my home."" Then they go to this plant, they go and live inside"
00:12:07,00:12:13,"it, poo all over it, plant eats it up, and Bob's your uncle. That's amazing. There's"
00:12:13,00:12:17,"another one that's in Borneo, I think, because I remember seeing it. It's like four, is"
00:12:17,00:12:20,it shrews as well? They do kind of a similar thing. They sit on the edge and then they
00:12:20,00:12:27,"kind of lick the pollen, but it's a laxative, so it makes them shit everywhere. The plant"
00:12:27,00:12:32,"just goes, ""Oh, yum."" That's so amazing. It feels like the plant is a bit sentient"
00:12:32,00:12:38,"there, right? I know you're going to say no, but okay, let's move on."
00:12:38,00:12:42,"There is a tunnel under Mont Blanc now. Oh, yeah. Is there? Yes."
00:12:42,00:12:49,Like a rail tunnel or a rail tunnel? It's a tunnel. It doesn't matter whether it's
00:12:49,00:12:56,"old nuts. No, it's a road tunnel. It's a road tunnel, isn't it? Thanks, guys. Okay. Literally"
00:12:56,00:13:02,"everyone in our audience knew that. Yeah, yeah. It's a road tunnel and it was started"
00:13:02,00:13:10,"by one man who just decided to make a tunnel under Mont Blanc, freelance off his own bat."
00:13:10,00:13:16,"He was a count called Dino Lora Tatina. He was Italian and when he was growing up, getting"
00:13:16,00:13:22,between France and Italy around Mont Blanc is a massive pain and it took about 18 hours
00:13:22,00:13:27,to make the journey and he called it an accursed mountain. He grew up in the shadow of it and
00:13:27,00:13:31,"he became a wealthy businessman. He owned a wool factory and he said, ""I'm going to do"
00:13:31,00:13:36,"something about Mont Blanc."" He just started digging with no permission from anyone. He"
00:13:36,00:13:42,"got 250 meters into the granite on the Italian side and the authorities eventually said,"
00:13:42,00:13:48,"""What are you doing?"" They stopped him and then it's fine. He was stopped, but by that"
00:13:48,00:13:52,point the plans were in progress and France and Italy eventually agreed. They were really
00:13:52,00:13:56,nervous about it as well because it was only 15 years after the Second World War ended and
00:13:56,00:14:01,"they thought, ""This feels like giving the other country a route just to pass military"
00:14:01,00:14:04,"vehicles straight into our country,"" but they did agree on it and eventually it was"
00:14:04,00:14:10,completed in about 1962. So now the 18 hour journey takes 10 minutes.
00:14:10,00:14:11,That's so cool.
00:14:11,00:14:15,"Yeah, I have been through that tunnel actually because we got a speeding ticket on the French"
00:14:15,00:14:19,side on the way in and then on the way out on the Italian side.
00:14:19,00:14:27,Wow. What an example of learning nothing from crashes.
00:14:27,00:14:31,I went to the dentist for the first time in two years the other day and I went because
00:14:31,00:14:37,"I had a bit of a problem and when I got there, the dentist misheard me when I said my name"
00:14:37,00:14:42,and put me down as Samuel Schreiber. I didn't correct her and so for the whole thing while
00:14:42,00:14:46,"she was setting it up, I was called Samuel Schreiber, which I thought was quite cool."
00:14:46,00:14:50,"That's a nice cool name. Anyway, it turns out when she found out my name wasn't Samuel,"
00:14:50,00:14:54,"she gave me a lot of crap saying, ""You can't do this. This is all in all the systems now."
00:14:54,00:14:58,"This is all the records."" And she spent half an hour undoing it and then ran out of time"
00:14:58,00:15:02,and she wasn't able to look at my teeth. So I have to go back in six weeks with a pain.
00:15:02,00:15:06,"I thought you were going to say when she realized it wasn't you, the tooth that she pulled out,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,she shoved back in.
00:15:08,00:15:12,But it is important to identify people by their dental records sometimes.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Yes.
00:15:13,00:15:17,"You know, so if they say, well, we found Alastair Jedzky, James Harkett, Andrew Antemari,"
00:15:17,00:15:23,"and someone called Samuel Schreiber, it's going to be confusing."
00:15:23,00:15:29,It is confusing. Yeah. And I've got a painful tooth because of my dickheadness.
00:15:29,00:15:34,Sea gulls use humans as taste testers. This is so weird. This happens at the seaside.
00:15:34,00:15:39,"There's a scientist called Madeline Goumas and she approached 38 gulls with a bucket,"
00:15:39,00:15:45,"right? Each bucket had a flapjack in. Sounds like a riddle, doesn't it? A wonderful riddle."
00:15:45,00:15:50,"She would unwrap both flapjacks, right? And then she would pretend to eat one of the flapjacks"
00:15:50,00:15:54,"for about 20 seconds. She's sort of mime nibbling away at it, right?"
00:15:54,00:16:00,So then she would put down the flapjacks. When sea gulls approached and got involved
00:16:00,00:16:04,"with the food that she'd just left, 19 out of 24 times, they approached the one that"
00:16:04,00:16:05,she had been pretending to eat.
00:16:05,00:16:11,"Sea gulls are way more interested. It could just be that they're dicks. And it's like,"
00:16:11,00:16:14,"""Oh, she was really enjoying that one, so I'm going to steal that one from her."""
00:16:14,00:16:17,"Yeah. I mean, her thesis is that they know that handled food is probably good for you"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"and not going to kill you. But your theory also cuts a lot of ice, frankly."
00:16:21,00:16:26,"But also maybe the other thing is that it's discarded food. She ate it, she no longer wants"
00:16:26,00:16:30,"it, so I'll take that and we're going to have a cool symbiotic relationship. It's like,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"""Cool, I'm not going to touch your good stuff."""
00:16:32,00:16:38,"How many sea gulls have you met, Dan? Because symbiosis is not on their to-do list."
00:16:38,00:16:42,"When they steal a chip out of his mouth, it's like, ""Oh, it's okay, I wasn't going to eat"
00:16:42,00:16:43,"that anyway."""
00:16:43,00:16:46,That's nature. Good on you.
00:16:46,00:16:50,More on the weirdness of a kid in the body is just a bit because we've mentioned a few
00:16:50,00:16:56,"things, but they have so little stuff that we take for granted. So they have no stomachs,"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"they have no teeth, they just have to crush their food up against the roof of their mouth"
00:16:59,00:17:06,"with their tongue, they have no nipples. So when the baby hatches and is in a little pouch,"
00:17:06,00:17:14,"there are these glands which just leak directly out of their skin. They're very basic, basically."
00:17:14,00:17:19,"They have to pop when just for the baby itself, they have to kind of like curl up and pop"
00:17:19,00:17:26,"it out of their bum, because they're an animal that is called like monohull, I don't know"
00:17:26,00:17:29,"how to say it, monotreme. That's it."
00:17:29,00:17:33,"It's sort of fact number one about a kid on the Wikipedia page, they are a monotreme"
00:17:33,00:17:34,bum.
00:17:34,00:17:42,"Monohull. I missed that episode of the Simpsons. Monohull, monohull, monohull."
00:17:42,00:17:51,"They are one-hulled, it's their bum and they're everything, it's a monohull. So they bring"
00:17:51,00:17:56,it up and then the baby sort of pops out and obviously there's an egg which is cracked
00:17:56,00:18:01,"and it pops out and then they have a pouch, much like a kangaroo does, and the baby crawls"
00:18:01,00:18:06,along and it goes inside and that's where the milk is secreted into.
00:18:06,00:18:07,"Wait, are you talking about goodness? Yeah."
00:18:07,00:18:08,That's not what happens.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"Oh, shit."
00:18:09,00:18:14,How is the baby crawling along? It's an egg.
00:18:14,00:18:15,It's what?
00:18:15,00:18:18,"The baby, the baby's in an egg, right? So the way the mother..."
00:18:18,00:18:22,"Oh, it's like a kangaroo, isn't it? A joey who climbs up."
00:18:22,00:18:26,I'm afraid that's the difference between your monotremes and your marsupials.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Your Dolby dreams.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Yeah.
00:18:28,00:18:29,Right.
00:18:29,00:18:30,"Okay, so..."
00:18:30,00:18:33,"But it is very fun, the way they give birth. The mother, it's much harder than as a kangaroo"
00:18:33,00:18:36,"because you can just give birth and the thing sorts itself out, clutches at your hair and"
00:18:36,00:18:37,crawls up.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Right.
00:18:38,00:18:43,"As an echidna, you lie on your back and you give birth, the egg comes out in egg form,"
00:18:43,00:18:48,"no legs, and they have to sort of shimmy it up their stomach. A bit like... Oh, you know"
00:18:48,00:18:50,that game where you have to get an after-eight down your forehead?
00:18:50,00:18:51,I was just...
00:18:51,00:18:56,"And pop it in your pouch, and then it sits in your pouch for a few more days."
00:18:56,00:19:00,"It's a different game when the after-eight comes out of your vagina, isn't it?"
00:19:00,00:19:01,Right.
00:19:01,00:19:03,"Well, it kind of gets late, some parties, you know."
00:19:03,00:19:04,My gosh.
00:19:04,00:19:09,"I was thinking, yeah, that ping-pong ball talent thing is a..."
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Oh, interesting."
00:19:10,00:19:11,They were the originators.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Talent.
00:19:12,00:19:13,It's a talent.
00:19:13,00:19:14,It is a talent.
00:19:14,00:19:15,Yeah.
00:19:15,00:19:16,I haven't seen it.
00:19:16,00:19:17,It is a talent.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:18,00:19:19,I haven't.
00:19:19,00:19:24,"I thought they'd laid what was inside the ping-pong ball, and that's what shot out."
00:19:24,00:19:27,"I didn't realize that it was... Anyway, let's move on."
00:19:27,00:19:31,"In fact, we actually do need to move on to our next fact."
00:19:31,00:19:36,"That was the terrible insight into Dan's internal monologue there, wasn't it?"
00:19:36,00:19:37,I felt really alone there.
00:19:37,00:19:38,I think you were alone.
00:19:38,00:19:39,It was incredible.
00:19:39,00:19:44,"I also felt like everyone, 900 people were going, ""Shh, just..."""
00:19:44,00:19:47,Let's see where it goes.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Let's see where it goes.
00:19:48,00:19:53,"Quite similarly, she was the oldest person ever in a rap song."
00:19:53,00:19:54,Ah!
00:19:54,00:19:59,"And again, someone just recorded her saying, ""Je m'appelle, je m'pellement."""
00:19:59,00:20:00,"What's happening, Dan?"
00:20:00,00:20:01,You broke the table?
00:20:01,00:20:04,My table's falling down.
00:20:04,00:20:06,I'm literally holding it up.
00:20:06,00:20:09,"You were telling such a good story, and they didn't want to do anything."
00:20:09,00:20:14,I actually think we might all be one of Dan's terrible dreams.
00:20:14,00:20:16,Can't fucking believe this.
00:20:16,00:20:19,He's going to be naked and have to do an exam in a minute.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"Okay, don't lean on this table, okay, Dan?"
00:20:21,00:20:22,Holy shit.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Don't touch it.
00:20:23,00:20:26,"I was literally, I was like, ""Rawr!"""
00:20:26,00:20:27,"Like, who are Atlas?"
00:20:27,00:20:30,"You're like Atlas there, holding up the world."
00:20:30,00:20:31,I like this.
00:20:31,00:20:36,I was reading about this group of people that like to get to the top of a mountain
00:20:36,00:20:39,or somewhere a bit hard to get to and set up a jacuzzi.
00:20:39,00:20:41,"And then they all hop in the jacuzzi,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,"and they managed to do this on the top of Mont Blanc,"
00:20:44,00:20:48,"which, even though a lot of people assume it's quite an easy mountain to climb,"
00:20:48,00:20:50,it's responsible for a huge number of deaths.
00:20:50,00:20:52,It is a very hard mountain to get to.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"So they packed up all their stuff,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,and they managed to get this jacuzzi on top of there.
00:20:56,00:21:00,And you can see photos of about 30 people who've gone through all the night
00:21:00,00:21:01,treaching up there.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"Yeah, yeah, and setting it up."
00:21:02,00:21:06,"And using, it's heated by the snow with the system that they have."
00:21:06,00:21:07,Heated by the snow?
00:21:07,00:21:09,"Yeah, so they have a system."
00:21:09,00:21:11,"And, oh shit, okay."
00:21:11,00:21:13,[laughter]
00:21:13,00:21:21,"So, they put the snow onto these kind of really cool things that then heat up the water"
00:21:21,00:21:23,that somehow they've brought up with them.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Have they brought water up?
00:21:24,00:21:26,"No, you wouldn't bring water to the top of Mont Blanc."
00:21:26,00:21:27,Why would you do that?
00:21:27,00:21:28,That's not necessary.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Why would you do that?
00:21:29,00:21:34,"So, it was really hot because it was powered by snow."
00:21:34,00:21:37,"And, okay, so they get to the top."
00:21:37,00:21:38,Here's the fascinating thing.
00:21:38,00:21:40,They're on the top of Mont Blanc.
00:21:40,00:21:44,"And suddenly this Italian group that climbs up and they see them,"
00:21:44,00:21:47,and obviously it's a shock for anyone that suddenly sees a jacuzzi full of people
00:21:47,00:21:49,and their swimwear on the top.
00:21:49,00:21:53,But it just so happens this Italian group had already met these people in a jacuzzi
00:21:53,00:21:56,"on a previous mountain that they'd been on before,"
00:21:56,00:22:00,"completely by coincidence, got up there and they're like, ""You again?"""
00:22:00,00:22:04,"And they now just think there's someone in a jacuzzi at the top of every mountain, don't they?"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:05,00:22:06,That's so funny.
00:22:06,00:22:13,"It is funny, and so it doesn't matter about how you can make a jacuzzi full of snow."
00:22:13,00:22:15,"This has not been a good one for me, guys."
00:22:15,00:22:17,I'll admit that right now.
00:22:17,00:22:19,It's been a shitter.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"We need to move on to our next fact, guys."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"Oh, can I just talk about an origin of life thing?"
00:22:23,00:22:24,Yeah.
00:22:24,00:22:25,I really like.
00:22:25,00:22:29,"So there were lots of theories about where life started and most of my sensible scientists,"
00:22:29,00:22:34,"but one was by an American homeopath at the start of the 20th century called Charles Wentworth Littlefield,"
00:22:34,00:22:40,and he was reported as a scientist and it was in all the news that he's found out where life comes from
00:22:40,00:22:44,and the way he found it was he took some salt out of one of his patient's wounds
00:22:44,00:22:47,and he looked at it under a microscope while thinking about chicken
00:22:47,00:22:50,and he saw it turn into a chicken.
00:22:50,00:22:51,Sorry.
00:22:51,00:22:54,He took some stuff from a patient's wound.
00:22:54,00:22:55,Some salt.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"Something like bodily salts, basically."
00:22:57,00:22:58,"He said, ""Sift them out."""
00:22:58,00:23:00,He looked under a microscope and thought about chicken.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"It turned into the shape of a chicken, not a live chicken."
00:23:02,00:23:04,That would be stupid.
00:23:04,00:23:09,"But he realised that by concentrating on any grain of salt,"
00:23:09,00:23:12,"he could make it transform into the thing he was thinking about,"
00:23:12,00:23:17,"and it was always inanimate until he thought about octopuses, tiny, tiny octopuses,"
00:23:17,00:23:21,and then he created live octopuses from these grains of salt
00:23:21,00:23:25,and he concluded that this must be how life initially formed.
00:23:25,00:23:26,Okay.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"Well, who was doing the thinking?"
00:23:28,00:23:30,That's the question.
00:23:30,00:23:32,I suppose that's where God comes into it.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"What was the octopus bit, though?"
00:23:34,00:23:36,He thought of octopuses and they didn't turn to octopuses.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"No, they did turn into octopuses, but they were alive, so it was life."
00:23:39,00:23:40,Sorry.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Wow.
00:23:41,00:23:44,"Given that all this is complete bullshit, what is the outcome?"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"Hang on, don't judge it just yet, because there is a theory as well"
00:23:49,00:23:52,"that octopuses are actually aliens that came to Earth,"
00:23:52,00:23:55,"and so that wouldn't be the original life, right?"
00:23:55,00:23:59,So this guy was probably just going through every single animal
00:23:59,00:24:02,"and then suddenly hit on the one that actually, if you stare at it long enough,"
00:24:02,00:24:03,does turn into a living octopus.
00:24:03,00:24:06,I should just say that theory is also bullshit.
00:24:06,00:24:11,"I think it's demeaning us, James, to say it's bullshit."
00:24:11,00:24:13,"So what was he just crazy, this person?"
00:24:13,00:24:16,"Yeah, he was just taken vaguely seriously in the news at the turn of the century."
00:24:16,00:24:17,Wow.
00:24:17,00:24:20,"And you know, I like the idea, and who's tried it?"
00:24:20,00:24:22,Who's tried looking at salt and thinking of an octopus?
00:24:22,00:24:23,Not me.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:25,So don't knock it.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"Well, listen, okay, this half of the table thinks there's something to it."
00:24:27,00:24:29,That half of the table doesn't it?
00:24:29,00:24:31,I'm not signing up to this.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"Instead of the first car on the moon, we almost had the first pogo stick."
00:24:35,00:24:36,What?
00:24:36,00:24:41,"There was debate, so as I said earlier, Apollo 15 was the first mission"
00:24:41,00:24:44,where there was actually a vehicle that was driven around.
00:24:44,00:24:45,They drove it around.
00:24:45,00:24:46,And they were there for three days.
00:24:46,00:24:49,"They drove it around for like at least six hours a day,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,which actually is just quite a long time to be driving.
00:24:51,00:24:52,That's a lot.
00:24:52,00:24:53,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:53,00:24:55,And they had to wear seat belts.
00:24:55,00:24:57,The seat belts really didn't fit.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"And they took ages trying to get the seat belts on, which seems so weird to me."
00:25:00,00:25:01,How many obstacles are there?
00:25:01,00:25:02,How many cars coming at you?
00:25:02,00:25:04,There's a lot of rocks around them.
00:25:04,00:25:07,There are a lot of craters and dips.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"Okay, I reckon I could hack it."
00:25:09,00:25:10,I don't know.
00:25:10,00:25:11,I'd rather seat belt.
00:25:11,00:25:13,That's the main question at the NASA astronaut selection actually.
00:25:13,00:25:15,Do you reckon you could hack it?
00:25:15,00:25:16,Yeah.
00:25:16,00:25:17,Come on then.
00:25:17,00:25:18,Come on in.
00:25:18,00:25:24,"Anyway, there were lots of ideas for what kind of vehicle to design for the moon."
00:25:24,00:25:26,NASA was very interested in a motorcycle at first.
00:25:26,00:25:27,I thought that might work.
00:25:27,00:25:29,"And then there was the idea for a giant pogo stick,"
00:25:29,00:25:31,which would be manned by two people.
00:25:31,00:25:33,I think sort of one on each.
00:25:33,00:25:36,I feel like things that you do to get yourself along the railway tracks.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"You know, those things."
00:25:37,00:25:38,That's not what a pogo stick is.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"No, but it's manned by two people, you know."
00:25:40,00:25:43,"Yeah, but so is a pedalo."
00:25:43,00:25:45,A seesaw.
00:25:45,00:25:49,I don't think the audience needed a simile for manned by two people.
00:25:49,00:25:51,I just just didn't want to picture that.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"Maybe they'd each be standing at one end of the pogo stick,"
00:25:53,00:25:56,and then one would go up and one would go down at the same time.
00:25:56,00:25:57,That is a seesaw.
00:25:57,00:25:58,That's not a pogo stick.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"Okay, look, we've drilled down and we've acetate that."
00:26:01,00:26:03,I don't know what a pogo stick is.
00:26:03,00:26:05,You are failing that NASA interview.
00:26:05,00:26:09,"If they're testing laboratories,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,"dog food is often used to put down them,"
00:26:11,00:26:14,"because it has a sort of, to simulate the stuff."
00:26:14,00:26:19,"It's got the same consistency as my poo, for example."
00:26:19,00:26:22,Do you get it in jelly or in gravy?
00:26:22,00:26:24,"Okay, my poo?"
00:26:24,00:26:25,Okay.
00:26:25,00:26:26,Sure.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"You know, there's quite a range of textures, isn't there?"
00:26:29,00:26:31,But I suppose that's to a poo and dog food.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"James, I want to split off and start a one podcast."
00:26:33,00:26:35,Just on this table.
00:26:35,00:26:37,There used to be a takeaway place near me
00:26:37,00:26:39,"that would cut off the top of a loaf of bread,"
00:26:39,00:26:42,"and they'd hollow it out, and then they'd just pour in a stew,"
00:26:42,00:26:44,and they'd give you the bread back.
00:26:44,00:26:45,That sounds great.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"It was a South African thing, I think."
00:26:47,00:26:48,Okay.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Say again.
00:26:49,00:26:50,Bunny chow.
00:26:50,00:26:51,Sonny chow.
00:26:51,00:26:52,Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:53,Bunny chow.
00:26:53,00:26:54,I don't think it was a bunny in it.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"I think it was a better option, but it's very nice."
00:26:57,00:26:59,"Well, on Christmas, very quickly,"
00:26:59,00:27:02,"the aviator, he claimed to be the third person"
00:27:02,00:27:05,"to fly in America, but we think he probably didn't,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,because his planes were all terrible.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"He kept inventing these really awful planes,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,so there was one called the Christmas Bullet.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"The wings were supposed to flap as you flew,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,"but unfortunately, they crashed on his maiden flight,"
00:27:19,00:27:22,"and then they made another one, and that one crashed as well."
00:27:22,00:27:25,He made another design when it was a plane
00:27:25,00:27:27,which had a huge hole in the top.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"His idea was, right, if you get a parachute,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,"a lot of parachutes have a hole in the top,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,and that's because you don't want all the air
00:27:34,00:27:37,"to properly just get properly into the parachute,"
00:27:37,00:27:39,"otherwise it might get a bit wobbly,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"so he thought, why don't I do that for a plane?"
00:27:41,00:27:42,Interesting.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Right.
00:27:43,00:27:45,I hope they tell you when you do a parachute jump
00:27:45,00:27:47,"about the whole thing, because I can't imagine"
00:27:47,00:27:49,"how fucking terrified I'd be if my parachute,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,"because I looked up, there was a huge hole in the top."
00:27:51,00:27:52,Could be worse.
00:27:52,00:27:54,"James, when you said they have to have a hole in the top,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"I just thought, I thought you were going to say,"
00:27:56,00:27:59,"because obviously, if the aero goes up in there,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,it just gets stuck in there and you just stay
00:28:01,00:28:03,where you are in the sky.
00:28:03,00:28:10,"That's how that works, yeah?"
00:28:10,00:28:12,"Do you know that, you may have seen it,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"actually, this is extremely cutting-edge"
00:28:14,00:28:16,soup news right now.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"Hines have just released a Christmas soup,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,which is very exciting.
00:28:22,00:28:24,They've just announced it as a kind of PR thing.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"They've only made 500 tins, but it's got, you know,"
00:28:26,00:28:27,everything.
00:28:27,00:28:29,"It's got turkey, sprouts, stuffing, roast potatoes,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,"pigs in blankets, gravy, cranberry sauce."
00:28:31,00:28:33,"Well, I mean, that sounds all right,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,because at least it's one course.
00:28:35,00:28:36,Have they just mushed it all up?
00:28:36,00:28:38,"No, you get chunks of turkey and things like that."
00:28:38,00:28:39,"Oh, right, yeah, there are chunks."
00:28:39,00:28:41,"Oh, James, don't worry."
00:28:41,00:28:43,There are chunks.
00:28:43,00:28:46,"But it could be worse, because in 2013,"
00:28:46,00:28:49,"game, the video game people,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"they launched a thing called a Christmas dinner,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,which was for people too addictive to video games
00:28:53,00:28:55,"to cook anything on Christmas Day,"
00:28:55,00:28:57,and the top layer was scrambled egg and bacon.
00:28:57,00:28:59,Then there was a layer of mincemeat.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"Then there was some turkey and trimmings,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,and then there was a Christmas pudding
00:29:03,00:29:05,in the bottom of the tin.
00:29:05,00:29:08,Where are all the quality street?
00:29:08,00:29:13,Wow.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Yeah.
00:29:14,00:29:16,Are you allowed to eat a painting?
00:29:16,00:29:18,"What do you mean, are you allowed to eat a painting?"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"Legally, if you own a painting, this is..."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"Of course, if you own it, you can do what you want."
00:29:22,00:29:24,"Well, you're absolutely right."
00:29:25,00:29:27,"OK, it's time for"
00:29:27,00:29:30,fact number three.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"Any more? Any more for that, no?"
00:29:33,00:29:34,Not really.
00:29:34,00:29:36,Is that mid-busted?
00:29:36,00:29:39,"It's just, you know, would you be allowed to eat the Mona Lisa"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"if you owned it, probably?"
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:42,00:29:43,"Well, you're right."
00:29:43,00:29:47,Has someone put this in the statue books?
00:29:47,00:29:49,"Yes, they have. Thank you, Anna."
00:29:49,00:29:51,Good question. Is the 1990...
00:29:51,00:29:53,"Oh, no, hang on."
00:29:54,00:29:56,"No, it is all right, actually."
00:29:56,00:29:59,"There are laws about works that might still be in copyright,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"so if it's within 75 years of the artist's death,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,or works that are protected
00:30:03,00:30:05,"under the 1990 Visual Artist Rights Act,"
00:30:05,00:30:08,you're not allowed to eat some of those protected ones.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"But the good news is, anything from Caravaggio's time"
00:30:11,00:30:13,is on the menu.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Wow!
00:30:14,00:30:16,That's interesting.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"We really had to pull it out of you,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,but 75 days after...
00:30:20,00:30:22,75 days after...
00:30:22,00:30:24,75 days?
00:30:24,00:30:26,Yes!
00:30:26,00:30:28,I was just...
00:30:28,00:30:33,"Okay, cool. 75 years."
00:30:33,00:30:35,That's Christmas lunch sorted
00:30:35,00:30:37,in the Hunter Murray household.
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Oh, boy."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"I think the very first-ever study of it,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"the long-beaked echidna, it's called,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,was published in 2009.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"And even then, the study author,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,"who was a guy called Musee Opiang,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,was 500 hours studying them
00:30:50,00:30:52,before even seeing one.
00:30:52,00:30:54,Wow!
00:30:54,00:30:56,"Was he studying them, then?"
00:30:56,00:30:58,"Really, for that first 500 hours?"
00:30:58,00:31:00,He was warming up. He was doing stretches.
00:31:00,00:31:02,"They are quite hard to find, though, aren't they?"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"There was a guy, the first scientist,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,to study the testicles of echidnas.
00:31:06,00:31:09,He did that by employing Aboriginal people
00:31:09,00:31:11,to find these echidnas for him.
00:31:11,00:31:14,"And he always paid more for the females,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,because it was more hard to find the females.
00:31:16,00:31:18,I think that of all you...
00:31:18,00:31:20,It is much harder to find the females' testicles.
00:31:20,00:31:22,Is that what he said?
00:31:22,00:31:24,"He did lots of studying,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,but he happens to be the first person
00:31:26,00:31:28,to have studied the testicles.
00:31:28,00:31:30,This guy actually committed suicide.
00:31:30,00:31:32,He was a German scientist.
00:31:32,00:31:34,He committed suicide in 1918
00:31:34,00:31:36,"while wrapped in a German flag,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,because he was so upset with the way the war was going.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"But, yeah, he was most famous, I think,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,"for studying the testicles of the echidnas,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,and his name was Dick Seaman.
00:31:44,00:31:46,What? Richard W. Seaman.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"Oh, my God, that's incredible."
00:31:48,00:31:49,"A, change your name."
00:31:49,00:31:52,"B, don't study testicles if your name is Dick Seaman."
00:31:52,00:31:54,[laughter]
00:31:54,00:31:55,"Well, kind of..."
00:31:55,00:31:57,"All right, Dan. I mean, the guy was obviously a troubled man."
00:31:57,00:31:59,Let's not kick him while he's down.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"Okay, fair enough."
00:32:00,00:32:02,"Seriously, weird thing. So random."
00:32:02,00:32:04,"On soup, Ted Cruz, you remember Ted Cruz,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,came second to Trump in the primaries.
00:32:06,00:32:08,"2016, during those primaries,"
00:32:08,00:32:11,"his wife revealed that after they got back from their honeymoon,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"the first thing he did was he went out to the shop,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"said he was going shopping, he came home,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,and all he had was 100 cans of Campbell's soup.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"And so she said,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"""We had to have a tough conversation."""
00:32:22,00:32:24,"Well, I explained to him,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,"""You don't come back with 100 of anything."
00:32:26,00:32:28,"""Low-loan Campbell's soup."""
00:32:28,00:32:30,"He said, ""You know you're not going to cook love,"
00:32:30,00:32:33,"""so this is what I'll be eating for the rest of our marriage."""
00:32:33,00:32:34,And she was...
00:32:34,00:32:36,"Look, he didn't say to put it in those terms."
00:32:36,00:32:37,Don't worry.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"Basically, that's what he said."
00:32:39,00:32:42,She snuck out and returned them all the next morning
00:32:42,00:32:43,before he woke up.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"And then she talked to her mum on the phone,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"and her mum said, ""Are you going to cook for him, though?"""
00:32:48,00:32:50,"And she went, ""No, I'm a terrible cook. Can't cook at all."""
00:32:50,00:32:53,"Her mum was like, ""Go and get the soup back."""
00:32:53,00:32:55,She went and got the soup back.
00:32:55,00:32:56,No!
00:32:56,00:32:57,Yeah.
00:32:57,00:33:00,"Well, that's a beautiful marriage, right there."
00:33:00,00:33:03,There's one cashier at the soup shop
00:33:03,00:33:05,"who has no idea about this whole story,"
00:33:05,00:33:09,"just as a weird thing where some guy turned up, bought 110s,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,lady came and took them away.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"Yeah, then returned, demanded them back."
00:33:13,00:33:16,"""What's going on? Am I on a reality TV show?"""
00:33:16,00:33:18,Can I tell you one more trick?
00:33:18,00:33:20,"Yeah, we're going to have to wrap up in a sec."
00:33:20,00:33:22,"Okay, this is a trick by one of the greatest magicians of all time,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"Robert Houdin, who Houdini got his name from."
00:33:25,00:33:26,This is the trick.
00:33:26,00:33:28,He would take a handkerchief from an audience member.
00:33:28,00:33:31,He would turn that into a file of liquid.
00:33:31,00:33:35,He would pour that liquid on a dry twig.
00:33:35,00:33:39,That would sprout and grow into a bush.
00:33:39,00:33:42,The bush would then grow oranges on it.
00:33:42,00:33:45,Robert Houdin would pick the oranges off the bush.
00:33:45,00:33:48,He would throw them into the audience one by one.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"The final one, he would split open."
00:33:51,00:33:55,"Out of that final orange, two butterflies would fly,"
00:33:55,00:34:00,"living butterflies, holding the handkerchief between them."
00:34:00,00:34:01,No!
00:34:01,00:34:03,And return it to the audience member.
00:34:03,00:34:05,The butterflies would return it.
00:34:05,00:34:09,"And we're going to do that tonight, ladies and gentlemen."
00:34:09,00:34:11,"But unfortunately, no one has a handkerchief anymore."
00:34:11,00:34:13,Sorry!
00:34:13,00:34:15,Can I just tell you one more thing about postcards?
00:34:15,00:34:19,"In 2017, a Europe poll, so kind of like Interpol, but for Europe,"
00:34:19,00:34:23,they started trying to catch criminals through the mechanism of postcards.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"They developed these postcards,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,each one featuring one of Europe's highest-profile fugitives.
00:34:28,00:34:33,"And they said things like, ""Dear Arta, Belgium fries are the best,"
00:34:33,00:34:36,"""and we know you missed them. Come back to enjoy them."
00:34:36,00:34:38,"""We'll have a nice surprise in store for you."""
00:34:38,00:34:40,That was for a famous drug dealer.
00:34:40,00:34:42,So did they send them to him?
00:34:42,00:34:46,"No, they just published them and made people aware that these people were on the run."
00:34:46,00:34:49,Because they're going to say if he knew where he lived to send them a postcard.
00:34:49,00:34:51,That's true. It's so true.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Hi, David, we've been trying to get hold of you because there is still so much to discuss."
00:34:54,00:34:56,"Please get in touch soon, the police."
00:34:56,00:35:00,"So someone accused of multiple, quite serious sexual offences,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"and they won an award for it, and three criminals were actually..."
00:35:02,00:35:04,But there's sexual offences!
00:35:04,00:35:06,They didn't win a... Sorry.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Okay.
00:35:07,00:35:12,"It's hard, it's very hard to transplant testicles, obviously,"
00:35:12,00:35:15,onto a different part of the body.
00:35:15,00:35:16,"Oh, sorry."
00:35:16,00:35:17,Why?
00:35:17,00:35:18,"So, actually, who's..."
00:35:18,00:35:19,What a shame.
00:35:19,00:35:20,I got that thought around.
00:35:20,00:35:21,Which part of the body was it?
00:35:21,00:35:23,It's actually a lot easier to transplant testicles
00:35:23,00:35:25,onto a different part of the body than into a scrotum.
00:35:25,00:35:29,And this has been tested on rats.
00:35:29,00:35:33,"So, a few years ago, a team put a load of testicles of rats."
00:35:33,00:35:34,"They did some transplants,"
00:35:34,00:35:38,"and they moved the testicles either into other rat scrotii,"
00:35:38,00:35:41,or onto the necks of the other rats.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"And it had a much higher success rate, the transplant,"
00:35:43,00:35:46,if the testicles were just put on the necks of the rats.
00:35:46,00:35:47,Really? Yeah.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"But you'd be pissed off with your surgeon when you woke up,"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"if they said, ""Well, transplant wasn't successful."""
00:35:51,00:35:54,"Of course, it was easier to do it onto your forehead."
00:35:54,00:35:55,"So, we've done it."
00:35:55,00:35:57,I thought you didn't mind.
00:35:57,00:36:04,"It's so strange that you have a tiger with canine teeth,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"because they're felines, but they've got canines."
00:36:06,00:36:07,You know what I mean?
00:36:07,00:36:08,Yeah.
00:36:08,00:36:09,"That's weird, that, isn't it?"
00:36:09,00:36:10,It makes you think.
00:36:10,00:36:11,It really does.
00:36:11,00:36:12,What does it make you think about?
00:36:12,00:36:14,It doesn't really make me think about anything.
00:36:14,00:36:16,It just makes me think in a kind of abstract way.
00:36:16,00:36:19,Bill Gates is intending to block out the sun.
00:36:19,00:36:20,What do you mean?
00:36:20,00:36:25,He wants to use some of his money to help scientists at Harvard University
00:36:25,00:36:30,who are proposing an experiment that can hopefully stop global warming
00:36:30,00:36:34,"by sending a balloon up there, sending a load of particles into the atmosphere,"
00:36:34,00:36:37,"where the sun's rays will come down, bounce off into space,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,and it will be less hot on Earth.
00:36:39,00:36:41,I can't see that going wrong.
00:36:41,00:36:42,No!
00:36:42,00:36:43,"I saw it, why not?"
00:36:43,00:36:44,Let's do it.
00:36:44,00:36:45,Let's do it.
00:36:45,00:36:46,I'm up for it.
00:36:46,00:36:49,It's going to look like we're at a worldwide children's birthday party.
00:36:49,00:36:50,That's quite cool.
00:36:50,00:36:51,That would be cool.
00:36:51,00:36:52,That would be cool.
00:36:52,00:36:57,He's one of the few people in the world who has a McDonald's gold card.
00:36:57,00:36:59,I don't know if it's connected to this.
00:36:59,00:37:00,What's that?
00:37:00,00:37:03,"McDonald's gold card is where you can go to any McDonald's,"
00:37:03,00:37:06,"you hand it in, and no matter what you've ordered, they give it to you for free."
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Oh, thank God."
00:37:07,00:37:11,"Because otherwise, how would he be able to afford a Big Mac?"
00:37:11,00:37:12,So we don't have it in the UK.
00:37:12,00:37:16,"What we have is the Nando's black card, which is quite a famous card,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,which I've experienced a couple of times.
00:37:18,00:37:19,"I have, yeah."
00:37:19,00:37:21,A couple of friends of mine have had it.
00:37:21,00:37:25,"So Tom Davis, who is King Gary, he once had it."
00:37:25,00:37:27,The other guy had to stop using it because he was...
00:37:27,00:37:31,"Good luck with the Nando's lawsuit, Dan."
00:37:31,00:37:33,I am not saying...
00:37:33,00:37:36,Good point. Let's edit that out.
00:37:36,00:37:38,We're not saying that Nando's...
00:37:41,00:37:43,We're not. Put it from your mind.
00:37:43,00:37:49,There was an amazing thing that happened in the Netherlands at the start of this year.
00:37:49,00:37:53,"Actually, it was the end of last year, and that was that there was an Armenian family"
00:37:53,00:37:56,"who'd been living in the Netherlands for nine years,"
00:37:56,00:37:59,and the country had decided they wanted to deport them.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"And they were like, ""Well, we can't go back to Armenia"
00:38:01,00:38:04,"because if we go back, we'll be in terrible trouble."""
00:38:04,00:38:07,"And they said to the church, ""What are we going to do?"""
00:38:07,00:38:12,"Apparently, there's an old and obscured Dutch law that police aren't allowed to arrest someone"
00:38:12,00:38:14,in the middle of a church service.
00:38:14,00:38:22,"And so, the local church started a mass that went on for 24 hours a day for 97 days."
00:38:22,00:38:23,Wow.
00:38:23,00:38:26,While this family were living in the church.
00:38:26,00:38:29,"They started off doing it for a few days, a few days."
00:38:29,00:38:35,"Eventually, more than 650 clergy members were signing up to be the next person to do it."
00:38:35,00:38:37,They kind of tag-teamed all the priests.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Wow.
00:38:38,00:38:41,"And eventually, the government just thought, ""Fuck this."""
00:38:41,00:38:44,"And they went, ""Fine, you can stay, you can stay, you can stay."""
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Oh, really?"
00:38:45,00:38:48,"I would have thought they'd go, ""Fuck this, we're going to walk in and arrest you anyway."""
00:38:48,00:38:49,It's the law.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"You can't break the law if you're a government, can you?"
00:38:51,00:38:52,What?
00:38:52,00:38:54,Well...
00:38:54,00:38:58,"Caravaggio died, maybe, of sunstroke, we think."
00:38:58,00:38:59,Really?
00:38:59,00:39:01,"Yeah, this is what people have claimed."
00:39:01,00:39:04,"I couldn't define what their evidence was, except that."
00:39:04,00:39:09,"So, researchers, there's this big mystery of how he died, or shrouded in mystery."
00:39:09,00:39:10,"Like, was he murdered?"
00:39:10,00:39:11,Was he poisoned?
00:39:11,00:39:12,Did he have syphilis?
00:39:12,00:39:16,"And they thought in 2010 that they found some of his bones, fragments of his bones."
00:39:16,00:39:18,"They studied his bones, these researchers."
00:39:18,00:39:22,"And they said, it showed signs of lead poisoning and syphilis."
00:39:22,00:39:24,But they think what eventually killed him was sunstroke.
00:39:24,00:39:31,And then the only evidence I could find that they had was that 1610 was an extremely hot year.
00:39:32,00:39:33,What?
00:39:33,00:39:35,"That's the reason, darling."
00:39:35,00:39:37,"That makes sense, yeah."
00:39:37,00:39:39,It's been quite cold this winter.
00:39:39,00:39:42,"In future, every single person who died this year, people will look at them and go,"
00:39:42,00:39:45,"""I reckon that was the cold that killed this one."""
00:39:45,00:39:47,I'm not sure they were.
00:39:47,00:39:48,I think they might be.
00:39:48,00:39:51,It was a very heavy cold.
00:39:51,00:39:56,"A bit too much Nando, sir, I reckon."
00:39:56,00:39:57,"No, we can't keep that in."
00:39:57,00:39:59,It has to stay.
00:39:59,00:40:00,It has to stay.
00:40:00,00:40:06,Who's full of tingers?
00:40:06,00:40:07,Gates or Nando's?
00:40:07,00:40:10,We'll find out when this episode goes out.
00:40:10,00:40:15,"Okay, that's it."
00:40:15,00:40:16,That's all of our facts.

00:40:51,00:40:53,We were only joking.
