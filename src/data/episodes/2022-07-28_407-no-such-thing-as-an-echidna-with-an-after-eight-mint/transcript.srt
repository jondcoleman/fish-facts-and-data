00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,380
 Hi everyone, it is New Year's Eve if you're hearing this on the day that this episode

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:16,300
 drops. Wow, 2021, what a year, eh? Phew, dear goodness. Well, we got through it, we got

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,900
 through it and 2022 I'm sure will hold lots and lots of exciting things for all of you

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,340
 people and all of us as well. So what do we have for you this week? Well, we have a compilation

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,880
 of outtakes from our latest tour. We like to think that we are the pros, we've been doing

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,340
 this for 400 episodes, we've been doing it for almost 8 years, surely everything is so

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,320
 slick that nothing ever goes wrong. Well, if you've actually been to one of our shows,

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,040
 you know that things quite often do go wrong. Sometimes we say things that we can't possibly

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,400
 put out on the podcast, unless I very heavily censor them. Sometimes it's a really good

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,060
 fact and it just doesn't quite fit in the final edit. Sometimes the set just falls to pieces

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,660
 all around us and so what I've done is I've collected all those things together and put

12
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:13,200
 them into a compilation of all the craziest bits from the last few months of touring fish.

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
 Really hope you enjoy it. We'll be back with a normal episode for the first show of 2022

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:35,020
 for the time being. Hope you enjoy the show on with the podcast.

15
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,540
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. My name is Dan Schreiber

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,680
 and I'm sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Hawken and

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
 once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,040
 seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,760
 is James. Did you not bring your microphone? Do you know I'm so relieved about that because

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,920
 I forgot to bring my drinks on. All right, you two go off cover. Should we start again?

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,320
 So it turns out unbelievable. Listeners at home, James forgot to bring his microphone

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,360
 and I forgot to bring her drink. I can't work out which is worse. I'm here, Dan. Thank

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,400
 you, Andy. Dan, I don't think anyone's noticed. I think if we go straight to me, Dan, though.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,160
 It's hilarious you didn't bring your microphone. I think what's funny is it was only when I

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,960
 was speaking. I started speaking and my voice is a lot quieter than normal. And you started

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,680
 looking at your empty hands and you were like, what? Amazing. Absolute pros. Eight years

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,160
 you've been doing this. Okay, it's time for fact number one and that is James. Okay,

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:03:00,560
 my fact this week. It's gonna make no sense in the edit when this show goes out. His real

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,440
 name is not Caravaggio. Yeah, he's actually called Michelangelo, but that name was taken.

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,360
 So he had to resort to where he was born. So Leonardo da Vinci, that's not his surname,

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,120
 it's of Vinci. That's where he's born. Same thing with Caravaggio. Michelangelo, Merisida,

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,480
 Caravaggio, of Caravaggio. So that just became his nickname. And do you know why he was called

33
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,920
 Michelangelo? No. It's because he was born, we think probably, on the 29th of December,

34
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,400
 which was the feast of the Archangel, Michel, which is also my birthday. Wait, your birthday

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,920
 is not 29th of December. September. Oh, did you say September? You said December. Yeah.

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:53,640
 But by the time the edit goes out, I won't have done. Is there a reason why clownfish

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,800
 are so good to experiment on? Do we know? I'm actually not sure. We probably mentioned

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,760
 it at some point in our 300 podcast, so you should go back and check. Just kind of funny.

39
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,880
 Yeah. Good looking. Yeah. Photogenic. You can fit a load of clownfish in the same car,

40
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,960
 which is useful for research purposes. That's something. And do you know why he was called

41
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,480
 Michelangelo? No. It's because he was born, we think probably, on the 29th of September,

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,960
 which was the feast of the Archangel, Michel, which is also my birthday. I was looking into,

43
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,980
 I was just looking into names of dentists. There's always that thing that if you're called

44
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,240
 Dennis, you're going to be a dentist, you know, more. There's the idea, and there's been

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,640
 lots of studies to show that Dennis or Denise, you'll be a dentist. And so I found a few

46
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,200
 names where it does feel like you're being pulled into it. So Rachel B. Pullin was one.

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:55,280
 And then in Rutland, there is a dentistry that are called Dennis and Deneth Stental Practice.

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:06,480
 What? You said that again. Denteth and denteth. Denteth. D-E-N-T-I-T-H and denteth. But when

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,120
 they get their braces off, they're going to have to change the name, aren't they? So good.

50
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,440
 In the 1960s, some women were taught how to breastfeed using sock puppets. Sock puppets.

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,880
 So they would, I mean, we're just doing the sock puppet symbol. Yeah. Well, there were

52
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,120
 knitted nitted breasts as well. So there were knitted sock puppets and then knitted breasts

53
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,960
 to kind of demonstrate how the baby latches on. So the sock puppet would suck on the knitted

54
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,280
 breast as opposed to the real breast? Yes, that's right. Like a weird punch and judy show?

55
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,760
 It's a very weird punch and judy show. In fact, I told one of our colleagues this in

56
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,520
 the office the other day, and immediately he said punch and booby. Yeah.

57
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,040
 There was also an advent Christmas clock, wasn't there, which had 24 hands on it. And

58
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,120
 so you would move the hand. 24 hands? Yeah. I'm sorry. 24 spots for the hand to move

59
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,280
 on. And so you would move it each day. And that was a primitive version of the eye talent.

60
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,120
 Your clock will be so cheap. You just want 24 hands on a clock. Just look at the relevant

61
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,040
 hand to know what the time is.

62
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,440
 Do you remember the time when they asked if they could put our podcast on British Airways

63
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,560
 flights? Yes. Oh, yeah. And they said, well, can you go back through your first 100 episodes

64
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,920
 and remove? We don't want anyone's where you mentioned plane crashes. And it turned out

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,240
 we mentioned it in every single episode. Yeah. It was bizarre. It was truly bizarre.

66
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,080
 It was so weird. Yeah. It was weird. We've already done it in this one. Yeah. Do you know,

67
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,480
 can I just say a non-orgasm thing to do with llamas, which is that llamas, there was a

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,840
 photo that was taken in the 20s, which led to an international incident where Tibetan

69
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,480
 monks, or monks, I think they were Tibet, were flown over. And there was a photo taken

70
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,800
 of them with llamas. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And this calls, so a llama with a llama was the idea

71
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,760
 that the British did when they brought them over. And it led to big problems because,

72
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,640
 so this was part of publicity for a 1924 film, which was filmed by a guy called Captain John

73
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,520
 Noll, who provided, for me, the greatest fact that I think I've ever brought to this show,

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,200
 which is he said that it's easier to escape a female yeti than it is a male yeti because

75
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,680
 female yetis have such long dangling boobs that before they can chase you, they need to

76
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,640
 chuck them over the shoulders and tie them like a scarf. Otherwise, they might trip on

77
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,380
 them as they're chasing you. And then the time it takes them to do all that, you can

78
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,120
 escape. So that's Captain John Noll who said that. And he was responsible for bringing

79
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,280
 the llamas to meet the lamas. Yeah. So he was the official filmmaker on the Mallory Expedition.

80
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,640
 He's the one who filmed the whole thing. He made it into a big movie. And it was a, you

81
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,120
 know, a Hollywood nominated movie. And it's still to the say, it's a classic. But the

82
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,120
 publicity that he did is what actually banned any more attempts from happening on Mount

83
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,960
 Everest, because the authorities were so furious about the way that the religion was parodied

84
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 by having llamas next to llama. We weren't allowed to go back to Mount Everest for ages.

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,880
 That's interesting. That happened when I tried to put some bananas in some pajamas. It's

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,040
 also happened to me. Who are you? Who's the parodying? The bananas or the pajamas? I don't

87
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,880
 know. I haven't got that far. I'm working on the joke. Here's one really weird thing.

88
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,480
 I don't know if we can do this in the UK. I unfortunately found this way too late in

89
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,800
 the day to research this a bit more. But in other countries, this definitely happens.

90
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,320
 So imagine you're at home, right? Everyone and the bins have just gone out. And suddenly

91
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,120
 you realize that you accidentally threw away or must have lost something really precious

92
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,120
 in the trash. Yeah. Right. So what you can do and the story that I was reading about,

93
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,280
 it's in a bunch of places, but in Montgomery County in Maryland, you can call up your local

94
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,280
 trash place. And if the truck is still doing its rounds, they will separate the truck into

95
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,760
 a different area when it gets the dump, dump the entire contents out and you can come in

96
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,800
 to go through all the trash to find your lost thing. So it's a 10 ton pile of trash basically.

97
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,560
 They let you go in it. What would it have to be? Do you think? A wedding ring or a passport

98
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,000
 if you were leaving the country? Like things, a child can throw away a thing, right? Yeah.

99
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,560
 A child's teddy. If I lost one of my teddies in the bin when I was four, my parents would

100
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,080
 have both been in that rubbish dump for hours looking for it. Yeah. And on the FAQs, when

101
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,840
 you read their site for doing it, it says time available to work. And it says, we must

102
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,960
 clear out all trash that comes into the transfer station before our day is over. Therefore,

103
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:50,680
 we can give you a limited time of 30 minutes. We've had a few kind of TV formats that we've

104
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,240
 been pitching in the past. This is a TV show, waiting to be made, isn't it? 30 minutes.

105
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,320
 You're going to find your teddy in a whole bunch of shit. Yeah. And they sort of go,

106
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,080
 you might just notice your own personal black bag that you threw away amongst the 10 tons

107
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,520
 of black bags. Yeah, if you label them. Yeah, of course. I mean, don't you label yours?

108
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:17,280
 You're so labelled in, don't you? We've got to move on in a second. I've just got one

109
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,240
 more thing. I was looking into the telescopes and I was looking into numbers behind them.

110
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,220
 So this is a bit of a tangent. There's a number called Graham's number, which is so big that

111
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,400
 if you could imagine it properly, it would cause a black hole to form inside your head.

112
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,780
 What? No. Yes. That's just not what I understand about black holes. That's bullshit. No, it's

113
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,240
 not bullshit. It's real. Black holes form, right, when there's an enormously heavy mass,

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,240
 huge mass in a very small space, right? Yeah. This number is so big, there are so many digits

115
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,680
 in it, that if the smallest measurable space, a plank volume, was a digit and you had the

116
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,840
 entire observable universe to write with, you couldn't write it. Therefore, if in your

117
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,240
 head you could conceptualise every single one of those digits, a black hole would form

118
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,720
 in your head and destroy you. Wow. I've received an unexpectedly small amount of pushback on

119
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,240
 that fact. I'm thrilled. I'm not surprised you didn't get that job on countdown. I'm

120
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,640
 sure you guys know there's a plant that lives entirely off bat poo. We only realised this

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,000
 recently. It's a pitcher plant. You know those plants that are carnivorous and they're like

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,600
 champagne glasses, champagne flutes, and then insects fall into them and they eat them,

123
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,440
 but it was really confusing researchers because they weren't trapping any insects. They didn't

124
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,520
 have enough of the liquid in them. They were too big, but what researchers kept finding

125
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,480
 was that whole families of bats were nesting inside them. Turns out they've adapted, they've

126
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,960
 evolved to just become the home for hardwicks, woolly bats. This is in Borneo and they eat

127
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,040
 their guano. They attract them by basically they're shaped like this parabolic dish. Bats

128
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,760
 give out their sonar and then these pitcher plants are the only ones that are shaped perfectly

129
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,600
 to reflect that sonar straight back to the bat. That's amazing. Then they're like, "Okay,

130
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,400
 cool. That's the core of my home." Then they go to this plant, they go and live inside

131
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,040
 it, poo all over it, plant eats it up, and Bob's your uncle. That's amazing. There's

132
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,120
 another one that's in Borneo, I think, because I remember seeing it. It's like four, is

133
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,960
 it shrews as well? They do kind of a similar thing. They sit on the edge and then they

134
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,000
 kind of lick the pollen, but it's a laxative, so it makes them shit everywhere. The plant

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,760
 just goes, "Oh, yum." That's so amazing. It feels like the plant is a bit sentient

136
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,240
 there, right? I know you're going to say no, but okay, let's move on.

137
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,760
 There is a tunnel under Mont Blanc now. Oh, yeah. Is there? Yes.

138
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,600
 Like a rail tunnel or a rail tunnel? It's a tunnel. It doesn't matter whether it's

139
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,840
 old nuts. No, it's a road tunnel. It's a road tunnel, isn't it? Thanks, guys. Okay. Literally

140
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,720
 everyone in our audience knew that. Yeah, yeah. It's a road tunnel and it was started

141
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,760
 by one man who just decided to make a tunnel under Mont Blanc, freelance off his own bat.

142
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,640
 He was a count called Dino Lora Tatina. He was Italian and when he was growing up, getting

143
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,400
 between France and Italy around Mont Blanc is a massive pain and it took about 18 hours

144
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,560
 to make the journey and he called it an accursed mountain. He grew up in the shadow of it and

145
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,160
 he became a wealthy businessman. He owned a wool factory and he said, "I'm going to do

146
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,760
 something about Mont Blanc." He just started digging with no permission from anyone. He

147
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,400
 got 250 meters into the granite on the Italian side and the authorities eventually said,

148
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,120
 "What are you doing?" They stopped him and then it's fine. He was stopped, but by that

149
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,160
 point the plans were in progress and France and Italy eventually agreed. They were really

150
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,120
 nervous about it as well because it was only 15 years after the Second World War ended and

151
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,520
 they thought, "This feels like giving the other country a route just to pass military

152
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,760
 vehicles straight into our country," but they did agree on it and eventually it was

153
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,400
 completed in about 1962. So now the 18 hour journey takes 10 minutes.

154
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 That's so cool.

155
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,560
 Yeah, I have been through that tunnel actually because we got a speeding ticket on the French

156
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,920
 side on the way in and then on the way out on the Italian side.

157
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,040
 Wow. What an example of learning nothing from crashes.

158
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,500
 I went to the dentist for the first time in two years the other day and I went because

159
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,440
 I had a bit of a problem and when I got there, the dentist misheard me when I said my name

160
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,800
 and put me down as Samuel Schreiber. I didn't correct her and so for the whole thing while

161
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
 she was setting it up, I was called Samuel Schreiber, which I thought was quite cool.

162
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,840
 That's a nice cool name. Anyway, it turns out when she found out my name wasn't Samuel,

163
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,520
 she gave me a lot of crap saying, "You can't do this. This is all in all the systems now.

164
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,320
 This is all the records." And she spent half an hour undoing it and then ran out of time

165
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,760
 and she wasn't able to look at my teeth. So I have to go back in six weeks with a pain.

166
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,000
 I thought you were going to say when she realized it wasn't you, the tooth that she pulled out,

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,600
 she shoved back in.

168
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,640
 But it is important to identify people by their dental records sometimes.

169
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 Yes.

170
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,760
 You know, so if they say, well, we found Alastair Jedzky, James Harkett, Andrew Antemari,

171
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,760
 and someone called Samuel Schreiber, it's going to be confusing.

172
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,000
 It is confusing. Yeah. And I've got a painful tooth because of my dickheadness.

173
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,920
 Sea gulls use humans as taste testers. This is so weird. This happens at the seaside.

174
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,760
 There's a scientist called Madeline Goumas and she approached 38 gulls with a bucket,

175
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,040
 right? Each bucket had a flapjack in. Sounds like a riddle, doesn't it? A wonderful riddle.

176
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,320
 She would unwrap both flapjacks, right? And then she would pretend to eat one of the flapjacks

177
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
 for about 20 seconds. She's sort of mime nibbling away at it, right?

178
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,280
 So then she would put down the flapjacks. When sea gulls approached and got involved

179
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,360
 with the food that she'd just left, 19 out of 24 times, they approached the one that

180
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,800
 she had been pretending to eat.

181
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,320
 Sea gulls are way more interested. It could just be that they're dicks. And it's like,

182
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,160
 "Oh, she was really enjoying that one, so I'm going to steal that one from her."

183
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,920
 Yeah. I mean, her thesis is that they know that handled food is probably good for you

184
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
 and not going to kill you. But your theory also cuts a lot of ice, frankly.

185
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,680
 But also maybe the other thing is that it's discarded food. She ate it, she no longer wants

186
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,560
 it, so I'll take that and we're going to have a cool symbiotic relationship. It's like,

187
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,200
 "Cool, I'm not going to touch your good stuff."

188
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,000
 How many sea gulls have you met, Dan? Because symbiosis is not on their to-do list.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,680
 When they steal a chip out of his mouth, it's like, "Oh, it's okay, I wasn't going to eat

190
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 that anyway."

191
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,280
 That's nature. Good on you.

192
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,120
 More on the weirdness of a kid in the body is just a bit because we've mentioned a few

193
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,320
 things, but they have so little stuff that we take for granted. So they have no stomachs,

194
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,960
 they have no teeth, they just have to crush their food up against the roof of their mouth

195
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:06,720
 with their tongue, they have no nipples. So when the baby hatches and is in a little pouch,

196
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,120
 there are these glands which just leak directly out of their skin. They're very basic, basically.

197
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,720
 They have to pop when just for the baby itself, they have to kind of like curl up and pop

198
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,760
 it out of their bum, because they're an animal that is called like monohull, I don't know

199
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,120
 how to say it, monotreme. That's it.

200
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,200
 It's sort of fact number one about a kid on the Wikipedia page, they are a monotreme

201
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 bum.

202
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:42,680
 Monohull. I missed that episode of the Simpsons. Monohull, monohull, monohull.

203
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:51,720
 They are one-hulled, it's their bum and they're everything, it's a monohull. So they bring

204
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,920
 it up and then the baby sort of pops out and obviously there's an egg which is cracked

205
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,680
 and it pops out and then they have a pouch, much like a kangaroo does, and the baby crawls

206
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,040
 along and it goes inside and that's where the milk is secreted into.

207
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,720
 Wait, are you talking about goodness? Yeah.

208
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
 That's not what happens.

209
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 Oh, shit.

210
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,480
 How is the baby crawling along? It's an egg.

211
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
 It's what?

212
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,560
 The baby, the baby's in an egg, right? So the way the mother...

213
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,320
 Oh, it's like a kangaroo, isn't it? A joey who climbs up.

214
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,360
 I'm afraid that's the difference between your monotremes and your marsupials.

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
 Your Dolby dreams.

216
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 Yeah.

217
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
 Right.

218
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
 Okay, so...

219
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,280
 But it is very fun, the way they give birth. The mother, it's much harder than as a kangaroo

220
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,480
 because you can just give birth and the thing sorts itself out, clutches at your hair and

221
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
 crawls up.

222
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
 Right.

223
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,160
 As an echidna, you lie on your back and you give birth, the egg comes out in egg form,

224
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,280
 no legs, and they have to sort of shimmy it up their stomach. A bit like... Oh, you know

225
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,800
 that game where you have to get an after-eight down your forehead?

226
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 I was just...

227
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,560
 And pop it in your pouch, and then it sits in your pouch for a few more days.

228
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's a different game when the after-eight comes out of your vagina, isn't it?

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Right.

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,440
 Well, it kind of gets late, some parties, you know.

231
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
 My gosh.

232
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,000
 I was thinking, yeah, that ping-pong ball talent thing is a...

233
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Oh, interesting.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 They were the originators.

235
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Talent.

236
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's a talent.

237
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It is a talent.

238
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Yeah.

239
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I haven't seen it.

240
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It is a talent.

241
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Yeah, yeah.

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I haven't.

243
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I thought they'd laid what was inside the ping-pong ball, and that's what shot out.

244
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I didn't realize that it was... Anyway, let's move on.

245
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 In fact, we actually do need to move on to our next fact.

246
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 That was the terrible insight into Dan's internal monologue there, wasn't it?

247
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I felt really alone there.

248
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I think you were alone.

249
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It was incredible.

250
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I also felt like everyone, 900 people were going, "Shh, just..."

251
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Let's see where it goes.

252
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Let's see where it goes.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Quite similarly, she was the oldest person ever in a rap song.

254
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Ah!

255
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And again, someone just recorded her saying, "Je m'appelle, je m'pellement."

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 What's happening, Dan?

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 You broke the table?

258
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 My table's falling down.

259
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I'm literally holding it up.

260
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You were telling such a good story, and they didn't want to do anything.

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I actually think we might all be one of Dan's terrible dreams.

262
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Can't fucking believe this.

263
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 He's going to be naked and have to do an exam in a minute.

264
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Okay, don't lean on this table, okay, Dan?

265
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Holy shit.

266
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Don't touch it.

267
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I was literally, I was like, "Rawr!"

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Like, who are Atlas?

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 You're like Atlas there, holding up the world.

270
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I like this.

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I was reading about this group of people that like to get to the top of a mountain

272
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 or somewhere a bit hard to get to and set up a jacuzzi.

273
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And then they all hop in the jacuzzi,

274
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 and they managed to do this on the top of Mont Blanc,

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 which, even though a lot of people assume it's quite an easy mountain to climb,

276
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 it's responsible for a huge number of deaths.

277
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It is a very hard mountain to get to.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So they packed up all their stuff,

279
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 and they managed to get this jacuzzi on top of there.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And you can see photos of about 30 people who've gone through all the night

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 treaching up there.

282
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Yeah, yeah, and setting it up.

283
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And using, it's heated by the snow with the system that they have.

284
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Heated by the snow?

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Yeah, so they have a system.

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And, oh shit, okay.

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 [laughter]

288
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 So, they put the snow onto these kind of really cool things that then heat up the water

289
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 that somehow they've brought up with them.

290
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Have they brought water up?

291
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 No, you wouldn't bring water to the top of Mont Blanc.

292
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Why would you do that?

293
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 That's not necessary.

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Why would you do that?

295
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So, it was really hot because it was powered by snow.

296
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And, okay, so they get to the top.

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Here's the fascinating thing.

298
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 They're on the top of Mont Blanc.

299
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And suddenly this Italian group that climbs up and they see them,

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 and obviously it's a shock for anyone that suddenly sees a jacuzzi full of people

301
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 and their swimwear on the top.

302
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 But it just so happens this Italian group had already met these people in a jacuzzi

303
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 on a previous mountain that they'd been on before,

304
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 completely by coincidence, got up there and they're like, "You again?"

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And they now just think there's someone in a jacuzzi at the top of every mountain, don't they?

306
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Yeah, exactly.

307
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 That's so funny.

308
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It is funny, and so it doesn't matter about how you can make a jacuzzi full of snow.

309
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 This has not been a good one for me, guys.

310
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I'll admit that right now.

311
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It's been a shitter.

312
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 We need to move on to our next fact, guys.

313
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Oh, can I just talk about an origin of life thing?

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Yeah.

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I really like.

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 So there were lots of theories about where life started and most of my sensible scientists,

317
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 but one was by an American homeopath at the start of the 20th century called Charles Wentworth Littlefield,

318
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 and he was reported as a scientist and it was in all the news that he's found out where life comes from

319
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 and the way he found it was he took some salt out of one of his patient's wounds

320
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and he looked at it under a microscope while thinking about chicken

321
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 and he saw it turn into a chicken.

322
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Sorry.

323
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 He took some stuff from a patient's wound.

324
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Some salt.

325
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Something like bodily salts, basically.

326
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 He said, "Sift them out."

327
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 He looked under a microscope and thought about chicken.

328
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It turned into the shape of a chicken, not a live chicken.

329
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 That would be stupid.

330
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But he realised that by concentrating on any grain of salt,

331
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 he could make it transform into the thing he was thinking about,

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and it was always inanimate until he thought about octopuses, tiny, tiny octopuses,

333
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 and then he created live octopuses from these grains of salt

334
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and he concluded that this must be how life initially formed.

335
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Okay.

336
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Well, who was doing the thinking?

337
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 That's the question.

338
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I suppose that's where God comes into it.

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 What was the octopus bit, though?

340
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 He thought of octopuses and they didn't turn to octopuses.

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 No, they did turn into octopuses, but they were alive, so it was life.

342
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Sorry.

343
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Wow.

344
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Given that all this is complete bullshit, what is the outcome?

345
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Hang on, don't judge it just yet, because there is a theory as well

346
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 that octopuses are actually aliens that came to Earth,

347
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and so that wouldn't be the original life, right?

348
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So this guy was probably just going through every single animal

349
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 and then suddenly hit on the one that actually, if you stare at it long enough,

350
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 does turn into a living octopus.

351
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I should just say that theory is also bullshit.

352
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I think it's demeaning us, James, to say it's bullshit.

353
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So what was he just crazy, this person?

354
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Yeah, he was just taken vaguely seriously in the news at the turn of the century.

355
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Wow.

356
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And you know, I like the idea, and who's tried it?

357
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Who's tried looking at salt and thinking of an octopus?

358
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Not me.

359
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Yeah.

360
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So don't knock it.

361
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Well, listen, okay, this half of the table thinks there's something to it.

362
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 That half of the table doesn't it?

363
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I'm not signing up to this.

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Instead of the first car on the moon, we almost had the first pogo stick.

365
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 What?

366
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 There was debate, so as I said earlier, Apollo 15 was the first mission

367
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 where there was actually a vehicle that was driven around.

368
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 They drove it around.

369
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And they were there for three days.

370
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 They drove it around for like at least six hours a day,

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 which actually is just quite a long time to be driving.

372
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's a lot.

373
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

374
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And they had to wear seat belts.

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 The seat belts really didn't fit.

376
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And they took ages trying to get the seat belts on, which seems so weird to me.

377
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 How many obstacles are there?

378
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 How many cars coming at you?

379
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 There's a lot of rocks around them.

380
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 There are a lot of craters and dips.

381
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Okay, I reckon I could hack it.

382
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I don't know.

383
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I'd rather seat belt.

384
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 That's the main question at the NASA astronaut selection actually.

385
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Do you reckon you could hack it?

386
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Yeah.

387
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Come on then.

388
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Come on in.

389
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Anyway, there were lots of ideas for what kind of vehicle to design for the moon.

390
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 NASA was very interested in a motorcycle at first.

391
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I thought that might work.

392
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And then there was the idea for a giant pogo stick,

393
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 which would be manned by two people.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I think sort of one on each.

395
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I feel like things that you do to get yourself along the railway tracks.

396
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You know, those things.

397
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 That's not what a pogo stick is.

398
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 No, but it's manned by two people, you know.

399
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Yeah, but so is a pedalo.

400
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 A seesaw.

401
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I don't think the audience needed a simile for manned by two people.

402
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I just just didn't want to picture that.

403
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Maybe they'd each be standing at one end of the pogo stick,

404
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 and then one would go up and one would go down at the same time.

405
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 That is a seesaw.

406
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 That's not a pogo stick.

407
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Yeah.

408
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Okay, look, we've drilled down and we've acetate that.

409
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 I don't know what a pogo stick is.

410
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 You are failing that NASA interview.

411
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 If they're testing laboratories,

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 dog food is often used to put down them,

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 because it has a sort of, to simulate the stuff.

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It's got the same consistency as my poo, for example.

415
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Do you get it in jelly or in gravy?

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Okay, my poo?

417
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Okay.

418
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Sure.

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 You know, there's quite a range of textures, isn't there?

420
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 But I suppose that's to a poo and dog food.

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 James, I want to split off and start a one podcast.

422
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Just on this table.

423
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 There used to be a takeaway place near me

424
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 that would cut off the top of a loaf of bread,

425
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and they'd hollow it out, and then they'd just pour in a stew,

426
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and they'd give you the bread back.

427
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 That sounds great.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 It was a South African thing, I think.

429
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Okay.

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Say again.

431
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Bunny chow.

432
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Sonny chow.

433
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Yeah.

434
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Bunny chow.

435
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I don't think it was a bunny in it.

436
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I think it was a better option, but it's very nice.

437
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Well, on Christmas, very quickly,

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 the aviator, he claimed to be the third person

439
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 to fly in America, but we think he probably didn't,

440
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 because his planes were all terrible.

441
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 He kept inventing these really awful planes,

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 so there was one called the Christmas Bullet.

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 The wings were supposed to flap as you flew,

444
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 but unfortunately, they crashed on his maiden flight,

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 and then they made another one, and that one crashed as well.

446
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 He made another design when it was a plane

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 which had a huge hole in the top.

448
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 His idea was, right, if you get a parachute,

449
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 a lot of parachutes have a hole in the top,

450
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 and that's because you don't want all the air

451
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 to properly just get properly into the parachute,

452
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 otherwise it might get a bit wobbly,

453
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 so he thought, why don't I do that for a plane?

454
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Interesting.

455
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Right.

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 I hope they tell you when you do a parachute jump

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 about the whole thing, because I can't imagine

458
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 how fucking terrified I'd be if my parachute,

459
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 because I looked up, there was a huge hole in the top.

460
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Could be worse.

461
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 James, when you said they have to have a hole in the top,

462
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I just thought, I thought you were going to say,

463
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 because obviously, if the aero goes up in there,

464
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 it just gets stuck in there and you just stay

465
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 where you are in the sky.

466
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 That's how that works, yeah?

467
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Do you know that, you may have seen it,

468
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 actually, this is extremely cutting-edge

469
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 soup news right now.

470
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Hines have just released a Christmas soup,

471
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 which is very exciting.

472
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 They've just announced it as a kind of PR thing.

473
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 They've only made 500 tins, but it's got, you know,

474
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 everything.

475
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 It's got turkey, sprouts, stuffing, roast potatoes,

476
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 pigs in blankets, gravy, cranberry sauce.

477
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Well, I mean, that sounds all right,

478
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 because at least it's one course.

479
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Have they just mushed it all up?

480
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 No, you get chunks of turkey and things like that.

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Oh, right, yeah, there are chunks.

482
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Oh, James, don't worry.

483
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 There are chunks.

484
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But it could be worse, because in 2013,

485
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 game, the video game people,

486
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 they launched a thing called a Christmas dinner,

487
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 which was for people too addictive to video games

488
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 to cook anything on Christmas Day,

489
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 and the top layer was scrambled egg and bacon.

490
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Then there was a layer of mincemeat.

491
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Then there was some turkey and trimmings,

492
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 and then there was a Christmas pudding

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 in the bottom of the tin.

494
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Where are all the quality street?

495
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Wow.

496
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Yeah.

497
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Are you allowed to eat a painting?

498
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 What do you mean, are you allowed to eat a painting?

499
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Legally, if you own a painting, this is...

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Of course, if you own it, you can do what you want.

501
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Well, you're absolutely right.

502
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 OK, it's time for

503
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 fact number three.

504
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Any more? Any more for that, no?

505
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Not really.

506
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Is that mid-busted?

507
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It's just, you know, would you be allowed to eat the Mona Lisa

508
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 if you owned it, probably?

509
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Yeah, yeah.

510
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Well, you're right.

511
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Has someone put this in the statue books?

512
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Yes, they have. Thank you, Anna.

513
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Good question. Is the 1990...

514
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Oh, no, hang on.

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 No, it is all right, actually.

516
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 There are laws about works that might still be in copyright,

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 so if it's within 75 years of the artist's death,

518
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 or works that are protected

519
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 under the 1990 Visual Artist Rights Act,

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 you're not allowed to eat some of those protected ones.

521
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 But the good news is, anything from Caravaggio's time

522
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 is on the menu.

523
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Wow!

524
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 That's interesting.

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 We really had to pull it out of you,

526
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 but 75 days after...

527
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 75 days after...

528
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 75 days?

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Yes!

530
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I was just...

531
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Okay, cool. 75 years.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 That's Christmas lunch sorted

533
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 in the Hunter Murray household.

534
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Oh, boy.

535
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I think the very first-ever study of it,

536
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 the long-beaked echidna, it's called,

537
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 was published in 2009.

538
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And even then, the study author,

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 who was a guy called Musee Opiang,

540
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 was 500 hours studying them

541
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 before even seeing one.

542
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Wow!

543
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Was he studying them, then?

544
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Really, for that first 500 hours?

545
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 He was warming up. He was doing stretches.

546
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 They are quite hard to find, though, aren't they?

547
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 There was a guy, the first scientist,

548
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 to study the testicles of echidnas.

549
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 He did that by employing Aboriginal people

550
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 to find these echidnas for him.

551
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And he always paid more for the females,

552
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 because it was more hard to find the females.

553
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 I think that of all you...

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It is much harder to find the females' testicles.

555
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Is that what he said?

556
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 He did lots of studying,

557
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 but he happens to be the first person

558
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 to have studied the testicles.

559
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 This guy actually committed suicide.

560
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 He was a German scientist.

561
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 He committed suicide in 1918

562
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 while wrapped in a German flag,

563
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 because he was so upset with the way the war was going.

564
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 But, yeah, he was most famous, I think,

565
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 for studying the testicles of the echidnas,

566
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 and his name was Dick Seaman.

567
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 What? Richard W. Seaman.

568
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Oh, my God, that's incredible.

569
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 A, change your name.

570
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 B, don't study testicles if your name is Dick Seaman.

571
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 [laughter]

572
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Well, kind of...

573
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 All right, Dan. I mean, the guy was obviously a troubled man.

574
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Let's not kick him while he's down.

575
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Okay, fair enough.

576
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Seriously, weird thing. So random.

577
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 On soup, Ted Cruz, you remember Ted Cruz,

578
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 came second to Trump in the primaries.

579
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 2016, during those primaries,

580
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 his wife revealed that after they got back from their honeymoon,

581
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 the first thing he did was he went out to the shop,

582
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 said he was going shopping, he came home,

583
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 and all he had was 100 cans of Campbell's soup.

584
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And so she said,

585
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 "We had to have a tough conversation."

586
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Well, I explained to him,

587
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 "You don't come back with 100 of anything.

588
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 "Low-loan Campbell's soup."

589
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 He said, "You know you're not going to cook love,

590
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 "so this is what I'll be eating for the rest of our marriage."

591
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And she was...

592
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Look, he didn't say to put it in those terms.

593
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Don't worry.

594
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Basically, that's what he said.

595
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 She snuck out and returned them all the next morning

596
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 before he woke up.

597
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And then she talked to her mum on the phone,

598
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 and her mum said, "Are you going to cook for him, though?"

599
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And she went, "No, I'm a terrible cook. Can't cook at all."

600
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Her mum was like, "Go and get the soup back."

601
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 She went and got the soup back.

602
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 No!

603
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Yeah.

604
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Well, that's a beautiful marriage, right there.

605
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 There's one cashier at the soup shop

606
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 who has no idea about this whole story,

607
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 just as a weird thing where some guy turned up, bought 110s,

608
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 lady came and took them away.

609
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Yeah, then returned, demanded them back.

610
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 "What's going on? Am I on a reality TV show?"

611
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Can I tell you one more trick?

612
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Yeah, we're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

613
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Okay, this is a trick by one of the greatest magicians of all time,

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Robert Houdin, who Houdini got his name from.

615
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 This is the trick.

616
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 He would take a handkerchief from an audience member.

617
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 He would turn that into a file of liquid.

618
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 He would pour that liquid on a dry twig.

619
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 That would sprout and grow into a bush.

620
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 The bush would then grow oranges on it.

621
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Robert Houdin would pick the oranges off the bush.

622
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 He would throw them into the audience one by one.

623
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 The final one, he would split open.

624
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Out of that final orange, two butterflies would fly,

625
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 living butterflies, holding the handkerchief between them.

626
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 No!

627
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 And return it to the audience member.

628
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 The butterflies would return it.

629
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And we're going to do that tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

630
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 But unfortunately, no one has a handkerchief anymore.

631
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Sorry!

632
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Can I just tell you one more thing about postcards?

633
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 In 2017, a Europe poll, so kind of like Interpol, but for Europe,

634
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 they started trying to catch criminals through the mechanism of postcards.

635
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 They developed these postcards,

636
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 each one featuring one of Europe's highest-profile fugitives.

637
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And they said things like, "Dear Arta, Belgium fries are the best,

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 "and we know you missed them. Come back to enjoy them.

639
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 "We'll have a nice surprise in store for you."

640
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 That was for a famous drug dealer.

641
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 So did they send them to him?

642
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 No, they just published them and made people aware that these people were on the run.

643
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Because they're going to say if he knew where he lived to send them a postcard.

644
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 That's true. It's so true.

645
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Hi, David, we've been trying to get hold of you because there is still so much to discuss.

646
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Please get in touch soon, the police.

647
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 So someone accused of multiple, quite serious sexual offences,

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 and they won an award for it, and three criminals were actually...

649
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 But there's sexual offences!

650
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 They didn't win a... Sorry.

651
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Okay.

652
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 It's hard, it's very hard to transplant testicles, obviously,

653
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 onto a different part of the body.

654
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Oh, sorry.

655
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Why?

656
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 So, actually, who's...

657
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 What a shame.

658
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I got that thought around.

659
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Which part of the body was it?

660
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 It's actually a lot easier to transplant testicles

661
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 onto a different part of the body than into a scrotum.

662
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And this has been tested on rats.

663
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 So, a few years ago, a team put a load of testicles of rats.

664
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 They did some transplants,

665
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 and they moved the testicles either into other rat scrotii,

666
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 or onto the necks of the other rats.

667
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And it had a much higher success rate, the transplant,

668
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 if the testicles were just put on the necks of the rats.

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Really? Yeah.

670
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 But you'd be pissed off with your surgeon when you woke up,

671
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 if they said, "Well, transplant wasn't successful."

672
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Of course, it was easier to do it onto your forehead.

673
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 So, we've done it.

674
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 I thought you didn't mind.

675
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 It's so strange that you have a tiger with canine teeth,

676
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 because they're felines, but they've got canines.

677
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 You know what I mean?

678
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Yeah.

679
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 That's weird, that, isn't it?

680
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 It makes you think.

681
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 It really does.

682
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 What does it make you think about?

683
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 It doesn't really make me think about anything.

684
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 It just makes me think in a kind of abstract way.

685
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Bill Gates is intending to block out the sun.

686
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 What do you mean?

687
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 He wants to use some of his money to help scientists at Harvard University

688
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 who are proposing an experiment that can hopefully stop global warming

689
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 by sending a balloon up there, sending a load of particles into the atmosphere,

690
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 where the sun's rays will come down, bounce off into space,

691
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 and it will be less hot on Earth.

692
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 I can't see that going wrong.

693
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 No!

694
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 I saw it, why not?

695
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Let's do it.

696
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Let's do it.

697
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 I'm up for it.

698
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 It's going to look like we're at a worldwide children's birthday party.

699
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 That's quite cool.

700
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 That would be cool.

701
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 That would be cool.

702
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 He's one of the few people in the world who has a McDonald's gold card.

703
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I don't know if it's connected to this.

704
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 What's that?

705
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 McDonald's gold card is where you can go to any McDonald's,

706
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 you hand it in, and no matter what you've ordered, they give it to you for free.

707
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Oh, thank God.

708
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Because otherwise, how would he be able to afford a Big Mac?

709
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 So we don't have it in the UK.

710
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 What we have is the Nando's black card, which is quite a famous card,

711
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 which I've experienced a couple of times.

712
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I have, yeah.

713
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 A couple of friends of mine have had it.

714
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 So Tom Davis, who is King Gary, he once had it.

715
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 The other guy had to stop using it because he was...

716
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Good luck with the Nando's lawsuit, Dan.

717
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 I am not saying...

718
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Good point. Let's edit that out.

719
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 We're not saying that Nando's...

720
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 We're not. Put it from your mind.

721
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 There was an amazing thing that happened in the Netherlands at the start of this year.

722
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Actually, it was the end of last year, and that was that there was an Armenian family

723
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 who'd been living in the Netherlands for nine years,

724
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 and the country had decided they wanted to deport them.

725
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 And they were like, "Well, we can't go back to Armenia

726
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 because if we go back, we'll be in terrible trouble."

727
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And they said to the church, "What are we going to do?"

728
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Apparently, there's an old and obscured Dutch law that police aren't allowed to arrest someone

729
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 in the middle of a church service.

730
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And so, the local church started a mass that went on for 24 hours a day for 97 days.

731
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Wow.

732
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 While this family were living in the church.

733
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 They started off doing it for a few days, a few days.

734
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Eventually, more than 650 clergy members were signing up to be the next person to do it.

735
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 They kind of tag-teamed all the priests.

736
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Wow.

737
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 And eventually, the government just thought, "Fuck this."

738
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 And they went, "Fine, you can stay, you can stay, you can stay."

739
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Oh, really?

740
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 I would have thought they'd go, "Fuck this, we're going to walk in and arrest you anyway."

741
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 It's the law.

742
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 You can't break the law if you're a government, can you?

743
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 What?

744
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Well...

745
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Caravaggio died, maybe, of sunstroke, we think.

746
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Really?

747
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Yeah, this is what people have claimed.

748
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I couldn't define what their evidence was, except that.

749
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 So, researchers, there's this big mystery of how he died, or shrouded in mystery.

750
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Like, was he murdered?

751
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Was he poisoned?

752
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Did he have syphilis?

753
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And they thought in 2010 that they found some of his bones, fragments of his bones.

754
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 They studied his bones, these researchers.

755
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And they said, it showed signs of lead poisoning and syphilis.

756
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 But they think what eventually killed him was sunstroke.

757
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 And then the only evidence I could find that they had was that 1610 was an extremely hot year.

758
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 What?

759
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 That's the reason, darling.

760
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 That makes sense, yeah.

761
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 It's been quite cold this winter.

762
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 In future, every single person who died this year, people will look at them and go,

763
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 "I reckon that was the cold that killed this one."

764
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 I'm not sure they were.

765
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 I think they might be.

766
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 It was a very heavy cold.

767
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 A bit too much Nando, sir, I reckon.

768
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 No, we can't keep that in.

769
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 It has to stay.

770
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 It has to stay.

771
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Who's full of tingers?

772
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Gates or Nando's?

773
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 We'll find out when this episode goes out.

774
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Okay, that's it.

775
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 That's all of our facts.

776
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Very much hope you enjoyed that show.

784
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 then it's Christmas, guys.

785
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Give us a break.

786
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 We were only joking.

787
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Okay, listen, we'll be back next week at the start of 2022, can you believe it, with a whole new episode.

788
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 So we will see you then.

789
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Goodbye!
