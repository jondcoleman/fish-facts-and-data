00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
 Hi everyone, it is New Year's Eve if you're hearing this on the day that this episode

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:16.300
 drops. Wow, 2021, what a year, eh? Phew, dear goodness. Well, we got through it, we got

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 through it and 2022 I'm sure will hold lots and lots of exciting things for all of you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 people and all of us as well. So what do we have for you this week? Well, we have a compilation

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.880
 of outtakes from our latest tour. We like to think that we are the pros, we've been doing

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.340
 this for 400 episodes, we've been doing it for almost 8 years, surely everything is so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.320
 slick that nothing ever goes wrong. Well, if you've actually been to one of our shows,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.040
 you know that things quite often do go wrong. Sometimes we say things that we can't possibly

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.400
 put out on the podcast, unless I very heavily censor them. Sometimes it's a really good

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.060
 fact and it just doesn't quite fit in the final edit. Sometimes the set just falls to pieces

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.660
 all around us and so what I've done is I've collected all those things together and put

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.200
 them into a compilation of all the craziest bits from the last few months of touring fish.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240
 Really hope you enjoy it. We'll be back with a normal episode for the first show of 2022

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:35.020
 for the time being. Hope you enjoy the show on with the podcast.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.540
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. My name is Dan Schreiber

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.680
 and I'm sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Hawken and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.040
 seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.760
 is James. Did you not bring your microphone? Do you know I'm so relieved about that because

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.920
 I forgot to bring my drinks on. All right, you two go off cover. Should we start again?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.320
 So it turns out unbelievable. Listeners at home, James forgot to bring his microphone

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.360
 and I forgot to bring her drink. I can't work out which is worse. I'm here, Dan. Thank

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.400
 you, Andy. Dan, I don't think anyone's noticed. I think if we go straight to me, Dan, though.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.160
 It's hilarious you didn't bring your microphone. I think what's funny is it was only when I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.960
 was speaking. I started speaking and my voice is a lot quieter than normal. And you started

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.680
 looking at your empty hands and you were like, what? Amazing. Absolute pros. Eight years

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.160
 you've been doing this. Okay, it's time for fact number one and that is James. Okay,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:00.560
 my fact this week. It's gonna make no sense in the edit when this show goes out. His real

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.440
 name is not Caravaggio. Yeah, he's actually called Michelangelo, but that name was taken.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.360
 So he had to resort to where he was born. So Leonardo da Vinci, that's not his surname,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.120
 it's of Vinci. That's where he's born. Same thing with Caravaggio. Michelangelo, Merisida,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.480
 Caravaggio, of Caravaggio. So that just became his nickname. And do you know why he was called

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.920
 Michelangelo? No. It's because he was born, we think probably, on the 29th of December,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.400
 which was the feast of the Archangel, Michel, which is also my birthday. Wait, your birthday

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.920
 is not 29th of December. September. Oh, did you say September? You said December. Yeah.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:53.640
 But by the time the edit goes out, I won't have done. Is there a reason why clownfish

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.800
 are so good to experiment on? Do we know? I'm actually not sure. We probably mentioned

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.760
 it at some point in our 300 podcast, so you should go back and check. Just kind of funny.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.880
 Yeah. Good looking. Yeah. Photogenic. You can fit a load of clownfish in the same car,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.960
 which is useful for research purposes. That's something. And do you know why he was called

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.480
 Michelangelo? No. It's because he was born, we think probably, on the 29th of September,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.960
 which was the feast of the Archangel, Michel, which is also my birthday. I was looking into,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.980
 I was just looking into names of dentists. There's always that thing that if you're called

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.240
 Dennis, you're going to be a dentist, you know, more. There's the idea, and there's been

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.640
 lots of studies to show that Dennis or Denise, you'll be a dentist. And so I found a few

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.200
 names where it does feel like you're being pulled into it. So Rachel B. Pullin was one.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:55.280
 And then in Rutland, there is a dentistry that are called Dennis and Deneth Stental Practice.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:06.480
 What? You said that again. Denteth and denteth. Denteth. D-E-N-T-I-T-H and denteth. But when

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.120
 they get their braces off, they're going to have to change the name, aren't they? So good.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.440
 In the 1960s, some women were taught how to breastfeed using sock puppets. Sock puppets.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.880
 So they would, I mean, we're just doing the sock puppet symbol. Yeah. Well, there were

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.120
 knitted nitted breasts as well. So there were knitted sock puppets and then knitted breasts

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.960
 to kind of demonstrate how the baby latches on. So the sock puppet would suck on the knitted

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.280
 breast as opposed to the real breast? Yes, that's right. Like a weird punch and judy show?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.760
 It's a very weird punch and judy show. In fact, I told one of our colleagues this in

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.520
 the office the other day, and immediately he said punch and booby. Yeah.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.040
 There was also an advent Christmas clock, wasn't there, which had 24 hands on it. And

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.120
 so you would move the hand. 24 hands? Yeah. I'm sorry. 24 spots for the hand to move

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.280
 on. And so you would move it each day. And that was a primitive version of the eye talent.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.120
 Your clock will be so cheap. You just want 24 hands on a clock. Just look at the relevant

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.040
 hand to know what the time is.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.440
 Do you remember the time when they asked if they could put our podcast on British Airways

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.560
 flights? Yes. Oh, yeah. And they said, well, can you go back through your first 100 episodes

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.920
 and remove? We don't want anyone's where you mentioned plane crashes. And it turned out

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.240
 we mentioned it in every single episode. Yeah. It was bizarre. It was truly bizarre.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.080
 It was so weird. Yeah. It was weird. We've already done it in this one. Yeah. Do you know,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.480
 can I just say a non-orgasm thing to do with llamas, which is that llamas, there was a

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.840
 photo that was taken in the 20s, which led to an international incident where Tibetan

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.480
 monks, or monks, I think they were Tibet, were flown over. And there was a photo taken

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.800
 of them with llamas. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And this calls, so a llama with a llama was the idea

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.760
 that the British did when they brought them over. And it led to big problems because,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.640
 so this was part of publicity for a 1924 film, which was filmed by a guy called Captain John

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.520
 Noll, who provided, for me, the greatest fact that I think I've ever brought to this show,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.200
 which is he said that it's easier to escape a female yeti than it is a male yeti because

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.680
 female yetis have such long dangling boobs that before they can chase you, they need to

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.640
 chuck them over the shoulders and tie them like a scarf. Otherwise, they might trip on

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.380
 them as they're chasing you. And then the time it takes them to do all that, you can

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.120
 escape. So that's Captain John Noll who said that. And he was responsible for bringing

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:47.280
 the llamas to meet the lamas. Yeah. So he was the official filmmaker on the Mallory Expedition.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.640
 He's the one who filmed the whole thing. He made it into a big movie. And it was a, you

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.120
 know, a Hollywood nominated movie. And it's still to the say, it's a classic. But the

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.120
 publicity that he did is what actually banned any more attempts from happening on Mount

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.960
 Everest, because the authorities were so furious about the way that the religion was parodied

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.960
 by having llamas next to llama. We weren't allowed to go back to Mount Everest for ages.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.880
 That's interesting. That happened when I tried to put some bananas in some pajamas. It's

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.040
 also happened to me. Who are you? Who's the parodying? The bananas or the pajamas? I don't

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.880
 know. I haven't got that far. I'm working on the joke. Here's one really weird thing.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.480
 I don't know if we can do this in the UK. I unfortunately found this way too late in

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.800
 the day to research this a bit more. But in other countries, this definitely happens.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.320
 So imagine you're at home, right? Everyone and the bins have just gone out. And suddenly

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.120
 you realize that you accidentally threw away or must have lost something really precious

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.120
 in the trash. Yeah. Right. So what you can do and the story that I was reading about,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.280
 it's in a bunch of places, but in Montgomery County in Maryland, you can call up your local

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.280
 trash place. And if the truck is still doing its rounds, they will separate the truck into

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.760
 a different area when it gets the dump, dump the entire contents out and you can come in

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.800
 to go through all the trash to find your lost thing. So it's a 10 ton pile of trash basically.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.560
 They let you go in it. What would it have to be? Do you think? A wedding ring or a passport

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.000
 if you were leaving the country? Like things, a child can throw away a thing, right? Yeah.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.560
 A child's teddy. If I lost one of my teddies in the bin when I was four, my parents would

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.080
 have both been in that rubbish dump for hours looking for it. Yeah. And on the FAQs, when

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.840
 you read their site for doing it, it says time available to work. And it says, we must

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.960
 clear out all trash that comes into the transfer station before our day is over. Therefore,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:50.680
 we can give you a limited time of 30 minutes. We've had a few kind of TV formats that we've

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.240
 been pitching in the past. This is a TV show, waiting to be made, isn't it? 30 minutes.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.320
 You're going to find your teddy in a whole bunch of shit. Yeah. And they sort of go,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.080
 you might just notice your own personal black bag that you threw away amongst the 10 tons

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.520
 of black bags. Yeah, if you label them. Yeah, of course. I mean, don't you label yours?

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.280
 You're so labelled in, don't you? We've got to move on in a second. I've just got one

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.240
 more thing. I was looking into the telescopes and I was looking into numbers behind them.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.220
 So this is a bit of a tangent. There's a number called Graham's number, which is so big that

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.400
 if you could imagine it properly, it would cause a black hole to form inside your head.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.780
 What? No. Yes. That's just not what I understand about black holes. That's bullshit. No, it's

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.240
 not bullshit. It's real. Black holes form, right, when there's an enormously heavy mass,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 huge mass in a very small space, right? Yeah. This number is so big, there are so many digits

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.680
 in it, that if the smallest measurable space, a plank volume, was a digit and you had the

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.840
 entire observable universe to write with, you couldn't write it. Therefore, if in your

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.240
 head you could conceptualise every single one of those digits, a black hole would form

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.720
 in your head and destroy you. Wow. I've received an unexpectedly small amount of pushback on

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:16.240
 that fact. I'm thrilled. I'm not surprised you didn't get that job on countdown. I'm

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.640
 sure you guys know there's a plant that lives entirely off bat poo. We only realised this

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.000
 recently. It's a pitcher plant. You know those plants that are carnivorous and they're like

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.600
 champagne glasses, champagne flutes, and then insects fall into them and they eat them,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.440
 but it was really confusing researchers because they weren't trapping any insects. They didn't

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.520
 have enough of the liquid in them. They were too big, but what researchers kept finding

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.480
 was that whole families of bats were nesting inside them. Turns out they've adapted, they've

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.960
 evolved to just become the home for hardwicks, woolly bats. This is in Borneo and they eat

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.040
 their guano. They attract them by basically they're shaped like this parabolic dish. Bats

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.760
 give out their sonar and then these pitcher plants are the only ones that are shaped perfectly

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.600
 to reflect that sonar straight back to the bat. That's amazing. Then they're like, "Okay,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.400
 cool. That's the core of my home." Then they go to this plant, they go and live inside

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:13.040
 it, poo all over it, plant eats it up, and Bob's your uncle. That's amazing. There's

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.120
 another one that's in Borneo, I think, because I remember seeing it. It's like four, is

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.960
 it shrews as well? They do kind of a similar thing. They sit on the edge and then they

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.000
 kind of lick the pollen, but it's a laxative, so it makes them shit everywhere. The plant

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.760
 just goes, "Oh, yum." That's so amazing. It feels like the plant is a bit sentient

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:38.240
 there, right? I know you're going to say no, but okay, let's move on.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.760
 There is a tunnel under Mont Blanc now. Oh, yeah. Is there? Yes.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.600
 Like a rail tunnel or a rail tunnel? It's a tunnel. It doesn't matter whether it's

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:56.840
 old nuts. No, it's a road tunnel. It's a road tunnel, isn't it? Thanks, guys. Okay. Literally

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.720
 everyone in our audience knew that. Yeah, yeah. It's a road tunnel and it was started

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:10.760
 by one man who just decided to make a tunnel under Mont Blanc, freelance off his own bat.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.640
 He was a count called Dino Lora Tatina. He was Italian and when he was growing up, getting

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.400
 between France and Italy around Mont Blanc is a massive pain and it took about 18 hours

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.560
 to make the journey and he called it an accursed mountain. He grew up in the shadow of it and

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.160
 he became a wealthy businessman. He owned a wool factory and he said, "I'm going to do

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.760
 something about Mont Blanc." He just started digging with no permission from anyone. He

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.400
 got 250 meters into the granite on the Italian side and the authorities eventually said,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.120
 "What are you doing?" They stopped him and then it's fine. He was stopped, but by that

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.160
 point the plans were in progress and France and Italy eventually agreed. They were really

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.120
 nervous about it as well because it was only 15 years after the Second World War ended and

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.520
 they thought, "This feels like giving the other country a route just to pass military

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.760
 vehicles straight into our country," but they did agree on it and eventually it was

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.400
 completed in about 1962. So now the 18 hour journey takes 10 minutes.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400
 That's so cool.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.560
 Yeah, I have been through that tunnel actually because we got a speeding ticket on the French

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.920
 side on the way in and then on the way out on the Italian side.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:27.040
 Wow. What an example of learning nothing from crashes.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.500
 I went to the dentist for the first time in two years the other day and I went because

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.440
 I had a bit of a problem and when I got there, the dentist misheard me when I said my name

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.800
 and put me down as Samuel Schreiber. I didn't correct her and so for the whole thing while

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.000
 she was setting it up, I was called Samuel Schreiber, which I thought was quite cool.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.840
 That's a nice cool name. Anyway, it turns out when she found out my name wasn't Samuel,

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.520
 she gave me a lot of crap saying, "You can't do this. This is all in all the systems now.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.320
 This is all the records." And she spent half an hour undoing it and then ran out of time

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.760
 and she wasn't able to look at my teeth. So I have to go back in six weeks with a pain.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.000
 I thought you were going to say when she realized it wasn't you, the tooth that she pulled out,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.600
 she shoved back in.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.640
 But it is important to identify people by their dental records sometimes.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640
 Yes.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.760
 You know, so if they say, well, we found Alastair Jedzky, James Harkett, Andrew Antemari,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.760
 and someone called Samuel Schreiber, it's going to be confusing.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.000
 It is confusing. Yeah. And I've got a painful tooth because of my dickheadness.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.920
 Sea gulls use humans as taste testers. This is so weird. This happens at the seaside.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.760
 There's a scientist called Madeline Goumas and she approached 38 gulls with a bucket,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.040
 right? Each bucket had a flapjack in. Sounds like a riddle, doesn't it? A wonderful riddle.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.320
 She would unwrap both flapjacks, right? And then she would pretend to eat one of the flapjacks

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.800
 for about 20 seconds. She's sort of mime nibbling away at it, right?

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.280
 So then she would put down the flapjacks. When sea gulls approached and got involved

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.360
 with the food that she'd just left, 19 out of 24 times, they approached the one that

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.800
 she had been pretending to eat.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.320
 Sea gulls are way more interested. It could just be that they're dicks. And it's like,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.160
 "Oh, she was really enjoying that one, so I'm going to steal that one from her."

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.920
 Yeah. I mean, her thesis is that they know that handled food is probably good for you

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.920
 and not going to kill you. But your theory also cuts a lot of ice, frankly.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.680
 But also maybe the other thing is that it's discarded food. She ate it, she no longer wants

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.560
 it, so I'll take that and we're going to have a cool symbiotic relationship. It's like,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.200
 "Cool, I'm not going to touch your good stuff."

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.000
 How many sea gulls have you met, Dan? Because symbiosis is not on their to-do list.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.680
 When they steal a chip out of his mouth, it's like, "Oh, it's okay, I wasn't going to eat

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.680
 that anyway."

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.280
 That's nature. Good on you.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.120
 More on the weirdness of a kid in the body is just a bit because we've mentioned a few

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.320
 things, but they have so little stuff that we take for granted. So they have no stomachs,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.960
 they have no teeth, they just have to crush their food up against the roof of their mouth

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:06.720
 with their tongue, they have no nipples. So when the baby hatches and is in a little pouch,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:14.120
 there are these glands which just leak directly out of their skin. They're very basic, basically.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.720
 They have to pop when just for the baby itself, they have to kind of like curl up and pop

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:26.760
 it out of their bum, because they're an animal that is called like monohull, I don't know

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.120
 how to say it, monotreme. That's it.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.200
 It's sort of fact number one about a kid on the Wikipedia page, they are a monotreme

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200
 bum.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:42.680
 Monohull. I missed that episode of the Simpsons. Monohull, monohull, monohull.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:51.720
 They are one-hulled, it's their bum and they're everything, it's a monohull. So they bring

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.920
 it up and then the baby sort of pops out and obviously there's an egg which is cracked

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.680
 and it pops out and then they have a pouch, much like a kangaroo does, and the baby crawls

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.040
 along and it goes inside and that's where the milk is secreted into.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.720
 Wait, are you talking about goodness? Yeah.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720
 That's not what happens.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.720
 Oh, shit.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.480
 How is the baby crawling along? It's an egg.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.480
 It's what?

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.560
 The baby, the baby's in an egg, right? So the way the mother...

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.320
 Oh, it's like a kangaroo, isn't it? A joey who climbs up.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.360
 I'm afraid that's the difference between your monotremes and your marsupials.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.360
 Your Dolby dreams.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 Yeah.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
 Right.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360
 Okay, so...

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.280
 But it is very fun, the way they give birth. The mother, it's much harder than as a kangaroo

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.480
 because you can just give birth and the thing sorts itself out, clutches at your hair and

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.480
 crawls up.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.480
 Right.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.160
 As an echidna, you lie on your back and you give birth, the egg comes out in egg form,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.280
 no legs, and they have to sort of shimmy it up their stomach. A bit like... Oh, you know

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.800
 that game where you have to get an after-eight down your forehead?

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800
 I was just...

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.560
 And pop it in your pouch, and then it sits in your pouch for a few more days.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.000
 It's a different game when the after-eight comes out of your vagina, isn't it?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Right.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.440
 Well, it kind of gets late, some parties, you know.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440
 My gosh.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.000
 I was thinking, yeah, that ping-pong ball talent thing is a...

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Oh, interesting.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 They were the originators.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Talent.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 It's a talent.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 It is a talent.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Yeah.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 I haven't seen it.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 It is a talent.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 I haven't.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 I thought they'd laid what was inside the ping-pong ball, and that's what shot out.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 I didn't realize that it was... Anyway, let's move on.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 In fact, we actually do need to move on to our next fact.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 That was the terrible insight into Dan's internal monologue there, wasn't it?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 I felt really alone there.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 I think you were alone.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 It was incredible.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 I also felt like everyone, 900 people were going, "Shh, just..."

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Let's see where it goes.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Let's see where it goes.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Quite similarly, she was the oldest person ever in a rap song.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Ah!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 And again, someone just recorded her saying, "Je m'appelle, je m'pellement."

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 What's happening, Dan?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 You broke the table?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 My table's falling down.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 I'm literally holding it up.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 You were telling such a good story, and they didn't want to do anything.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 I actually think we might all be one of Dan's terrible dreams.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Can't fucking believe this.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 He's going to be naked and have to do an exam in a minute.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Okay, don't lean on this table, okay, Dan?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Holy shit.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Don't touch it.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 I was literally, I was like, "Rawr!"

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Like, who are Atlas?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 You're like Atlas there, holding up the world.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 I like this.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 I was reading about this group of people that like to get to the top of a mountain

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 or somewhere a bit hard to get to and set up a jacuzzi.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 And then they all hop in the jacuzzi,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 and they managed to do this on the top of Mont Blanc,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 which, even though a lot of people assume it's quite an easy mountain to climb,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 it's responsible for a huge number of deaths.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 It is a very hard mountain to get to.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 So they packed up all their stuff,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 and they managed to get this jacuzzi on top of there.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 And you can see photos of about 30 people who've gone through all the night

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 treaching up there.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Yeah, yeah, and setting it up.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 And using, it's heated by the snow with the system that they have.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Heated by the snow?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Yeah, so they have a system.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 And, oh shit, okay.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 [laughter]

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 So, they put the snow onto these kind of really cool things that then heat up the water

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 that somehow they've brought up with them.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Have they brought water up?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 No, you wouldn't bring water to the top of Mont Blanc.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Why would you do that?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 That's not necessary.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Why would you do that?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 So, it was really hot because it was powered by snow.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 And, okay, so they get to the top.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Here's the fascinating thing.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 They're on the top of Mont Blanc.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And suddenly this Italian group that climbs up and they see them,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 and obviously it's a shock for anyone that suddenly sees a jacuzzi full of people

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 and their swimwear on the top.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 But it just so happens this Italian group had already met these people in a jacuzzi

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 on a previous mountain that they'd been on before,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 completely by coincidence, got up there and they're like, "You again?"

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And they now just think there's someone in a jacuzzi at the top of every mountain, don't they?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 That's so funny.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 It is funny, and so it doesn't matter about how you can make a jacuzzi full of snow.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 This has not been a good one for me, guys.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 I'll admit that right now.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 It's been a shitter.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 We need to move on to our next fact, guys.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Oh, can I just talk about an origin of life thing?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Yeah.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 I really like.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 So there were lots of theories about where life started and most of my sensible scientists,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 but one was by an American homeopath at the start of the 20th century called Charles Wentworth Littlefield,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 and he was reported as a scientist and it was in all the news that he's found out where life comes from

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 and the way he found it was he took some salt out of one of his patient's wounds

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 and he looked at it under a microscope while thinking about chicken

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 and he saw it turn into a chicken.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Sorry.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 He took some stuff from a patient's wound.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Some salt.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Something like bodily salts, basically.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 He said, "Sift them out."

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 He looked under a microscope and thought about chicken.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It turned into the shape of a chicken, not a live chicken.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 That would be stupid.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 But he realised that by concentrating on any grain of salt,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 he could make it transform into the thing he was thinking about,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 and it was always inanimate until he thought about octopuses, tiny, tiny octopuses,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 and then he created live octopuses from these grains of salt

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 and he concluded that this must be how life initially formed.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Okay.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Well, who was doing the thinking?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 That's the question.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 I suppose that's where God comes into it.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 What was the octopus bit, though?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 He thought of octopuses and they didn't turn to octopuses.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 No, they did turn into octopuses, but they were alive, so it was life.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Sorry.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Wow.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Given that all this is complete bullshit, what is the outcome?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Hang on, don't judge it just yet, because there is a theory as well

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 that octopuses are actually aliens that came to Earth,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 and so that wouldn't be the original life, right?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 So this guy was probably just going through every single animal

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 and then suddenly hit on the one that actually, if you stare at it long enough,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 does turn into a living octopus.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 I should just say that theory is also bullshit.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 I think it's demeaning us, James, to say it's bullshit.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 So what was he just crazy, this person?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Yeah, he was just taken vaguely seriously in the news at the turn of the century.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Wow.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And you know, I like the idea, and who's tried it?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Who's tried looking at salt and thinking of an octopus?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Not me.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Yeah.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 So don't knock it.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Well, listen, okay, this half of the table thinks there's something to it.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 That half of the table doesn't it?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 I'm not signing up to this.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Instead of the first car on the moon, we almost had the first pogo stick.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 What?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 There was debate, so as I said earlier, Apollo 15 was the first mission

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 where there was actually a vehicle that was driven around.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 They drove it around.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 And they were there for three days.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 They drove it around for like at least six hours a day,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 which actually is just quite a long time to be driving.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 That's a lot.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 And they had to wear seat belts.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 The seat belts really didn't fit.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 And they took ages trying to get the seat belts on, which seems so weird to me.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 How many obstacles are there?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 How many cars coming at you?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 There's a lot of rocks around them.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 There are a lot of craters and dips.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Okay, I reckon I could hack it.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 I don't know.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 I'd rather seat belt.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 That's the main question at the NASA astronaut selection actually.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Do you reckon you could hack it?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Yeah.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Come on then.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Come on in.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Anyway, there were lots of ideas for what kind of vehicle to design for the moon.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 NASA was very interested in a motorcycle at first.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 I thought that might work.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And then there was the idea for a giant pogo stick,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 which would be manned by two people.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 I think sort of one on each.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 I feel like things that you do to get yourself along the railway tracks.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 You know, those things.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 That's not what a pogo stick is.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 No, but it's manned by two people, you know.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Yeah, but so is a pedalo.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 A seesaw.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 I don't think the audience needed a simile for manned by two people.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 I just just didn't want to picture that.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Maybe they'd each be standing at one end of the pogo stick,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 and then one would go up and one would go down at the same time.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 That is a seesaw.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 That's not a pogo stick.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Yeah.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Okay, look, we've drilled down and we've acetate that.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 I don't know what a pogo stick is.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 You are failing that NASA interview.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 If they're testing laboratories,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 dog food is often used to put down them,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 because it has a sort of, to simulate the stuff.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 It's got the same consistency as my poo, for example.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Do you get it in jelly or in gravy?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Okay, my poo?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Okay.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Sure.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 You know, there's quite a range of textures, isn't there?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 But I suppose that's to a poo and dog food.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 James, I want to split off and start a one podcast.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Just on this table.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 There used to be a takeaway place near me

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 that would cut off the top of a loaf of bread,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and they'd hollow it out, and then they'd just pour in a stew,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 and they'd give you the bread back.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 That sounds great.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 It was a South African thing, I think.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Okay.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Say again.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Bunny chow.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Sonny chow.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Yeah.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Bunny chow.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 I don't think it was a bunny in it.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 I think it was a better option, but it's very nice.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Well, on Christmas, very quickly,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 the aviator, he claimed to be the third person

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 to fly in America, but we think he probably didn't,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 because his planes were all terrible.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 He kept inventing these really awful planes,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 so there was one called the Christmas Bullet.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 The wings were supposed to flap as you flew,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 but unfortunately, they crashed on his maiden flight,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 and then they made another one, and that one crashed as well.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 He made another design when it was a plane

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 which had a huge hole in the top.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 His idea was, right, if you get a parachute,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 a lot of parachutes have a hole in the top,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 and that's because you don't want all the air

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 to properly just get properly into the parachute,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 otherwise it might get a bit wobbly,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 so he thought, why don't I do that for a plane?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Interesting.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Right.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 I hope they tell you when you do a parachute jump

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 about the whole thing, because I can't imagine

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 how fucking terrified I'd be if my parachute,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 because I looked up, there was a huge hole in the top.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Could be worse.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 James, when you said they have to have a hole in the top,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 I just thought, I thought you were going to say,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 because obviously, if the aero goes up in there,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 it just gets stuck in there and you just stay

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 where you are in the sky.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 That's how that works, yeah?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Do you know that, you may have seen it,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 actually, this is extremely cutting-edge

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 soup news right now.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Hines have just released a Christmas soup,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 which is very exciting.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 They've just announced it as a kind of PR thing.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 They've only made 500 tins, but it's got, you know,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 everything.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 It's got turkey, sprouts, stuffing, roast potatoes,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 pigs in blankets, gravy, cranberry sauce.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Well, I mean, that sounds all right,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 because at least it's one course.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Have they just mushed it all up?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 No, you get chunks of turkey and things like that.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Oh, right, yeah, there are chunks.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Oh, James, don't worry.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 There are chunks.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 But it could be worse, because in 2013,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 game, the video game people,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 they launched a thing called a Christmas dinner,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 which was for people too addictive to video games

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 to cook anything on Christmas Day,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 and the top layer was scrambled egg and bacon.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Then there was a layer of mincemeat.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Then there was some turkey and trimmings,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 and then there was a Christmas pudding

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 in the bottom of the tin.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Where are all the quality street?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Wow.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Yeah.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Are you allowed to eat a painting?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 What do you mean, are you allowed to eat a painting?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Legally, if you own a painting, this is...

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Of course, if you own it, you can do what you want.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Well, you're absolutely right.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 OK, it's time for

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 fact number three.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Any more? Any more for that, no?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Not really.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Is that mid-busted?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 It's just, you know, would you be allowed to eat the Mona Lisa

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 if you owned it, probably?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Well, you're right.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Has someone put this in the statue books?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Yes, they have. Thank you, Anna.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Good question. Is the 1990...

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Oh, no, hang on.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 No, it is all right, actually.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 There are laws about works that might still be in copyright,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 so if it's within 75 years of the artist's death,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 or works that are protected

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 under the 1990 Visual Artist Rights Act,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 you're not allowed to eat some of those protected ones.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 But the good news is, anything from Caravaggio's time

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 is on the menu.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Wow!

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 That's interesting.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 We really had to pull it out of you,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 but 75 days after...

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 75 days after...

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 75 days?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Yes!

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 I was just...

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Okay, cool. 75 years.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 That's Christmas lunch sorted

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 in the Hunter Murray household.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Oh, boy.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 I think the very first-ever study of it,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 the long-beaked echidna, it's called,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 was published in 2009.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And even then, the study author,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 who was a guy called Musee Opiang,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 was 500 hours studying them

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 before even seeing one.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Wow!

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Was he studying them, then?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Really, for that first 500 hours?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 He was warming up. He was doing stretches.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 They are quite hard to find, though, aren't they?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 There was a guy, the first scientist,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 to study the testicles of echidnas.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 He did that by employing Aboriginal people

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 to find these echidnas for him.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And he always paid more for the females,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 because it was more hard to find the females.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 I think that of all you...

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 It is much harder to find the females' testicles.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Is that what he said?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 He did lots of studying,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 but he happens to be the first person

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 to have studied the testicles.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 This guy actually committed suicide.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 He was a German scientist.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 He committed suicide in 1918

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 while wrapped in a German flag,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 because he was so upset with the way the war was going.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 But, yeah, he was most famous, I think,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 for studying the testicles of the echidnas,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 and his name was Dick Seaman.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 What? Richard W. Seaman.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Oh, my God, that's incredible.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 A, change your name.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 B, don't study testicles if your name is Dick Seaman.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 [laughter]

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Well, kind of...

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 All right, Dan. I mean, the guy was obviously a troubled man.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Let's not kick him while he's down.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Okay, fair enough.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Seriously, weird thing. So random.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 On soup, Ted Cruz, you remember Ted Cruz,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 came second to Trump in the primaries.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 2016, during those primaries,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 his wife revealed that after they got back from their honeymoon,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 the first thing he did was he went out to the shop,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 said he was going shopping, he came home,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 and all he had was 100 cans of Campbell's soup.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 And so she said,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 "We had to have a tough conversation."

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Well, I explained to him,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 "You don't come back with 100 of anything.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 "Low-loan Campbell's soup."

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 He said, "You know you're not going to cook love,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 "so this is what I'll be eating for the rest of our marriage."

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 And she was...

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Look, he didn't say to put it in those terms.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Don't worry.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Basically, that's what he said.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 She snuck out and returned them all the next morning

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 before he woke up.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 And then she talked to her mum on the phone,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 and her mum said, "Are you going to cook for him, though?"

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And she went, "No, I'm a terrible cook. Can't cook at all."

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Her mum was like, "Go and get the soup back."

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 She went and got the soup back.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 No!

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Yeah.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Well, that's a beautiful marriage, right there.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 There's one cashier at the soup shop

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 who has no idea about this whole story,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 just as a weird thing where some guy turned up, bought 110s,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 lady came and took them away.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Yeah, then returned, demanded them back.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 "What's going on? Am I on a reality TV show?"

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Can I tell you one more trick?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Yeah, we're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Okay, this is a trick by one of the greatest magicians of all time,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Robert Houdin, who Houdini got his name from.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 This is the trick.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 He would take a handkerchief from an audience member.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 He would turn that into a file of liquid.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 He would pour that liquid on a dry twig.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 That would sprout and grow into a bush.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 The bush would then grow oranges on it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Robert Houdin would pick the oranges off the bush.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 He would throw them into the audience one by one.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 The final one, he would split open.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Out of that final orange, two butterflies would fly,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 living butterflies, holding the handkerchief between them.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 No!

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 And return it to the audience member.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 The butterflies would return it.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 And we're going to do that tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 But unfortunately, no one has a handkerchief anymore.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Sorry!

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Can I just tell you one more thing about postcards?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 In 2017, a Europe poll, so kind of like Interpol, but for Europe,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 they started trying to catch criminals through the mechanism of postcards.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 They developed these postcards,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 each one featuring one of Europe's highest-profile fugitives.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 And they said things like, "Dear Arta, Belgium fries are the best,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 "and we know you missed them. Come back to enjoy them.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 "We'll have a nice surprise in store for you."

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 That was for a famous drug dealer.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 So did they send them to him?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 No, they just published them and made people aware that these people were on the run.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 Because they're going to say if he knew where he lived to send them a postcard.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 That's true. It's so true.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 Hi, David, we've been trying to get hold of you because there is still so much to discuss.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Please get in touch soon, the police.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 So someone accused of multiple, quite serious sexual offences,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 and they won an award for it, and three criminals were actually...

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 But there's sexual offences!

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 They didn't win a... Sorry.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Okay.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 It's hard, it's very hard to transplant testicles, obviously,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 onto a different part of the body.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Why?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 So, actually, who's...

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 What a shame.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 I got that thought around.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Which part of the body was it?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 It's actually a lot easier to transplant testicles

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 onto a different part of the body than into a scrotum.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And this has been tested on rats.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 So, a few years ago, a team put a load of testicles of rats.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 They did some transplants,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 and they moved the testicles either into other rat scrotii,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 or onto the necks of the other rats.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 And it had a much higher success rate, the transplant,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 if the testicles were just put on the necks of the rats.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Really? Yeah.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 But you'd be pissed off with your surgeon when you woke up,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 if they said, "Well, transplant wasn't successful."

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Of course, it was easier to do it onto your forehead.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 So, we've done it.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 I thought you didn't mind.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 It's so strange that you have a tiger with canine teeth,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 because they're felines, but they've got canines.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 You know what I mean?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Yeah.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 That's weird, that, isn't it?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 It makes you think.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 It really does.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 What does it make you think about?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 It doesn't really make me think about anything.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 It just makes me think in a kind of abstract way.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 Bill Gates is intending to block out the sun.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 What do you mean?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 He wants to use some of his money to help scientists at Harvard University

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 who are proposing an experiment that can hopefully stop global warming

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 by sending a balloon up there, sending a load of particles into the atmosphere,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 where the sun's rays will come down, bounce off into space,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 and it will be less hot on Earth.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 I can't see that going wrong.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 No!

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 I saw it, why not?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Let's do it.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Let's do it.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 I'm up for it.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 It's going to look like we're at a worldwide children's birthday party.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 That's quite cool.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 That would be cool.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 That would be cool.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 He's one of the few people in the world who has a McDonald's gold card.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 I don't know if it's connected to this.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 What's that?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 McDonald's gold card is where you can go to any McDonald's,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 you hand it in, and no matter what you've ordered, they give it to you for free.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Oh, thank God.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Because otherwise, how would he be able to afford a Big Mac?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 So we don't have it in the UK.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 What we have is the Nando's black card, which is quite a famous card,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 which I've experienced a couple of times.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 I have, yeah.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 A couple of friends of mine have had it.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 So Tom Davis, who is King Gary, he once had it.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 The other guy had to stop using it because he was...

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Good luck with the Nando's lawsuit, Dan.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I am not saying...

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Good point. Let's edit that out.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 We're not saying that Nando's...

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 We're not. Put it from your mind.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 There was an amazing thing that happened in the Netherlands at the start of this year.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Actually, it was the end of last year, and that was that there was an Armenian family

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 who'd been living in the Netherlands for nine years,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 and the country had decided they wanted to deport them.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 And they were like, "Well, we can't go back to Armenia

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 because if we go back, we'll be in terrible trouble."

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 And they said to the church, "What are we going to do?"

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Apparently, there's an old and obscured Dutch law that police aren't allowed to arrest someone

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 in the middle of a church service.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 And so, the local church started a mass that went on for 24 hours a day for 97 days.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Wow.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 While this family were living in the church.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 They started off doing it for a few days, a few days.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Eventually, more than 650 clergy members were signing up to be the next person to do it.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 They kind of tag-teamed all the priests.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Wow.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 And eventually, the government just thought, "Fuck this."

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 And they went, "Fine, you can stay, you can stay, you can stay."

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Oh, really?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 I would have thought they'd go, "Fuck this, we're going to walk in and arrest you anyway."

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 It's the law.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 You can't break the law if you're a government, can you?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 What?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Well...

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Caravaggio died, maybe, of sunstroke, we think.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Really?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Yeah, this is what people have claimed.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 I couldn't define what their evidence was, except that.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 So, researchers, there's this big mystery of how he died, or shrouded in mystery.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Like, was he murdered?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Was he poisoned?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Did he have syphilis?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And they thought in 2010 that they found some of his bones, fragments of his bones.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 They studied his bones, these researchers.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 And they said, it showed signs of lead poisoning and syphilis.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 But they think what eventually killed him was sunstroke.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 And then the only evidence I could find that they had was that 1610 was an extremely hot year.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 What?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 That's the reason, darling.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 That makes sense, yeah.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 It's been quite cold this winter.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 In future, every single person who died this year, people will look at them and go,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 "I reckon that was the cold that killed this one."

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 I'm not sure they were.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 I think they might be.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 It was a very heavy cold.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 A bit too much Nando, sir, I reckon.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 No, we can't keep that in.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 It has to stay.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 It has to stay.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Who's full of tingers?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Gates or Nando's?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 We'll find out when this episode goes out.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 then it's Christmas, guys.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Give us a break.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 We were only joking.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 Okay, listen, we'll be back next week at the start of 2022, can you believe it, with a whole new episode.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 So we will see you then.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Goodbye!
