00:00:00,00:00:04,we run it on QI a few years ago yeah um which was there's no such thing as a fish
00:00:04,00:00:07,isn't it nice or something as a fish? no seriously it's in a tea
00:00:07,00:00:11,Oxford dictionary of underwater life he says it right there first paragraph no
00:00:11,00:00:13,such thing as a fish
00:00:13,00:00:23,hey everyone welcome to another edition of no such thing as a fish a weekly
00:00:23,00:00:27,podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden my name is Dan
00:00:27,00:00:32,Shriver sitting here with the regular three QI elves Anichesensky Andy Murray
00:00:32,00:00:35,and James Harkin and we've got joining us today on fact checking Judy's
00:00:35,00:00:39,Freddie Somes and once again we have gathered around the microphones and
00:00:39,00:00:44,our offices to tell each other our favorite facts from the last seven days so in
00:00:44,00:00:48,no particular order here we go
00:00:48,00:00:55,first up it's James oh my fact this week is that the CEO of Levi's chip
00:00:55,00:00:59,Berg hasn't washed his jeans in more than a year
00:00:59,00:01:04,so when you first mentioned this to us yes I thought that wasn't that
00:01:04,00:01:08,surprising because I didn't really wash jeans and didn't realise that was a
00:01:08,00:01:13,thing I was shocked and I wanted to know where his mother was
00:01:13,00:01:17,and I wash my jeans every day but Aniches crisps up a plate come on that's true
00:01:17,00:01:21,can't trust his household habits but apparently I'm right right so a jeans
00:01:21,00:01:25,a fish or no I don't know yeah well there are lots of people who think that you
00:01:25,00:01:30,shouldn't wash jeans because it fades the colors and it spoils the fabric but
00:01:30,00:01:35,that's people who work for jeans companies not so much microbiologists who
00:01:35,00:01:38,tend to think that you probably should wash them because there's going to be
00:01:38,00:01:43,lots of bacteria on there and so how much bacteria are we talking okay so there
00:01:43,00:01:48,was a student at the University of Alberta called Josh Ley holy and he as an
00:01:48,00:01:51,experiment wore the same pair of jeans for 15 months without washing them
00:01:51,00:01:57,and after two weeks he found that he had around a thousand to two thousand
00:01:57,00:02:02,bacteria per square centimetre that was on the front of the jeans
00:02:02,00:02:08,"1500 to 2500 on the back and between 8,000 and 10,000 in the crop"
00:02:08,00:02:11,area lovely I wonder how many more that is than we
00:02:11,00:02:16,have on our skin yeah well you do have bacteria on your skin we have we have 10
00:02:16,00:02:19,times more bacterial cells than human cells in our bodies is that right yes most
00:02:19,00:02:23,of them are very small cells in the gut but 90% of you is not human
00:02:23,00:02:26,yeah and doesn't isn't that where all the smell comes from
00:02:26,00:02:29,so you should remember saying this to you guys a long time ago but that's where
00:02:29,00:02:33,that's why you smell it's not you it's a little animal that's
00:02:33,00:02:38,it's a very poor excuse on a date though it's not me it's the 90% of cells which
00:02:38,00:02:44,aren't me in my body so if someone ever says to you oh you smell of sweat today
00:02:44,00:02:47,you just say no I smell of bacterial feces actually
00:02:47,00:02:51,in your face where are you going don't get in that taxi
00:02:51,00:02:54,promise for us
00:02:54,00:02:58,and so I don't know do you just not do anything with your jeans and or do you put
00:02:58,00:03:01,them in the freezer like some people do I don't really understand this freezer thing
00:03:01,00:03:06,what's the freezer thing well that's what this this guy from Levi says that
00:03:06,00:03:09,instead of washing you can click you can kill the bacteria by putting your
00:03:09,00:03:14,jeans in the freezer and one it it means that it doesn't fade the jeans and
00:03:14,00:03:18,what have you but too it also will save water and apparently
00:03:18,00:03:23,people are using a lot of water all the time uselessly for washing their jeans
00:03:23,00:03:26,so that's a bit like that's like a cool way of cleaning in the same way that
00:03:26,00:03:30,remember the person who used to have an asbestos um tablecloth
00:03:30,00:03:34,oh yeah Charlemagne yeah yeah yeah do you know about that Andy
00:03:34,00:03:38,okay so like Dan says exactly that he had an asbestos tablecloth
00:03:38,00:03:41,after each meal he would take it out throw it in the fire
00:03:41,00:03:44,and then let the fire clean it and then he would bring it out and use it again
00:03:44,00:03:48,did he die young by any chance can I tell you my favorite thing about this Levi's bass
00:03:48,00:03:52,yeah go on is that I just like that the head of Levi's
00:03:52,00:03:57,wears Levi's yeah it's just I love anytime you hear a story where someone uses the thing
00:03:57,00:04:01,that they created or or that they're the head of like when I was wearing my
00:04:01,00:04:05,nose which thing is a fish t-shirt that cue I recordings this week exactly yeah
00:04:05,00:04:10,there's no shame in the buy online in New Zealand not from us not from us
00:04:10,00:04:15,I like it even more so when you see the the company getting in trouble for
00:04:15,00:04:19,something to do with their own company like for example Jimmy Wales who created
00:04:19,00:04:23,Wikipedia got in trouble for editing his own Wikipedia page
00:04:23,00:04:27,which is the top line of what you're not meant to do and he got busted for it
00:04:27,00:04:31,and I don't know what he was thinking because it comes up as edited by Jimmy Wales
00:04:31,00:04:34,I think we tweeted this the other day and Freddie you might have to check which
00:04:34,00:04:36,you news they were but there's an American uni that
00:04:36,00:04:41,or a guidelines on plagiarism and it was all plagiarized from another American
00:04:41,00:04:44,oh yeah that's a great fact that was yeah that's it's a cue I tweet if you can find that
00:04:44,00:04:48,do we know who invented jeans by the way well there's a difference between
00:04:48,00:04:52,jeans and blue jeans you know the blue jeans that everyone wears today
00:04:52,00:04:56,yeah we're invented in the late 19th century in America but this is cool
00:04:56,00:05:00,there have been paintings discovered from the 1650s where people are wearing
00:05:00,00:05:05,the blue cloth sort of fixed him with white which is the you know the proper
00:05:05,00:05:09,jean fabric and the artist is unknown but he's called the master of the blue jeans
00:05:09,00:05:14,and so in one there's a peasant wearing a blue skirt and others boy in a rip dark blue jacket
00:05:14,00:05:19,and it looks like they're wearing jeans in the 1600s yeah yeah and double denim it's very very cool
00:05:19,00:05:22,that's so mean because that's where it comes from denim doesn't it?
00:05:22,00:05:26,would possibly denim is from neem or it's either there or it's from
00:05:26,00:05:31,genoa in Italy which is where they think we might get the word jeans from
00:05:31,00:05:34,but that's not that's not blue jeans with the rivets in those those were the ones which
00:05:34,00:05:39,took over the whole world yeah but Levi's didn't call their product jeans did they for a long time
00:05:39,00:05:45,um i think for the first 107 years they called them waste overalls really we had a fact in one
00:05:45,00:05:50,of our books that half of the world's population are wearing jeans at any one time oh yeah um
00:05:50,00:05:53,can't remember where it came from i think i missed maybe i know where it came from oh go on
00:05:53,00:05:58,well it was a man called miller who visited lots and lots of countries and in every country he
00:05:58,00:06:02,visited he stopped and counted the first 100 people to walk by and in each one he found that almost
00:06:02,00:06:08,half of the population were wearing jeans on any given date which is unbelievable yeah it's fantastic
00:06:08,00:06:13,i'm wearing jeans now i'm wearing jeans yeah me too i'm not wearing jeans yeah i'm just
00:06:13,00:06:22,smelling it i thought yeah just going back to um not really washing etc um there was a very famous
00:06:22,00:06:28,dirty celebrity um in the um 19th century i think i think i think i thought we were going to say
00:06:28,00:06:35,in the 1970s and he was called dirty dick you know dirty dicks pub uh some Liverpool street
00:06:35,00:06:41,and the Liverpool street station uh on bishopsgate uh and what happened was on his uh wedding day his
00:06:41,00:06:47,fiancee died very sadly and then after that he refused to wash or clean for the rest of his life
00:06:47,00:06:52,and lived in this place in in London and he became really famous for being dirty and never washing and
00:06:52,00:06:58,if you sent any letters uh addressed to the dirty warehouse in London they would always get to him
00:06:58,00:07:01,because he was self-famous for being dirty well there wasn't much in Queen Victoria that washing
00:07:01,00:07:05,was really bad for you as well didn't she? Was it people did? Yeah in 19th century very unwashedable
00:07:05,00:07:11,okay um before we move on uh Freddie have you got anything to add? Yeah so um the tweet that was on
00:07:11,00:07:16,quick immediately other day was that um a university in Oregon has plagiarized the section on
00:07:16,00:07:22,plagiarism in its student handbook um from the section on plagiarism in stanford university's handbook
00:07:22,00:07:36,wow so good um we took that tweet from omg facts okay let's uh move on to fact number two and this
00:07:36,00:07:43,fact is my one uh it's a long one so I was just I found this pretty astonishing the first successful
00:07:43,00:07:49,transatlantic flight which happened in 1919 was made by two guys from Manchester but it's one of
00:07:49,00:07:54,those trips where uh it was just a complete disaster but they managed to do it but my favorite bit about
00:07:54,00:07:58,the fact is that at one point they got completely lost while they were in the air they were just
00:07:58,00:08:05,"covered in cloud and fog and when they came out of the cloud and fog thinking that they were 13,000"
00:08:05,00:08:10,feet in the air it turned out they were only 60 feet above the water and not only that that they
00:08:10,00:08:16,were flying sideways on a 90 degree angle to the surface of the ocean wow how will they try and
00:08:16,00:08:21,always know when I'm at 90 degrees because of gravity yeah were they so tense while they were
00:08:21,00:08:27,flying that they just didn't oh so stiff they were they were so tense now I got this from Bill
00:08:27,00:08:34,Bryson's book one summer america 1927 he was saying this is how tense it was for them to do it the
00:08:34,00:08:39,guy who was in front who was called allcock was holding onto the wheel they didn't have a cover
00:08:39,00:08:46,over them it was like a convertible plane and the other guy's job who was brown had to sit forward
00:08:46,00:08:51,and using his two index fingers as kind of windshield wipers on the goggles of allcock that was his
00:08:51,00:08:57,job to basically just be wiping them away he also had to jump out onto the wings of the plane six
00:08:57,00:09:05,times in order to knock icing off and get back on ice you mean ice they flew through the great cake
00:09:05,00:09:14,yeah so when was this what year was this 1919 um they did the first transatlantic yeah yeah
00:09:14,00:09:19,yeah but they went from Canada didn't they they went from Newfoundland yeah to Ireland yeah um but at
00:09:19,00:09:23,one point they even went the wrong way they did a loop and started heading back towards Canada
00:09:23,00:09:29,it is pretty easy to get disorientated I think when you're flying um shame on me I can't
00:09:29,00:09:34,remember who it was but there was an explorer who was in a balloon and he went up very very high
00:09:34,00:09:40,and sort of passed out or fell asleep or something like that and then when he woke up um he thought he'd
00:09:40,00:09:46,landed and so decided to get out of the plane to just walk on the snow which he saw below and only
00:09:46,00:09:50,when he was halfway out of the balloon did he realize that it wasn't snow it was actually the clouds
00:09:50,00:09:58,"and he was still 20,000 feet up oh my god uh in 1914 when you look at the military use of airplanes"
00:09:59,00:10:05,this is fact here that the French Air Corps had the largest air force in the world larger than
00:10:05,00:10:11,"Germany, Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan and Austria all combined and they only had three dozen"
00:10:11,00:10:18,planes and that was the largest in the world so how many to the rest of us have four each or
00:10:18,00:10:24,between us each each and America had two and in the space of four years they went up to
00:10:24,00:10:31,"Britain having 55,000, Germany having 48,000, Italy having 20,000 and France still have 36"
00:10:31,00:10:38,do you want to hear something cool about Lindbergh? Yes please you made the first solo flight from
00:10:38,00:10:43,New York to Paris he was the 19th person to cross the Atlantic in a plane oh really?
00:10:43,00:10:49,yeah see the first solo then he was the first solo New York to Paris that was the thing and New York
00:10:49,00:10:52,is a much further distance because obviously it's further down the coast so lots of people talk
00:10:52,00:10:56,about the amazing length you went to to cut down the weight of the plane and even cut the top and the
00:10:56,00:11:03,bottom off his map so that it would save a couple of ounces but he also had this thing he said I had
00:11:03,00:11:08,an arm burst cup which is a device for condensing the moisture from human breath into drinking water
00:11:08,00:11:13,how cool is that? Why don't we still have these? He didn't realize how famous he was going to be
00:11:13,00:11:19,did he? He knew he might be in the papers so he he subscribed to a cutting service that would send
00:11:19,00:11:26,all the newspaper cuttings to his mother's house thinking it would just be a few here or there
00:11:26,00:11:31,but of course it was in every single newspaper for days and days and days and by the end of his
00:11:31,00:11:36,first week his mother discovered to a horror that a fleet of trucks was preparing to deliver several
00:11:36,00:11:41,tons of newspaper articles to our house. Reports were at the time like if he left something on his
00:11:41,00:11:46,plate you know a meal like corn on the cob that waiters would fight over it because that would
00:11:46,00:11:52,become really precious I could drum as drumstick after a gig yeah exactly an actual drumstick for corn
00:11:52,00:11:58,so the right flyer was the right brothers plane that they first flew and what's the highest
00:11:58,00:12:06,altitude that any part of it reached? 20 feet 30 feet I'm thinking it's a QI question so I think
00:12:06,00:12:13,I know the answer yeah go on is it the moon? It's so the moon oh of course another one of
00:12:13,00:12:18,nails little trinkets you brought up Neil Armstrong brought it up to brought up a bit of the wing
00:12:18,00:12:25,we had a few series ago Buzz Aldrin on Museum of Curiosity sister show to QI and no such thing as a fish
00:12:25,00:12:32,cousin of no such thing as a fish and I found this fact that I hadn't read in any of his biographies
00:12:32,00:12:37,I can't even remember where I found it now but I I mentioned it to him in person because I thought
00:12:37,00:12:42,this is gonna be amazing to say that Buzz Aldrin I discovered that his dad was mates with one of
00:12:42,00:12:49,the right brothers so within the father's lifetime he knew the first person to fly a plane and his
00:12:49,00:12:56,son became the first well second person to stand on the moon and so I said to him you might have
00:12:56,00:13:02,actually met him because you were at the same air force base where your dad and he worked and he
00:13:02,00:13:08,went yeah I guess so and he just wasn't interested I thought I delivered I think it's the way
00:13:08,00:13:14,you tell him dad the right brothers dad told them that they were never allowed to fly together didn't
00:13:14,00:13:18,he because he was right that one of them was going to die so they only flew together once in their
00:13:18,00:13:24,whole life and you know on that so after their first flight in the right flyer in 1983 I think it was
00:13:24,00:13:27,then so they they took turns flying and they had goes on it and they flew further and further and
00:13:27,00:13:31,then they had a chat about it stood next to the plane had a chat about it and the right flyer never
00:13:31,00:13:34,flew again after that day because a gust of wind picked it up and afflicted over a bunch of times
00:13:34,00:13:39,and broke it oh really yeah just as they were talking they're like oh shit there goes that do you
00:13:39,00:13:45,guys know who was the first woman to fly solo in an aeroplane is it not a female lady human
00:13:45,00:13:51,is it a female animal is it a female ant is it a tortoise it's not even a qi thing it's just a
00:13:51,00:13:57,question and it's a question to which none of you know the answer tell us the answer god damn it it
00:13:57,00:14:02,was blanched you at Scott of course because the story was quite good because she was the first
00:14:02,00:14:09,woman to fly solo in an aeroplane she reached 40 feet and it was in 1910 and she was a friend of an
00:14:09,00:14:15,aviator called Glenn Curtis and he like was a time in in those days nobody thought a woman should
00:14:15,00:14:22,really be in an aeroplane and he allowed her to sort of taxi around the airfield in the aeroplane
00:14:22,00:14:27,but she wasn't allowed to take off and then something happened we don't know what happened
00:14:28,00:14:34,on september the second in 1910 and she managed to take off and ended up going up to 40 feet in the air
00:14:34,00:14:39,and no one really knows how she managed to do it because what he would do is he he would insert a
00:14:39,00:14:44,block of wood behind the throttle to stop her from reaching the necessary speed to take off and then
00:14:44,00:14:50,assume that a woman would not have the intelligence to remove a block of wood from behind the throttle
00:14:50,00:14:55,because my theory is that's probably what she did or it might have come loose itself and did she
00:14:55,00:15:00,land it yeah so she didn't die no she didn't die okay that's good news good blanche I have a
00:15:00,00:15:06,fun fact about the guy who invented the autopilot oh cool um who was Lawrence Ferry who I think you're
00:15:06,00:15:12,familiar with Andy yeah but so he also inadvertently invented something else which was the mile high
00:15:12,00:15:22,club sorry I was going to make that like attention thing so yeah in 1916 he was going flying lessons
00:15:22,00:15:27,to this socialite called Mrs Waldo Pierce whose husband to make this story a bit more poignant was
00:15:27,00:15:31,driving an ambulance in France at the time in the war her husband was friends with Anna's
00:15:31,00:15:37,Hemingway by coincidence um so Lawrence Ferry autopilot inventor Mrs Waldo Pierce go up in his
00:15:37,00:15:44,plane he uses his autopilot um to flight the plane for a while while he has a quick uh bit of uh
00:15:44,00:15:50,whatever you want to give it how's your father bumpy bumpy with Mrs Waldo um and the plane crashed
00:15:50,00:15:53,something went wrong with the autopilot people think that they kicked it during their
00:15:53,00:15:58,relations and kicked the autopilot of course and the plane crashed into a duck pond and they were found
00:15:58,00:16:02,unclothed by duck hunters fortunately her husband was driving an ambulance nearby
00:16:02,00:16:09,sperry claim they'd been divested by the force of the crash when they emerged
00:16:09,00:16:18,isn't there a fact that the first ever hot air balloon trip there was some hanky panky going on
00:16:18,00:16:21,in there it's not the first ever because i think that was the mongolian brothers
00:16:21,00:16:31,George Bigin and Latisha Sage went up in a balloon organised by an Italian man called Lunardi
00:16:31,00:16:36,but he got out just at the last minute and it went over Piccadilly and as it went over Piccadilly
00:16:36,00:16:42,people could see sage on all fours um although she maintained that she was not having sex i think
00:16:42,00:16:46,she said she was looking for something like i can't remember for sure and all of all of her
00:16:46,00:16:51,clothes had fallen off in the excitement of going up and so then later on in these big wager books
00:16:51,00:16:57,"that they have in London clubs um one one wager reads ""Lord Chambley has given two guineas to Lord"
00:16:57,00:17:02,Derby to receive 500 guineas whenever his lordship plays hospitals with a woman in a balloon a
00:17:02,00:17:07,"thousand yards from the earth"" maybe people's clothes were just much more poorly designed in the"
00:17:07,00:17:17,olden days maybe they just never washed their jeans they just fell off crumbling away
00:17:17,00:17:26,okay um time from fact number three and there is annas uh yeah my fact is that in 2007 a
00:17:26,00:17:35,woman called Evan Latimer inherited Napoleon's penis from her father so that happened yep um so
00:17:35,00:17:42,basically at Napoleon's autopsy in 1921 there were 17 doctors present um and it's thought that
00:17:42,00:17:47,the main his physician his main doctor cut off his penis we know that bits of his body were removed
00:17:47,00:17:51,so his heart was removed because he wanted it sent to his wife his strange wife although i never
00:17:51,00:17:56,got her and there's a theory that it was eaten by rats um and anyway then it was later admitted by one
00:17:56,00:18:01,of the doctors who was there that other bits of Napoleon's body were also removed so it resurfaced
00:18:01,00:18:06,at the beginning of the 20th century from the family of the priest who was also present at the
00:18:06,00:18:12,autopsy whom the physician had given it to um and yeah it was put up it was sold to a collector and
00:18:12,00:18:18,it's been sold at various auctions and it's been on display in New York in 1974 only three thousand
00:18:18,00:18:24,dollars he bought it for in 1977 that would have been more money a bit more but also it was questionable
00:18:24,00:18:29,whether it was his penis at all but was this woman upset that you know did her elder sister get
00:18:29,00:18:34,the Duke of Wellington's penis in the well or something was it was the whole bequest penises
00:18:34,00:18:40,of one side because his penis is certainly diminutive it measures 1.5 inches now and there is a
00:18:40,00:18:44,defense that it wasn't very well preserved so there's been some shriveling but it's it's been
00:18:44,00:18:48,likened to various things it's been likened over the years by people who've seen it to shriveled
00:18:48,00:18:55,eel beef jerky and a bit of leather um and it's 1.5 inches um yeah it was described as a mummified
00:18:55,00:19:02,tendon I believe when he removed it was a very delicate way of describing a severed penis yeah certainly
00:19:02,00:19:07,better than shriveled eel I first read this fact in a book called the antiques magpie which is
00:19:07,00:19:13,really good um and it's written by an antiques rocho expert he thinks that the reason the willy
00:19:13,00:19:17,was locked off was because the physician was annoyed at being left out of Napoleon's will
00:19:17,00:19:23,oh I know I read it it was the chaplain who wanted it done as an act of revenge um because
00:19:23,00:19:27,uh Napoleon kept calling him impotent well he did give it to the chaplain so maybe they both had
00:19:27,00:19:30,a chat in the pub one night and he was like I'm really pissed off in the polian I'm not in his will
00:19:30,00:19:34,and the chaplain was like I'm pissed off in the polian too he's called me impotent and they agreed
00:19:34,00:19:40,to it maybe they maybe they each got half which explains its size that's such a good point yeah um
00:19:40,00:19:45,it's actually three inches we've been unfair the thing is that often Napoleon was captured at
00:19:45,00:19:50,Waterloo all of his belongings were sent on tour around England very much like the x factor
00:19:50,00:19:56,rocho today for example so his carriage was sent around the country and it drew crowds it had
00:19:56,00:20:02,had little objects that he had owned like a gold tongue scraper a flesh brush and a chocolate
00:20:02,00:20:07,pot sorry what's a flesh brush I think I'm not certain it's a brush with hard bristles that you
00:20:07,00:20:12,use to stimulate your skin and stimulate blood flow but I am not certain did you guys know that
00:20:12,00:20:17,this this is a bit of research that I did in the b-series and no one liked it Napoleon um
00:20:18,00:20:26,had a little jeanie that he used to talk to called it a little one point five it
00:20:26,00:20:30,straight up jeanie honestly it's more but it works magic just rub it just rub it
00:20:30,00:20:40,um no he he had a um it's apparently someone who before big battles used to come from the stars
00:20:40,00:20:43,called the red man is what he called them the red man and he first appeared during the battle of
00:20:43,00:20:48,the pyramids and the supposedly Napoleon said he made a pact a ten-year pact with this jeanie
00:20:49,00:20:56,oh weird uh recipes since penis uh that was sold um and it turned out later to be a dried up piece of
00:20:56,00:21:01,sea cucumber and not a penis at all just can you imagine all the women who were disappointed in
00:21:01,00:21:09,the bedroom by that and Tutankhamoon another famous person was the only mummy uh who was buried
00:21:09,00:21:17,within the wrecked penis wow someone else is on his own yes one of the best sentences
00:21:17,00:21:21,set out loud in this office i'm convinced was one night when me and james were sitting here uh
00:21:21,00:21:26,and putting music to one of the no such thing as a fish podcast and in a moment of silence
00:21:26,00:21:31,where james saw oh i've got you know i should just start a conversation james said to me
00:21:31,00:21:34,hey did you know over 600 men in the world have two dicks
00:21:34,00:21:42,yeah no that is true like 600 men have two dicks there was a circus performer who had two penises
00:21:43,00:21:50,remember him no um no i missed i missed that i missed when i was seven that zippo circus
00:21:50,00:21:56,you were concentrating on the clouds and the elephants yeah there we go
00:21:56,00:22:03,don't see the man exposing himself by the door of the tent um that's true i'm not sure he was
00:22:03,00:22:07,part of the circus i'm thinking about it it might be two ben
00:22:10,00:22:16,so the guy was called um Juan Baptista dos Santos and he was known as the man with two penises
00:22:16,00:22:25,and he was born in pharaoh in Portugal in 1843 and in 1865 he turned down the sum of 200 000
00:22:25,00:22:30,francs to appear for two years with a French circus huh and press of guy that would be very
00:22:30,00:22:35,difficult for his tailor though which way to serve dressed to the left no actually both to the left and
00:22:35,00:22:47,the right okay moving on to our final fact to the show fact number four Andy yours my fact is
00:22:47,00:22:52,to say i don't care about something a german person has the option of saying it's sausage to me
00:22:54,00:23:02,or in german does this me a worst um yeah so there there's a rich heritage of sausage sayings in
00:23:02,00:23:07,germany um there's another one which suggests that it's very important is that sausage is very
00:23:07,00:23:13,important where you say uh is gate undiwurst which is it's all about the sausage um anyway this is
00:23:13,00:23:19,from a blog on uh Oxford dictionaries website from the oup they have other ones like um if you're
00:23:19,00:23:24,sulking you aren't playing the offended liver pate de belay dig de liver worst spielin
00:23:24,00:23:30,that's like i think that's like referring to the bottom lip sticking out isn't it it's like a bit of
00:23:30,00:23:36,liver is it i think so yeah they have a sausage academy i believe do they what yeah you can get a sausage
00:23:36,00:23:43,diploma and in germany you can get is it a diploma that's also a sausage i i also have a sausage
00:23:43,00:23:50,"diploma i got it from banger university and is right there's uh 1,300 students have earned"
00:23:50,00:23:54,certificates at the sausage academy they learn things like what's the right master to put with
00:23:54,00:23:59,what sausage and which is the best log to drink with it in america they have the national hotdog
00:23:59,00:24:05,academy and they do a similar thing they have rules about eating hotdogs uh and so for instance one
00:24:05,00:24:11,of them is don't take more than five bites to finish a hotdog for foot long weeners seven bites are
00:24:11,00:24:19,acceptable and also don't use ketchup on your hotdog after the age of eighteen mustard relish
00:24:19,00:24:25,onions cheese and chili are acceptable the first hotdog eating competition was held in 1916
00:24:25,00:24:29,which i think was in the states so the year before they entered the war when they were still
00:24:29,00:24:35,locking around and the winner ate 13 frankfurters i don't know in what time scale that was but recently
00:24:35,00:24:42,the the latest record i've found is from last year where at a man eight 69 hotdogs in 10 minutes with
00:24:42,00:24:46,buns i highly recommend anyone listening if they want to find out more about this kind of hotdog
00:24:46,00:24:52,eating competition stuff uh i just read an article by john ronson in his book lost at sea called
00:24:52,00:24:57,the hunger games and he interviews the top the person who set that record that Andy just read out
00:24:57,00:25:05,it's him into john ronson interviewing him and it's phenomenal the industry great breakthrough was um
00:25:05,00:25:10,a very small slight looking i think japanese yeah who came up with the incredible innovation that you
00:25:10,00:25:15,don't have to chew your way through the buns you dip them in water which makes them a lot smaller a
00:25:15,00:25:20,lot easier to swallow quickly and revolutionize the game but actually it was the fosbrew flot moment
00:25:20,00:25:24,in competitive hotdog eating but actually there is controversy whether you should be allowed to do
00:25:24,00:25:30,that it sounds like cheating i think i definitely think you shouldn't i'm afraid to say no um i found a
00:25:30,00:25:37,there's a japanese book uh which is it's published in edambrough and it's called the insider's guide
00:25:37,00:25:41,to scotland obviously though with a japanese title that's the translated title and in the book
00:25:41,00:25:47,they um advise anyone from japan visiting scotland to avoid eating the sausages
00:25:47,00:25:54,oh yeah um speaking of um parts of the uk and sausages um there is a Welsh product called dragon
00:25:54,00:25:58,sausages and it had to be taken off the shelves because it didn't contain any dragons
00:25:59,00:26:04,right yeah a power scounty council spokesman said the product was not sufficiently precise to
00:26:04,00:26:12,inform a purchaser of the true nature of the food there's a man called david harding in london
00:26:12,00:26:17,who's become the first official sausage addict and he's spent two more than two grand on therapy
00:26:17,00:26:21,to try and get over it um because he can't live he says i genuinely cannot bear the thought of living
00:26:21,00:26:25,without sausages he thinks he's had at least one sausage a day since he was three and he's having
00:26:25,00:26:29,therapy to why would you need therapy to get over that just buys it then i'm going anyway
00:26:29,00:26:34,to find another sausage oh yeah that's that's your attitude to old drugs isn't it
00:26:34,00:26:41,it's a very good sign okay in everywhere why don't you just carry on just like it's a shot
00:26:41,00:26:48,it just have some more cocaine and it's like man up um sausages are very elderly um
00:26:48,00:26:54,they are they've been long and noble history haven't they? yeah i've found a lot of things online
00:26:54,00:26:58,i don't need to properly stack it up but i think they're older than ancient Rome
00:26:59,00:27:03,yes which is cool i'm pretty sure they are um i think poma mentions one
00:27:03,00:27:08,there's an aristophany's play called the knights as in knights of the round table uh in which a
00:27:08,00:27:15,sausage seller uh beats a demagogue in conversation over politics because he knows how to do all the
00:27:15,00:27:19,stuff like minting up policies and stuff them and dress them up looking all nice and pretty
00:27:19,00:27:24,uh yeah well that's the thing they say laws are like sausages don't they?
00:27:24,00:27:29,yeah was it Bismarck? I think it was Bismarck who said it um laws are like sausages it's best not to
00:27:29,00:27:35,watch them being made yeah something like that and so we talk about how old sausages are um they were
00:27:35,00:27:43,banned um or blood sausages were banned by Leo the wise he ruled in the um attempt century and he
00:27:43,00:27:48,banned the blood sausage and the pronouncement was like this it said we hereby forbid all persons
00:27:48,00:27:54,either to use or sell it and we give notice that if anyone should in contempt of divine
00:27:54,00:28:00,law have been found to have prepared blood as food whether he sells or buys it he shall have all his
00:28:00,00:28:08,property confiscated wow and after being severely scourged and disgracefully shaved he shall be exiled
00:28:08,00:28:13,for life disgracefully shaved what is that that's wonderful that's very funny um the Catholic church
00:28:13,00:28:17,bound them in the fourth century as well because um they were thought to be a part of pagan rituals
00:28:17,00:28:23,which they were often hey this is really exciting there's uh there's a bunch of forgotten grim fairy
00:28:23,00:28:31,tales stories and one of them is called the mouse the bird and the sausage a mouse with a bird
00:28:31,00:28:35,of the sausage set up a house together for a while and things are going well birds job was to fly
00:28:35,00:28:39,into the forest every day bring back wood mouse carried water let the fire set the table sausage
00:28:39,00:28:45,did the cooking making sure their meals were probably flavoured by rolling around in them
00:28:45,00:28:52,I think we should then wrap up yeah okay uh Freddie do you want to add anything before we wrap up
00:28:52,00:28:57,yeah I I have one thing um it's kind of mundane but pretty impressive all the same so as
00:28:57,00:29:03,actually commissioned in 2000 the creation of the world's longest sausage and it was made in
00:29:03,00:29:12,Sheffield and it measured 59.14 kilometers kilometers yeah 36.75 miles wow did they just not
00:29:12,00:29:19,turn on the thing which divides the sausages up you know so they just have a continuous production line
00:29:19,00:29:24,one sausage that must be it oh that's great good fact that's good there's one of the world's most
00:29:24,00:29:40,frightening penis metaphor with that Napoleon looked on with envy okay that's it for this
00:29:40,00:29:44,episode a no such thing as a fish that is all of our facts if you want to talk to us about any of
