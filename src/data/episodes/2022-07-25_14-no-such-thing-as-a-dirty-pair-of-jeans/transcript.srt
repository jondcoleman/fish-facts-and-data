1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 we run it on QI a few years ago yeah um which was there's no such thing as a fish

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,280
 isn't it nice or something as a fish? no seriously it's in a tea

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,680
 Oxford dictionary of underwater life he says it right there first paragraph no

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,200
 such thing as a fish

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:23,520
 hey everyone welcome to another edition of no such thing as a fish a weekly

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,440
 podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden my name is Dan

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,240
 Shriver sitting here with the regular three QI elves Anichesensky Andy Murray

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,840
 and James Harkin and we've got joining us today on fact checking Judy's

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,680
 Freddie Somes and once again we have gathered around the microphones and

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,480
 our offices to tell each other our favorite facts from the last seven days so in

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
 no particular order here we go

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,600
 first up it's James oh my fact this week is that the CEO of Levi's chip

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
 Berg hasn't washed his jeans in more than a year

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,720
 so when you first mentioned this to us yes I thought that wasn't that

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,640
 surprising because I didn't really wash jeans and didn't realise that was a

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
 thing I was shocked and I wanted to know where his mother was

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,680
 and I wash my jeans every day but Aniches crisps up a plate come on that's true

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,760
 can't trust his household habits but apparently I'm right right so a jeans

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,600
 a fish or no I don't know yeah well there are lots of people who think that you

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,480
 shouldn't wash jeans because it fades the colors and it spoils the fabric but

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,600
 that's people who work for jeans companies not so much microbiologists who

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
 tend to think that you probably should wash them because there's going to be

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,120
 lots of bacteria on there and so how much bacteria are we talking okay so there

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,240
 was a student at the University of Alberta called Josh Ley holy and he as an

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
 experiment wore the same pair of jeans for 15 months without washing them

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,760
 and after two weeks he found that he had around a thousand to two thousand

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,480
 bacteria per square centimetre that was on the front of the jeans

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,080
 1500 to 2500 on the back and between 8,000 and 10,000 in the crop

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
 area lovely I wonder how many more that is than we

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,160
 have on our skin yeah well you do have bacteria on your skin we have we have 10

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
 times more bacterial cells than human cells in our bodies is that right yes most

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,600
 of them are very small cells in the gut but 90% of you is not human

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,640
 yeah and doesn't isn't that where all the smell comes from

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,840
 so you should remember saying this to you guys a long time ago but that's where

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,520
 that's why you smell it's not you it's a little animal that's

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,720
 it's a very poor excuse on a date though it's not me it's the 90% of cells which

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,000
 aren't me in my body so if someone ever says to you oh you smell of sweat today

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
 you just say no I smell of bacterial feces actually

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
 in your face where are you going don't get in that taxi

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
 promise for us

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
 and so I don't know do you just not do anything with your jeans and or do you put

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
 them in the freezer like some people do I don't really understand this freezer thing

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,160
 what's the freezer thing well that's what this this guy from Levi says that

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,600
 instead of washing you can click you can kill the bacteria by putting your

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,640
 jeans in the freezer and one it it means that it doesn't fade the jeans and

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
 what have you but too it also will save water and apparently

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,600
 people are using a lot of water all the time uselessly for washing their jeans

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,960
 so that's a bit like that's like a cool way of cleaning in the same way that

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,080
 remember the person who used to have an asbestos um tablecloth

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,160
 oh yeah Charlemagne yeah yeah yeah do you know about that Andy

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 okay so like Dan says exactly that he had an asbestos tablecloth

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,040
 after each meal he would take it out throw it in the fire

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,080
 and then let the fire clean it and then he would bring it out and use it again

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
 did he die young by any chance can I tell you my favorite thing about this Levi's bass

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
 yeah go on is that I just like that the head of Levi's

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,440
 wears Levi's yeah it's just I love anytime you hear a story where someone uses the thing

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,120
 that they created or or that they're the head of like when I was wearing my

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,360
 nose which thing is a fish t-shirt that cue I recordings this week exactly yeah

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
 there's no shame in the buy online in New Zealand not from us not from us

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,360
 I like it even more so when you see the the company getting in trouble for

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
 something to do with their own company like for example Jimmy Wales who created

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
 Wikipedia got in trouble for editing his own Wikipedia page

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
 which is the top line of what you're not meant to do and he got busted for it

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
 and I don't know what he was thinking because it comes up as edited by Jimmy Wales

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,720
 I think we tweeted this the other day and Freddie you might have to check which

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
 you news they were but there's an American uni that

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,040
 or a guidelines on plagiarism and it was all plagiarized from another American

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
 oh yeah that's a great fact that was yeah that's it's a cue I tweet if you can find that

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,160
 do we know who invented jeans by the way well there's a difference between

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
 jeans and blue jeans you know the blue jeans that everyone wears today

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
 yeah we're invented in the late 19th century in America but this is cool

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,640
 there have been paintings discovered from the 1650s where people are wearing

73
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,200
 the blue cloth sort of fixed him with white which is the you know the proper

74
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,520
 jean fabric and the artist is unknown but he's called the master of the blue jeans

75
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
 and so in one there's a peasant wearing a blue skirt and others boy in a rip dark blue jacket

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
 and it looks like they're wearing jeans in the 1600s yeah yeah and double denim it's very very cool

77
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
 that's so mean because that's where it comes from denim doesn't it?

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
 would possibly denim is from neem or it's either there or it's from

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,360
 genoa in Italy which is where they think we might get the word jeans from

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,800
 but that's not that's not blue jeans with the rivets in those those were the ones which

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
 took over the whole world yeah but Levi's didn't call their product jeans did they for a long time

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,680
 um i think for the first 107 years they called them waste overalls really we had a fact in one

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,400
 of our books that half of the world's population are wearing jeans at any one time oh yeah um

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
 can't remember where it came from i think i missed maybe i know where it came from oh go on

85
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,240
 well it was a man called miller who visited lots and lots of countries and in every country he

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,960
 visited he stopped and counted the first 100 people to walk by and in each one he found that almost

87
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,240
 half of the population were wearing jeans on any given date which is unbelievable yeah it's fantastic

88
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,120
 i'm wearing jeans now i'm wearing jeans yeah me too i'm not wearing jeans yeah i'm just

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:22,960
 smelling it i thought yeah just going back to um not really washing etc um there was a very famous

90
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,720
 dirty celebrity um in the um 19th century i think i think i think i thought we were going to say

91
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,600
 in the 1970s and he was called dirty dick you know dirty dicks pub uh some Liverpool street

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,920
 and the Liverpool street station uh on bishopsgate uh and what happened was on his uh wedding day his

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,760
 fiancee died very sadly and then after that he refused to wash or clean for the rest of his life

94
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,720
 and lived in this place in in London and he became really famous for being dirty and never washing and

95
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,080
 if you sent any letters uh addressed to the dirty warehouse in London they would always get to him

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,360
 because he was self-famous for being dirty well there wasn't much in Queen Victoria that washing

97
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
 was really bad for you as well didn't she? Was it people did? Yeah in 19th century very unwashedable

98
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,840
 okay um before we move on uh Freddie have you got anything to add? Yeah so um the tweet that was on

99
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,960
 quick immediately other day was that um a university in Oregon has plagiarized the section on

100
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,640
 plagiarism in its student handbook um from the section on plagiarism in stanford university's handbook

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:36,480
 wow so good um we took that tweet from omg facts okay let's uh move on to fact number two and this

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,760
 fact is my one uh it's a long one so I was just I found this pretty astonishing the first successful

103
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,920
 transatlantic flight which happened in 1919 was made by two guys from Manchester but it's one of

104
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,480
 those trips where uh it was just a complete disaster but they managed to do it but my favorite bit about

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,720
 the fact is that at one point they got completely lost while they were in the air they were just

106
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,600
 covered in cloud and fog and when they came out of the cloud and fog thinking that they were 13,000

107
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,320
 feet in the air it turned out they were only 60 feet above the water and not only that that they

108
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,160
 were flying sideways on a 90 degree angle to the surface of the ocean wow how will they try and

109
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,360
 always know when I'm at 90 degrees because of gravity yeah were they so tense while they were

110
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,680
 flying that they just didn't oh so stiff they were they were so tense now I got this from Bill

111
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,240
 Bryson's book one summer america 1927 he was saying this is how tense it was for them to do it the

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,840
 guy who was in front who was called allcock was holding onto the wheel they didn't have a cover

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,080
 over them it was like a convertible plane and the other guy's job who was brown had to sit forward

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,440
 and using his two index fingers as kind of windshield wipers on the goggles of allcock that was his

115
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,280
 job to basically just be wiping them away he also had to jump out onto the wings of the plane six

116
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,600
 times in order to knock icing off and get back on ice you mean ice they flew through the great cake

117
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:14,640
 yeah so when was this what year was this 1919 um they did the first transatlantic yeah yeah

118
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,920
 yeah but they went from Canada didn't they they went from Newfoundland yeah to Ireland yeah um but at

119
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,840
 one point they even went the wrong way they did a loop and started heading back towards Canada

120
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,920
 it is pretty easy to get disorientated I think when you're flying um shame on me I can't

121
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,880
 remember who it was but there was an explorer who was in a balloon and he went up very very high

122
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,560
 and sort of passed out or fell asleep or something like that and then when he woke up um he thought he'd

123
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,160
 landed and so decided to get out of the plane to just walk on the snow which he saw below and only

124
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
 when he was halfway out of the balloon did he realize that it wasn't snow it was actually the clouds

125
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,080
 and he was still 20,000 feet up oh my god uh in 1914 when you look at the military use of airplanes

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,440
 this is fact here that the French Air Corps had the largest air force in the world larger than

127
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,200
 Germany, Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan and Austria all combined and they only had three dozen

128
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,320
 planes and that was the largest in the world so how many to the rest of us have four each or

129
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,960
 between us each each and America had two and in the space of four years they went up to

130
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,360
 Britain having 55,000, Germany having 48,000, Italy having 20,000 and France still have 36

131
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,000
 do you want to hear something cool about Lindbergh? Yes please you made the first solo flight from

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,600
 New York to Paris he was the 19th person to cross the Atlantic in a plane oh really?

133
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,280
 yeah see the first solo then he was the first solo New York to Paris that was the thing and New York

134
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,880
 is a much further distance because obviously it's further down the coast so lots of people talk

135
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,400
 about the amazing length you went to to cut down the weight of the plane and even cut the top and the

136
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,200
 bottom off his map so that it would save a couple of ounces but he also had this thing he said I had

137
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,400
 an arm burst cup which is a device for condensing the moisture from human breath into drinking water

138
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,920
 how cool is that? Why don't we still have these? He didn't realize how famous he was going to be

139
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,840
 did he? He knew he might be in the papers so he he subscribed to a cutting service that would send

140
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,320
 all the newspaper cuttings to his mother's house thinking it would just be a few here or there

141
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,040
 but of course it was in every single newspaper for days and days and days and by the end of his

142
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,080
 first week his mother discovered to a horror that a fleet of trucks was preparing to deliver several

143
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,840
 tons of newspaper articles to our house. Reports were at the time like if he left something on his

144
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,880
 plate you know a meal like corn on the cob that waiters would fight over it because that would

145
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,400
 become really precious I could drum as drumstick after a gig yeah exactly an actual drumstick for corn

146
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,720
 so the right flyer was the right brothers plane that they first flew and what's the highest

147
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,320
 altitude that any part of it reached? 20 feet 30 feet I'm thinking it's a QI question so I think

148
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,840
 I know the answer yeah go on is it the moon? It's so the moon oh of course another one of

149
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,160
 nails little trinkets you brought up Neil Armstrong brought it up to brought up a bit of the wing

150
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,120
 we had a few series ago Buzz Aldrin on Museum of Curiosity sister show to QI and no such thing as a fish

151
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,640
 cousin of no such thing as a fish and I found this fact that I hadn't read in any of his biographies

152
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,120
 I can't even remember where I found it now but I I mentioned it to him in person because I thought

153
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,240
 this is gonna be amazing to say that Buzz Aldrin I discovered that his dad was mates with one of

154
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,920
 the right brothers so within the father's lifetime he knew the first person to fly a plane and his

155
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,800
 son became the first well second person to stand on the moon and so I said to him you might have

156
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,080
 actually met him because you were at the same air force base where your dad and he worked and he

157
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,480
 went yeah I guess so and he just wasn't interested I thought I delivered I think it's the way

158
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,720
 you tell him dad the right brothers dad told them that they were never allowed to fly together didn't

159
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,400
 he because he was right that one of them was going to die so they only flew together once in their

160
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,080
 whole life and you know on that so after their first flight in the right flyer in 1983 I think it was

161
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,520
 then so they they took turns flying and they had goes on it and they flew further and further and

162
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,120
 then they had a chat about it stood next to the plane had a chat about it and the right flyer never

163
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,960
 flew again after that day because a gust of wind picked it up and afflicted over a bunch of times

164
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,200
 and broke it oh really yeah just as they were talking they're like oh shit there goes that do you

165
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,520
 guys know who was the first woman to fly solo in an aeroplane is it not a female lady human

166
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,840
 is it a female animal is it a female ant is it a tortoise it's not even a qi thing it's just a

167
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,120
 question and it's a question to which none of you know the answer tell us the answer god damn it it

168
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,720
 was blanched you at Scott of course because the story was quite good because she was the first

169
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,120
 woman to fly solo in an aeroplane she reached 40 feet and it was in 1910 and she was a friend of an

170
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,440
 aviator called Glenn Curtis and he like was a time in in those days nobody thought a woman should

171
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,720
 really be in an aeroplane and he allowed her to sort of taxi around the airfield in the aeroplane

172
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,920
 but she wasn't allowed to take off and then something happened we don't know what happened

173
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,720
 on september the second in 1910 and she managed to take off and ended up going up to 40 feet in the air

174
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,840
 and no one really knows how she managed to do it because what he would do is he he would insert a

175
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,960
 block of wood behind the throttle to stop her from reaching the necessary speed to take off and then

176
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,080
 assume that a woman would not have the intelligence to remove a block of wood from behind the throttle

177
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,280
 because my theory is that's probably what she did or it might have come loose itself and did she

178
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,720
 land it yeah so she didn't die no she didn't die okay that's good news good blanche I have a

179
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 fun fact about the guy who invented the autopilot oh cool um who was Lawrence Ferry who I think you're

180
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,960
 familiar with Andy yeah but so he also inadvertently invented something else which was the mile high

181
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:22,000
 club sorry I was going to make that like attention thing so yeah in 1916 he was going flying lessons

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,520
 to this socialite called Mrs Waldo Pierce whose husband to make this story a bit more poignant was

183
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,120
 driving an ambulance in France at the time in the war her husband was friends with Anna's

184
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,120
 Hemingway by coincidence um so Lawrence Ferry autopilot inventor Mrs Waldo Pierce go up in his

185
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,160
 plane he uses his autopilot um to flight the plane for a while while he has a quick uh bit of uh

186
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,400
 whatever you want to give it how's your father bumpy bumpy with Mrs Waldo um and the plane crashed

187
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,920
 something went wrong with the autopilot people think that they kicked it during their

188
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,720
 relations and kicked the autopilot of course and the plane crashed into a duck pond and they were found

189
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,960
 unclothed by duck hunters fortunately her husband was driving an ambulance nearby

190
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,520
 sperry claim they'd been divested by the force of the crash when they emerged

191
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:18,960
 isn't there a fact that the first ever hot air balloon trip there was some hanky panky going on

192
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,760
 in there it's not the first ever because i think that was the mongolian brothers

193
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:31,200
 George Bigin and Latisha Sage went up in a balloon organised by an Italian man called Lunardi

194
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,480
 but he got out just at the last minute and it went over Piccadilly and as it went over Piccadilly

195
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,320
 people could see sage on all fours um although she maintained that she was not having sex i think

196
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,640
 she said she was looking for something like i can't remember for sure and all of all of her

197
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,920
 clothes had fallen off in the excitement of going up and so then later on in these big wager books

198
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,440
 that they have in London clubs um one one wager reads "Lord Chambley has given two guineas to Lord

199
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,720
 Derby to receive 500 guineas whenever his lordship plays hospitals with a woman in a balloon a

200
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,440
 thousand yards from the earth" maybe people's clothes were just much more poorly designed in the

201
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:17,680
 olden days maybe they just never washed their jeans they just fell off crumbling away

202
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:26,240
 okay um time from fact number three and there is annas uh yeah my fact is that in 2007 a

203
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:35,600
 woman called Evan Latimer inherited Napoleon's penis from her father so that happened yep um so

204
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,560
 basically at Napoleon's autopsy in 1921 there were 17 doctors present um and it's thought that

205
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,280
 the main his physician his main doctor cut off his penis we know that bits of his body were removed

206
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,760
 so his heart was removed because he wanted it sent to his wife his strange wife although i never

207
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,880
 got her and there's a theory that it was eaten by rats um and anyway then it was later admitted by one

208
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,520
 of the doctors who was there that other bits of Napoleon's body were also removed so it resurfaced

209
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
 at the beginning of the 20th century from the family of the priest who was also present at the

210
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,720
 autopsy whom the physician had given it to um and yeah it was put up it was sold to a collector and

211
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,560
 it's been sold at various auctions and it's been on display in New York in 1974 only three thousand

212
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,240
 dollars he bought it for in 1977 that would have been more money a bit more but also it was questionable

213
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,760
 whether it was his penis at all but was this woman upset that you know did her elder sister get

214
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,000
 the Duke of Wellington's penis in the well or something was it was the whole bequest penises

215
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,480
 of one side because his penis is certainly diminutive it measures 1.5 inches now and there is a

216
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,640
 defense that it wasn't very well preserved so there's been some shriveling but it's it's been

217
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
 likened to various things it's been likened over the years by people who've seen it to shriveled

218
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,280
 eel beef jerky and a bit of leather um and it's 1.5 inches um yeah it was described as a mummified

219
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,160
 tendon I believe when he removed it was a very delicate way of describing a severed penis yeah certainly

220
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,760
 better than shriveled eel I first read this fact in a book called the antiques magpie which is

221
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,360
 really good um and it's written by an antiques rocho expert he thinks that the reason the willy

222
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,440
 was locked off was because the physician was annoyed at being left out of Napoleon's will

223
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,360
 oh I know I read it it was the chaplain who wanted it done as an act of revenge um because

224
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
 uh Napoleon kept calling him impotent well he did give it to the chaplain so maybe they both had

225
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
 a chat in the pub one night and he was like I'm really pissed off in the polian I'm not in his will

226
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
 and the chaplain was like I'm pissed off in the polian too he's called me impotent and they agreed

227
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,640
 to it maybe they maybe they each got half which explains its size that's such a good point yeah um

228
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,760
 it's actually three inches we've been unfair the thing is that often Napoleon was captured at

229
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,720
 Waterloo all of his belongings were sent on tour around England very much like the x factor

230
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,640
 rocho today for example so his carriage was sent around the country and it drew crowds it had

231
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,480
 had little objects that he had owned like a gold tongue scraper a flesh brush and a chocolate

232
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,440
 pot sorry what's a flesh brush I think I'm not certain it's a brush with hard bristles that you

233
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,560
 use to stimulate your skin and stimulate blood flow but I am not certain did you guys know that

234
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,760
 this this is a bit of research that I did in the b-series and no one liked it Napoleon um

235
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,560
 had a little jeanie that he used to talk to called it a little one point five it

236
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,960
 straight up jeanie honestly it's more but it works magic just rub it just rub it

237
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:40,240
 um no he he had a um it's apparently someone who before big battles used to come from the stars

238
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,680
 called the red man is what he called them the red man and he first appeared during the battle of

239
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,560
 the pyramids and the supposedly Napoleon said he made a pact a ten-year pact with this jeanie

240
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,720
 oh weird uh recipes since penis uh that was sold um and it turned out later to be a dried up piece of

241
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,680
 sea cucumber and not a penis at all just can you imagine all the women who were disappointed in

242
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:09,520
 the bedroom by that and Tutankhamoon another famous person was the only mummy uh who was buried

243
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:17,440
 within the wrecked penis wow someone else is on his own yes one of the best sentences

244
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,760
 set out loud in this office i'm convinced was one night when me and james were sitting here uh

245
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,960
 and putting music to one of the no such thing as a fish podcast and in a moment of silence

246
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,600
 where james saw oh i've got you know i should just start a conversation james said to me

247
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,320
 hey did you know over 600 men in the world have two dicks

248
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:42,720
 yeah no that is true like 600 men have two dicks there was a circus performer who had two penises

249
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,560
 remember him no um no i missed i missed that i missed when i was seven that zippo circus

250
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,320
 you were concentrating on the clouds and the elephants yeah there we go

251
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,680
 don't see the man exposing himself by the door of the tent um that's true i'm not sure he was

252
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,280
 part of the circus i'm thinking about it it might be two ben

253
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,080
 so the guy was called um Juan Baptista dos Santos and he was known as the man with two penises

254
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:25,280
 and he was born in pharaoh in Portugal in 1843 and in 1865 he turned down the sum of 200 000

255
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,800
 francs to appear for two years with a French circus huh and press of guy that would be very

256
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,840
 difficult for his tailor though which way to serve dressed to the left no actually both to the left and

257
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:47,680
 the right okay moving on to our final fact to the show fact number four Andy yours my fact is

258
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,880
 to say i don't care about something a german person has the option of saying it's sausage to me

259
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:02,400
 or in german does this me a worst um yeah so there there's a rich heritage of sausage sayings in

260
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,600
 germany um there's another one which suggests that it's very important is that sausage is very

261
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,440
 important where you say uh is gate undiwurst which is it's all about the sausage um anyway this is

262
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,280
 from a blog on uh Oxford dictionaries website from the oup they have other ones like um if you're

263
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,880
 sulking you aren't playing the offended liver pate de belay dig de liver worst spielin

264
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,560
 that's like i think that's like referring to the bottom lip sticking out isn't it it's like a bit of

265
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,320
 liver is it i think so yeah they have a sausage academy i believe do they what yeah you can get a sausage

266
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,040
 diploma and in germany you can get is it a diploma that's also a sausage i i also have a sausage

267
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:50,800
 diploma i got it from banger university and is right there's uh 1,300 students have earned

268
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,480
 certificates at the sausage academy they learn things like what's the right master to put with

269
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,440
 what sausage and which is the best log to drink with it in america they have the national hotdog

270
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,760
 academy and they do a similar thing they have rules about eating hotdogs uh and so for instance one

271
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,680
 of them is don't take more than five bites to finish a hotdog for foot long weeners seven bites are

272
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:19,040
 acceptable and also don't use ketchup on your hotdog after the age of eighteen mustard relish

273
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:25,360
 onions cheese and chili are acceptable the first hotdog eating competition was held in 1916

274
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
 which i think was in the states so the year before they entered the war when they were still

275
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,520
 locking around and the winner ate 13 frankfurters i don't know in what time scale that was but recently

276
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,320
 the the latest record i've found is from last year where at a man eight 69 hotdogs in 10 minutes with

277
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,960
 buns i highly recommend anyone listening if they want to find out more about this kind of hotdog

278
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,400
 eating competition stuff uh i just read an article by john ronson in his book lost at sea called

279
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,680
 the hunger games and he interviews the top the person who set that record that Andy just read out

280
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,280
 it's him into john ronson interviewing him and it's phenomenal the industry great breakthrough was um

281
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,640
 a very small slight looking i think japanese yeah who came up with the incredible innovation that you

282
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,520
 don't have to chew your way through the buns you dip them in water which makes them a lot smaller a

283
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
 lot easier to swallow quickly and revolutionize the game but actually it was the fosbrew flot moment

284
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,800
 in competitive hotdog eating but actually there is controversy whether you should be allowed to do

285
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,560
 that it sounds like cheating i think i definitely think you shouldn't i'm afraid to say no um i found a

286
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,200
 there's a japanese book uh which is it's published in edambrough and it's called the insider's guide

287
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,600
 to scotland obviously though with a japanese title that's the translated title and in the book

288
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,440
 they um advise anyone from japan visiting scotland to avoid eating the sausages

289
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:54,080
 oh yeah um speaking of um parts of the uk and sausages um there is a Welsh product called dragon

290
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
 sausages and it had to be taken off the shelves because it didn't contain any dragons

291
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,880
 right yeah a power scounty council spokesman said the product was not sufficiently precise to

292
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,160
 inform a purchaser of the true nature of the food there's a man called david harding in london

293
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,120
 who's become the first official sausage addict and he's spent two more than two grand on therapy

294
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,680
 to try and get over it um because he can't live he says i genuinely cannot bear the thought of living

295
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,280
 without sausages he thinks he's had at least one sausage a day since he was three and he's having

296
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,520
 therapy to why would you need therapy to get over that just buys it then i'm going anyway

297
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,000
 to find another sausage oh yeah that's that's your attitude to old drugs isn't it

298
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,040
 it's a very good sign okay in everywhere why don't you just carry on just like it's a shot

299
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,160
 it just have some more cocaine and it's like man up um sausages are very elderly um

300
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,320
 they are they've been long and noble history haven't they? yeah i've found a lot of things online

301
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,720
 i don't need to properly stack it up but i think they're older than ancient Rome

302
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,760
 yes which is cool i'm pretty sure they are um i think poma mentions one

303
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,880
 there's an aristophany's play called the knights as in knights of the round table uh in which a

304
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,280
 sausage seller uh beats a demagogue in conversation over politics because he knows how to do all the

305
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,920
 stuff like minting up policies and stuff them and dress them up looking all nice and pretty

306
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,320
 uh yeah well that's the thing they say laws are like sausages don't they?

307
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,840
 yeah was it Bismarck? I think it was Bismarck who said it um laws are like sausages it's best not to

308
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,520
 watch them being made yeah something like that and so we talk about how old sausages are um they were

309
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:43,040
 banned um or blood sausages were banned by Leo the wise he ruled in the um attempt century and he

310
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,800
 banned the blood sausage and the pronouncement was like this it said we hereby forbid all persons

311
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,240
 either to use or sell it and we give notice that if anyone should in contempt of divine

312
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,480
 law have been found to have prepared blood as food whether he sells or buys it he shall have all his

313
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,400
 property confiscated wow and after being severely scourged and disgracefully shaved he shall be exiled

314
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,920
 for life disgracefully shaved what is that that's wonderful that's very funny um the Catholic church

315
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,840
 bound them in the fourth century as well because um they were thought to be a part of pagan rituals

316
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,520
 which they were often hey this is really exciting there's uh there's a bunch of forgotten grim fairy

317
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:31,360
 tales stories and one of them is called the mouse the bird and the sausage a mouse with a bird

318
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
 of the sausage set up a house together for a while and things are going well birds job was to fly

319
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,680
 into the forest every day bring back wood mouse carried water let the fire set the table sausage

320
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,280
 did the cooking making sure their meals were probably flavoured by rolling around in them

321
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:52,560
 I think we should then wrap up yeah okay uh Freddie do you want to add anything before we wrap up

322
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,200
 yeah I I have one thing um it's kind of mundane but pretty impressive all the same so as

323
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,680
 actually commissioned in 2000 the creation of the world's longest sausage and it was made in

324
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:12,880
 Sheffield and it measured 59.14 kilometers kilometers yeah 36.75 miles wow did they just not

325
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,600
 turn on the thing which divides the sausages up you know so they just have a continuous production line

326
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,480
 one sausage that must be it oh that's great good fact that's good there's one of the world's most

327
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:40,480
