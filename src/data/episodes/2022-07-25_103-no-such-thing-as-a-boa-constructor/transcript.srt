1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,600
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,360
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,240
 This week coming to you live from Leeds.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
 My name is Dan Troiber and please welcome to the stage.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,060
 It's Aniches Innski, James Harkin and Andy Murray.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,060
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,900
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,340
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,860
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,220
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,140
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,340
 My fact this week is that Chikovsky used to hold his head

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,660
 when conducting because he was afraid it would fall off.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,940
 (audience laughing)

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,660
 So this is apparently he used to get so nervous

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,660
 when he was going on stage and there was so much going

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,180
 on in his head that he genuinely thought,

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,420
 "No, this is definitely gonna fly off halfway through the game."

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,340
 So he would sit there or stand there rather

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,900
 and have his hand just resting.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,420
 - Yeah, I thought that it wasn't true

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,660
 and I went on the internet and a few people said

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,740
 that they thought it wasn't true

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,500
 but then I found one of his best friends actually said

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,820
 that he did do this so.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,100
 - Although, less you'd trust Dan too far

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,860
 when you first told this to me last week

29
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,140
 and he told me where you'd read it.

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,860
 It wasn't a book of fiction, wasn't it?

31
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,060
 (audience laughing)

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,180
 - It was in a movie called "Still Crazy"

33
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,700
 which stars Bill Nighy and Billy Conley

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,820
 and he said that.

35
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,380
 But yeah, so it turns out a lot of people do say

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,700
 that it might not be true

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,780
 and they only say it because Tchaikovsky is one of those guys

38
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,180
 where people love to build myths around him

39
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,940
 for some reason and create stories about him

40
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,260
 and that was one possibly, but as James says,

41
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,100
 we found a source.

42
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,020
 - Well, he was a massive star, wasn't he?

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,500
 He was one of those classical musicians in the 19th century

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,980
 that was the equivalent of what's the famous band?

45
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,300
 - Just in Beaver of his day.

46
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,860
 - The Justin Beaver of his day.

47
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,620
 Yeah, when he went to America to perform,

48
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,940
 a few performances in New York,

49
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,140
 people used to cut out the pictures of his face

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,540
 and newspapers and send them to him

51
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,700
 and say, "Please sign this."

52
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,940
 And which is really creepy, but whatever.

53
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,220
 - Got a guy who thinks his head's gonna fall off as well together.

54
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,220
 (audience laughing)

55
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,580
 - Yeah, you're right, that was harsh, it was harsh.

56
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,740
 He was a troubled person,

57
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,820
 but I think the clues were there.

58
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,540
 So when he was first going to America,

59
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,460
 he was writing this diary of a questions

60
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,740
 he had to ask when he got there

61
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,580
 to make sure that he didn't screw up or die.

62
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,180
 And there were three questions

63
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,540
 and it was, is it safe to drink the water for a question?

64
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,900
 Where can I do my laundry for a question?

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,500
 What sort of hats do people wear?

66
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,140
 (audience laughing)

67
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,620
 - Wow, but that's interesting because his death

68
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,100
 is to do with a glass of water, isn't it?

69
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,940
 - Yeah, really, yeah.

70
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,460
 He's supposedly died of cholera, didn't he?

71
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,300
 - Yeah.

72
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,220
 - That's what they think, hold on,

73
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,180
 maybe he committed suicide?

74
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,180
 - Yeah, they're not sure.

75
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,580
 - Or it might be that he, so I think,

76
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,540
 'cause he was really paranoid about drinking

77
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,740
 about clean water as evidence by his to-do list

78
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,820
 when he got to America,

79
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,780
 really paranoid about clean as the water's whole life.

80
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
 And then he suddenly drunk a glass of tap water

81
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,300
 in the middle of a cholera outbreak.

82
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,020
 So people think maybe he did that on purpose.

83
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,860
 - There was one of the time when he supposedly tried

84
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,180
 to commit suicide by walking into the Moscow River

85
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,860
 and trying to catch pneumonia that way.

86
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,020
 - Yeah, sure, isn't it?

87
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,820
 - Evelyn wore, tried to kill himself by swimming out to sea,

88
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,500
 but then he got stung by a jellyfish.

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,860
 (audience laughing)

90
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,660
 He didn't like that, one bit.

91
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,660
 (audience laughing)

92
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,940
 So I think he thought, "Dying's probably even worse than this."

93
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,660
 (audience laughing)

94
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,460
 So he swam back.

95
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,820
 That was before he wrote anything as well.

96
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,180
 He wouldn't have any even more of that.

97
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,900
 I started reading something about Tchaikovsky,

98
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,340
 which is that he always had this kind of slightly

99
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,460
 uneasy relationship with the sound of the violin,

100
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,820
 because as a child, he had had this nightmare

101
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,780
 that he was being rubbed against a block of,

102
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,180
 you know, Rosen, the stuff at the--

103
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,020
 - Oh, really?

104
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,780
 - Yeah, and then I realized this was a humor piece

105
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,820
 from The New Yorker.

106
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,500
 (audience laughing)

107
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,940
 This was not true.

108
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,820
 - All the other stuff at Tchaikovsky is so crazy

109
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
 that you would think--

110
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
 - It just kind of sound like it could be true, doesn't it?

111
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,660
 - It did.

112
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,780
 - He once went to Berlin Zoo and saw a Boer Constructor

113
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,180
 being fed a large rat.

114
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,180
 - A Boer Constructor?

115
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,020
 - A Boer Constructor.

116
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,020
 (audience laughing)

117
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,100
 (audience laughing)

118
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,620
 Those Boers don't make themselves.

119
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,700
 (audience laughing)

120
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,380
 A Boer Constructor.

121
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,140
 Yes, a Boer Constrictor being fed a large rat,

122
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,420
 and he screamed, run away, started shaking all over,

123
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,660
 and he had to be in bed for a week, because--

124
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
 - Yeah.

125
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,340
 - But that's it.

126
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,100
 (audience laughing)

127
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,220
 - So, this thing about his head falling off

128
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,180
 is kind of an example of what they call glass delusion, isn't it?

129
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,020
 - Yeah.

130
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,540
 - It is a really popular delusion for about 300 years.

131
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,580
 Glass had become like this massive material

132
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,660
 that everyone was using.

133
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,500
 And it was almost a standard mental issue of the day

134
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,660
 that people had, that they thought they were made of glass

135
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,100
 and they were gonna shatter if they fell over or whatever.

136
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,820
 And then it got replaced by cement delusion a bit later.

137
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,660
 - Really?

138
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,300
 - Yeah, it did, cement delusion was a real thing.

139
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,820
 - But when was cement invented?

140
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,300
 - Well, the Romans made cement, they made a kind of cement

141
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
 that we don't really know exactly what it was anymore,

142
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,420
 but the real kind of proper time that cement was really

143
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,660
 popular was the 19th century,

144
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,220
 and that's when cement delusion came in.

145
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,180
 And actually, it always seems to be that people get deluded

146
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,380
 by whatever is the main kind of technology of the day.

147
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,660
 So people think that the internet's out to get them

148
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,780
 or whatever.

149
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,340
 And there's one that last year was the first ever known case

150
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,260
 of climate change delusion.

151
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,900
 - And it was where a guy wouldn't drink any water

152
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,540
 because he felt guilty about taking it from the earth.

153
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,940
 - Oh, oh, yeah.

154
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,420
 - Well, maybe if we all had that actually,

155
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,940
 we would be in the pickle room.

156
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,580
 King Charles VI of France.

157
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,020
 - Charles the mad, wasn't he?

158
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,020
 - Well, he was known either as Charles the mad

159
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,740
 or Charles the well-beloved,

160
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,140
 which suggests the PR people found out about the first thing.

161
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,700
 But he thought he was made of glass

162
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,140
 and he would keep pieces of iron in his pockets

163
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,220
 because he thought that would protect him

164
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,380
 if anything bumped into him

165
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,020
 or if he accidentally bumped into a doorway

166
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,180
 when he was going through it.

167
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,980
 So he would be defended against it.

168
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,820
 - Yeah.

169
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,060
 - So I think it was real.

170
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,460
 - There is a thing where your limbs can randomly fall off though.

171
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
 - What?

172
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,500
 (audience laughs)

173
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,340
 - What?

174
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,620
 - It's auto-amputation, which is when a limb decides

175
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,940
 to amputate itself.

176
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
 And the most--

177
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,700
 - When a limb decides to amputate itself.

178
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,260
 - That's a very dense sentence.

179
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,740
 - So it sounds weird coming from Adam.

180
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
 (audience laughs)

181
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,700
 - The most common form makes us unless to amputate.

182
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,620
 The most common form is dactylosis spontaneous,

183
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,700
 which is when your toes spontaneously fall off.

184
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,100
 And they don't know why this happens,

185
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,940
 but it's like a ring of tough tissue forms

186
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,460
 around the base of your little toe.

187
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,420
 And weirdly when it happens,

188
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,820
 it usually happens on both little toes at once

189
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,300
 and it starts squeezing and squeezing our little toe.

190
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,940
 And eventually your little toe falls off

191
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
 and they don't know the cause of it.

192
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,420
 And so eventually it's hanging by something called a pedical

193
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,380
 and then it just drops off.

194
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,380
 And we don't know why it happens.

195
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,820
 It's more common in the tropics,

196
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,500
 but that's the only clue we have.

197
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,340
 - Oh my god.

198
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,820
 - So anyone else have that thing where you read about a disease

199
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,380
 and then you automatically get it?

200
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,300
 (audience laughs)

201
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,900
 I am so sure my little toes are gonna fall off.

202
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,220
 (audience laughs)

203
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,260
 - I found another thing about sort of worry and fear.

204
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,660
 So the Pintupi people of Australia,

205
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,740
 who are an Aboriginal people in Australia,

206
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,540
 supposedly they have 15 different words for fear

207
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
 and this drops up a lot.

208
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,340
 And they're all specific kinds of fears.

209
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,620
 So I'm gonna pronounce this, don't write in,

210
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,460
 but Ni-Ni-Wara-Ringu.

211
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,060
 (audience laughs)

212
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,180
 - Even I'm right again.

213
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
 (audience laughs)

214
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,540
 - Do you try saying it?

215
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,060
 Ni-Ni-Wara-Ringu I think is a sudden fear

216
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,580
 that leads one to stand up to see what caused it.

217
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
 (audience laughs)

218
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,420
 What?

219
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,020
 (audience laughs)

220
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,860
 - It's cool.

221
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,700
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

222
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,860
 - Yeah.

223
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,700
 - Is that over?

224
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,860
 - I feel like I'm at it.

225
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,700
 - I'm sorry.

226
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
 - I'm gonna read the other kind of 45 out of it though.

227
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
 - No, that's the only one I've found.

228
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
 - I can't read proof of it.

229
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,780
 - That's the only one that I can print out though.

230
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,700
 (audience laughs)

231
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,340
 We should move on to our next fact soon.

232
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,300
 Anyone got anything before we do?

233
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,420
 - I've one last thing.

234
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
 - Yeah, yeah, sure.

235
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,700
 - Which is, it's not really related.

236
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,620
 It's about classical music,

237
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,260
 but I found it through looking for things about Chakowsky,

238
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,260
 which is that shock waves from the front of trombones

239
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,900
 move faster than the speed of sound.

240
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,740
 - Whoa.

241
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,580
 - Really?

242
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
 - I'm gonna miss it.

243
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,260
 - I'm gonna miss it.

244
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,100
 - Bullshit.

245
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,460
 (audience laughs)

246
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,500
 - Well, I refer you to bbc.co.uk.

247
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,580
 (audience laughs)

248
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,980
 - They've measured, they've measured that,

249
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,900
 okay, it sort of builds up in the tube of the trombone.

250
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,700
 And it leaves the front of the trombone

251
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,740
 at about 1% faster than the speed of sound.

252
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,980
 These pressure waves.

253
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,780
 And so if you're sitting in front of the trombones,

254
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,740
 if you're in an orchestra, it can be a nightmare.

255
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,580
 And sometimes people have a projector screen.

256
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,940
 - I look at anyone's that close to a trombone

257
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,540
 or you know that's gonna be a worry at a gig.

258
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,860
 - If you're in an orchestra.

259
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,140
 - Oh, sorry, the person sitting in front of the trombone.

260
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,220
 - I thought you made the audience say,

261
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,460
 "Oh, these are great seats."

262
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,460
 (audience laughs)

263
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,100
 - Wait, so people were in the orchestra

264
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,660
 were protective clothes to someone

265
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,220
 so they were getting battered by the shockwaves?

266
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,060
 - Yeah.

267
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,820
 - Some musicians who are sitting directly

268
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,380
 in front of the trombonists

269
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,940
 have protective screens between them and the trombonists.

270
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,500
 - Now I feel so passive-aggressive that motion.

271
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,580
 If I were the trombonist and I sat down,

272
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,420
 I realize someone's got a big screen up in front of me.

273
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,260
 (audience laughs)

274
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,420
 - All right, let's move on.

275
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,100
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

276
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,860
 And that is James Tarkin.

277
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,420
 - Okay, my fact this week is that asthmatic otters

278
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,820
 can be taught to use inhalers.

279
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,180
 (audience laughs)

280
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,740
 So there is asthmatic otter in Seattle Aquarium.

281
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,580
 He seemed to have contracted asthma

282
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,060
 after the wild fires got near to him

283
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,860
 when he had bad fires in Washington State.

284
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,980
 He was called Mishka, this otter.

285
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,500
 And they used food to train Mishka

286
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,700
 to kind of go up to this little inhaler thing

287
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
 and he would press it with his nose

288
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,860
 and then get a little bit of asthma medicine.

289
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,980
 - Ah.

290
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,900
 - It is the most adorable fact of all times.

291
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,100
 - This is really his.

292
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,140
 - I quite like the whole thing of offering food

293
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,940
 to get them to heal themselves through a bit of medication.

294
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,620
 There is another otter that I read about called Eddie,

295
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,940
 Eddie the otter.

296
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,620
 And Eddie had problems with his,

297
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,220
 he basically was developing arthritis in his elbows.

298
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,780
 And so they needed to get him to sort of exercise

299
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,300
 or the joints constantly.

300
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,900
 And so what they did was they set up a basketball ring

301
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,980
 and they rewarded him in fish every time he got a shot in.

302
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,580
 So they'd give him a basketball

303
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,700
 and I swear to God, this is what this says.

304
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,900
 Eddie was slam dunking into the ring.

305
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,260
 He was loving it.

306
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,340
 - He's now got a contract, doesn't he, with the NBA?

307
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,380
 - Yeah, speaking of otters that could be six foot tall.

308
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,540
 - I know.

309
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,260
 - They're a giant otters in Brazil, in the Amazon.

310
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,220
 They're otters that are up to six feet long

311
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,460
 and they're called giant otters.

312
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,380
 So they're only 5,000 left and in captivity,

313
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,660
 they have killed people, people who fall into their cages.

314
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,260
 - They're killed by an otter.

315
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,620
 - Yeah, but a huge otter.

316
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,460
 They're really powerful looking things.

317
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,660
 - They're also really, they can be really vicious though,

318
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,860
 although they're, so they can attack.

319
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,540
 - Outside of killing people, they can also.

320
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,380
 - That is the tip of the iceberg.

321
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,740
 No, the otter and family, the were,

322
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,140
 they're part of the Weasel family.

323
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,780
 And I was watching it David, after my clip the other day,

324
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,060
 there was a Weasel that was about three inches long

325
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,300
 and it killed, now it doesn't sound that impressive,

326
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,140
 it was a rabbit.

327
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,380
 It was 10 times its size.

328
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,700
 It was the biggest rabbit I've ever seen,

329
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,020
 10 times the size of it.

330
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,420
 And they wrap themselves around the necks of their prey

331
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,500
 and then they just squeeze them

332
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,620
 and then they bite them in the back of the neck

333
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,900
 and they're done and they can take prey 10 times the size of them.

334
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,340
 - Wow. - Yeah, so they're not so cute.

335
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,740
 - So I read a book called Otter by Daniel Allen

336
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,340
 and if you want otter facts, it is such a good book.

337
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,580
 So otters used to be sacred to the Zoroastrian people

338
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,340
 who lived in Persia, so multiply a run.

339
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,820
 There were 18 possible penalties for killing an otter

340
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,780
 in ancient Persia with the Zoroastrians,

341
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,260
 which included you would have to then go and kill 10,000 frogs,

342
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,220
 (laughing)

343
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,340
 10,000 snakes, 10,000 worms, 10,000 corpse flies,

344
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,260
 whatever they are, and whoever did it,

345
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,060
 he would also have to carry 10,000 loads of cleansed wood

346
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,380
 to a sacred fire and he would lose all his wealth,

347
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,660
 his property, his land and he would have to give up his daughter

348
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,940
 to godly men.

349
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,500
 (laughing)

350
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,820
 - Wow. - Yeah.

351
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,340
 - It is a Japanese folklore otter's can shape shift.

352
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,700
 And so the stories that they kind of live in moats

353
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,580
 around castles and they could turn into a beautiful woman,

354
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,700
 invite a man over and then eat and kill him.

355
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,540
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

356
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,580
 - People are waking up, be caught next to a daughter.

357
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,540
 Oh, I swear to god, she's a beautiful woman last night.

358
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,940
 (laughing)

359
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,300
 - And also they can shape shift and full people

360
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,620
 into engaging in sumo against a rock or a tree stump.

361
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,900
 (laughing)

362
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,060
 When St. Cuthbert, he was a seventh century saint

363
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,340
 and when he walked into the sea one night to pray

364
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,100
 and when he walked out two otters approached him

365
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,380
 and warmed his feet ceremonially by rubbing themselves

366
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,180
 on him and breathing on his feet, otter.

367
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,380
 - They were probably just trying to dry off,

368
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,900
 I imagine, and his feet happened to be there.

369
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,940
 I'm sure he's interpreted it as an affectionate move

370
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,220
 but when they come out of the water,

371
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,780
 they have to rub themselves on a lot of stuff.

372
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,820
 And this must be the most annoying thing,

373
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,660
 coastal otters who live in the sea,

374
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,460
 every time they are in the sea and then they come out of the sea,

375
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,140
 they have to then go and have a shower in fresh water somewhere

376
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,980
 because if they keep the salt on their fur

377
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,300
 for any amount of time, then it ruins the waterproofing

378
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,140
 of their fur.

379
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,380
 So they live in the sea but every time they get out of the sea

380
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,060
 they have to find some fresh water immediately

381
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,140
 and wash the salt out of it.

382
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,980
 - Oh, wow.

383
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,820
 - How annoying is that?

384
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,660
 - Yeah.

385
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,340
 Do you guys know the surface area of an otter?

386
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
 (laughing)

387
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,500
 I mean, roughly, yeah.

388
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,660
 - So one more with Cuthbert.

389
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,500
 - What would you say?

390
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,660
 - About one square meter.

391
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,220
 - I don't know, including the hairs.

392
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,060
 - Yeah.

393
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,500
 - We're do the surface area.

394
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,340
 - Yeah.

395
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,820
 - Yeah, if you tend to go to a surface area,

396
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,900
 including the hairs.

397
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,740
 - Yeah.

398
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,860
 - And I know that they have 70,000 hairs per centimeter squared

399
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,340
 so a quick bit of calculation.

400
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,060
 - That's right, they're about 10 tennis courts.

401
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,100
 (laughing)

402
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,700
 - A million carparks.

403
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
 - No, that's it.

404
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,540
 - No, what is it?

405
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
 - What are the size of whales?

406
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,060
 (laughing)

407
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,460
 - About the size of a hockey rink.

408
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,980
 - That doesn't have.

409
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,820
 - That's great.

410
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,060
 - They say like the size of a shoe or something.

411
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
 I don't know.

412
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,740
 (laughing)

413
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,660
 So they've got more hairs on them

414
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,100
 than any animal in the animal kingdom.

415
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,460
 So if you have that to go total surface area,

416
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,740
 the size of a hockey rink.

417
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,580
 - Which is--

418
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,420
 - That's not amazing.

419
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,980
 - Yeah, I read that the sea otters have the densest

420
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,220
 'cause they spend the whole lives basically in the sea.

421
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,660
 They mate and they eat and they sleep and they feed.

422
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,420
 They spend almost all the time floating on the backs

423
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,300
 and they have up to 165,000 hairs per square centimeter.

424
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,660
 That's the densest you get.

425
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,660
 But I think that's more than a human has hairs on their head.

426
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,620
 One thing that's interesting about sea otters is they use tools.

427
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,060
 So they can get stones and they can crack open shells

428
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,220
 to get the food inside.

429
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,500
 But there are people whose job it is

430
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,580
 to be an otter archaeologist.

431
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,620
 And they want to go and find the tools that the otters use

432
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,620
 so they can see kind of how they've evolved.

433
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,100
 So a normal archaeologist would go and find old human tools.

434
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,540
 But there are people looking for old otter tools.

435
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,380
 That's cool, isn't it?

436
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,220
 - That's really cool.

437
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,620
 - But the problem is that a stone like after they've broken

438
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,820
 the thing, they just kind of drop it to the bottom of the ocean

439
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,860
 and it just looks like a stone then.

440
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,340
 - Yeah, there's not like now they have spanners and seed drills

441
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,180
 and stuff.

442
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
 And we need to look at where they started.

443
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,100
 We're not going, wow, to start somewhere.

444
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,820
 - Also, how does a single archaeologist

445
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,540
 able to take them away? - So what they do now

446
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,100
 is because they can't really work out which stones are used

447
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,700
 by otters in which hand.

448
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,340
 They get like, they get--

449
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,740
 - So they just get some stones, so it's probably these.

450
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,580
 - So what they do is they get like old ancient otter skeletons

451
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,460
 and they look at the teeth and they see whether they've used--

452
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,780
 if they had to use a teeth to open the shells and they'll be cracked

453
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,220
 and if they didn't have to use a teeth, then they won't be cracked

454
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,860
 and so you can tell when they started using tools.

455
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,980
 - Wow. - That's amazing.

456
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,900
 - They also have, we think they smell in quite an incredible way

457
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,980
 because they can't technically smell underwater.

458
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,340
 The water stops the smell particles

459
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,420
 and being able to get to their nose.

460
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,860
 So what is thought that they do, what we've seen them doing,

461
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,020
 is they blow a snot bubble out of their nose while they're underwater

462
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,660
 and then they blow it out towards what they think is some prey

463
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,460
 and then they immediately suck it back in again.

464
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,260
 So they get the scent of the prey into the air and the snot bubble

465
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,980
 and they suck it back in and they can smell it.

466
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,260
 - Oh, wait. - That's incredible.

467
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,740
 - That's a perani what they're doing

468
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,380
 and that's how they smell if it's prey they want to eat

469
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,700
 or if it's just a bit of rock.

470
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,780
 - That's so cool.

471
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,540
 - We should move on to our next fact very soon.

472
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,380
 Anyone got anything before we do?

473
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,900
 - Some stuff about asthma very quickly. - Yeah, sure.

474
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,340
 - So Thomas Penny, who is an English entomologist,

475
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,260
 thought that if you took crushed wood lyce, that would cure asthma.

476
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
 - Huh?

477
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,340
 - Something that actually can cure asthma is roller coasters

478
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,380
 or you can't cure it but you can leave the symptoms.

479
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,020
 - It can make you forget about it for three minutes.

480
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
 (laughing)

481
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,940
 - Yeah, this is an Ig Nobel study actually

482
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,380
 and they check people's kind of breathing, breathing,

483
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,580
 not breathing.

484
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,220
 - Not a roller coaster, James.

485
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,020
 (laughing)

486
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
 - The bars are damn it. - Three minutes, that's all right.

487
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,180
 (laughing)

488
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,140
 - So they check their breathing ability before and after

489
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,100
 and just before they, because of the stress

490
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,380
 of going on the roller coaster, it got a bit worse

491
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,940
 but then afterwards, somehow the pleasurable stress

492
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,900
 seems to have kind of relieved the symptoms

493
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,660
 of asthma quite a lot.

494
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,500
 - Really?

495
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,340
 - It's quite good.

496
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,980
 - Good tip, it's good.

497
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,260
 - Just on difficulty breathing,

498
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,340
 also mothers teach their kids to swim

499
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,740
 by doing what all of our parents did when we learned to swim

500
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,620
 which is just like forcibly ducking them underwater

501
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
 in order to make that.

502
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,380
 So baby otters are born not being able to swim

503
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,860
 and that you can watch videos of mothers training otters

504
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,580
 and they drag them from the rocks into the water

505
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,980
 and then they pull them along behind them

506
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,100
 and then they let go of them like when you're riding a bike

507
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
 for the first time and they sort of start sinking a bit

508
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,180
 and so their mother has to go up and get them

509
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,780
 and then to get them used to being underwater

510
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,460
 for long periods of time, they just like duck

511
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,740
 these baby otters underwater and hold them there.

512
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,660
 - It's very difficult experiences growing up.

513
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,980
 (laughing)

514
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,780
 - My dad was an otter.

515
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,060
 (laughing)

516
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,380
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

517
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,900
 and that is Chazinski.

518
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,780
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that your appendix

519
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,820
 can be turned into a sphincter, if you like.

520
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,260
 (laughing)

521
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
 - No one's forcing you.

522
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,940
 - I think you're gonna have to explain.

523
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,540
 - Yeah, so I just think this is incredibly cool.

524
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,180
 What I guess what medicine and surgery can do.

525
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,860
 So appendix can be really useful now.

526
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,220
 It can be repurposed for other reasons inside your body.

527
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,980
 So for instance, if you need bladder replacement surgery

528
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,860
 then the surgeon's going and they take a part of your intestine

529
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,180
 to make a little bladder out of it

530
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,300
 and then they take your appendix and they reform it into tissue

531
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,820
 that builds a sphincter muscle that can contract

532
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,780
 and means that you're not gonna be incontinent.

533
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,620
 Which I think is incredible.

534
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,380
 You take your appendix that's sitting there

535
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,980
 relatively uselessly, controversial claim.

536
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,820
 (laughing)

537
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,140
 And you turn it into something really useful

538
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,940
 that stops you wetting yourself all the time.

539
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,780
 - I think that's amazing.

540
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,940
 And it happens a lot in surgery.

541
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,580
 You can use appendices for various things.

542
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,980
 You can turn them into other things.

543
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,660
 You can also turn them into the ureta.

544
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,860
 If you've got a problem with your ureta

545
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,700
 you can replace that by reshaping an appendix.

546
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,980
 - If you are hosting a child's birthday party

547
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,340
 but you've run out of balloons.

548
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,700
 (laughing)

549
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,260
 And appendix will make a poor,

550
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,380
 but exams are the subject.

551
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
 (laughing)

552
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,740
 - We should say that because the Aztecs

553
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,300
 used the bowels of animals to make balloons.

554
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,580
 Or they blew into them.

555
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,460
 I mean, and then they kind of tied them

556
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,780
 and I don't think they did shapes out of them.

557
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,100
 (laughing)

558
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
 But that is true actually.

559
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,660
 I think that is true.

560
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,580
 And I read in one place that apparently

561
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,980
 when they ran out of kind of caps or dogs,

562
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,060
 what did they use?

563
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,020
 They use humans because they had loads of human sacrifices

564
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,940
 and loads of dead humans

565
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,140
 and they would use the insides of humans to make balloons.

566
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,980
 I have read that.

567
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
 - Happy birthday son.

568
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,420
 - And here's your grandparents, organs.

569
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
 (laughing)

570
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,260
 - God.

571
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,740
 (laughing)

572
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,900
 So you, Dan, have millions of sphincters.

573
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,060
 (laughing)

574
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,900
 And so does everybody else.

575
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,140
 - Millions are strong.

576
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,460
 You have such a point out of the sphincter

577
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,980
 I'm talking about is not the sphincter

578
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,220
 that you're imagining.

579
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,060
 - Of course.

580
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,420
 - Because we do have a lot of sphincters.

581
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,460
 - Yeah, so we've all got an A-list sphincter as it were.

582
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,420
 But there are millions of them throughout your body.

583
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,620
 So you have sphincters all the way

584
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,660
 through your digestive system.

585
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,020
 So sphincter is just a ring of muscle

586
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,820
 which can expand or contract to allow anything through it.

587
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,260
 So you also have them in your blood vessels.

588
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,620
 All your veins and capillaries have tiny, tiny, tiny sphincters

589
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,460
 which widen or constrict depending

590
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,820
 on where needs blood in the body.

591
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,220
 - Is it millions?

592
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,500
 I thought it was like 60.

593
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,980
 - Well, I looked into it a lot and I haven't got enough.

594
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,660
 - They've counted a load of ones.

595
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,900
 So they've counted the one that goes

596
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,660
 from your esophagus to the stomach

597
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,500
 or from the stomach to the small intestine.

598
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,620
 But they haven't counted the ones in the blood vessels.

599
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,500
 - Some of them are so tiny.

600
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,060
 So I'm not sure that there can be a proper audit.

601
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
 - Wow.

602
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,900
 - Yeah.

603
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,700
 - But you've done your best.

604
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,860
 - Yeah.

605
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,700
 - So why say a million?

606
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,900
 Maybe it's thousands, I don't know.

607
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,060
 - So the word sphincter comes from an old word sphinctine

608
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,460
 which means to squeeze.

609
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,420
 And another word that comes from that is sphincts

610
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,500
 as in the big animal in Egypt.

611
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,940
 Yeah, that's a country.

612
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,940
 So the official plural of the word sphincts is sphinjis.

613
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,780
 - Yeah.

614
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,460
 - So that's one for you all to use.

615
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,420
 (laughing)

616
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,060
 - Sphincters are a blue horse.

617
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,540
 Whales, blue horse, sphincters.

618
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,380
 - Yeah.

619
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
 - Any kind of muscle that kind of contracts.

620
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
 - An elephant's trunks.

621
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,220
 - Your eyes.

622
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,060
 - Your eyes.

623
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,220
 - In your pupils, the muscles which allow your pupils

624
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,580
 to expand or contract their sphincters.

625
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,660
 - And you have two in your reiners.

626
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,500
 - Three.

627
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
 - You have an internal one,

628
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,220
 which is involuntary and an external one,

629
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,820
 which is voluntary.

630
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,660
 - In most cases.

631
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,820
 (laughing)

632
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,780
 - Also, koalas.

633
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,660
 Koala pouches are like kangaroo pouches,

634
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,340
 but they're upside down, which feels like a design flaw.

635
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,700
 So when they're raising their young,

636
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,460
 they're in this upside down pouch,

637
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,740
 which if they didn't have the sphincter,

638
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,620
 which acts kind of like an elastic band

639
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,900
 or like a drawstring to keep the baby in there,

640
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
 the baby would just drop out of their pouch.

641
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,340
 So they clench their sphincter,

642
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,860
 and then the baby stays in there.

643
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,140
 - So the appendix, should we talk about that?

644
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,980
 - Yeah, why not?

645
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,820
 - Yeah.

646
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,300
 - So lots of theories.

647
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,900
 We didn't know about it until 1522,

648
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,780
 because in the ancient world,

649
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,140
 the doctor Galen, who was just the doctor,

650
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,900
 and his stuff was the only really anatomical stuff

651
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,660
 we knew about until the 16th century,

652
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,500
 he only dissected monkeys,

653
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,340
 and monkeys don't have an appendix or appendices.

654
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
 - Do they not?

655
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
 - Yeah, so that's why we didn't know it existed.

656
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,780
 - Yeah, although what happened when it burst,

657
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,860
 presumably people would have got appendicitis.

658
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,020
 - Yeah, people got it, but I--

659
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,900
 - But they just didn't know when it was.

660
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,260
 - No, exactly, 'cause the dissection was really,

661
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,180
 a big no-no, as long as you went an elastic, I suppose.

662
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,140
 - There's a thing I read today about

663
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,700
 when Australian explorers go to the Arctic,

664
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,860
 they have to have their appendix taken out,

665
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,940
 so it turns out that that's not necessarily true,

666
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,020
 they do encourage it,

667
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,580
 but there is Werner Herzog made a documentary

668
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,220
 about the people who live out there,

669
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,940
 and the ones who choose to stay out

670
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,060
 when it goes into the real inaccessible months,

671
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,700
 and they have to make the decision

672
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,860
 if they're gonna stay out there.

673
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,460
 The appendix needs to be taken out,

674
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,740
 as do wisdom teeth.

675
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,700
 That's the thing that doesn't have any way

676
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
 that they can stay out there.

677
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,940
 - I wasn't there who had appendicitis

678
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,980
 when he was in the Antarctic.

679
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,180
 - I think Lear Nidroghazov, I was gonna say, he was Russian, yeah.

680
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,140
 - Yeah, so there was this 1961,

681
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,660
 and it was a Russian trip to the South Pole,

682
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,980
 and this guy, Lear Nidroghazov,

683
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,780
 got appendicitis, he happened to be a surgeon,

684
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,540
 which was useful, and he said,

685
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,780
 "Look, I think I'm gonna have to take out my own appendix."

686
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,780
 And he wrote, "Well, I find incredible as he's in total agony,

687
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,940
 and the night before he did the operation,

688
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,540
 he was writing his diary, and he wrote,

689
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
 "It hurts like the devil,

690
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,380
 I have to think through the only possible way out

691
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,780
 "to operate on myself."

692
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,580
 Anyway, he took his appendix out,

693
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,540
 and he had three assistants, one to hold the lamp,

694
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,900
 one to hold the mirror,

695
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
 so that he could see inside himself,

696
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,700
 and then a third person in case one of those two fainted.

697
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,540
 - What?

698
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,100
 (laughing)

699
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,140
 - I want to be that guy.

700
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,540
 (laughing)

701
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,980
 - He said so, he, so the mirror wasn't actually

702
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
 that helpful, it turned out,

703
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,180
 so he ended up doing it by feeling around.

704
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,020
 - Oh, that's right.

705
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,340
 - Because it was all back to front, wasn't he?

706
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,500
 He had the mirror there, but he kept going one way,

707
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,580
 but like shaving the wrong side of your face or something.

708
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,340
 - Yeah, which I think was harder than he imagined,

709
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,900
 so he thought it was probably easy if I just feel,

710
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,500
 and then he ended up tearing a bit of his gut at one point,

711
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,740
 and he had to sow that art mid-operation.

712
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,980
 And what he said afterwards, when he was talking,

713
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,060
 when he was interviewed about, he said,

714
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,140
 "I felt so sorry for my surgical assistants,

715
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,820
 "they stood there in their surgical whites,

716
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,620
 "whiter than the white themselves."

717
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,460
 (laughing)

718
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
 Paul there.

719
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,460
 (laughing)

720
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,620
 - The task doorstep challenge was actually,

721
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,900
 (laughing)

722
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,140
 I found it that way.

723
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
 (laughing)

724
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,980
 Paul, do you know what, so this is sort of this fact,

725
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,020
 was sort of about repurposing body parts

726
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,860
 for different things.

727
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,340
 And if you have a tummy tuck, they use the fat

728
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,660
 for breast implants, so they read the--

729
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,900
 - But even if you don't ask for it, I'm full.

730
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,380
 (laughing)

731
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,620
 - Wait, not what not.

732
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,740
 (laughing)

733
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,300
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show,

734
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,100
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

735
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,100
 - My fact is that the founder of Croft's

736
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,420
 designed special train carriages for celebrity dogs.

737
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,180
 (laughing)

738
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,940
 So in the 19th century, Croft's was founded in the,

739
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,860
 I think, 1891.

740
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,220
 But there were loads of dog shows, before Croft's,

741
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,820
 and before these train carriages were invented,

742
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,660
 what they would just do, they would put the dogs

743
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,340
 that were going to the dog show in special boxes,

744
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,980
 which were then strapped to the underside of the carriage.

745
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,980
 - Yeah.

746
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,740
 - So they would arrive, not in good nick,

747
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,180
 not really ready for a dog show.

748
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,700
 (laughing)

749
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,900
 So he designed these special deluxe train carriages

750
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,260
 for dogs, and they had a row of canals inside,

751
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,620
 and they had zinc flooring, and they had water troughs,

752
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,260
 and they had drainage, and they had two seats for attendance.

753
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,820
 So it's like tapping crew.

754
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,500
 - It's zinc flooring the height of luxury.

755
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,940
 - I dream, I don't know, maybe for dogs,

756
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,900
 or maybe he's seen as cleaner or maybe it was that.

757
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,700
 - The guy from Croft's, Charles Croft,

758
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,620
 he was actually, was he kind of a showman,

759
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,580
 or a dog biscuit manufacturer?

760
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,380
 - He was a dog biscuit manufacturer.

761
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,100
 In London, there was a very famous building,

762
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,060
 I think it was the first ever dog biscuit factory ever,

763
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,500
 and it was called Sprats, and that's where Charles Croft worked.

764
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,380
 He started there, and he was working on the biscuits,

765
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,340
 and he was so good, he had ideas about marketing,

766
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,660
 and he turned it into the first sort of major brand of biscuits.

767
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,980
 They put logos on it, and so on, so people knew about it.

768
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,820
 - Yeah, thanks.

769
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,420
 - There's a rumor that Charles Croft never owned a dog

770
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,420
 in his life.

771
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,260
 - Yeah, I've read it.

772
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,980
 - And he sort of put it about during his life

773
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,860
 that he never owned a dog, and his wife's, yeah,

774
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,540
 because we couldn't show favoritism for one breed or another,

775
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,180
 and then in his posthumous memoirs,

776
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,660
 it turned out that he had a sunburner.

777
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,380
 - Yeah, he had a massive sunburner, didn't he?

778
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,700
 - Yeah, that sounds very rude.

779
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,020
 (audience laughing)

780
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,900
 - Quite hard to hide that, the dog.

781
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,260
 (audience laughing)

782
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,380
 I'm surprised he kept his secrets in love.

783
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
 - They're true, yeah.

784
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,580
 - So Croft was a genius at making money, basically.

785
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,620
 I'm putting on these big shows,

786
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,820
 I'm putting on even bigger shows,

787
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,980
 and just really exploiting his audience in his market.

788
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,340
 So I read that this was what he did

789
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,580
 in the early days of Croft, so I'm quoting here.

790
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,060
 He introduced a system where competitors would pay

791
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,860
 to enter their dogs, and make additional payments

792
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,820
 if they wish to take the dogs away

793
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,780
 each night of the competition,

794
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,660
 and then pay again if they wanted to take them away early

795
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,860
 on the final day.

796
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,700
 - Wow.

797
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,060
 - So basically, it's not free to enter or leave.

798
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,420
 (audience laughing)

799
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,780
 - Coated, many people run out of money

800
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,380
 and just have to leave their dog there forever.

801
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,060
 Is there a huge lost property office of dead dogs

802
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,660
 that are 75 years old?

803
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,380
 (audience laughing)

804
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,380
 - I just think that's an inspired system, yeah, that's it.

805
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,300
 It also applies here tonight, guys, so.

806
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,540
 (audience laughing)

807
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,020
 Croft also found, Charles Croft, the guy who founded it,

808
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,740
 also founded a cat show, did you know that?

809
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,580
 - It did.

810
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,180
 - But, quoting from, I think there's Oxford Dictionary

811
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,140
 of National Bography Entry,

812
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,380
 it failed to live up to commercial expectations.

813
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,220
 - Yeah.

814
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,740
 - It doesn't feel like cats would like to be shown.

815
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,460
 - Oh, I read a thing about cat shows,

816
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,460
 and there was a lady who was giving advice for this,

817
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,860
 there is a cat show called the Supreme Cat Show,

818
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,140
 which is such a good name,

819
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,980
 and she enters cats for it all the time,

820
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,740
 and she said, "The main grooming things

821
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,940
 "are brushing the coat through with a comb,

822
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,500
 "making sure the underarms and the bikini area

823
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,820
 "are combed through with a comb."

824
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,660
 (audience laughing)

825
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,500
 - Whoa.

826
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 - Oh my God.

827
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 (audience laughing)

828
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,940
 - And washing the cat's face.

829
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,940
 (audience laughing)

830
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,300
 - It's pretty weird, yeah.

831
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,460
 - Wow.

832
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,940
 - So, the prize isn't croft.

833
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,100
 It's really small as well.

834
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,260
 Do you know the maximum prize?

835
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,780
 Cash prize that you get?

836
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,620
 - Oh no.

837
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,940
 - It's 100 pounds, so it's really, it's a token thing.

838
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,780
 - Yeah, right.

839
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,620
 - You also get a big silver cup,

840
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,860
 but you're not allowed to melt it or anything.

841
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,500
 - And a lot of royalty have won.

842
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,340
 - So there are?

843
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
 - Have a lot of royalties.

844
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,660
 - Do they come in disguise?

845
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,500
 (audience laughing)

846
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,940
 - Quick, quick, Victoria entered as a shitsoo.

847
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,100
 (audience laughing)

848
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
 - What many years running?

849
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,980
 'Cause everyone was too afraid to say that's the queen.

850
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,620
 (audience laughing)

851
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,460
 - Yeah, and so you can make money from endorsements

852
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,980
 and from, you know, pimping the dog out for stud.

853
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,100
 Whatever, I don't know what it's called,

854
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,700
 but they have sex with other dogs

855
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,220
 and then you get better dogs.

856
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,300
 But, do you know what the prize was?

857
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,980
 It was in the first modern dog show,

858
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,500
 which was in 1859 in Newcastle.

859
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,340
 - No.

860
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,900
 - The prizes were all guns.

861
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,180
 (audience laughing)

862
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,620
 It was a really rural farming based competition.

863
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,220
 It was a cattle show and they said,

864
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,300
 "Why don't we add a dog element to this cattle show

865
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,140
 "and so the prize at the thrall guns?"

866
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,660
 - Do you know if you get a train in the UK

867
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,900
 that you don't have to pay for your first two dogs

868
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,420
 to come on for your third one you do?

869
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,580
 Yeah, so you get two dogs free and then your third one,

870
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,420
 you gotta start paying.

871
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,260
 - Really?

872
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,660
 - Yeah, and every additional dog you bring up, yeah.

873
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,500
 - But I read also that if any other customer objects

874
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,740
 to its presence on the train,

875
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,140
 you are obliged to move it to another area

876
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,420
 according to by law 16 of the...

877
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,220
 - Oh yeah, try saying that when the pitbull's good at stealing it.

878
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
 (audience laughing)

879
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
 I object to this according to by law 16.

880
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,140
 (audience laughing)

881
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,580
 - I just have a cool train if you want to hear it.

882
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,780
 - I have a cool train.

883
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
 (audience laughing)

884
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
 What are you, sex?

885
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,820
 (audience laughing)

886
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,220
 - So, the Shining Zeppelin in 1931 was a German train

887
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,180
 and they wanted to make a super fast train.

888
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,300
 And what they wanted to do was put a huge propeller

889
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,180
 on the back of the train and they would go super, super fast

890
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,020
 down the tracks.

891
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,660
 It's a brilliant idea, but it never went past the prototype stage

892
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,220
 because they found out that the propellers would kill people

893
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,980
 who stood too close to the tracks

894
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,140
 at the train stations.

895
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,980
 Oh my God.

896
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,620
 (audience laughing)

897
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,220
 I've read there's a new idea of most complaints

898
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,780
 that come about the way that trains function.

899
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,460
 One complaint is the fact that too much time is lost

900
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,460
 when they're trying to stop when they stop at a station

901
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,740
 and people are getting on and off.

902
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,500
 The other one is about internet access.

903
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,940
 So, one of the plans for a new train that they've been designing

904
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,700
 is to design a train that never stops

905
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,540
 but still picks up passengers.

906
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,380
 - Oh yeah.

907
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,220
 - Yeah, it's incredible.

908
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,900
 So, it just goes high speed, it's just high speeding along.

909
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,620
 And then what they do is everyone boards another train

910
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,860
 and the other train chases the train that's going to the place,

911
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,180
 docs onto it, everyone casually walks over, docs off it

912
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,260
 and goes back to the station.

913
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,380
 That's one proposed idea for a new train.

914
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,220
 - Yeah.

915
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,780
 - That sounds about as sensible as James's massive slicey fan.

916
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,220
 (audience laughing)

917
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,780
 - Okay, that's it.

918
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,140
 That is all of our facts.

00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,180
