00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast."
00:00:18,00:00:20,This week coming to you live from Leeds.
00:00:20,00:00:22,My name is Dan Troiber and please welcome to the stage.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"It's Aniches Innski, James Harkin and Andy Murray."
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:32,(audience cheering)
00:00:32,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:36,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:38,00:00:41,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:41,00:00:44,Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.
00:00:44,00:00:47,My fact this week is that Chikovsky used to hold his head
00:00:47,00:00:50,when conducting because he was afraid it would fall off.
00:00:50,00:00:51,(audience laughing)
00:00:51,00:00:54,So this is apparently he used to get so nervous
00:00:54,00:00:56,when he was going on stage and there was so much going
00:00:56,00:00:58,"on in his head that he genuinely thought,"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"""No, this is definitely gonna fly off halfway through the game."""
00:01:01,00:01:03,So he would sit there or stand there rather
00:01:03,00:01:04,and have his hand just resting.
00:01:04,00:01:06,"- Yeah, I thought that it wasn't true"
00:01:06,00:01:08,and I went on the internet and a few people said
00:01:08,00:01:09,that they thought it wasn't true
00:01:09,00:01:12,but then I found one of his best friends actually said
00:01:12,00:01:13,that he did do this so.
00:01:13,00:01:16,"- Although, less you'd trust Dan too far"
00:01:16,00:01:17,when you first told this to me last week
00:01:17,00:01:19,and he told me where you'd read it.
00:01:19,00:01:20,"It wasn't a book of fiction, wasn't it?"
00:01:20,00:01:23,(audience laughing)
00:01:23,00:01:25,"- It was in a movie called ""Still Crazy"""
00:01:25,00:01:27,which stars Bill Nighy and Billy Conley
00:01:27,00:01:28,and he said that.
00:01:28,00:01:31,"But yeah, so it turns out a lot of people do say"
00:01:31,00:01:32,that it might not be true
00:01:32,00:01:34,and they only say it because Tchaikovsky is one of those guys
00:01:34,00:01:37,where people love to build myths around him
00:01:37,00:01:38,for some reason and create stories about him
00:01:38,00:01:41,"and that was one possibly, but as James says,"
00:01:41,00:01:42,we found a source.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"- Well, he was a massive star, wasn't he?"
00:01:44,00:01:46,He was one of those classical musicians in the 19th century
00:01:46,00:01:48,that was the equivalent of what's the famous band?
00:01:48,00:01:51,- Just in Beaver of his day.
00:01:51,00:01:52,- The Justin Beaver of his day.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"Yeah, when he went to America to perform,"
00:01:54,00:01:55,"a few performances in New York,"
00:01:55,00:01:58,people used to cut out the pictures of his face
00:01:58,00:01:59,and newspapers and send them to him
00:01:59,00:02:01,"and say, ""Please sign this."""
00:02:01,00:02:03,"And which is really creepy, but whatever."
00:02:03,00:02:06,- Got a guy who thinks his head's gonna fall off as well together.
00:02:06,00:02:09,(audience laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:12,"- Yeah, you're right, that was harsh, it was harsh."
00:02:12,00:02:13,"He was a troubled person,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,but I think the clues were there.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"So when he was first going to America,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,he was writing this diary of a questions
00:02:19,00:02:20,he had to ask when he got there
00:02:20,00:02:23,to make sure that he didn't screw up or die.
00:02:23,00:02:25,And there were three questions
00:02:25,00:02:28,"and it was, is it safe to drink the water for a question?"
00:02:28,00:02:30,Where can I do my laundry for a question?
00:02:30,00:02:32,What sort of hats do people wear?
00:02:32,00:02:34,(audience laughing)
00:02:34,00:02:37,"- Wow, but that's interesting because his death"
00:02:37,00:02:39,"is to do with a glass of water, isn't it?"
00:02:39,00:02:40,"- Yeah, really, yeah."
00:02:40,00:02:42,"He's supposedly died of cholera, didn't he?"
00:02:42,00:02:43,- Yeah.
00:02:43,00:02:44,"- That's what they think, hold on,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,maybe he committed suicide?
00:02:46,00:02:47,"- Yeah, they're not sure."
00:02:47,00:02:49,"- Or it might be that he, so I think,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,'cause he was really paranoid about drinking
00:02:51,00:02:53,about clean water as evidence by his to-do list
00:02:53,00:02:54,"when he got to America,"
00:02:54,00:02:56,really paranoid about clean as the water's whole life.
00:02:56,00:02:58,And then he suddenly drunk a glass of tap water
00:02:58,00:03:00,in the middle of a cholera outbreak.
00:03:00,00:03:02,So people think maybe he did that on purpose.
00:03:02,00:03:03,- There was one of the time when he supposedly tried
00:03:03,00:03:07,to commit suicide by walking into the Moscow River
00:03:07,00:03:09,and trying to catch pneumonia that way.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"- Yeah, sure, isn't it?"
00:03:11,00:03:14,"- Evelyn wore, tried to kill himself by swimming out to sea,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,but then he got stung by a jellyfish.
00:03:16,00:03:17,(audience laughing)
00:03:17,00:03:19,"He didn't like that, one bit."
00:03:19,00:03:20,(audience laughing)
00:03:20,00:03:23,"So I think he thought, ""Dying's probably even worse than this."""
00:03:23,00:03:25,(audience laughing)
00:03:25,00:03:27,So he swam back.
00:03:27,00:03:28,That was before he wrote anything as well.
00:03:28,00:03:31,He wouldn't have any even more of that.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"I started reading something about Tchaikovsky,"
00:03:32,00:03:35,which is that he always had this kind of slightly
00:03:35,00:03:37,"uneasy relationship with the sound of the violin,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"because as a child, he had had this nightmare"
00:03:39,00:03:41,"that he was being rubbed against a block of,"
00:03:41,00:03:43,"you know, Rosen, the stuff at the--"
00:03:43,00:03:44,"- Oh, really?"
00:03:44,00:03:45,"- Yeah, and then I realized this was a humor piece"
00:03:45,00:03:46,from The New Yorker.
00:03:46,00:03:48,(audience laughing)
00:03:48,00:03:49,This was not true.
00:03:49,00:03:51,- All the other stuff at Tchaikovsky is so crazy
00:03:51,00:03:52,that you would think--
00:03:52,00:03:54,"- It just kind of sound like it could be true, doesn't it?"
00:03:54,00:03:55,- It did.
00:03:55,00:03:58,- He once went to Berlin Zoo and saw a Boer Constructor
00:03:58,00:04:00,being fed a large rat.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- A Boer Constructor?
00:04:01,00:04:02,- A Boer Constructor.
00:04:02,00:04:04,(audience laughing)
00:04:04,00:04:06,(audience laughing)
00:04:06,00:04:07,Those Boers don't make themselves.
00:04:07,00:04:10,(audience laughing)
00:04:10,00:04:12,A Boer Constructor.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Yes, a Boer Constrictor being fed a large rat,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"and he screamed, run away, started shaking all over,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"and he had to be in bed for a week, because--"
00:04:20,00:04:21,- Yeah.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- But that's it.
00:04:22,00:04:24,(audience laughing)
00:04:24,00:04:26,"- So, this thing about his head falling off"
00:04:26,00:04:29,"is kind of an example of what they call glass delusion, isn't it?"
00:04:29,00:04:30,- Yeah.
00:04:30,00:04:32,- It is a really popular delusion for about 300 years.
00:04:32,00:04:34,Glass had become like this massive material
00:04:34,00:04:35,that everyone was using.
00:04:35,00:04:39,And it was almost a standard mental issue of the day
00:04:39,00:04:41,"that people had, that they thought they were made of glass"
00:04:41,00:04:44,and they were gonna shatter if they fell over or whatever.
00:04:44,00:04:47,And then it got replaced by cement delusion a bit later.
00:04:47,00:04:48,- Really?
00:04:48,00:04:50,"- Yeah, it did, cement delusion was a real thing."
00:04:50,00:04:51,- But when was cement invented?
00:04:51,00:04:55,"- Well, the Romans made cement, they made a kind of cement"
00:04:55,00:04:57,"that we don't really know exactly what it was anymore,"
00:04:57,00:05:00,but the real kind of proper time that cement was really
00:05:00,00:05:01,"popular was the 19th century,"
00:05:01,00:05:03,and that's when cement delusion came in.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"And actually, it always seems to be that people get deluded"
00:05:06,00:05:09,by whatever is the main kind of technology of the day.
00:05:09,00:05:11,So people think that the internet's out to get them
00:05:11,00:05:12,or whatever.
00:05:12,00:05:15,And there's one that last year was the first ever known case
00:05:15,00:05:17,of climate change delusion.
00:05:17,00:05:19,- And it was where a guy wouldn't drink any water
00:05:19,00:05:22,because he felt guilty about taking it from the earth.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"- Oh, oh, yeah."
00:05:24,00:05:26,"- Well, maybe if we all had that actually,"
00:05:26,00:05:27,we would be in the pickle room.
00:05:27,00:05:32,King Charles VI of France.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"- Charles the mad, wasn't he?"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"- Well, he was known either as Charles the mad"
00:05:36,00:05:37,"or Charles the well-beloved,"
00:05:37,00:05:42,which suggests the PR people found out about the first thing.
00:05:42,00:05:45,But he thought he was made of glass
00:05:45,00:05:48,and he would keep pieces of iron in his pockets
00:05:48,00:05:50,because he thought that would protect him
00:05:50,00:05:51,if anything bumped into him
00:05:51,00:05:53,or if he accidentally bumped into a doorway
00:05:53,00:05:54,when he was going through it.
00:05:54,00:05:55,So he would be defended against it.
00:05:55,00:05:56,- Yeah.
00:05:56,00:05:58,- So I think it was real.
00:05:58,00:06:01,- There is a thing where your limbs can randomly fall off though.
00:06:01,00:06:02,- What?
00:06:02,00:06:04,(audience laughs)
00:06:04,00:06:05,- What?
00:06:05,00:06:07,"- It's auto-amputation, which is when a limb decides"
00:06:07,00:06:08,to amputate itself.
00:06:08,00:06:09,And the most--
00:06:09,00:06:12,- When a limb decides to amputate itself.
00:06:12,00:06:14,- That's a very dense sentence.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- So it sounds weird coming from Adam.
00:06:15,00:06:16,(audience laughs)
00:06:16,00:06:18,- The most common form makes us unless to amputate.
00:06:18,00:06:20,"The most common form is dactylosis spontaneous,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,which is when your toes spontaneously fall off.
00:06:22,00:06:24,"And they don't know why this happens,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,but it's like a ring of tough tissue forms
00:06:26,00:06:28,around the base of your little toe.
00:06:28,00:06:29,"And weirdly when it happens,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,it usually happens on both little toes at once
00:06:31,00:06:34,and it starts squeezing and squeezing our little toe.
00:06:34,00:06:35,And eventually your little toe falls off
00:06:35,00:06:36,and they don't know the cause of it.
00:06:36,00:06:39,And so eventually it's hanging by something called a pedical
00:06:39,00:06:41,and then it just drops off.
00:06:41,00:06:42,And we don't know why it happens.
00:06:42,00:06:43,"It's more common in the tropics,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,but that's the only clue we have.
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Oh my god.
00:06:46,00:06:48,- So anyone else have that thing where you read about a disease
00:06:48,00:06:50,and then you automatically get it?
00:06:50,00:06:52,(audience laughs)
00:06:52,00:06:54,I am so sure my little toes are gonna fall off.
00:06:54,00:06:56,(audience laughs)
00:06:56,00:06:59,- I found another thing about sort of worry and fear.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"So the Pintupi people of Australia,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,"who are an Aboriginal people in Australia,"
00:07:04,00:07:07,supposedly they have 15 different words for fear
00:07:07,00:07:08,and this drops up a lot.
00:07:08,00:07:10,And they're all specific kinds of fears.
00:07:10,00:07:12,"So I'm gonna pronounce this, don't write in,"
00:07:12,00:07:16,but Ni-Ni-Wara-Ringu.
00:07:16,00:07:18,(audience laughs)
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Even I'm right again.
00:07:19,00:07:20,(audience laughs)
00:07:20,00:07:21,- Do you try saying it?
00:07:21,00:07:25,Ni-Ni-Wara-Ringu I think is a sudden fear
00:07:25,00:07:27,that leads one to stand up to see what caused it.
00:07:27,00:07:28,(audience laughs)
00:07:28,00:07:29,What?
00:07:29,00:07:31,(audience laughs)
00:07:31,00:07:31,- It's cool.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:07:32,00:07:33,- Yeah.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- Is that over?
00:07:34,00:07:35,- I feel like I'm at it.
00:07:35,00:07:36,- I'm sorry.
00:07:36,00:07:38,- I'm gonna read the other kind of 45 out of it though.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"- No, that's the only one I've found."
00:07:39,00:07:40,- I can't read proof of it.
00:07:40,00:07:42,- That's the only one that I can print out though.
00:07:42,00:07:44,(audience laughs)
00:07:44,00:07:46,We should move on to our next fact soon.
00:07:46,00:07:48,Anyone got anything before we do?
00:07:48,00:07:49,- I've one last thing.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"- Yeah, yeah, sure."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"- Which is, it's not really related."
00:07:51,00:07:52,"It's about classical music,"
00:07:52,00:07:55,"but I found it through looking for things about Chakowsky,"
00:07:55,00:07:58,which is that shock waves from the front of trombones
00:07:58,00:08:00,move faster than the speed of sound.
00:08:00,00:08:01,- Whoa.
00:08:01,00:08:02,- Really?
00:08:02,00:08:03,- I'm gonna miss it.
00:08:03,00:08:04,- I'm gonna miss it.
00:08:04,00:08:05,- Bullshit.
00:08:05,00:08:06,(audience laughs)
00:08:06,00:08:09,"- Well, I refer you to bbc.co.uk."
00:08:09,00:08:11,(audience laughs)
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- They've measured, they've measured that,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"okay, it sort of builds up in the tube of the trombone."
00:08:14,00:08:16,And it leaves the front of the trombone
00:08:16,00:08:18,at about 1% faster than the speed of sound.
00:08:18,00:08:19,These pressure waves.
00:08:19,00:08:21,"And so if you're sitting in front of the trombones,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"if you're in an orchestra, it can be a nightmare."
00:08:23,00:08:25,And sometimes people have a projector screen.
00:08:25,00:08:26,- I look at anyone's that close to a trombone
00:08:26,00:08:29,or you know that's gonna be a worry at a gig.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- If you're in an orchestra.
00:08:30,00:08:33,"- Oh, sorry, the person sitting in front of the trombone."
00:08:33,00:08:34,"- I thought you made the audience say,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,"""Oh, these are great seats."""
00:08:35,00:08:38,(audience laughs)
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- Wait, so people were in the orchestra"
00:08:41,00:08:42,were protective clothes to someone
00:08:42,00:08:44,so they were getting battered by the shockwaves?
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:45,- Some musicians who are sitting directly
00:08:45,00:08:47,in front of the trombonists
00:08:47,00:08:49,have protective screens between them and the trombonists.
00:08:49,00:08:52,- Now I feel so passive-aggressive that motion.
00:08:52,00:08:54,"If I were the trombonist and I sat down,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,I realize someone's got a big screen up in front of me.
00:08:57,00:08:58,(audience laughs)
00:08:58,00:08:59,"- All right, let's move on."
00:08:59,00:09:02,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:09:02,00:09:03,And that is James Tarkin.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"- Okay, my fact this week is that asthmatic otters"
00:09:07,00:09:09,can be taught to use inhalers.
00:09:09,00:09:13,(audience laughs)
00:09:13,00:09:17,So there is asthmatic otter in Seattle Aquarium.
00:09:17,00:09:19,He seemed to have contracted asthma
00:09:19,00:09:22,after the wild fires got near to him
00:09:22,00:09:23,when he had bad fires in Washington State.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"He was called Mishka, this otter."
00:09:26,00:09:29,And they used food to train Mishka
00:09:29,00:09:31,to kind of go up to this little inhaler thing
00:09:31,00:09:33,and he would press it with his nose
00:09:33,00:09:35,and then get a little bit of asthma medicine.
00:09:35,00:09:37,- Ah.
00:09:37,00:09:39,- It is the most adorable fact of all times.
00:09:39,00:09:41,- This is really his.
00:09:41,00:09:44,- I quite like the whole thing of offering food
00:09:44,00:09:46,to get them to heal themselves through a bit of medication.
00:09:46,00:09:49,"There is another otter that I read about called Eddie,"
00:09:49,00:09:50,Eddie the otter.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"And Eddie had problems with his,"
00:09:53,00:09:56,he basically was developing arthritis in his elbows.
00:09:56,00:09:59,And so they needed to get him to sort of exercise
00:09:59,00:10:01,or the joints constantly.
00:10:01,00:10:03,And so what they did was they set up a basketball ring
00:10:03,00:10:08,and they rewarded him in fish every time he got a shot in.
00:10:08,00:10:10,So they'd give him a basketball
00:10:10,00:10:12,"and I swear to God, this is what this says."
00:10:12,00:10:16,Eddie was slam dunking into the ring.
00:10:16,00:10:18,He was loving it.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- He's now got a contract, doesn't he, with the NBA?"
00:10:20,00:10:24,"- Yeah, speaking of otters that could be six foot tall."
00:10:24,00:10:25,- I know.
00:10:25,00:10:29,"- They're a giant otters in Brazil, in the Amazon."
00:10:29,00:10:31,They're otters that are up to six feet long
00:10:31,00:10:32,and they're called giant otters.
00:10:32,00:10:35,"So they're only 5,000 left and in captivity,"
00:10:35,00:10:37,"they have killed people, people who fall into their cages."
00:10:37,00:10:39,- They're killed by an otter.
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- Yeah, but a huge otter."
00:10:40,00:10:42,They're really powerful looking things.
00:10:42,00:10:45,"- They're also really, they can be really vicious though,"
00:10:45,00:10:46,"although they're, so they can attack."
00:10:46,00:10:49,"- Outside of killing people, they can also."
00:10:49,00:10:51,- That is the tip of the iceberg.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"No, the otter and family, the were,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,they're part of the Weasel family.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"And I was watching it David, after my clip the other day,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,there was a Weasel that was about three inches long
00:10:59,00:11:01,"and it killed, now it doesn't sound that impressive,"
00:11:01,00:11:02,it was a rabbit.
00:11:02,00:11:03,It was 10 times its size.
00:11:03,00:11:04,"It was the biggest rabbit I've ever seen,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,10 times the size of it.
00:11:06,00:11:09,And they wrap themselves around the necks of their prey
00:11:09,00:11:10,and then they just squeeze them
00:11:10,00:11:11,and then they bite them in the back of the neck
00:11:11,00:11:13,and they're done and they can take prey 10 times the size of them.
00:11:13,00:11:16,"- Wow. - Yeah, so they're not so cute."
00:11:16,00:11:18,- So I read a book called Otter by Daniel Allen
00:11:18,00:11:21,"and if you want otter facts, it is such a good book."
00:11:21,00:11:26,So otters used to be sacred to the Zoroastrian people
00:11:26,00:11:29,"who lived in Persia, so multiply a run."
00:11:29,00:11:32,There were 18 possible penalties for killing an otter
00:11:32,00:11:34,"in ancient Persia with the Zoroastrians,"
00:11:34,00:11:38,"which included you would have to then go and kill 10,000 frogs,"
00:11:38,00:11:39,(laughing)
00:11:39,00:11:43,"10,000 snakes, 10,000 worms, 10,000 corpse flies,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,"whatever they are, and whoever did it,"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"he would also have to carry 10,000 loads of cleansed wood"
00:11:48,00:11:51,"to a sacred fire and he would lose all his wealth,"
00:11:51,00:11:54,"his property, his land and he would have to give up his daughter"
00:11:54,00:11:55,to godly men.
00:11:55,00:11:57,(laughing)
00:11:57,00:11:58,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:11:58,00:12:02,- It is a Japanese folklore otter's can shape shift.
00:12:02,00:12:04,And so the stories that they kind of live in moats
00:12:04,00:12:07,"around castles and they could turn into a beautiful woman,"
00:12:07,00:12:10,invite a man over and then eat and kill him.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"- People are waking up, be caught next to a daughter."
00:12:14,00:12:17,"Oh, I swear to god, she's a beautiful woman last night."
00:12:17,00:12:18,(laughing)
00:12:18,00:12:22,- And also they can shape shift and full people
00:12:22,00:12:26,into engaging in sumo against a rock or a tree stump.
00:12:26,00:12:27,(laughing)
00:12:27,00:12:31,"When St. Cuthbert, he was a seventh century saint"
00:12:31,00:12:34,and when he walked into the sea one night to pray
00:12:34,00:12:37,and when he walked out two otters approached him
00:12:37,00:12:40,and warmed his feet ceremonially by rubbing themselves
00:12:40,00:12:42,"on him and breathing on his feet, otter."
00:12:42,00:12:43,"- They were probably just trying to dry off,"
00:12:43,00:12:44,"I imagine, and his feet happened to be there."
00:12:44,00:12:46,I'm sure he's interpreted it as an affectionate move
00:12:46,00:12:48,"but when they come out of the water,"
00:12:48,00:12:49,they have to rub themselves on a lot of stuff.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"And this must be the most annoying thing,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,"coastal otters who live in the sea,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"every time they are in the sea and then they come out of the sea,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,they have to then go and have a shower in fresh water somewhere
00:13:00,00:13:01,because if they keep the salt on their fur
00:13:01,00:13:04,"for any amount of time, then it ruins the waterproofing"
00:13:04,00:13:05,of their fur.
00:13:05,00:13:07,So they live in the sea but every time they get out of the sea
00:13:07,00:13:09,they have to find some fresh water immediately
00:13:09,00:13:10,and wash the salt out of it.
00:13:10,00:13:10,"- Oh, wow."
00:13:10,00:13:11,- How annoying is that?
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:15,Do you guys know the surface area of an otter?
00:13:15,00:13:16,(laughing)
00:13:16,00:13:18,"I mean, roughly, yeah."
00:13:18,00:13:19,- So one more with Cuthbert.
00:13:19,00:13:20,- What would you say?
00:13:20,00:13:22,- About one square meter.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- I don't know, including the hairs."
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Yeah.
00:13:25,00:13:26,- We're do the surface area.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Yeah.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"- Yeah, if you tend to go to a surface area,"
00:13:28,00:13:29,including the hairs.
00:13:29,00:13:30,- Yeah.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"- And I know that they have 70,000 hairs per centimeter squared"
00:13:33,00:13:35,so a quick bit of calculation.
00:13:35,00:13:39,"- That's right, they're about 10 tennis courts."
00:13:39,00:13:41,(laughing)
00:13:41,00:13:42,- A million carparks.
00:13:42,00:13:43,"- No, that's it."
00:13:43,00:13:44,"- No, what is it?"
00:13:44,00:13:45,- What are the size of whales?
00:13:45,00:13:47,(laughing)
00:13:47,00:13:48,- About the size of a hockey rink.
00:13:48,00:13:49,- That doesn't have.
00:13:49,00:13:50,- That's great.
00:13:50,00:13:53,- They say like the size of a shoe or something.
00:13:53,00:13:53,I don't know.
00:13:53,00:13:54,(laughing)
00:13:54,00:13:56,So they've got more hairs on them
00:13:56,00:13:58,than any animal in the animal kingdom.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"So if you have that to go total surface area,"
00:14:00,00:14:01,the size of a hockey rink.
00:14:01,00:14:02,- Which is--
00:14:02,00:14:03,- That's not amazing.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- Yeah, I read that the sea otters have the densest"
00:14:05,00:14:08,'cause they spend the whole lives basically in the sea.
00:14:08,00:14:10,They mate and they eat and they sleep and they feed.
00:14:10,00:14:12,They spend almost all the time floating on the backs
00:14:12,00:14:16,"and they have up to 165,000 hairs per square centimeter."
00:14:16,00:14:17,That's the densest you get.
00:14:17,00:14:20,But I think that's more than a human has hairs on their head.
00:14:20,00:14:23,One thing that's interesting about sea otters is they use tools.
00:14:23,00:14:26,So they can get stones and they can crack open shells
00:14:26,00:14:27,to get the food inside.
00:14:27,00:14:29,But there are people whose job it is
00:14:29,00:14:31,to be an otter archaeologist.
00:14:31,00:14:34,And they want to go and find the tools that the otters use
00:14:34,00:14:36,so they can see kind of how they've evolved.
00:14:36,00:14:40,So a normal archaeologist would go and find old human tools.
00:14:40,00:14:43,But there are people looking for old otter tools.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"That's cool, isn't it?"
00:14:44,00:14:45,- That's really cool.
00:14:45,00:14:48,- But the problem is that a stone like after they've broken
00:14:48,00:14:51,"the thing, they just kind of drop it to the bottom of the ocean"
00:14:51,00:14:53,and it just looks like a stone then.
00:14:53,00:14:57,"- Yeah, there's not like now they have spanners and seed drills"
00:14:57,00:14:58,and stuff.
00:14:58,00:15:00,And we need to look at where they started.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"We're not going, wow, to start somewhere."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"- Also, how does a single archaeologist"
00:15:05,00:15:07,able to take them away? - So what they do now
00:15:07,00:15:10,is because they can't really work out which stones are used
00:15:10,00:15:11,by otters in which hand.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"They get like, they get--"
00:15:13,00:15:17,"- So they just get some stones, so it's probably these."
00:15:17,00:15:21,- So what they do is they get like old ancient otter skeletons
00:15:21,00:15:25,and they look at the teeth and they see whether they've used--
00:15:25,00:15:28,if they had to use a teeth to open the shells and they'll be cracked
00:15:28,00:15:31,"and if they didn't have to use a teeth, then they won't be cracked"
00:15:31,00:15:33,and so you can tell when they started using tools.
00:15:33,00:15:34,- Wow. - That's amazing.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"- They also have, we think they smell in quite an incredible way"
00:15:38,00:15:40,because they can't technically smell underwater.
00:15:40,00:15:43,The water stops the smell particles
00:15:43,00:15:44,and being able to get to their nose.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"So what is thought that they do, what we've seen them doing,"
00:15:46,00:15:51,is they blow a snot bubble out of their nose while they're underwater
00:15:51,00:15:53,and then they blow it out towards what they think is some prey
00:15:53,00:15:55,and then they immediately suck it back in again.
00:15:55,00:15:58,So they get the scent of the prey into the air and the snot bubble
00:15:58,00:15:59,and they suck it back in and they can smell it.
00:15:59,00:16:01,"- Oh, wait. - That's incredible."
00:16:01,00:16:02,- That's a perani what they're doing
00:16:02,00:16:04,and that's how they smell if it's prey they want to eat
00:16:04,00:16:05,or if it's just a bit of rock.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- That's so cool.
00:16:06,00:16:08,- We should move on to our next fact very soon.
00:16:08,00:16:10,Anyone got anything before we do?
00:16:10,00:16:12,"- Some stuff about asthma very quickly. - Yeah, sure."
00:16:12,00:16:15,"- So Thomas Penny, who is an English entomologist,"
00:16:15,00:16:19,"thought that if you took crushed wood lyce, that would cure asthma."
00:16:19,00:16:20,- Huh?
00:16:20,00:16:23,- Something that actually can cure asthma is roller coasters
00:16:23,00:16:26,or you can't cure it but you can leave the symptoms.
00:16:26,00:16:28,- It can make you forget about it for three minutes.
00:16:28,00:16:30,(laughing)
00:16:30,00:16:32,"- Yeah, this is an Ig Nobel study actually"
00:16:32,00:16:36,"and they check people's kind of breathing, breathing,"
00:16:36,00:16:37,not breathing.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"- Not a roller coaster, James."
00:16:39,00:16:40,(laughing)
00:16:40,00:16:42,"- The bars are damn it. - Three minutes, that's all right."
00:16:42,00:16:44,(laughing)
00:16:45,00:16:48,- So they check their breathing ability before and after
00:16:48,00:16:50,"and just before they, because of the stress"
00:16:50,00:16:52,"of going on the roller coaster, it got a bit worse"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"but then afterwards, somehow the pleasurable stress"
00:16:54,00:16:56,seems to have kind of relieved the symptoms
00:16:56,00:16:58,of asthma quite a lot.
00:16:58,00:16:59,- Really?
00:16:59,00:17:00,- It's quite good.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Good tip, it's good."
00:17:01,00:17:04,"- Just on difficulty breathing,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,also mothers teach their kids to swim
00:17:07,00:17:09,by doing what all of our parents did when we learned to swim
00:17:09,00:17:12,which is just like forcibly ducking them underwater
00:17:13,00:17:14,in order to make that.
00:17:14,00:17:16,So baby otters are born not being able to swim
00:17:16,00:17:18,and that you can watch videos of mothers training otters
00:17:18,00:17:21,and they drag them from the rocks into the water
00:17:21,00:17:22,and then they pull them along behind them
00:17:22,00:17:25,and then they let go of them like when you're riding a bike
00:17:25,00:17:27,for the first time and they sort of start sinking a bit
00:17:27,00:17:29,and so their mother has to go up and get them
00:17:29,00:17:30,and then to get them used to being underwater
00:17:30,00:17:32,"for long periods of time, they just like duck"
00:17:32,00:17:34,these baby otters underwater and hold them there.
00:17:34,00:17:36,- It's very difficult experiences growing up.
00:17:36,00:17:37,(laughing)
00:17:37,00:17:39,- My dad was an otter.
00:17:39,00:17:42,(laughing)
00:17:42,00:17:47,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:17:47,00:17:49,and that is Chazinski.
00:17:49,00:17:51,"- Yeah, my fact this week is that your appendix"
00:17:51,00:17:54,"can be turned into a sphincter, if you like."
00:17:54,00:17:57,(laughing)
00:17:57,00:17:58,- No one's forcing you.
00:17:58,00:17:59,- I think you're gonna have to explain.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"- Yeah, so I just think this is incredibly cool."
00:18:02,00:18:05,What I guess what medicine and surgery can do.
00:18:05,00:18:07,So appendix can be really useful now.
00:18:07,00:18:11,It can be repurposed for other reasons inside your body.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"So for instance, if you need bladder replacement surgery"
00:18:13,00:18:16,then the surgeon's going and they take a part of your intestine
00:18:16,00:18:18,to make a little bladder out of it
00:18:18,00:18:22,and then they take your appendix and they reform it into tissue
00:18:22,00:18:24,that builds a sphincter muscle that can contract
00:18:24,00:18:26,and means that you're not gonna be incontinent.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Which I think is incredible.
00:18:27,00:18:29,You take your appendix that's sitting there
00:18:29,00:18:31,"relatively uselessly, controversial claim."
00:18:31,00:18:32,(laughing)
00:18:32,00:18:35,And you turn it into something really useful
00:18:35,00:18:36,that stops you wetting yourself all the time.
00:18:36,00:18:37,- I think that's amazing.
00:18:37,00:18:38,And it happens a lot in surgery.
00:18:38,00:18:41,You can use appendices for various things.
00:18:41,00:18:42,You can turn them into other things.
00:18:42,00:18:45,You can also turn them into the ureta.
00:18:45,00:18:46,If you've got a problem with your ureta
00:18:46,00:18:49,you can replace that by reshaping an appendix.
00:18:49,00:18:51,- If you are hosting a child's birthday party
00:18:51,00:18:53,but you've run out of balloons.
00:18:53,00:18:55,(laughing)
00:18:55,00:18:58,"And appendix will make a poor,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,but exams are the subject.
00:19:00,00:19:01,(laughing)
00:19:01,00:19:06,- We should say that because the Aztecs
00:19:06,00:19:10,used the bowels of animals to make balloons.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Or they blew into them.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"I mean, and then they kind of tied them"
00:19:14,00:19:16,and I don't think they did shapes out of them.
00:19:16,00:19:18,(laughing)
00:19:18,00:19:19,But that is true actually.
00:19:19,00:19:20,I think that is true.
00:19:20,00:19:23,And I read in one place that apparently
00:19:23,00:19:25,"when they ran out of kind of caps or dogs,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,what did they use?
00:19:27,00:19:30,They use humans because they had loads of human sacrifices
00:19:30,00:19:30,and loads of dead humans
00:19:30,00:19:33,and they would use the insides of humans to make balloons.
00:19:33,00:19:33,I have read that.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- Happy birthday son.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"- And here's your grandparents, organs."
00:19:37,00:19:38,(laughing)
00:19:38,00:19:39,- God.
00:19:39,00:19:40,(laughing)
00:19:40,00:19:44,"So you, Dan, have millions of sphincters."
00:19:44,00:19:46,(laughing)
00:19:46,00:19:47,And so does everybody else.
00:19:47,00:19:49,- Millions are strong.
00:19:49,00:19:50,You have such a point out of the sphincter
00:19:50,00:19:51,I'm talking about is not the sphincter
00:19:51,00:19:53,that you're imagining.
00:19:53,00:19:54,- Of course.
00:19:54,00:19:55,- Because we do have a lot of sphincters.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"- Yeah, so we've all got an A-list sphincter as it were."
00:19:58,00:20:01,But there are millions of them throughout your body.
00:20:01,00:20:03,So you have sphincters all the way
00:20:03,00:20:04,through your digestive system.
00:20:04,00:20:06,So sphincter is just a ring of muscle
00:20:06,00:20:08,which can expand or contract to allow anything through it.
00:20:08,00:20:11,So you also have them in your blood vessels.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"All your veins and capillaries have tiny, tiny, tiny sphincters"
00:20:14,00:20:17,which widen or constrict depending
00:20:17,00:20:18,on where needs blood in the body.
00:20:18,00:20:20,- Is it millions?
00:20:20,00:20:21,I thought it was like 60.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- Well, I looked into it a lot and I haven't got enough."
00:20:23,00:20:25,- They've counted a load of ones.
00:20:25,00:20:26,So they've counted the one that goes
00:20:26,00:20:28,from your esophagus to the stomach
00:20:28,00:20:30,or from the stomach to the small intestine.
00:20:30,00:20:33,But they haven't counted the ones in the blood vessels.
00:20:33,00:20:36,- Some of them are so tiny.
00:20:36,00:20:39,So I'm not sure that there can be a proper audit.
00:20:39,00:20:40,- Wow.
00:20:40,00:20:40,- Yeah.
00:20:40,00:20:41,- But you've done your best.
00:20:41,00:20:42,- Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:43,- So why say a million?
00:20:43,00:20:44,"Maybe it's thousands, I don't know."
00:20:44,00:20:48,- So the word sphincter comes from an old word sphinctine
00:20:48,00:20:49,which means to squeeze.
00:20:49,00:20:52,And another word that comes from that is sphincts
00:20:52,00:20:55,as in the big animal in Egypt.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Yeah, that's a country."
00:20:56,00:21:01,So the official plural of the word sphincts is sphinjis.
00:21:01,00:21:02,- Yeah.
00:21:02,00:21:04,- So that's one for you all to use.
00:21:04,00:21:06,(laughing)
00:21:06,00:21:08,- Sphincters are a blue horse.
00:21:08,00:21:09,"Whales, blue horse, sphincters."
00:21:09,00:21:10,- Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- Any kind of muscle that kind of contracts.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- An elephant's trunks.
00:21:12,00:21:13,- Your eyes.
00:21:13,00:21:14,- Your eyes.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"- In your pupils, the muscles which allow your pupils"
00:21:17,00:21:18,to expand or contract their sphincters.
00:21:18,00:21:20,- And you have two in your reiners.
00:21:20,00:21:21,- Three.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"- You have an internal one,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,"which is involuntary and an external one,"
00:21:25,00:21:26,which is voluntary.
00:21:26,00:21:27,- In most cases.
00:21:27,00:21:29,(laughing)
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- Also, koalas."
00:21:33,00:21:35,"Koala pouches are like kangaroo pouches,"
00:21:35,00:21:38,"but they're upside down, which feels like a design flaw."
00:21:38,00:21:39,"So when they're raising their young,"
00:21:39,00:21:41,"they're in this upside down pouch,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,"which if they didn't have the sphincter,"
00:21:42,00:21:44,which acts kind of like an elastic band
00:21:44,00:21:46,"or like a drawstring to keep the baby in there,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,the baby would just drop out of their pouch.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"So they clench their sphincter,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,and then the baby stays in there.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"- So the appendix, should we talk about that?"
00:21:55,00:21:55,"- Yeah, why not?"
00:21:55,00:21:56,- Yeah.
00:21:56,00:21:58,- So lots of theories.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"We didn't know about it until 1522,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"because in the ancient world,"
00:22:02,00:22:06,"the doctor Galen, who was just the doctor,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,and his stuff was the only really anatomical stuff
00:22:08,00:22:10,"we knew about until the 16th century,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,"he only dissected monkeys,"
00:22:12,00:22:15,and monkeys don't have an appendix or appendices.
00:22:15,00:22:16,- Do they not?
00:22:16,00:22:18,"- Yeah, so that's why we didn't know it existed."
00:22:18,00:22:19,"- Yeah, although what happened when it burst,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,presumably people would have got appendicitis.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"- Yeah, people got it, but I--"
00:22:23,00:22:23,- But they just didn't know when it was.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"- No, exactly, 'cause the dissection was really,"
00:22:27,00:22:30,"a big no-no, as long as you went an elastic, I suppose."
00:22:30,00:22:33,- There's a thing I read today about
00:22:33,00:22:35,"when Australian explorers go to the Arctic,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"they have to have their appendix taken out,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,"so it turns out that that's not necessarily true,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"they do encourage it,"
00:22:42,00:22:44,but there is Werner Herzog made a documentary
00:22:44,00:22:46,"about the people who live out there,"
00:22:46,00:22:47,and the ones who choose to stay out
00:22:47,00:22:50,"when it goes into the real inaccessible months,"
00:22:50,00:22:51,and they have to make the decision
00:22:51,00:22:52,if they're gonna stay out there.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"The appendix needs to be taken out,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,as do wisdom teeth.
00:22:55,00:22:57,That's the thing that doesn't have any way
00:22:57,00:22:58,that they can stay out there.
00:22:58,00:23:00,- I wasn't there who had appendicitis
00:23:00,00:23:02,when he was in the Antarctic.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"- I think Lear Nidroghazov, I was gonna say, he was Russian, yeah."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"- Yeah, so there was this 1961,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,"and it was a Russian trip to the South Pole,"
00:23:10,00:23:11,"and this guy, Lear Nidroghazov,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,"got appendicitis, he happened to be a surgeon,"
00:23:13,00:23:15,"which was useful, and he said,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"""Look, I think I'm gonna have to take out my own appendix."""
00:23:17,00:23:20,"And he wrote, ""Well, I find incredible as he's in total agony,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,"and the night before he did the operation,"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"he was writing his diary, and he wrote,"
00:23:24,00:23:25,"""It hurts like the devil,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,I have to think through the only possible way out
00:23:27,00:23:28,"""to operate on myself."""
00:23:28,00:23:30,"Anyway, he took his appendix out,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"and he had three assistants, one to hold the lamp,"
00:23:33,00:23:34,"one to hold the mirror,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,"so that he could see inside himself,"
00:23:36,00:23:39,and then a third person in case one of those two fainted.
00:23:39,00:23:40,- What?
00:23:40,00:23:43,(laughing)
00:23:43,00:23:44,- I want to be that guy.
00:23:44,00:23:46,(laughing)
00:23:46,00:23:48,"- He said so, he, so the mirror wasn't actually"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"that helpful, it turned out,"
00:23:49,00:23:52,so he ended up doing it by feeling around.
00:23:52,00:23:53,"- Oh, that's right."
00:23:53,00:23:54,"- Because it was all back to front, wasn't he?"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"He had the mirror there, but he kept going one way,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,but like shaving the wrong side of your face or something.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"- Yeah, which I think was harder than he imagined,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,"so he thought it was probably easy if I just feel,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"and then he ended up tearing a bit of his gut at one point,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,and he had to sow that art mid-operation.
00:24:06,00:24:08,"And what he said afterwards, when he was talking,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"when he was interviewed about, he said,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,"""I felt so sorry for my surgical assistants,"
00:24:12,00:24:13,"""they stood there in their surgical whites,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,"""whiter than the white themselves."""
00:24:15,00:24:16,(laughing)
00:24:16,00:24:17,Paul there.
00:24:17,00:24:18,(laughing)
00:24:18,00:24:20,"- The task doorstep challenge was actually,"
00:24:20,00:24:21,(laughing)
00:24:21,00:24:23,I found it that way.
00:24:23,00:24:24,(laughing)
00:24:24,00:24:26,"Paul, do you know what, so this is sort of this fact,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,was sort of about repurposing body parts
00:24:29,00:24:29,for different things.
00:24:29,00:24:33,"And if you have a tummy tuck, they use the fat"
00:24:33,00:24:36,"for breast implants, so they read the--"
00:24:36,00:24:38,"- But even if you don't ask for it, I'm full."
00:24:38,00:24:40,(laughing)
00:24:40,00:24:41,"- Wait, not what not."
00:24:41,00:24:43,(laughing)
00:24:43,00:24:46,"Okay, time for our final fact of the show,"
00:24:46,00:24:49,and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:24:49,00:24:52,- My fact is that the founder of Croft's
00:24:52,00:24:55,designed special train carriages for celebrity dogs.
00:24:55,00:24:57,(laughing)
00:24:57,00:25:01,"So in the 19th century, Croft's was founded in the,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"I think, 1891."
00:25:03,00:25:06,"But there were loads of dog shows, before Croft's,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"and before these train carriages were invented,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"what they would just do, they would put the dogs"
00:25:11,00:25:14,"that were going to the dog show in special boxes,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,which were then strapped to the underside of the carriage.
00:25:16,00:25:17,- Yeah.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"- So they would arrive, not in good nick,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,not really ready for a dog show.
00:25:22,00:25:23,(laughing)
00:25:23,00:25:26,So he designed these special deluxe train carriages
00:25:26,00:25:29,"for dogs, and they had a row of canals inside,"
00:25:29,00:25:32,"and they had zinc flooring, and they had water troughs,"
00:25:32,00:25:36,"and they had drainage, and they had two seats for attendance."
00:25:36,00:25:37,So it's like tapping crew.
00:25:37,00:25:40,- It's zinc flooring the height of luxury.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"- I dream, I don't know, maybe for dogs,"
00:25:43,00:25:46,or maybe he's seen as cleaner or maybe it was that.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"- The guy from Croft's, Charles Croft,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,"he was actually, was he kind of a showman,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,or a dog biscuit manufacturer?
00:25:52,00:25:54,- He was a dog biscuit manufacturer.
00:25:54,00:25:57,"In London, there was a very famous building,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,"I think it was the first ever dog biscuit factory ever,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,"and it was called Sprats, and that's where Charles Croft worked."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"He started there, and he was working on the biscuits,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"and he was so good, he had ideas about marketing,"
00:26:07,00:26:10,and he turned it into the first sort of major brand of biscuits.
00:26:10,00:26:12,"They put logos on it, and so on, so people knew about it."
00:26:12,00:26:13,"- Yeah, thanks."
00:26:13,00:26:16,- There's a rumor that Charles Croft never owned a dog
00:26:16,00:26:17,in his life.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"- Yeah, I've read it."
00:26:18,00:26:19,- And he sort of put it about during his life
00:26:19,00:26:21,"that he never owned a dog, and his wife's, yeah,"
00:26:21,00:26:24,"because we couldn't show favoritism for one breed or another,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,"and then in his posthumous memoirs,"
00:26:26,00:26:27,it turned out that he had a sunburner.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"- Yeah, he had a massive sunburner, didn't he?"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"- Yeah, that sounds very rude."
00:26:31,00:26:35,(audience laughing)
00:26:35,00:26:36,"- Quite hard to hide that, the dog."
00:26:36,00:26:38,(audience laughing)
00:26:38,00:26:40,I'm surprised he kept his secrets in love.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- They're true, yeah."
00:26:42,00:26:45,"- So Croft was a genius at making money, basically."
00:26:45,00:26:46,"I'm putting on these big shows,"
00:26:46,00:26:47,"I'm putting on even bigger shows,"
00:26:47,00:26:50,and just really exploiting his audience in his market.
00:26:50,00:26:53,So I read that this was what he did
00:26:53,00:26:55,"in the early days of Croft, so I'm quoting here."
00:26:55,00:26:58,He introduced a system where competitors would pay
00:26:58,00:27:00,"to enter their dogs, and make additional payments"
00:27:00,00:27:02,if they wish to take the dogs away
00:27:02,00:27:04,"each night of the competition,"
00:27:04,00:27:07,and then pay again if they wanted to take them away early
00:27:07,00:27:08,on the final day.
00:27:08,00:27:09,- Wow.
00:27:09,00:27:13,"- So basically, it's not free to enter or leave."
00:27:13,00:27:15,(audience laughing)
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- Coated, many people run out of money"
00:27:16,00:27:19,and just have to leave their dog there forever.
00:27:19,00:27:22,Is there a huge lost property office of dead dogs
00:27:22,00:27:24,that are 75 years old?
00:27:24,00:27:26,(audience laughing)
00:27:26,00:27:29,"- I just think that's an inspired system, yeah, that's it."
00:27:29,00:27:31,"It also applies here tonight, guys, so."
00:27:31,00:27:34,(audience laughing)
00:27:34,00:27:37,"Croft also found, Charles Croft, the guy who founded it,"
00:27:37,00:27:38,"also founded a cat show, did you know that?"
00:27:38,00:27:39,- It did.
00:27:39,00:27:43,"- But, quoting from, I think there's Oxford Dictionary"
00:27:43,00:27:44,"of National Bography Entry,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,it failed to live up to commercial expectations.
00:27:46,00:27:47,- Yeah.
00:27:47,00:27:49,- It doesn't feel like cats would like to be shown.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"- Oh, I read a thing about cat shows,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"and there was a lady who was giving advice for this,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"there is a cat show called the Supreme Cat Show,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,"which is such a good name,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"and she enters cats for it all the time,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,"and she said, ""The main grooming things"
00:28:02,00:28:04,"""are brushing the coat through with a comb,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,"""making sure the underarms and the bikini area"
00:28:07,00:28:08,"""are combed through with a comb."""
00:28:08,00:28:10,(audience laughing)
00:28:10,00:28:11,- Whoa.
00:28:11,00:28:12,- Oh my God.
00:28:12,00:28:13,(audience laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:14,- And washing the cat's face.
00:28:14,00:28:17,(audience laughing)
00:28:17,00:28:19,"- It's pretty weird, yeah."
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Wow.
00:28:20,00:28:21,"- So, the prize isn't croft."
00:28:21,00:28:23,It's really small as well.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Do you know the maximum prize?
00:28:24,00:28:25,Cash prize that you get?
00:28:25,00:28:26,- Oh no.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"- It's 100 pounds, so it's really, it's a token thing."
00:28:28,00:28:29,"- Yeah, right."
00:28:29,00:28:30,"- You also get a big silver cup,"
00:28:30,00:28:31,but you're not allowed to melt it or anything.
00:28:31,00:28:34,- And a lot of royalty have won.
00:28:34,00:28:35,- So there are?
00:28:35,00:28:36,- Have a lot of royalties.
00:28:36,00:28:37,- Do they come in disguise?
00:28:37,00:28:38,(audience laughing)
00:28:38,00:28:40,"- Quick, quick, Victoria entered as a shitsoo."
00:28:40,00:28:42,(audience laughing)
00:28:42,00:28:43,- What many years running?
00:28:43,00:28:45,'Cause everyone was too afraid to say that's the queen.
00:28:45,00:28:48,(audience laughing)
00:28:48,00:28:51,"- Yeah, and so you can make money from endorsements"
00:28:51,00:28:54,"and from, you know, pimping the dog out for stud."
00:28:54,00:28:56,"Whatever, I don't know what it's called,"
00:28:56,00:28:57,but they have sex with other dogs
00:28:57,00:28:59,and then you get better dogs.
00:28:59,00:29:02,"But, do you know what the prize was?"
00:29:02,00:29:03,"It was in the first modern dog show,"
00:29:03,00:29:06,which was in 1859 in Newcastle.
00:29:06,00:29:07,- No.
00:29:07,00:29:08,- The prizes were all guns.
00:29:08,00:29:11,(audience laughing)
00:29:11,00:29:14,It was a really rural farming based competition.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"It was a cattle show and they said,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,"""Why don't we add a dog element to this cattle show"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"""and so the prize at the thrall guns?"""
00:29:20,00:29:23,- Do you know if you get a train in the UK
00:29:23,00:29:26,that you don't have to pay for your first two dogs
00:29:26,00:29:28,to come on for your third one you do?
00:29:28,00:29:31,"Yeah, so you get two dogs free and then your third one,"
00:29:31,00:29:32,you gotta start paying.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- Really?
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- Yeah, and every additional dog you bring up, yeah."
00:29:35,00:29:38,- But I read also that if any other customer objects
00:29:38,00:29:39,"to its presence on the train,"
00:29:39,00:29:42,you are obliged to move it to another area
00:29:42,00:29:44,according to by law 16 of the...
00:29:44,00:29:47,"- Oh yeah, try saying that when the pitbull's good at stealing it."
00:29:47,00:29:48,(audience laughing)
00:29:48,00:29:50,I object to this according to by law 16.
00:29:50,00:29:52,(audience laughing)
00:29:52,00:29:55,- I just have a cool train if you want to hear it.
00:29:55,00:29:56,- I have a cool train.
00:29:56,00:29:57,(audience laughing)
00:29:57,00:29:58,"What are you, sex?"
00:29:58,00:30:00,(audience laughing)
00:30:00,00:30:06,"- So, the Shining Zeppelin in 1931 was a German train"
00:30:06,00:30:08,and they wanted to make a super fast train.
00:30:08,00:30:10,And what they wanted to do was put a huge propeller
00:30:10,00:30:13,"on the back of the train and they would go super, super fast"
00:30:13,00:30:14,down the tracks.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"It's a brilliant idea, but it never went past the prototype stage"
00:30:17,00:30:20,because they found out that the propellers would kill people
00:30:20,00:30:21,who stood too close to the tracks
00:30:21,00:30:24,at the train stations.
00:30:24,00:30:24,Oh my God.
00:30:24,00:30:26,(audience laughing)
00:30:26,00:30:29,I've read there's a new idea of most complaints
00:30:29,00:30:31,that come about the way that trains function.
00:30:31,00:30:34,One complaint is the fact that too much time is lost
00:30:34,00:30:37,when they're trying to stop when they stop at a station
00:30:37,00:30:38,and people are getting on and off.
00:30:38,00:30:40,The other one is about internet access.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"So, one of the plans for a new train that they've been designing"
00:30:42,00:30:45,is to design a train that never stops
00:30:45,00:30:47,but still picks up passengers.
00:30:47,00:30:48,- Oh yeah.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"- Yeah, it's incredible."
00:30:49,00:30:51,"So, it just goes high speed, it's just high speeding along."
00:30:51,00:30:54,And then what they do is everyone boards another train
00:30:54,00:30:58,"and the other train chases the train that's going to the place,"
00:30:58,00:31:03,"docs onto it, everyone casually walks over, docs off it"
00:31:03,00:31:05,and goes back to the station.
00:31:05,00:31:07,That's one proposed idea for a new train.
00:31:07,00:31:08,- Yeah.
00:31:08,00:31:10,- That sounds about as sensible as James's massive slicey fan.
00:31:10,00:31:12,(audience laughing)
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- Okay, that's it."
