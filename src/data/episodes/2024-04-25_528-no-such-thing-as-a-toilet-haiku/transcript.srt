00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,720
 Before we get going, we have a very exciting announcement.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,060
 Anna?

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,900
 - Thanks, Dan.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,180
 Our announcement is that our esteemed colleague,

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,180
 Andrew Hunter Murray, famous podcaster, comedian galore.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,120
 Does one say that?

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,760
 He's also a published author.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,800
 I'm sure you've read his first two novels,

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,120
 which were brilliant thrillers.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,340
 He's written a third, which is so much fun so far.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,400
 I'm only about a quarter of the way through,

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
 because look, he didn't send me the proof on time,

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
 but it is fantastic.

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,200
 It's called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,080
 It's really fun.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,440
 It's got elements of comedy.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,780
 It's got elements of thriller in it so far.

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,000
 I really love the main character

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
 'cause he's doing something

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,800
 that I can really imagine myself doing in life.

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
 Don't just believe us.

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,600
 It's been complemented by The Guardian,

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
 which says it has a propulsive plot,

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,040
 an ingenious narrator and lashings of intrigue,

26
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,280
 making it a genuine and thoroughly enjoyable page turner.

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,480
 The Sunday Times has called it hugely entertaining,

28
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,120
 laugh out loud funny and impossible to put down.

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,320
 Dan Shriver, what do you say?

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,280
 - Well, I actually am a third of the way through the book.

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,040
 And I can say-- - All right,

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,720
 and I need to break? - It absolutely gets better

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,680
 after the first quarter.

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,960
 So if you want your books great in the first quarter

35
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,120
 and then accelerating to an even better place,

36
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,040
 you gotta get a beginner's guide to breaking and entering.

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,420
 It is the story of a guy who breaks

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,320
 into the second homes of the wealthy.

39
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,200
 He lives in them.

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
 They don't know it.

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
 He steals nothing, but one day,

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,080
 after he accidentally bumps into a group of people

43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,740
 who also do the same thing, they witness a murder

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,400
 and they get embroiled in a thing that they can't escape.

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
 And it's one of those comedy capers

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,280
 that just gets further and further into the chaos of it.

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,120
 If you've read Richard Osman's

48
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,680
 The Thursday Murder Club series,

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
 this is the perfect accompaniment to it.

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
 It's comedy, it's thriller, page turner, you're gonna love it.

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,880
 - So go to your local bookshop or any online bookseller

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,480
 or Amazon, look up a beginner's guide

53
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,400
 to breaking and entering by Andrew Hunter Murray now.

54
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,320
 - Okay, on with the podcast.

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,240
 - On with the show.

56
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,820
 (upbeat music)

57
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:15,840
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,200
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

61
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,320
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

62
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,640
 James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

65
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,400
 and in no particular order, here we go.

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,520
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

67
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that children's author,

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,560
 Margaret Wise Brown, died from doing

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,600
 an over-enthusiastic can-can kick.

70
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,400
 - I think now having read up on her,

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,160
 she would like that we laughed just then.

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,480
 - Yeah, I think so.

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
 - Definitely.

74
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,400
 - So is there an under-enthusiastic can-can kick?

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,480
 Is there such a thing as that?

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

77
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,200
 I've been to the Moulin Rouge a few times

78
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
 and asked for my money back.

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
 Barely got above the knee.

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,520
 - You've got your protractor out in the front row.

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,600
 (laughing)

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,720
 - That was disgusting, I mean.

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,280
 They really looked out at that.

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,560
 So Margaret Wise Brown is most famous

85
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,440
 for a children's book called Good Night Moon.

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,000
 She's written lots of others, but this is the biggie.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,960
 What I liked about this is in this podcast,

88
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
 the number of times I've got a book out

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,920
 because we've talked about that author

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
 and I've got about 25% of the way through it

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
 and never finished that one.

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
 This is probably the first time

93
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,280
 I've got through the whole book.

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
 - Oh, you finished it?

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
 - I managed to finish it.

96
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
 - All 140-ish words, right?

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,640
 (laughing)

98
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,080
 - I thought you were going to say pages then.

99
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
 I was going to say, no, that wasn't the book I read.

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,960
 Yeah, it's a very short book.

101
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,880
 Actually, the first, maybe the first of those board books,

102
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,640
 you know, that you give to children,

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,680
 apparently it was the first of those.

104
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,720
 But she unfortunately died in 1952.

105
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,680
 She just had emergency surgery on either an ovarian cyst

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,600
 or an inflamed appendix, depending on what you read.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,040
 And she was ready to leave the hospital

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
 and be carried, as she said,

109
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,480
 in a sedentary by four of the village boys

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,880
 to a hilltop estate where she would convalesce,

111
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,240
 but to show the medical staff that she was in good health.

112
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,640
 She kicked up her leg, can-can style,

113
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,280
 and she had a blood clot, dislodged it, blacked out,

114
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,120
 and never died again.

115
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,480
 - According to what I read, died instantly.

116
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
 - Yeah.

117
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
 - Like, can-can kicked and just out.

118
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,680
 It's sad, obviously, but that's how I would love to go.

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
 - Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't.

120
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
 (laughing)

121
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,440
 - It's a good way to go, I think,

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
 if you've got to go at that age.

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
 - Yeah, I mean, she was so young, she was 42.

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,720
 And she was, the other cool thing about this,

125
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,640
 she was on her way to meet, I think, her lover,

126
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,480
 one of the junior rocker-fellas,

127
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,800
 who was going to pick her up in a boat

128
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
 and sail away to Tunisia with her.

129
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,920
 - Yeah, he was on his way, on the boat.

130
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
 - Yeah.

131
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
 - So sad.

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
 - I think that was maybe the saddest thing,

133
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,440
 is that she'd had a very unlucky love life,

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
 and she'd met this guy sort of the year before, I think,

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,880
 and I was reading a bit of a biography of her

136
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,720
 that he wrote many, many years later,

137
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,160
 and he was so, obviously, so in love with her,

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
 and she had finally found the love of her life.

139
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,440
 And then, yeah, bam, he was nicknamed Pebble,

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,160
 but it was a still, James Stillman, rocker-fella junior,

141
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,360
 and he was junior, he was 24.

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,280
 - Yeah. - Oh, wow.

143
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,200
 - Toy boy.

144
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,760
 - He later married a descendant of the Carnegie's.

145
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,840
 So it's a real powerhouse couple of that,

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,320
 the rocker-fellas and the Carnegie's.

147
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
 - Yeah.

148
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,000
 - Carnegie's. - Carnegie's, I would say.

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,640
 - Carnegie's are the ones who come up to you in the bar

150
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,320
 and say, "That's a shit shirt."

151
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,640
 (all laughing)

152
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,400
 - That's not how you neg.

153
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,920
 The neg is a compliment, and then a backhanded compliment.

154
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,080
 - What? - What should I be doing?

155
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
 - You should say, "I love your shirt.

156
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,440
 "I saw six people wearing it earlier tonight."

157
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,920
 - Oh, that's good, that's a true better than mine.

158
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 (all laughing)

159
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,520
 - But yeah, Margaret Was Brown was a absolute legend.

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,360
 - What a gal.

161
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,800
 - She was, and she sort of, the fact is,

162
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360
 is that she's often referred to

163
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
 as almost like a Hollywood dame.

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,720
 Like she was going around in high-class parties,

165
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,040
 she was doing the weirdest of stuff socially.

166
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,360
 She took all the-- - Oh yeah.

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,040
 - She had things like the Bird Brain Club,

168
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,120
 which it was a club where the decision was

169
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,080
 anyone who was part of it.

170
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,920
 If they said on the day, "It's Christmas,"

171
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
 you have to go over and celebrate Christmas.

172
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
 - It's a fun idea.

173
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,280
 - It's a great idea. - I got an idea.

174
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,200
 - Oh, it's a tiresome idea.

175
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,720
 It's a fun idea, the first two times you do it.

176
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
 And even by the third time, it's annoying.

177
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,560
 - I think it was used wisely.

178
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,040
 - I'm sure some people were kicked out

179
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,560
 of the Christmas club or whatever it was.

180
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,920
 - Bird Brain Society. - Bird Brain Society.

181
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,480
 She could run as fast as a dog?

182
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
 - There we go. (all laughing)

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,240
 - Which dog?

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,400
 Not a Greyhound.

185
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,880
 - No, you're absolutely right.

186
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,080
 Well, I've written in my notes, she was a lifelong beagle.

187
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,120
 She was actually a beagle-er,

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
 which is where you trace hairs on foot,

189
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,840
 and you have a load of beagle dogs with you.

190
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
 And supposedly she was noted for her ability

191
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,640
 to keep pace with running beagles.

192
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,280
 - Her relationship with rabbits gets intense

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,600
 when she's an author, because she published a book

194
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
 which was called Little Fur Family.

195
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,200
 The illustrator was the same guy, Gareth Williams,

196
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 who did the illustrations for Charlotte's Web.

197
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,480
 She had a first print run of 75,000 copies for this book,

198
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,880
 and each edition of it was wrapped entirely in the fur

199
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,080
 of a New Zealand rabbit.

200
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,440
 - No. - Yeah, I don't believe you.

201
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,400
 - And were they all ones that she caught herself

202
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,760
 while being a beagle? (all laughing)

203
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
 - Yeah, I have no idea.

204
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,680
 - It's amazing, isn't it? - Sorry, no.

205
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
 - Apparently it was because of a surrealist artist

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,680
 called Meret Oppenheim, who you might know this,

207
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,600
 it's like a teacup with rabbit fur on the inside

208
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,480
 and the outside, actually, you don't know that.

209
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,760
 It's in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is it, I think?

210
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,960
 And it was the first surrealist thing that they bought.

211
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,360
 But yeah, she decided she would do her own thing

212
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,520
 with books and make them really furry.

213
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,600
 - But it's 75,000. - 75,000?

214
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
 - Yeah, it's mad.

215
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,560
 - Dan, you mentioned that you haven't read Good Night Moon,

216
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,600
 so you won't be aware, as I am,

217
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,880
 as someone who reads it every single night, my daughter.

218
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,080
 The main character in that is also a rabbit.

219
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
 They're both rabbits, so having read this about her,

220
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,080
 I look at that completely differently now,

221
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,680
 every page where you see this old rabbit in a rocking chair.

222
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,280
 - It's a fantastic book, we should say.

223
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
 - It's so good. - It's so good.

224
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,680
 - It's pretty good, it's like one of the first ones

225
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
 that just was slightly weird and just rhyming stuff.

226
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,680
 - Yeah.

227
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,160
 - It's just a little bunny going to bed,

228
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
 and it's all the stuff in the room,

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,680
 Good Night Blocks and Good Night Socks and all that.

230
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
 It's just very gentle, sort of lulling for child.

231
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,960
 I'm sure I was read it lots, I think.

232
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,520
 - But she also didn't like children,

233
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
 as well as not liking rabbits.

234
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,560
 It's kind of weird to make a book about rabbits for children,

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,640
 if you don't like either of those things.

236
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
 - Yeah, 'cause she also did another book,

237
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
 which had a print run of 80,000,

238
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,600
 which was entirely wrapped in the skin of five-year-olds.

239
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,960
 - She said in an article for Life Magazine,

240
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,120
 she said, "I don't especially like children."

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,040
 And in another note to someone,

242
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,000
 she wrote, "How many children have you got?

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,080
 "I have 50 bucks."

244
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,120
 So I think she saw the bucks as her.

245
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,400
 - All right, they are less trouble.

246
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,440
 Have you seen all the Easter eggs in Good Night Moon?

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
 This is just what happens

248
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
 when you have read it over 100 times now.

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,000
 - I don't know how to read it again.

250
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
 - You are.

251
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,520
 - There's so much you start to discover.

252
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,480
 - Don't tell me it's the same with Les Miserables,

253
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,680
 'cause I'm not reading that again.

254
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
 - As long as you've got the illustrated version.

255
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,040
 Well, I won't give it away so you can discover it,

256
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,080
 but if you do have a copy,

257
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,640
 look at the clock on every page and look at the moon.

258
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,480
 - To go backwards?

259
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
 - No, it doesn't.

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
 - Oh, like memento.

261
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,200
 - That would be so much better.

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,960
 Why didn't you, it just goes forwards.

263
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
 Just goes forwards.

264
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,840
 And so you know that it takes an hour and 10 minutes

265
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
 to get this rabbit to sleep when you want to go forwards,

266
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,920
 which is actually a long time.

267
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
 And look at the book on the bedside table.

268
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,200
 What do you think the book on the bedside table is?

269
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,360
 - Is it the book itself?

270
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,800
 - It's the book itself.

271
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
 - Is it?

272
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
 - That's surreal.

273
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,320
 - It hasn't met her.

274
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,360
 - Good Night Moon, still innovating all these years later.

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
 - She wrote her book, she said,

276
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,320
 in a sort of 15 to 20 minute period.

277
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
 That's the first draft.

278
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,680
 And then the second draft.

279
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,020
 - This is all about your books, isn't it?

280
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,860
 - This is all about your books, isn't it?

281
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,240
 (laughing)

282
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,600
 - So it takes a 15 to 20 minutes for the first draft.

283
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,440
 And then it takes her between one and two years

284
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
 for the second draft.

285
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,880
 - Oh, and that's where you go and rub no second draft.

286
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
 (laughing)

287
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,340
 - Oh, the edit is hard, the edit is hard.

288
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,960
 - Can we talk about the great thing she did

289
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,800
 with the royalties?

290
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
 - Yes.

291
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,480
 - It's bizarre.

292
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,920
 Margaret Weisbrand gave the royalties

293
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
 to every single one of her books,

294
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,080
 basically in her entire estate.

295
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,560
 She said, I leave it all to this little nine year old boy

296
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,200
 who lives next door, who I'm friendly with,

297
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
 and you know, I'm 40.

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,080
 Nothing's gonna happen to me.

299
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 I'll probably change the world

300
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,400
 when I gain dependence or whatever.

301
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,560
 Anyway, she then dies.

302
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
 - Two years later, right?

303
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
 - Two years later, she dies.

304
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,280
 So, and also Good Night Moon was on the,

305
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,000
 it was not selling big anymore.

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,080
 It was probably gonna go out of print shortly.

307
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,360
 Obviously it's never been out of print.

308
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,900
 It's sold millions of copies.

309
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,600
 And he was called Albert Clarke.

310
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,320
 And by the time he was 21, there was $75,000 waiting for him.

311
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,760
 Unfortunately, he had become a bit of a tear away.

312
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,600
 - Oh yeah.

313
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,820
 - A bit of a, a bit of a.

314
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,760
 - A bit of a rogue.

315
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,440
 - Bit of a rogue, burglary, joyriding, vandalism.

316
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,200
 He's a very, very, very naughty boy.

317
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
 - Kicked out of school for five,

318
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,520
 saw that sort of.

319
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,840
 - Yeah, and he had this bizarre life

320
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
 where he was always broke and getting into trouble

321
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,440
 and being arrested and banged up.

322
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
 And then every year, publishers would say,

323
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,360
 right, there's another two million quid waiting for you.

324
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,200
 - It's like the lotto lout.

325
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
 Do you remember him?

326
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,080
 - No, I don't.

327
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,280
 - Do you not remember him?

328
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,000
 He was like, when the lottery first started,

329
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
 I'm sure he's a very nice guy.

330
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,360
 So apologies if you're listening,

331
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,520
 but he won a load of money on the lottery

332
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,280
 and then just spent it all within like two years or something.

333
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,880
 And he was in all the tabloids as being a bit of a rogue.

334
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,720
 But it's like that.

335
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
 But then if then, once he spent it all,

336
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,160
 he won the lottery again.

337
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
 - Yeah, exactly.

338
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,880
 Yeah, exactly.

339
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
 So the first initial batch of money that he got,

340
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,160
 he gave a lot to his parents, which was nice.

341
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,760
 He gave $35,000 to his parents.

342
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,720
 He spent $4,000 on clothes for him and his two brothers.

343
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,680
 He had two brothers.

344
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,240
 And then he bought a Chevy Impala.

345
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
 As soon as he took it out of the shop,

346
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
 got smashed into, immediately dented it.

347
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,080
 - That's not his fault.

348
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,840
 - No, no, but I read an interview with him

349
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,200
 where he was sort of saying, look, yes, I've done bad things.

350
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,680
 But also just like, bad things just happen all the time

351
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,440
 that throw me into situations of such weird details.

352
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,840
 It's like he had a dented car

353
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,600
 and 14 pairs of alligator shoes.

354
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
 That's all he had in life.

355
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
 And then the next check comes in.

356
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,160
 And the only thing he's kept with him wherever he goes

357
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,080
 is the will.

358
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,840
 He keeps the will that she wrote.

359
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
 - And the alligator shoes.

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,120
 The naked man wearing alligators on his feet,

361
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
 collapsing and weird.

362
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
 - Isn't it weird?

363
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,880
 Like she was putting rabbits on her bucks.

364
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
 He was putting alligators on his feet.

365
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
 This is like the least vegan fact we've ever done.

366
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,960
 (all laughing)

367
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,400
 - I just mentioned her love life earlier,

368
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,040
 which was, again, not something you imagine

369
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
 when you're reading it,

370
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,080
 'cause you picture this old lady.

371
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,240
 He's writing these books.

372
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,120
 - Also, her name sounds old, doesn't it?

373
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,160
 Margaret Wise Brown.

374
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
 It doesn't sound like wise, yeah.

375
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
 I suppose in the 1920s, that was a really sexy name.

376
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,480
 - Margaret is now a more old fashioned name.

377
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,320
 I think that's fair.

378
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,160
 Is that fair to say?

379
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,360
 - Well, my mom's a Margaret.

380
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
 - There we go.

381
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
 - And she's very cool.

382
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,880
 - Yeah.

383
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,720
 - Coming every weekend.

384
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
 (all laughing)

385
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
 - She had an interesting love life.

386
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,080
 - Oh yeah.

387
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,920
 - She had his mom.

388
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,040
 And so did Margaret Wise Brown.

389
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,040
 And she went out with a woman called Michael Strange,

390
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,920
 confusingly, who, I like the LA Times in 1992,

391
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
 described Michael Strange as a writer and performer

392
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,760
 of limited gifts and voracious ego.

393
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,920
 And she did seem to be not a great partner

394
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
 for Margaret Wise Brown,

395
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,640
 but they got together in 1940

396
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,360
 and pretty much lived together

397
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
 or lived in next door apartments

398
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,360
 until Strange died in 1950.

399
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,240
 - They did share a butler.

400
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,200
 - The two ladies.

401
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,040
 - Yeah, so they had an apartment opposite each other.

402
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
 So in the corridor,

403
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
 the butler would just sort of go out the door,

404
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,720
 go through the next door and sort of just--

405
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,560
 - Wait, did they know?

406
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,080
 Did they know that they were sharing a butler?

407
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
 Or was he doing a sort of--

408
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
 (all laughing)

409
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,080
 - This is terrifying.

410
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,680
 - Take the mustache off, yeah.

411
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,520
 - You don't need to take the--

412
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
 - Yeah, why would you do that?

413
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,280
 - 'Cause they're dating.

414
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,120
 - Oh, you're right, yeah.

415
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,960
 - Oh, yeah.

416
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
 How's your butler?

417
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,920
 Well, he's still without a mustache.

418
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,760
 - He must get one.

419
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,080
 Mine looks dashing.

420
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,440
 - That was pretty fun.

421
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
 That's a great thing to do.

422
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,880
 - I looked at a few other kids' authors.

423
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,200
 Well, basically I went through my daughter's books

424
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,560
 and googled all of their authors.

425
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,880
 And I was looking at the tiger who came to tea.

426
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,720
 - Oh, yeah.

427
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
 - Which is by Judith Kerr.

428
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,440
 And Michael Rosen, who was the children's laureate

429
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
 and the writer and stuff,

430
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,960
 he has drawn parallels between the tiger who came to tea

431
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,800
 and Judith Kerr's early life.

432
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,160
 'Cause Judith Kerr's father was on a death list

433
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,380
 from the Nazis.

434
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,880
 And they had to leave Nazi Germany

435
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,840
 when she was nine years old.

436
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,680
 - Wow.

437
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,480
 - And Michael Rosen said that maybe the tiger

438
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
 is based on the threat that they faced

439
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,080
 when they were children,

440
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,880
 because it disrupted their life so much.

441
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
 They took everything that the family owned,

442
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,280
 like the tiger who came to tea drinks all of the water

443
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,200
 and eats everything in the cupboards and stuff like that.

444
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,560
 And Judith Kerr has said

445
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,400
 that the tiger represents nothing more than a tiger.

446
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,480
 (all laughing)

447
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
 - Well, I believe Michael, though.

448
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
 - Yeah, I love you too.

449
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,080
 - It's got a very weird ending, the tiger who came to tea.

450
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,280
 - Yeah, well.

451
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,560
 - Doesn't the tiger just leave?

452
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,200
 - No, I think daddy comes home.

453
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,080
 And it's really annoying because, you know,

454
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,000
 the tiger's had all his, like--

455
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,840
 - Drunk all his beer?

456
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
 - Drunk all his beer and had all the food for tea.

457
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,680
 - Yeah.

458
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,520
 - So then--

459
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,000
 - He says, "I've got a very good idea.

460
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,840
 "We'll go to the cafe and have sausage and chips

461
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,680
 "and ice cream."

462
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
 - Oh yeah.

463
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,760
 - Yeah, daddy takes them all out for--

464
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,460
 - Meanwhile, there's a drunk tiger feeling that.

465
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,440
 - The tiger goes unaddressed, exactly, yeah.

466
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,160
 - No, because then the next morning,

467
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,000
 they buy loads of food to fill the pantry up

468
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,080
 and they buy a tin of tiger food in case he comes back

469
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
 and he never did.

470
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,240
 - Oh, really?

471
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
 - Hmm.

472
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
 - Interesting.

473
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,660
 - I think if I was a dad walking back home,

474
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,880
 I opened the door,

475
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,400
 I see my three kids and my wife sitting by a table.

476
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,760
 No, no, just like in my story.

477
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,280
 And in the corner is a drunk tiger.

478
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,040
 I do think my first instinct is to not make a deal of it.

479
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,080
 Take kids, we're going out now.

480
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,720
 - Okay, so, Dan, the tiger's already left

481
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,560
 when daddy comes home.

482
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,880
 - Oh, I thought you said he was drunk in the--

483
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,640
 - No, so the daddy comes home and all the food's gone.

484
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,520
 All the water's gone, there's no water in the tub.

485
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,880
 - Oh yeah, wow.

486
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,640
 - And Mummy and Sophie tell daddy what's happened

487
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,920
 and said the tiger came in and ate all of the food

488
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,160
 and drank all of the drinks and all of your beer

489
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,000
 and took all the water out of the taps

490
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,640
 and then daddy goes, let's go to a cafe.

491
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,480
 That's how it works.

492
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,120
 - It sounds like daddy doesn't believe a word of this.

493
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,280
 It sounds like it's happened before.

494
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,120
 - Yeah.

495
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
 - And all the beer's gone, has it?

496
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,960
 Oh, the tiger, right, yeah.

497
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
 - Someone's turned the water off, have they?

498
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,160
 - Okay.

499
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,840
 - And the water bill over here, that's not been paid.

500
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,120
 But the interesting thing about that

501
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,480
 is when they walk to the cafe, it's nighttime,

502
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
 so all the street lights are on

503
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,520
 and all the cars have their headlights on,

504
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,160
 but there's a little cat that's walking by

505
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,240
 near where they live that looks exactly like a tiger,

506
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,720
 but it looks like a cat long.

507
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
 - It's acknowledged as a--

508
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,640
 - No, it's not acknowledged,

509
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,680
 but it's obviously like what inspired her lies.

510
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,840
 - Yeah.

511
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,240
 This drunken, reprobate lady's lies,

512
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,280
 she booses up on her husband.

513
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,120
 - I wish.

514
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,560
 - Here's what we're gonna tell daddy.

515
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,640
 (all laughing)

516
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,480
 - Tiger.

517
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,520
 - He's never gonna believe it, man.

518
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,480
 - I wish I'd been able to,

519
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,240
 'cause I was on a sofa with Michael Rosen yesterday.

520
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
 - Were you?

521
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,560
 - Yeah, but it was such a long sofa

522
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,120
 that I couldn't ask him about this.

523
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480
 It was an enormously long sofa.

524
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,360
 - Well, he wouldn't have heard you.

525
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,200
 - Honestly, he wouldn't.

526
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,040
 I would have had to get him and walk

527
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
 to the other end of the sofa.

528
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,240
 - Oh, wait, did you genuinely think,

529
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,840
 ah, I'd love to talk to this man,

530
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,680
 this legend of literature?

531
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,000
 Ah, the sofa's too long.

532
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,720
 - He had picked the absolute opposite.

533
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,360
 He had picked the furthest other part of the sofa

534
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,200
 and so on.

535
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
 It was very clear to me

536
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,840
 that he wasn't looking for a pal.

537
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,680
 - Right.

538
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,520
 - Well, you were DFS.

539
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,800
 (all laughing)

540
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
 - It was a call-as-o for as well,

541
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,640
 so I could have walked the hypotenuse.

542
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,140
 (all laughing)

543
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,720
 (upbeat music)

544
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

545
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
 and that is Anna.

546
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,200
 - My fact this week is that the city of Matsuyama

547
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,680
 has over 90 post boxes specifically for mailing haiku.

548
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,280
 - Mm-hmm, lovely.

549
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,560
 - Or, as you could say, Matsuyama

550
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,560
 has over 90 post boxes for mailing haiku.

551
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,000
 - Brilliant. - Is that right?

552
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
 - It's right. - It's right.

553
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,680
 - It's right. - It's amazing.

554
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,280
 - Well done, Anna. - Why?

555
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
 - Why?

556
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,240
 Why?

557
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,520
 - Why did you bother making that haiku?

558
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,960
 (all laughing)

559
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,440
 - That's bloody easy to make, aren't they?

560
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,040
 This is the capital city of Shikoku Island,

561
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,400
 which is one of Japan's islands.

562
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,520
 And it's because the city sort of calls itself

563
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,240
 the home of haiku because very famous haiku poets

564
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
 lived there.

565
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,560
 And so the first post box was installed in 1968

566
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,000
 to commemorate one of these poets' births.

567
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,720
 And now they're all over the place.

568
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,840
 They're like monuments and baths, public baths,

569
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,160
 and they're really beautiful as well

570
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,800
 and lots of different designs.

571
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,680
 And every three months,

572
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,040
 the local haiku poets go to the post boxes

573
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,360
 or they send an envoy and they empty them out

574
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
 and then they judge all the entries.

575
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,800
 - Oh, yeah. - And the winner

576
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,880
 gets published on the city's website.

577
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,760
 - It's so good. - It's so great.

578
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,240
 - I hope there's a walking trail.

579
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,520
 There is between them, which is called the Taker Haiku.

580
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
 - Lovely. - That would be good.

581
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
 - Nice.

582
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,560
 - But there is a walking trail.

583
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,400
 Sorry to jump in on your joke.

584
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't see it coming.

585
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,720
 - You should be able to see by now that long,

586
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,960
 that distant look in my eyes,

587
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,120
 but it shows something's brewing.

588
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 - The fact he's been silent for two minutes done,

589
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
 that should have been a clue.

590
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,400
 - Yeah, no, they do in this place as well,

591
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,200
 the Matsuyama area.

592
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,000
 They have certain haiku bars that you go into

593
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,360
 and you go up to the counter and you write a haiku

594
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,160
 and the cocktail they make you is based on your haiku.

595
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,240
 - No. - It's just, you know,

596
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,800
 they love a haiku, they love a novelty thing to do there, yeah.

597
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,920
 - What do you say?

598
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,440
 Gin and tonic, please.

599
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,320
 (all laughing)

600
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,720
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

601
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,360
 - Is it Bashou who was from this place

602
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,200
 or is it someone else?

603
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,560
 'Cause he's the most famous haiku guy.

604
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,920
 - He is, yeah, there seem to be sort of four kings of haiku

605
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,760
 and he's like the king of kings.

606
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,880
 But no, it's Masaoka Shiki who was the person

607
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,760
 who rejuvenated haiku in the 19th century.

608
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 So it basically sort of died, it was really dying

609
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,160
 and he lit a fire under its arse and--

610
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,440
 - Redamed it as well.

611
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
 - And gave it its name. - Gave it its name haiku.

612
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,000
 It was called like Hoku or something before.

613
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,840
 - Oh, so it didn't change it much.

614
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,160
 - No, he just put a stamp on it.

615
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,080
 He just, yeah, this is the Shiki stamp.

616
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
 - It's really interesting what Shiki did

617
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
 'cause he was obsessed with haiku.

618
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
 He failed his exams at university,

619
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,280
 partly because he was writing so many haiku

620
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,520
 and reading haiku and he was engrossed in the world of haiku.

621
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,360
 He sort of added to the rules about haiku

622
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
 and the first, the most important thing

623
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,280
 about haiku as we know them

624
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 is that it's an observation of what's around you.

625
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
 It's an observation of nature.

626
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,160
 So that's a key element to haiku.

627
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,240
 - So actually what Anna did at the start was not a haiku.

628
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,080
 - No, it was a culture.

629
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,120
 - It had the right number of syllables in

630
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,720
 but it has to have something to do with nature

631
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,360
 or something to do, it has to have a word

632
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
 that's something to do with one of the seasons.

633
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,600
 So for instance, there's a really famous one

634
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,080
 by Bashou who I mentioned earlier

635
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,960
 which goes an ancient pond, a frog jumps in,

636
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,680
 the splash of water.

637
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,000
 In Japanese it works as a haiku.

638
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,320
 But for him, it's the word frog refers to spring.

639
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,960
 It's a spring word.

640
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
 And so you need one of those.

641
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,400
 And so unless you're using the word postbox to refer to-

642
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
 - Yeah, it's a classic autumnal word, postbox.

643
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,960
 It's in the glossaries.

644
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,800
 - I get it now.

645
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,160
 So I read that earlier, that one.

646
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,320
 And I thought, you know, it was like,

647
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,640
 this was one that he published and became famous.

648
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,200
 And he was like dining off it for years.

649
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
 Like, "Where in that haiku was insane?"

650
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,520
 And I didn't find it impressive at all.

651
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,320
 I didn't make the spring and the frog connection.

652
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,160
 That's wonderful.

653
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,120
 - And now are you wowed by it?

654
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,480
 - I do like the punnery in the kind of double meaning.

655
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,160
 - Are we saying it because frogs jump?

656
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,000
 - No, no, no, no.

657
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
 - No, that's not it.

658
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,920
 - Oh, then I just like it again.

659
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
 I thought that is what was going on.

660
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,040
 - Sorry, that wouldn't-

661
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,760
 - That wouldn't work at all in Japanese.

662
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
 - Please, no.

663
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,160
 - No, it's just that frogs come out in spring.

664
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,800
 That's in their barn in spring.

665
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,760
 So they're associated with spring time.

666
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,920
 And it's supposed to you read it

667
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,760
 and it just puts you in that position

668
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,480
 of being in a garden in spring.

669
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
 The frog jumps in, you know exactly where you are.

670
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,320
 You know what's happening.

671
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,360
 You're one with nature.

672
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
 That's it.

673
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,040
 - Do you get it now?

674
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,880
 - I get it now.

675
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,800
 Listen, it's no good night moon.

676
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,120
 It's like-

677
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,680
 - What it's meant to be is like,

678
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,400
 it's like a shot in a film almost.

679
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
 It's a shot that crystallizes something

680
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,800
 and expresses something.

681
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,720
 I really like them.

682
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,960
 I did not know they don't have to be five, seven, five.

683
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,000
 - No.

684
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
 You can be a bit flexible.

685
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,200
 - And actually I was very interested

686
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 to message my Japanese friend after I'd read about this

687
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 'cause yeah, people who write about haiku properly

688
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,440
 and who know about it say,

689
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,640
 look, the syllables thing,

690
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,600
 it's a misinterpretation in English anyway

691
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,720
 'cause it's not syllables, it sounds.

692
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,920
 And she wrote me a few haikus at random,

693
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
 I think, while she was sitting on the toilet.

694
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
 And none of them had the right number of syllables.

695
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
 And I was like,

696
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,720
 sorry, I don't know if she would have wanted me to share that,

697
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
 but I have-

698
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,920
 (laughing)

699
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,280
 - She said an ancient toilet.

700
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,160
 - And turds jumps in the splash of water.

701
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,720
 (laughing)

702
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
 - And she said,

703
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
 the only thing I think a haiku needs

704
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
 is the seasonal reference.

705
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,320
 So there you go.

706
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,800
 And it is, they have done these glossaries

707
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,920
 that you have to stick to, don't they?

708
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
 You can buy a glossary, a haiku glossary.

709
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,080
 - Dan, could you maybe say some words

710
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
 that you think might be summer words?

711
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,960
 - Summer words?

712
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,800
 - Yeah, like a word.

713
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,620
 - Sun.

714
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,460
 - That might do it.

715
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,300
 - I reckon.

716
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,360
 - Although you do get sun in the other, you know.

717
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,200
 - True.

718
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,040
 - A nice bright.

719
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
 - You get it in most seasons.

720
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
 - Winter sun.

721
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,560
 - All year round, don't you?

722
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,400
 The old sun.

723
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,880
 - Harvest.

724
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,720
 - Sorry.

725
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,800
 - That'll be an autumn one.

726
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
 - Bikini.

727
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,460
 - Beach.

728
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,300
 - Yeah.

729
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,140
 - Bikini.

730
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,980
 - Yeah, yeah, that's a classic.

731
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,980
 It's in the list of summer words.

732
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,820
 - Blockbuster.

733
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,560
 (laughing)

734
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,320
 - So summer could be insects,

735
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,920
 autumn, scarecrow,

736
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,240
 resentment,

737
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,920
 winter, tangle, twigs, empty fields.

738
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,840
 - Oh, lovely.

739
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,680
 - I really like it.

740
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,780
 Can I show you the prop I've brought along?

741
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,620
 - Yes.

742
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,460
 - I like a related prop.

743
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,940
 - Hang on.

744
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,840
 'Cause I don't know if you guys know this.

745
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,920
 - You're not on the news.

746
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
 - Sorry.

747
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,600
 I don't know if you guys know this.

748
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,000
 - You've got Michael Rosen in your bag.

749
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,120
 (laughing)

750
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,880
 - I brought the sofa.

751
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,040
 - Okay, so there's a British Haiku Society.

752
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
 - Oh, yeah.

753
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 - Do you guys find that?

754
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

755
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,560
 - Because of your research?

756
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,400
 Well, I'm very proud to announce

757
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,520
 they've gained a new member this week.

758
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,720
 - Oh, no way.

759
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
 - I joined up.

760
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,400
 - Yeah.

761
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
 - Have you stopped your subscription

762
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,480
 to the Lighthouse Society?

763
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,800
 - The Association of Lighthouse Keepers

764
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,640
 have lost a member.

765
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,100
 (laughing)

766
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,600
 - Is it like having citizenship?

767
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,920
 You're only allowed to be a member of one or the other.

768
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,020
 - I think it's lapsed now,

769
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,900
 'cause I haven't received a copy of Lamp Magazine

770
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,300
 for a while, and I was a big fan of that.

771
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,140
 - Lights out.

772
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,660
 (laughing)

773
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,380
 - I am now a member of the BHS.

774
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
 - Yeah.

775
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,060
 - British Home Stars.

776
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,380
 - That's right.

777
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,860
 And look, I've got the journal here,

778
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,060
 which is called Blythe Spirit.

779
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,060
 - So Andy's holding an A5 white book

780
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,460
 with Blythe Spirit written on it.

781
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,020
 Does it have a lot of haiku in it?

782
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,980
 - Absolutely jam-packed with really good haiku.

783
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,740
 It just randomly pick one.

784
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,820
 - Yeah, give us a good haiku.

785
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,960
 A spring one if you can.

786
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,480
 - You're not gonna believe this.

787
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,080
 This is by Philip Murrell.

788
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,840
 Called home, I scrape away moss to find his name.

789
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,880
 And you can see why I signed up, 'cause he was full of this.

790
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,000
 - I like the way you pretended that was just random,

791
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,840
 but actually--

792
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,760
 - It's fallen open to this page

793
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,560
 because the spine is so cracked.

794
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,840
 All right.

795
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,780
 A baby shower immersed by cherubs, Botticelli.

796
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,800
 - What do you guys, I admire the idea

797
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,220
 of haikus, I really like them.

798
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,980
 It doesn't do anything for me.

799
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,900
 Certainly something like reading through a book like that.

800
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,100
 Just, I imagine if I was sitting in nature

801
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,580
 and then someone sent me a haiku about the area,

802
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,980
 that would be really nice and poignant.

803
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,340
 But do you guys get something from haiku?

804
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,380
 - I have done, having done research for this,

805
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,860
 I would say until that I hadn't,

806
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,700
 until I understood what it was,

807
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,460
 I didn't really get anything out of it.

808
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,580
 But I like the idea, they have these clubs

809
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,660
 where a hundred people will go to a beautiful place

810
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,560
 in nature and they'll all just write as many haiku.

811
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
 - See, I get that, I get that.

812
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,720
 - And you're just kind of like,

813
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,240
 you're trying to capture one moment

814
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,000
 where you're with nature

815
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,840
 in just this kind of slightly formulaic,

816
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,040
 but you can go out of the rules if you want to way.

817
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,880
 I kind of, I do.

818
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,760
 - Oh, it's a lovely conceit, definitely.

819
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,600
 I like it.

820
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,920
 - Yeah, I really like it.

821
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,120
 As James says, reading about it, the analysis of it,

822
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
 as with any kind of poetry or art,

823
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,400
 'cause I'm not smart enough to understand it face on.

824
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,600
 But when you read the analysis, I think you get it.

825
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,500
 And maybe you could be lured in by the punchline element.

826
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,660
 You know, often you'll do a comedy set

827
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,460
 where at the end it's got a big reveal.

828
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,800
 And that--

829
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,820
 - Or haikus have them.

830
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,860
 - Haikus, exactly.

831
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,740
 There's supposed to be this moment of realization, so.

832
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,100
 - That's why I thought the spring with the frog thing.

833
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,620
 - Sorry, not that kind of thing.

834
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,900
 More like the one I read that I really liked was bass,

835
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,660
 picking bugs off the moon.

836
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,940
 And the way it was explained was,

837
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,920
 you have bass, it's a type of fish, it's plucking bugs,

838
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,480
 and then it's off the moon.

839
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,520
 'Cause suddenly you realize, to them,

840
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,680
 they think they're picking bugs off the surface of the moon

841
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,640
 'cause they're always looking up at the moon.

842
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,480
 - Oh, that's lovely.

843
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,120
 - To us, they're picking up the surface of the moon.

844
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,960
 - And all of the haikus would have like a word in it,

845
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,360
 which is kind of hard to translate into English,

846
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,640
 but they're like a surprise

847
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,400
 or they call them a cutting word online a lot.

848
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,520
 And it might be, aha!

849
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,840
 Or--

850
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,680
 - Sorry?

851
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,380
 - Yeah, it's almost like an exclamation point.

852
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,420
 - Oh, okay. - Do you know what I mean?

853
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,380
 - My favorite haiku that I found is,

854
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,380
 and I hadn't heard of this,

855
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,700
 and I really think this is beautiful,

856
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,340
 the idea of the death poem.

857
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,180
 - Oh, yeah.

858
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,620
 - So the death poem is a Japanese tradition,

859
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,820
 whereby if you know that you're about to die,

860
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,660
 let's say an execution is gonna happen,

861
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,820
 'cause this has been going from centuries and centuries,

862
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,100
 this death poem idea.

863
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,660
 You are encouraged to write your final poem,

864
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,140
 and that can be presented in sometimes as a haiku.

865
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,020
 So there was one that was written by a guy

866
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,560
 called Moriya Senan,

867
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,700
 and his was, "Bury me when I die

868
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,880
 beneath a wine barrel in a tavern,

869
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,560
 with luck the cask will leak."

870
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,240
 Okay, so that's his thing.

871
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 What's really nice is the line,

872
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,840
 hopefully the cask will leak or the cask will leak,

873
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,320
 the Japanese wording for that is Moriya Senan,

874
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,160
 which is his name.

875
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,000
 - Lovely.

876
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,840
 - Oh, that's clever.

877
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,680
 - Is that wonderful?

878
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,520
 Yeah.

879
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
 - That is clever.

880
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,680
 - No one else can do that, can they?

881
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,000
 No one else has a chance in that competition.

882
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,540
 - Hey doctor, watch this.

883
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,160
 I'm doing a big kankam.

884
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,480
 Uh-oh, oh shit, shit.

885
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,540
 (laughing)

886
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,380
 - Beautiful.

887
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
 - Yeah.

888
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,740
 - Really good, where's the seasonal reference?

889
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,980
 (laughing)

890
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,040
 - Did you guys hear, hear tell of?

891
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,720
 (laughing)

892
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,040
 - This is now he's a member of the Haiku Society.

893
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,260
 This is how Andy speaks.

894
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,400
 - Everything has to scan.

895
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,280
 - Did you hear tell of the 2014 Haiku artist

896
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,880
 who operated out of Sainsbury's in North London?

897
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
 (laughing)

898
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 This was the board baker who smuggled complaint poems

899
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,360
 into the Sainsbury's treats that he was bagging up.

900
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,760
 So for example, enjoy your cookies.

901
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
 Each bite is a minute, I'll never get back.

902
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,160
 (laughing)

903
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,000
 It's a nice one.

904
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,200
 Anyway, he was identified and immediately fired.

905
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,920
 - Sainsbury's apologized to customers

906
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,520
 and said it should never have happened.

907
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,080
 - I love it, come on, I love it.

908
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,920
 - I liked it.

909
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,120
 - You'd be delighted if you got it.

910
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
 It's like a fortune cookie, isn't it?

911
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,580
 But instead of your future, you get some abuse.

912
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,440
 - This city is Matsuyama,

913
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,320
 which led me to read about Hideki Matsuyama,

914
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,840
 who was the first to have a Japanese professional golfer

915
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,560
 to win a men's major golf championship.

916
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,400
 - What year are we talking?

917
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,480
 - 2021.

918
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,560
 - What, wow.

919
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,640
 - That's the first time.

920
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,440
 - The first time a Japanese man

921
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,440
 at least has won a major golf championship.

922
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,280
 And he was once disqualified from a competition

923
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,320
 due to Tipex, riddle me this.

924
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,360
 - Yeah, okay.

925
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,200
 Just qualified for the competition.

926
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,440
 - It's famous in the golfing world.

927
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,120
 - Painting his balls.

928
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,880
 - Painting his balls with Tipex,

929
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,440
 where they're already white.

930
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
 - But does it add weight to it?

931
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,780
 Or some kind of grip that you wouldn't have?

932
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,520
 - You're getting really close, but it's not the balls.

933
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,120
 - Did he Tipex over his score on the board?

934
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Different score.

935
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,080
 - It's the club.

936
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,640
 He would put it onto the club itself on the...

937
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,600
 - So he put like a little target on the club

938
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,760
 so that he could see where he wanted to hit the ball

939
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,520
 or with Tipex, and that's allowed.

940
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,840
 You're allowed to do that.

941
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,720
 But he put too much Tipex on it,

942
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,520
 which made it slightly raised,

943
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,920
 which would change the grip that when the club hit the ball,

944
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,840
 it would change the way that the ball flew.

945
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,680
 And they measured it,

946
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,560
 and it was like a millionth of a millimeter too thick.

947
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,720
 - How amazing is that? - From a competition.

948
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
 - Gosh.

949
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,440
 - The forensic down to the millimeter.

950
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,640
 - Yeah. - That's so pedantic.

951
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,480
 - Like someone said, "Yes, you are allowed to put Tipex

952
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,880
 "on your club, but only a bit."

953
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,200
 (laughing)

954
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,520
 - And he exceeds that bit. - How much is a bit?

955
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,760
 Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

956
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,680
 - Wow.

957
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,640
 - So that's just me shoehornin' some golf into this bag.

958
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,480
 - I love it.

959
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,160
 There was an exciting thing in the world.

960
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,120
 This is sort of, he was the first Japanese golfer

961
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,960
 to do this. - Yeah, yeah.

962
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,080
 - There was an exciting thing in the world

963
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,360
 of Haiku in 2017 when a very prestigious competition

964
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,320
 was won for the first time by a non-Japanese person.

965
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,160
 - Really?

966
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,360
 - And it was Gracie Starkey,

967
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,480
 who was a 14 year old school girl from Gloucestershire.

968
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
 - Wow. - Oh, wow.

969
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,280
 - And she was learning Japanese at the time,

970
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,640
 and her teacher encouraged her to enter it.

971
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,840
 I think there were 18,000 entries.

972
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,200
 - It doesn't say much for the entire population of Japan,

973
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
 does it?

974
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,880
 (laughing)

975
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,240
 - It doesn't. - It's girl who I'm sure is great,

976
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,320
 but has only just started learning the language.

977
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,040
 - Yeah, it shows that the bar to entry is low for Haiku,

978
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,880
 I suppose.

979
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,080
 - Like, I can't imagine her winning the Japanese open

980
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,840
 golf for instance. (laughing)

981
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,360
 - And her poem was printed on millions of,

982
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,280
 there's a green tea drink company that was sponsoring it,

983
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,720
 so her poem was printed on millions of these bottles.

984
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,920
 And the coder to the story is that Gracie then decided

985
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,740
 to drop Japanese for GCSE,

986
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,080
 (laughing)

987
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,360
 saying the Japanese language is so hard.

988
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
 (laughing)

989
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,940
 (upbeat music)

990
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

991
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,320
 and that is Andy.

992
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,880
 My fact is that in the early 1900s there was a debate

993
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,200
 over whether cinemas should be dark or fully lit.

994
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,760
 (laughing)

995
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,160
 - Do we think they got it right?

996
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,680
 - I think they did get it right.

997
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,520
 - For me, yes, I think dark is better.

998
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,600
 - For the screening purpose, yes.

999
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,320
 For the rest of society, maybe not.

1000
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,800
 - Mmm, go on.

1001
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,160
 - Well, this was the brainchild of a guy

1002
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,240
 called Roxy Rothafell, early cinema entrepreneur,

1003
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,320
 and he announced in 1910 that he had perfected

1004
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,200
 what he called daylight pictures.

1005
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,040
 He said they were absolutely flickerless,

1006
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,720
 they wouldn't tie the sensitive eyes of the audience out,

1007
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
 and you could see everything in the room.

1008
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,960
 And that was a kind of crucial point,

1009
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,160
 'cause he was a big part of making cinema

1010
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,440
 socially acceptable, whereas, you know,

1011
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,760
 before it was fairgrounds and peep shows,

1012
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
 and it was a bit raucous, and it was dark,

1013
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
 and you couldn't see what was going on,

1014
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,200
 and people might be, you know, getting up to hanky-panky,

1015
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,960
 and men and women were sitting next to each other in the dark.

1016
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,720
 You know, why have we allowed this to happen?

1017
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,640
 And he basically said, "Look, here's a lovely bright,

1018
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,800
 "nicely lit screen," and he said,

1019
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,360
 "You can see the picture perfectly,

1020
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,720
 "but you can also see the room,"

1021
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,400
 and it's just a nice, more sociable way of watching.

1022
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
 - But actually, even the very, very,

1023
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,960
 very, very earliest cinemas,

1024
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,800
 so when Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company

1025
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,560
 was first sending out projectors,

1026
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,960
 they said that you should install ambient lighting

1027
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,400
 to deter misbehavior.

1028
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,800
 So even from the very first moment of cinemas,

1029
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 they were saying, "Let's not have it too dark

1030
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,320
 "because you never know what's gonna happen."

1031
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,160
 - Exactly. - Imagine, if they'd stuck to it,

1032
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,840
 I wonder how many children wouldn't have been conceived

1033
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,160
 in the back row of a cinema.

1034
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
 It could have done damage to the population of the world.

1035
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
 - Seaved as well. - No, it would have ruined

1036
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,040
 a lot of people's cinema experiences,

1037
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,640
 wouldn't it, in their use?

1038
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,720
 - There's a cinema that's reopened in Leeds recently

1039
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,160
 called the Hyde Park Picture House,

1040
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,360
 and they are gas lamp lit,

1041
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,320
 and they basically were saying that the reason

1042
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,720
 that there were gas lamps in there

1043
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,280
 was to stop the groping,

1044
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
 not necessarily hanky-panky,

1045
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,640
 but actually attacking women in the dark

1046
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,800
 sitting in the cinema.

1047
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,160
 And so as they were restoring it,

1048
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,760
 they've been putting up photos online

1049
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,240
 of all the things that they're finding,

1050
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,040
 like sort of under the floorboards

1051
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,880
 and the seats and stuff,

1052
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,040
 and one thing they're finding is giant hatpins.

1053
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,720
 And this used to be a suffragette thing,

1054
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
 where it's suffins. - Hatpins.

1055
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,960
 - Yeah, you would have,

1056
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
 they had to legislate the length of hatpins

1057
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,320
 because they were being used as weapons,

1058
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,520
 but in the cinemas, women would bring hatpins with them

1059
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,720
 because guys would come and letch onto them,

1060
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,560
 and no one could see it,

1061
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,000
 and they would start poking them

1062
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,320
 with the old hatpin. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,280
 - Nice.

1064
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,400
 - 'Cause it was a thing that you had on you anyway,

1065
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,520
 like you could say,

1066
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,840
 "Oh no, this hatpin, it's not for stabbing people,

1067
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,440
 it's for keeping my hat on."

1068
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,920
 - But if you're a pervert,

1069
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,680
 and the woman you were perving on tap fell off,

1070
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,760
 you knew you were in trouble.

1071
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,120
 (laughing)

1072
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
 Get out of there, it's my advice.

1073
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,680
 - It's really cool.

1074
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,720
 If we ever get back to Leeds for a live show or whatever,

1075
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,480
 you know, the cinema's back open.

1076
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,120
 It's the only gas-lit cinema in the world now.

1077
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,040
 It's pretty cool. - Wow.

1078
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,920
 - One of the things about the darkness in cinemas

1079
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,920
 is that you know how if you go to the theater,

1080
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,760
 or the opera, or you know, whatever, it's dark.

1081
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,080
 Well, that wasn't always the case either.

1082
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,200
 And it mostly came through Gustav Mahler,

1083
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,480
 who decided everything should be dark,

1084
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,720
 and he was probably inspired by the cinemas.

1085
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,600
 So I think it seems that in the early 20th century,

1086
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,520
 he insisted on dimming the auditorium.

1087
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,880
 And actually, when he did so,

1088
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,080
 the audience were protesting,

1089
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,760
 because if you go to the opera in Vienna,

1090
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,800
 in the early 20th century,

1091
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
 you're wearing all your best clothes,

1092
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,480
 you want everyone to see you.

1093
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,720
 - Oh, yeah, you didn't go to see the opera.

1094
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,320
 You went to see your rivals, didn't you?

1095
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,160
 - Exactly.

1096
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,000
 - And the box over the other side of the audience.

1097
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,560
 - Well, you didn't want it to be dark,

1098
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,480
 and you have to concentrate on the opera.

1099
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,040
 'Cause as we all know, opera is incredibly dull.

1100
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,680
 (laughing)

1101
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,360
 - It's literally just a filler to go and make people stress.

1102
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,200
 - Yeah, that's great.

1103
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,040
 I didn't really like it.

1104
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,720
 I'd love to have visited back then

1105
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,040
 just to watch the social situation.

1106
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,880
 I didn't realize it was literally social gazing, basically.

1107
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,720
 - Oh, people went like that.

1108
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,800
 - Every night of the season,

1109
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
 and they were not concentrating on the play

1110
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
 beyond night one.

1111
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1112
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,040
 - Wow.

1113
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,840
 - There's a thing now where there's a lot of controversy

1114
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,320
 about when the lights should come back up

1115
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,680
 in a cinema at the end of the movie.

1116
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,960
 - Well, I think it's useful, right?

1117
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,280
 Because if the lights haven't come up

1118
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,000
 and the credits are starting,

1119
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,880
 that's probably 'cause there's an end Marvel thing

1120
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,720
 at the end, right?

1121
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,560
 - Yeah.

1122
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,400
 - That's usually what happens.

1123
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,200
 - Do they do like a little scene at the end?

1124
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,760
 - Yeah, like all the Marvel movies

1125
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,480
 would have a little scene at the very end.

1126
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,760
 - And there's never ever a horse to Marvel movie,

1127
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,600
 and I respect that.

1128
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,440
 It's like that.

1129
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,840
 - But they wouldn't put the lights up,

1130
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,440
 so you kind of knew that was coming.

1131
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
 - Right.

1132
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
 - That's very clever.

1133
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,960
 - So what's this red-hot debate

1134
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,800
 about when the lights go on?

1135
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,640
 - What the red-hot debate is,

1136
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,920
 it's a health and safety thing, right?

1137
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,720
 Most people, when the credits start rolling,

1138
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,440
 want to get out of the cinema as quick as possible.

1139
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,680
 Maybe they need to be somewhere.

1140
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,520
 If you're in--

1141
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,720
 - Just hate seeing the names of people who've worked.

1142
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,200
 I think it's just not like, "For fuck's sake, guys,

1143
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
 you've done the job.

1144
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
 I don't need to know about who's the best boy."

1145
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,120
 - Oh, it's the bragging.

1146
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,160
 - So they want to get out of there.

1147
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,000
 That can be very dangerous.

1148
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
 They can fall over, trip hazards, all that sort of stuff.

1149
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,320
 The issue is modern cinema uses its credit sequence now

1150
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,280
 as part of the film.

1151
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,520
 So there's one film where basically the final scene

1152
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,240
 is happening as the credits are rolling.

1153
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,320
 But you don't have the old-day projectionists

1154
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,480
 in most cinemas these days.

1155
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,680
 Let's say in modern cinema,

1156
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,200
 they get a hard drive,

1157
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
 and it has stamped throughout the hard drive.

1158
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,560
 This is when the credits arrive,

1159
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,840
 so they'll pre-program the lights to come up.

1160
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,960
 So a lot of people are missing the end of movies

1161
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,600
 in terms of the Atmos because lights are coming up.

1162
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,320
 And so, yeah, it's a raging debate.

1163
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,720
 - How many films are running their credits

1164
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,560
 over the final scene?

1165
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,120
 That feels very avant-garde to me.

1166
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,160
 Dan, have you ever been,

1167
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,560
 I ask you this 'cause you're Australian.

1168
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,840
 Have you ever been to Broome?

1169
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,960
 - No, haven't actually, no.

1170
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,520
 - 'Cause it's a very long way away from the rest of Australia.

1171
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,200
 It's in the Northwest,

1172
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,800
 and it's got a cinema called Sun Pictures.

1173
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,880
 And it's one of the first,

1174
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
 it's a very early cinema.

1175
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,120
 I don't know if it's Australia's first,

1176
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,240
 but it's very old, 1916.

1177
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,760
 It was, I just like it so much

1178
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,560
 'cause every night, the cinema at Broome was flooded

1179
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,640
 by the tide, it was on the coast,

1180
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,440
 and there was tidal flooding.

1181
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,560
 And most nights, the street would be submerged.

1182
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,480
 And apparently some old-timers who remembered it

1183
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,440
 back in the early days said you would be able to catch a fish

1184
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,640
 during the screening around, under your feet.

1185
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,480
 - That's so good.

1186
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,320
 - Yeah.

1187
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,560
 - Great if you're watching Titanic or something.

1188
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,880
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1189
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,200
 - It was more fun when projectionists

1190
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,760
 had a bit more control on the day, wasn't it?

1191
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,600
 'Cause people, you almost had a relationship

1192
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
 with your projectionists.

1193
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,640
 And actually, even,

1194
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,680
 I think momentarily when you're in the cinema,

1195
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,520
 you could say, you know,

1196
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,920
 put the music on louder in Nickelodeons or whatever.

1197
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
 - Oh, yeah.

1198
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,400
 - Or in 1939, a newspaper in Newcastle reported

1199
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,360
 on a really exciting innovation that it said

1200
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,440
 is gonna take off in cinemas,

1201
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,920
 where in musical films, of which there were quite a lot,

1202
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,880
 I kinda like singing in the rain or whatever,

1203
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
 after one of the good songs,

1204
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,900
 they'd bring the lights down to black,

1205
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,160
 and then that was the cue for the audience to shout encore,

1206
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,640
 and if they shouted encore long enough,

1207
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,800
 then you rewound the song and you played it again.

1208
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,640
 - That's great.

1209
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,800
 - Oh, that is good.

1210
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,640
 - That's really good.

1211
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,560
 - Could you say, I didn't quite, who's this?

1212
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,880
 Can you play that better again?

1213
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,120
 Is she married to him?

1214
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,980
 - Yeah, we've been incredibly annoying

1215
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,520
 watching it with a granny or a child or me.

1216
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,600
 - You mentioned Nickelodeons.

1217
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,920
 So that was in America, right?

1218
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,100
 And it was, you paid a nickel to get in,

1219
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,400
 and it was like usually the shop or something like that,

1220
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,840
 and they would pull all the blinds down,

1221
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,880
 make it really, really dark,

1222
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,680
 and you'd be able to watch one of these old movies.

1223
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,520
 And obviously very dark, and it was very cheap,

1224
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,720
 so they attracted the poorer classes,

1225
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,360
 and so it was worried by higher class people

1226
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,880
 that they'd get pickpocketed or whatever

1227
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,120
 as soon as they went in.

1228
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,040
 So again, the darkness was thought to be a problem.

1229
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,360
 But in the UK, we had our own version of the Nickelodeons,

1230
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,080
 and they were called Pennygaffs.

1231
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,260
 And obviously the difference being that in the UK,

1232
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,620
 there were one penny to go in,

1233
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
 whereas in America it was a nickel.

1234
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,020
 But the problem was a nickel was worth 2.5 pennies.

1235
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,660
 And so the people who were making the Pennygaffs

1236
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,460
 were making two and a half times less

1237
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,460
 than the Nickelodeon people.

1238
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,380
 - They just did it for the catchy title.

1239
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,660
 Call them Topnygaffs.

1240
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
 - I guess it was like the smallest,

1241
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,140
 although they didn't have pennies in America, didn't they?

1242
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,700
 So they could have done pennies as well.

1243
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,780
 But yeah, it was just, I suppose they thought

1244
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,800
 that it was the only price they could charge.

1245
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,480
 But there was a worry at the time.

1246
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,160
 I read some newspaper articles saying

1247
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,440
 that young children were robbing from their parents

1248
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,880
 so they'd be able to attend the Pennygaffs.

1249
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,040
 - Always, always social worries.

1250
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,360
 Any new technology, it's so interesting.

1251
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,300
 Just how is this going to ruin the youth?

1252
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,520
 - And the other thing that they did is

1253
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,560
 'cause these Pennygaffs were in shops.

1254
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,920
 So it was a normal shop and they'd be like,

1255
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,560
 "Okay, we'll put a load of chairs up.

1256
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,800
 We'll charge people a penny to come in."

1257
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,620
 But there was, people tried to shut them down.

1258
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,220
 And one way they did it was saying

1259
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,500
 you don't have a music hall license.

1260
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,900
 'Cause there was no cinema licenses

1261
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,420
 'cause cinemas didn't exist.

1262
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,100
 And so loads of them would play the movies

1263
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,800
 in complete silence.

1264
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,900
 And so you would go in, it was completely dark

1265
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,160
 and it was completely silent.

1266
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,560
 You'd be watching the moving pictures,

1267
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,800
 but there'd be no music.

1268
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,840
 - And that 'cause usually you'd have a piano or something,

1269
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,680
 wouldn't you? - Yeah.

1270
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,520
 - You'd be played live along with it.

1271
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,620
 - Exactly, but they couldn't do that

1272
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,380
 because if they did, they'd get closed down

1273
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,700
 for being a musical.

1274
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,800
 - To be fair, I think that's fine.

1275
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,300
 I mean, most of you are watching a silent film,

1276
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,200
 you're not watching it for the piano music, are you?

1277
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,840
 - Oh, no, the lot of music was composed specifically

1278
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,160
 for the reels, so they'd be handed the sweet music.

1279
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,000
 - Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1280
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,840
 - Ambience matters.

1281
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,480
 - Well, I don't think it matters as much as

1282
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,180
 with a film with dialogue, for instance,

1283
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,360
 where you wouldn't know what was happening.

1284
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,340
 If you're watching a silent film,

1285
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,560
 you still know what's happening.

1286
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,800
 - I would like more ambience in my movies, you know.

1287
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,680
 Do you think Star Wars, which has dialogue,

1288
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,440
 would be as good without the score?

1289
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,840
 The less experiment.

1290
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,680
 - So you should try that.

1291
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,920
 - Completely music-free or Indiana Jones or whatever.

1292
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,760
 - Also, I need something to drown out James going,

1293
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,600
 "Who's that?"

1294
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,420
 (all laughing)

1295
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,740
 - When did they marry?

1296
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,320
 (upbeat music)

1297
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,900
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1298
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,040
 and that is my fact.

1299
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,060
 My fact this week is that one of the oldest diving clubs

1300
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,660
 in Ireland is the Muff Diving Club.

1301
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,500
 - And?

1302
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,340
 What's so funny about that?

1303
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,340
 - Nothing, it's interesting because it's how old it is.

1304
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,600
 It's one of the oldest.

1305
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,920
 - How old is it?

1306
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,560
 - We're talking a good like three decades.

1307
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,400
 - Wow.

1308
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,240
 - Oh my God.

1309
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,400
 - Yeah, no, this is the Muff Diving Club.

1310
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,960
 Yeah, it was just set up by a group of guys

1311
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,720
 who obviously spotted a good gag and they wanted to do it.

1312
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
 And they've not only been pushing for it

1313
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,160
 to be an old, long-lasting diving club,

1314
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,760
 but they want it to be the largest,

1315
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,760
 the biggest membership of any diving club in the world.

1316
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,680
 And so you go to their site, you can buy t-shirts,

1317
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,880
 you can buy, you can get a membership card.

1318
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,720
 - There's a lot more t-shirts selling

1319
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,680
 than actual diving in this club, I think.

1320
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,800
 - I'm finding it so hard when I'm looking into it

1321
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,960
 and I still haven't got to the bottom of it

1322
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,640
 if any diving happens at all.

1323
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,960
 - What is a diving club?

1324
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,800
 What is a diving club?

1325
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,640
 - What do you get?

1326
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
 Diving instructors teach how to dive and scuba diving.

1327
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,480
 - Yeah.

1328
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,800
 - Oh, I thought it was high diving.

1329
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,080
 - Did you not even see the logo, did you research this?

1330
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,680
 - I did not follow the link you said.

1331
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,040
 I've tried, but I've got a child look on my computer.

1332
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,040
 - How interesting.

1333
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,960
 I mean, you could have a high diving club as well.

1334
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,040
 People who like to high dive might get together

1335
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,360
 and practice together.

1336
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,320
 - But if all your facts are about high diving,

1337
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,280
 then you are going to be lost for the next half an hour.

1338
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,520
 - I've gone purely Muff, actually, and Muff Directional.

1339
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,360
 - Well, me too.

1340
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,000
 I went to the Irish version of companies house

1341
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,680
 to see how many other Muff companies there are in Ireland.

1342
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,000
 Muff Engineering, Muff Service Station,

1343
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,560
 Muff Soap, Muff Direct.

1344
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,800
 - Muff Direct.

1345
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,120
 Is this all in Muff?

1346
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,880
 - These are all real, they're all in Muff.

1347
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,440
 Muff after school, and--

1348
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,680
 (laughing)

1349
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,600
 - I didn't know, you can't let other parents

1350
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,440
 send your kids to that.

1351
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,080
 - It's just like an after school place where kids go to,

1352
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,960
 like, while the parents are still working,

1353
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,280
 and the Muff Liquor Company.

1354
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,240
 - No.

1355
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,440
 - The Muff Liquor Company, this is really interesting.

1356
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,080
 I went on their website,

1357
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,040
 and it doesn't seem to be a joke at all.

1358
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,280
 In fact, if you go on their website,

1359
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,640
 it looks like they haven't realized

1360
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,680
 that Muff Liquor could be quite rude,

1361
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,640
 because it's a proper, like, it's a vodka company,

1362
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,880
 and they've got a history of this guy,

1363
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,120
 the grandfather of the owner who started it

1364
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,480
 all these years ago, and it's a--

1365
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,920
 - So there's no sort of sly wink at the fact

1366
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,240
 that this is an amusing phrase,

1367
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,440
 like that salad company called Tost.

1368
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,600
 - No, unless I've completely missed it.

1369
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,920
 - I think they've just gone deadpan.

1370
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,760
 - No, I think you're right.

1371
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,920
 I think it's just, we're in Muff, we make a liquor,

1372
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,760
 let's put it out.

1373
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,600
 - Well, fair enough.

1374
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,040
 - They do know, but they've gone, we're above that.

1375
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,960
 These fucking Muff Divers next door,

1376
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,240
 we don't need to stoop to that level.

1377
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
 We'll put it out there, we'll let people chuckle

1378
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,560
 to themselves, and we'll sell them some vodka.

1379
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,040
 No t-shirt necessary.

1380
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,120
 - I was reading an interview where a lady called Caitlyn

1381
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,160
 was over in Australia, and she was on a TV show,

1382
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,800
 like a Family Fortunes kind of thing,

1383
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,560
 and she was from Muff, like, you know,

1384
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,560
 it's not got a big population Muff, but she was from there,

1385
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,000
 and the guy couldn't believe that she was from there,

1386
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,760
 and she said she went to a school that was called Holly Bush,

1387
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,680
 so that was a nice, another connection,

1388
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,880
 and she says that when you come, when you're driving in,

1389
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,200
 that there is a sign that says you are now entering Muff,

1390
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,440
 and I've not seen that online, I've been looking--

1391
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,680
 - Seems plausible.

1392
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,600
 - It does seem plausible.

1393
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,080
 You can say, you see welcome to Muff,

1394
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,960
 but I haven't seen you are now entering Muff.

1395
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,320
 - House prices are struggling in Muff.

1396
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,080
 - Oh yeah. - Yeah, apparently,

1397
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,840
 the prices are lower than you might imagine.

1398
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,960
 - I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop on this joke.

1399
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,360
 I can't tell what it is. - It's not joke, it's not joke.

1400
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,560
 Well, it's for a slightly different reason you might think,

1401
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,880
 so you would find, like, people who live on shit house,

1402
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,080
 laying or whatever, they're always complaining,

1403
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,120
 and the newspapers are like, "I can't sell my house,"

1404
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,240
 or whatever. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1405
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,600
 - But in actual fact, the reason that they can't

1406
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,960
 sell them very well is because they're on the border

1407
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,960
 between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,

1408
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,920
 and Brexit has meant that the bottom

1409
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,280
 has dropped out of the Muff market.

1410
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,040
 - There we go, there we go.

1411
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,480
 I knew, I knew something was coming.

1412
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,640
 - Was it worth it?

1413
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,280
 - It was worth it. - It was mortgage news

1414
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,720
 from Muff. - I was not a written joke.

1415
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,480
 (laughing)

1416
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,080
 - You were on the phone to a local estate agent.

1417
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,440
 - So if I say this, am I technically right?

1418
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,240
 (laughing)

1419
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,760
 - Do you want to buy the house or not, it's dark in here.

1420
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,400
 (laughing)

1421
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,600
 - Oh dear, shall we talk about muffs themselves?

1422
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,200
 - Yeah, let's do wet muffs. - Actual fur muffs

1423
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,680
 that people would wear, hand muffs, as it were,

1424
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,600
 how you keep your hands warm.

1425
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,560
 They used to be completely gender-neutral.

1426
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,880
 Men and women alike would wear muffs,

1427
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,200
 it was just a thing, 'cause it was really cold,

1428
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,960
 it used to be a lot colder.

1429
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,840
 (laughing)

1430
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,640
 - What, what, what, big guys?

1431
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,320
 - It used to be a big colder, but also they were more common.

1432
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,520
 - In the 16th century, people did not have

1433
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,800
 well insulated homes, and clothes were,

1434
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,960
 you didn't have lovely puffer jackets.

1435
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,680
 People needed to keep warm, wearing fur muffs

1436
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,000
 to cover your hands, really useful.

1437
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,240
 - Furry muff. - Furry muff.

1438
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,720
 (laughing)

1439
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,160
 And I think it came from muffulai,

1440
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,880
 which is a medieval Latin term,

1441
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,000
 which describes these big leather winter mitts

1442
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,600
 that you'd wear in muffulai.

1443
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,240
 And there was a great article all about

1444
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,960
 the history of the word muff,

1445
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,200
 on the Oxford University Press website,

1446
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,160
 by Anatoly Lieberman.

1447
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,000
 And it's all these different words come from muff,

1448
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,680
 so Danish moth means clown,

1449
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,600
 and Dickens uses muff to mean something,

1450
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,640
 like an annoying person or a fool or whatever.

1451
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,680
 German has muffeln, which means sulk,

1452
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,440
 miff, might come from muff.

1453
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,520
 - Miff, miff. - I'm feeling a bit miffed.

1454
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,840
 - Oh, miffed, right.

1455
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,480
 - You might really be actually muffed.

1456
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,040
 - We say muff, we use muff in American football,

1457
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,880
 it's a term. - Do you?

1458
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,400
 Oh, you've muffed it?

1459
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,120
 - Yeah, that's what it means basically.

1460
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,680
 As in someone kicks the ball to you,

1461
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,400
 and you try and catch it, and you don't quite catch it,

1462
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,520
 but the ball's still in place,

1463
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,280
 so someone else can get it, that's a muff.

1464
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,280
 - Oh yeah, that's quite a technical term.

1465
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,520
 'Cause I would say, yeah, you've muffed it to mean sort of,

1466
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,800
 oh, you just messed it up.

1467
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,880
 - You do say that, and I actually checked

1468
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,320
 all my WhatsApp messages,

1469
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,040
 and you're the only person who's ever

1470
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,360
 WhatsApp'd me the word muff.

1471
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,200
 - No. - Really?

1472
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,920
 - Yes. - And to mean muffed it up?

1473
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1474
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,680
 - Oh, that is interesting.

1475
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,800
 I'm gonna search my WhatsApp.

1476
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,240
 - Well, no, not now.

1477
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,800
 - Oh, okay, yeah, I'll do it later.

1478
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,600
 - Yeah, so be it.

1479
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,440
 - For a work.

1480
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,120
 (laughing)

1481
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,600
 - But muff is also slang for a woman's vulva.

1482
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,440
 - No.

1483
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,280
 - What?

1484
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,120
 (laughing)

1485
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,960
 - No.

1486
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,800
 - I know, it's so weird.

1487
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,640
 - What? - Yeah.

1488
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,800
 - Wait a minute, so what about the muff diving club?

1489
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,560
 That would be- - So I think that could be,

1490
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,480
 that should be a euphemism.

1491
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,800
 - It sounds like Cunningling Dist, doesn't it?

1492
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,840
 - What about the thing that James said

1493
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,760
 about the bottom dropping out of the muff market?

1494
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,480
 (laughing)

1495
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,920
 - That's even funnier than it was originally.

1496
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,760
 (laughing)

1497
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,600
 - I thought it was just funny

1498
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,440
 'cause James said the word bottom,

1499
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,280
 which is a bit funny.

1500
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,080
 (laughing)

1501
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,160
 - No, it's actually true.

1502
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,440
 But also it's been- (laughing)

1503
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,760
 But it has been slang for that for so long.

1504
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,800
 I like how quickly we turn this into slang.

1505
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,440
 So it started meaning a hand warmer in the 1590s.

1506
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,800
 And by the 1690s, it meant a woman's pubic area.

1507
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,360
 Because I suppose you carried it down there,

1508
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,160
 it's big hairy things around your crotch.

1509
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,120
 So of course.

1510
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,960
 - It's 100 years.

1511
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,600
 That's a long time for it to make the leap.

1512
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,920
 - Well, it's first written down there.

1513
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,920
 - Yeah, I bet they've been saying it for decades.

1514
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,760
 - Yeah, you can get muff warmers.

1515
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,040
 - Is that to warm your muff or?

1516
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,880
 - Yeah.

1517
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,200
 - I thought muff was a warmer.

1518
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,040
 - That's to warm you.

1519
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,800
 - Yes, but the muff warmers warm the muff.

1520
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,640
 - I think you put your hand in the mouth.

1521
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,960
 - But who warms the muff warmers?

1522
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,160
 (laughing)

1523
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,760
 - They were little ceramic things

1524
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,360
 that you would fill up with hot water.

1525
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,200
 And I imagine actually that you'd leave them in the muff.

1526
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,400
 - Yeah, you would.

1527
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,840
 - And then when you're going out.

1528
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,680
 - That's clever.

1529
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,520
 - You warm the muff up.

1530
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,840
 Maybe you're going out on an hour.

1531
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,720
 You say, well, pop the muff warmer in the muff.

1532
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,960
 Then you come to go out.

1533
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
 You just get your muff as lovely and warm.

1534
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,720
 - Andy. - Yeah.

1535
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,060
 - Idea.

1536
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,720
 Have you got any money to invest?

1537
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,560
 - Yeah.

1538
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,400
 - Good.

1539
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,280
 Okay, so a mannequin.

1540
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,120
 - Yeah.

1541
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,000
 - But it's heated and you put your coat on the mannequin.

1542
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,240
 And then when you go out,

1543
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,840
 you can take a nice warm coat and put it on.

1544
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,680
 - Oh, yes.

1545
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,760
 - Ring the dragons.

1546
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,600
 (laughing)

1547
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,640
 - Ring the dragons.

1548
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,480
 - That's great.

1549
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,800
 - Or if you're really wealthy,

1550
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,120
 you just have a human coat warmer.

1551
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,280
 Someone who wears your coat for half an hour.

1552
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,120
 - Yeah.

1553
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,940
 - Before you go out.

1554
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:21,780
 - I see that.

1555
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,620
 - Oh, yeah.

1556
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,240
 - Mine is just a one-off purchase

1557
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,400
 whereas yours is more of a subscription one.

1558
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,240
 (laughing)

1559
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,080
 - Very much so, yes.

1560
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,920
 - Yeah, I do see that.

1561
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,120
 - I mean, when you get into bed,

1562
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,040
 it might be nice to,

1563
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,080
 I mean, a warmer bed is not,

1564
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,440
 I know you two are weird as you like cold beds,

1565
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,840
 but I like getting into a bed that's slightly warm

1566
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,200
 on a winter's night.

1567
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,040
 - Yeah.

1568
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,120
 - Do you do like they used to do on the grand tour

1569
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,240
 where they would put a live pig in their bed

1570
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,000
 before they went to bed to warm it up

1571
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,280
 and to get rid of bed bugs?

1572
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,400
 - Is that a real thing?

1573
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,240
 - Yeah, that's what they used to do.

1574
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,080
 - On the grand tour.

1575
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,280
 You saw the Clarkson show.

1576
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,960
 (laughing)

1577
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,020
 - Wait, what were you talking about?

1578
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,360
 That's what I thought you were talking about.

1579
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,400
 - I was talking about when would it have been

1580
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,080
 in the 18th century when you would go around Europe.

1581
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

1582
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,360
 - Have you heard of Muff Boutiques?

1583
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,400
 This is great.

1584
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,240
 - Uh-huh.

1585
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,060
 - Okay.

1586
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,080
 - Okay, not a company in Muff.

1587
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,080
 - No.

1588
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,920
 This was a thing.

1589
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,120
 It's from a book by a 19th century dandy

1590
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,800
 called Octave Ouzanne

1591
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,640
 and he was an admirer of ladies' accessories

1592
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,080
 and he wrote a book which was called

1593
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,600
 L'Hombre Legante Le Morgant

1594
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,560
 which means the parasol, the glove, the muff.

1595
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,960
 And he said that in Renaissance Italy,

1596
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,200
 there were Muff Boutiques

1597
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,040
 where you could either go in and buy a Muff

1598
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,680
 or in the off season when it gets nice and warm,

1599
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,880
 you don't need your Muff anymore,

1600
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,800
 you go and you store it in the Muff Boutique

1601
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,080
 and they delouse them.

1602
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,400
 I mean, if true, that's very funny.

1603
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,360
 - It's a brilliant book that, isn't it?

1604
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,200
 - It does sound great.

1605
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,120
 I've only read second hand about it.

1606
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,480
 - There was a, it's actually quite,

1607
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,680
 it's all available online and it's quite short.

1608
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,880
 So I did read it and yeah,

1609
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,160
 there's the Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff

1610
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,600
 and it was published by this guy

1611
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,080
 in response to the previous year's

1612
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,040
 incredibly successful The Fan

1613
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,480
 which was his history of The Fan.

1614
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,320
 - Oh, that was great.

1615
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,600
 Yeah, yeah, I know that book.

1616
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,440
 - Really?

1617
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,560
 Published in 1881.

1618
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,480
 Were you there for the first?

1619
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,640
 - No, I know a modern one.

1620
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,360
 Someone wrote a whole book about.

1621
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,200
 (all laughing)

1622
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,040
 - No, it's great.

1623
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,280
 The Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff.

1624
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,160
 And he tells, my favorite story from it was,

1625
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,600
 he says there's an account in the late 1500s

1626
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,480
 of towers being besieged

1627
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,200
 and at the front line of defenders

1628
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,040
 who are defending themselves from the siege

1629
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,720
 is a woman with muffs and a halberd in hand,

1630
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,200
 a halberd being a sort of poke sticky thing.

1631
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,040
 - Spear.

1632
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
 - Spear, thank you.

1633
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,720
 (all laughing)

1634
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,520
 A woman with a muff defending the city.

1635
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,640
 - Why?

1636
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,560
 For a reason.

1637
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,400
 - Keeping her hands.

1638
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,880
 - Keeping her hands warm while,

1639
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,880
 'cause you gotta be quite dexterous

1640
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,200
 to operate a spear, I suppose.

1641
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,040
 - Absolutely.

1642
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,800
 - You can't prod a haldane with cold hands.

1643
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,640
 Can you?

1644
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1645
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,320
 - Very difficult, yeah.

1646
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,800
 - There were muff chains

1647
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,200
 which were to hang your muff, I think,

1648
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,320
 when you're not using it.

1649
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,160
 Your hands out of your muff,

1650
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,800
 you just put it on your muff chain around your neck.

1651
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,640
 - Oh, right.

1652
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,480
 - Oh, right.

1653
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,320
 - Muff pistols.

1654
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,140
 - Okay.

1655
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,980
 - I don't think--

1656
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,800
 - To shoot your muff.

1657
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,640
 - To shoot from your muff

1658
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,760
 if you're approached by footpads.

1659
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,600
 - Oh, I see.

1660
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,960
 They weren't like the sex pistols.

1661
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,800
 (all laughing)

1662
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,760
 It was like a female sex pistols.

1663
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,520
 (all laughing)

1664
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,160
 - No, that was just a tiny gun for ladies

1665
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,800
 to protect yourself if you were out and about

1666
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,320
 and someone approaches you to rob you.

1667
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,160
 - One place in Ireland

1668
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,680
 that would have used the muff divers,

1669
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,040
 I think, quite usefully,

1670
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,120
 is a town where the first transatlantic telegraph cable

1671
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,880
 was laid in the 1880s.

1672
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,720
 - Oh, yeah.

1673
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,520
 - So that was there, that was in Ireland.

1674
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,200
 It was a little place called Spunkane.

1675
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,520
 - Mm-hmm, yeah.

1676
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,000
 - That's where the first transatlantic cable was laid.

1677
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,840
 - Spunkane.

1678
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,680
 - Spunkane.

1679
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,520
 - Sounds great.

1680
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,880
 - Okay, here's another fact.

1681
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,360
 The word spunk also can mean ejaculate.

1682
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,200
 - No.

1683
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,040
 - What?

1684
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,800
 - But that's a really funny name

1685
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,480
 for a place to start the cable.

1686
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,560
 - I thought it was just like a good-looking dude,

1687
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,440
 you know, spunky, you know?

1688
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,640
 That's disgusting now.

1689
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,400
 - Spunkane, and the town of Muff,

1690
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,040
 where the original fact was,

1691
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,440
 is where Amelia Earhart landed

1692
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,440
 when she did her first solo flight.

1693
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,280
 - Cool.

1694
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
 - Not our last one.

1695
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,000
 - No, unfortunately, we don't know exactly

1696
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,720
 where she landed that time.

1697
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,320
 But her first one, she landed

1698
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,200
 just outside the village of Muff.

1699
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,520
 - Oh, wow.

1700
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,480
 - The man who composed the theme music for Gladiators

1701
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,080
 is called Muff Murphy.

1702
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,920
 (all laughing)

1703
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,360
 - Gladiators of the TV show.

1704
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,200
 - Yeah.

1705
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,040
 - Ah.

1706
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,880
 - That's a good name.

1707
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
 - Muff Murphy, yeah, Muff is a name.

1708
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,960
 It's a man's name.

1709
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,800
 - Muff, I don't know any Muffs.

1710
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,040
 - Or maybe it's a Nick name as well.

1711
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,400
 - Yeah, I don't know any Muffs.

1712
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,280
 - I'm not familiar with the name Muff.

1713
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,720
 - The brother of Spencer Davis,

1714
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,000
 who obviously founded the Spencer Davis group.

1715
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,840
 - Obviously.

1716
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,680
 - Obviously.

1717
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,520
 - It's called Muff.

1718
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,360
 - Really?

1719
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,360
 - You know the Spencer Davis group?

1720
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,360
 Gimme some lovin'.

1721
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,200
 - Is that band?

1722
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,040
 - Oh, it's a band.

1723
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,880
 - Yeah, it's a band.

1724
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,000
 - Gimme some lovin', that one.

1725
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1726
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,800
 - Oh, hang on, is that, I've always thought it was

1727
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,200
 give me summer loving.

1728
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,040
 - No.

1729
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,560
 - I have thought it was give me some Muffin.

1730
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,280
 (all laughing)

1731
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,720
 - James has inserted a Muffin there.

1732
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,000
 Anna has thought it was a haiku.

1733
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,840
 It has to be a summer reference.

1734
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,720
 (all laughing)

1735
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,300
 (upbeat music)

1736
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,520
 - Okay, that's it.

1737
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,480
 That is all of our facts.

1738
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,680
