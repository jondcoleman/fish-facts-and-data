00:00:00,00:00:04,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:04,00:00:07,"Before we get going, we have a very exciting announcement."
00:00:07,00:00:09,Anna?
00:00:09,00:00:09,"- Thanks, Dan."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"Our announcement is that our esteemed colleague,"
00:00:12,00:00:17,"Andrew Hunter Murray, famous podcaster, comedian galore."
00:00:17,00:00:18,Does one say that?
00:00:18,00:00:19,He's also a published author.
00:00:19,00:00:21,"I'm sure you've read his first two novels,"
00:00:21,00:00:23,which were brilliant thrillers.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"He's written a third, which is so much fun so far."
00:00:26,00:00:28,"I'm only about a quarter of the way through,"
00:00:28,00:00:31,"because look, he didn't send me the proof on time,"
00:00:31,00:00:32,but it is fantastic.
00:00:32,00:00:36,It's called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering.
00:00:36,00:00:37,It's really fun.
00:00:37,00:00:38,It's got elements of comedy.
00:00:38,00:00:40,It's got elements of thriller in it so far.
00:00:40,00:00:42,I really love the main character
00:00:42,00:00:42,'cause he's doing something
00:00:42,00:00:45,that I can really imagine myself doing in life.
00:00:45,00:00:47,Don't just believe us.
00:00:47,00:00:49,"It's been complemented by The Guardian,"
00:00:49,00:00:51,"which says it has a propulsive plot,"
00:00:51,00:00:54,"an ingenious narrator and lashings of intrigue,"
00:00:54,00:00:57,making it a genuine and thoroughly enjoyable page turner.
00:00:57,00:00:59,"The Sunday Times has called it hugely entertaining,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,laugh out loud funny and impossible to put down.
00:01:02,00:01:03,"Dan Shriver, what do you say?"
00:01:03,00:01:06,"- Well, I actually am a third of the way through the book."
00:01:06,00:01:07,"And I can say-- - All right,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,and I need to break? - It absolutely gets better
00:01:09,00:01:10,after the first quarter.
00:01:10,00:01:13,So if you want your books great in the first quarter
00:01:13,00:01:16,"and then accelerating to an even better place,"
00:01:16,00:01:19,you gotta get a beginner's guide to breaking and entering.
00:01:19,00:01:21,It is the story of a guy who breaks
00:01:21,00:01:23,into the second homes of the wealthy.
00:01:23,00:01:24,He lives in them.
00:01:24,00:01:25,They don't know it.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"He steals nothing, but one day,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,after he accidentally bumps into a group of people
00:01:29,00:01:31,"who also do the same thing, they witness a murder"
00:01:31,00:01:34,and they get embroiled in a thing that they can't escape.
00:01:34,00:01:35,And it's one of those comedy capers
00:01:35,00:01:38,that just gets further and further into the chaos of it.
00:01:38,00:01:40,If you've read Richard Osman's
00:01:40,00:01:41,"The Thursday Murder Club series,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,this is the perfect accompaniment to it.
00:01:43,00:01:46,"It's comedy, it's thriller, page turner, you're gonna love it."
00:01:46,00:01:49,- So go to your local bookshop or any online bookseller
00:01:49,00:01:51,"or Amazon, look up a beginner's guide"
00:01:51,00:01:54,to breaking and entering by Andrew Hunter Murray now.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"- Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:56,00:01:57,- On with the show.
00:01:57,00:01:59,(upbeat music)
00:01:59,00:02:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:15,00:02:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:19,00:02:21,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:21,00:02:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:02:26,00:02:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:28,00:02:31,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:31,00:02:34,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:34,00:02:37,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:02:37,00:02:40,"- Okay, my fact this week is that children's author,"
00:02:40,00:02:43,"Margaret Wise Brown, died from doing"
00:02:43,00:02:46,an over-enthusiastic can-can kick.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"- I think now having read up on her,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,she would like that we laughed just then.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:02:52,00:02:53,- Definitely.
00:02:53,00:02:56,- So is there an under-enthusiastic can-can kick?
00:02:56,00:02:57,Is there such a thing as that?
00:02:57,00:02:58,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:02:58,00:03:00,I've been to the Moulin Rouge a few times
00:03:00,00:03:02,and asked for my money back.
00:03:02,00:03:04,Barely got above the knee.
00:03:04,00:03:06,- You've got your protractor out in the front row.
00:03:06,00:03:07,(laughing)
00:03:07,00:03:09,"- That was disgusting, I mean."
00:03:09,00:03:12,They really looked out at that.
00:03:12,00:03:15,So Margaret Wise Brown is most famous
00:03:15,00:03:18,for a children's book called Good Night Moon.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"She's written lots of others, but this is the biggie."
00:03:21,00:03:23,"What I liked about this is in this podcast,"
00:03:23,00:03:26,the number of times I've got a book out
00:03:26,00:03:27,because we've talked about that author
00:03:27,00:03:29,and I've got about 25% of the way through it
00:03:29,00:03:31,and never finished that one.
00:03:31,00:03:32,This is probably the first time
00:03:32,00:03:33,I've got through the whole book.
00:03:33,00:03:34,"- Oh, you finished it?"
00:03:34,00:03:34,- I managed to finish it.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"- All 140-ish words, right?"
00:03:36,00:03:37,(laughing)
00:03:37,00:03:39,- I thought you were going to say pages then.
00:03:39,00:03:40,"I was going to say, no, that wasn't the book I read."
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Yeah, it's a very short book."
00:03:41,00:03:44,"Actually, the first, maybe the first of those board books,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"you know, that you give to children,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,apparently it was the first of those.
00:03:48,00:03:51,But she unfortunately died in 1952.
00:03:51,00:03:55,She just had emergency surgery on either an ovarian cyst
00:03:55,00:03:58,"or an inflamed appendix, depending on what you read."
00:03:58,00:04:02,And she was ready to leave the hospital
00:04:02,00:04:03,"and be carried, as she said,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,in a sedentary by four of the village boys
00:04:06,00:04:09,"to a hilltop estate where she would convalesce,"
00:04:09,00:04:13,but to show the medical staff that she was in good health.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"She kicked up her leg, can-can style,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"and she had a blood clot, dislodged it, blacked out,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,and never died again.
00:04:20,00:04:22,"- According to what I read, died instantly."
00:04:22,00:04:23,- Yeah.
00:04:23,00:04:25,"- Like, can-can kicked and just out."
00:04:25,00:04:27,"It's sad, obviously, but that's how I would love to go."
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't."
00:04:29,00:04:30,(laughing)
00:04:30,00:04:31,"- It's a good way to go, I think,"
00:04:31,00:04:32,if you've got to go at that age.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"- Yeah, I mean, she was so young, she was 42."
00:04:34,00:04:37,"And she was, the other cool thing about this,"
00:04:37,00:04:40,"she was on her way to meet, I think, her lover,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,"one of the junior rocker-fellas,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,who was going to pick her up in a boat
00:04:43,00:04:45,and sail away to Tunisia with her.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"- Yeah, he was on his way, on the boat."
00:04:47,00:04:48,- Yeah.
00:04:48,00:04:49,- So sad.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"- I think that was maybe the saddest thing,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,"is that she'd had a very unlucky love life,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"and she'd met this guy sort of the year before, I think,"
00:04:56,00:04:59,and I was reading a bit of a biography of her
00:04:59,00:05:01,"that he wrote many, many years later,"
00:05:01,00:05:04,"and he was so, obviously, so in love with her,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,and she had finally found the love of her life.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"And then, yeah, bam, he was nicknamed Pebble,"
00:05:09,00:05:13,"but it was a still, James Stillman, rocker-fella junior,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"and he was junior, he was 24."
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- Yeah. - Oh, wow."
00:05:16,00:05:17,- Toy boy.
00:05:17,00:05:19,- He later married a descendant of the Carnegie's.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"So it's a real powerhouse couple of that,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,the rocker-fellas and the Carnegie's.
00:05:23,00:05:24,- Yeah.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"- Carnegie's. - Carnegie's, I would say."
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Carnegie's are the ones who come up to you in the bar
00:05:27,00:05:29,"and say, ""That's a shit shirt."""
00:05:29,00:05:31,(all laughing)
00:05:31,00:05:33,- That's not how you neg.
00:05:33,00:05:35,"The neg is a compliment, and then a backhanded compliment."
00:05:35,00:05:37,- What? - What should I be doing?
00:05:37,00:05:38,"- You should say, ""I love your shirt."
00:05:38,00:05:40,"""I saw six people wearing it earlier tonight."""
00:05:40,00:05:42,"- Oh, that's good, that's a true better than mine."
00:05:42,00:05:45,(all laughing)
00:05:45,00:05:49,"- But yeah, Margaret Was Brown was a absolute legend."
00:05:49,00:05:50,- What a gal.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"- She was, and she sort of, the fact is,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,is that she's often referred to
00:05:53,00:05:55,as almost like a Hollywood dame.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"Like she was going around in high-class parties,"
00:05:57,00:06:02,she was doing the weirdest of stuff socially.
00:06:02,00:06:03,She took all the-- - Oh yeah.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"- She had things like the Bird Brain Club,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,which it was a club where the decision was
00:06:08,00:06:09,anyone who was part of it.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"If they said on the day, ""It's Christmas,"""
00:06:10,00:06:12,you have to go over and celebrate Christmas.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- It's a fun idea.
00:06:13,00:06:14,- It's a great idea. - I got an idea.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"- Oh, it's a tiresome idea."
00:06:16,00:06:18,"It's a fun idea, the first two times you do it."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"And even by the third time, it's annoying."
00:06:20,00:06:22,- I think it was used wisely.
00:06:22,00:06:24,- I'm sure some people were kicked out
00:06:24,00:06:25,of the Christmas club or whatever it was.
00:06:25,00:06:27,- Bird Brain Society. - Bird Brain Society.
00:06:27,00:06:29,She could run as fast as a dog?
00:06:29,00:06:31,- There we go. (all laughing)
00:06:31,00:06:32,- Which dog?
00:06:32,00:06:33,Not a Greyhound.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- No, you're absolutely right."
00:06:35,00:06:39,"Well, I've written in my notes, she was a lifelong beagle."
00:06:39,00:06:41,"She was actually a beagle-er,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,"which is where you trace hairs on foot,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,and you have a load of beagle dogs with you.
00:06:44,00:06:46,And supposedly she was noted for her ability
00:06:46,00:06:48,to keep pace with running beagles.
00:06:48,00:06:51,- Her relationship with rabbits gets intense
00:06:51,00:06:53,"when she's an author, because she published a book"
00:06:53,00:06:55,which was called Little Fur Family.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"The illustrator was the same guy, Gareth Williams,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,who did the illustrations for Charlotte's Web.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"She had a first print run of 75,000 copies for this book,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,and each edition of it was wrapped entirely in the fur
00:07:05,00:07:07,of a New Zealand rabbit.
00:07:07,00:07:08,"- No. - Yeah, I don't believe you."
00:07:08,00:07:10,- And were they all ones that she caught herself
00:07:10,00:07:12,while being a beagle? (all laughing)
00:07:12,00:07:13,"- Yeah, I have no idea."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"- It's amazing, isn't it? - Sorry, no."
00:07:15,00:07:18,- Apparently it was because of a surrealist artist
00:07:18,00:07:22,"called Meret Oppenheim, who you might know this,"
00:07:22,00:07:26,it's like a teacup with rabbit fur on the inside
00:07:26,00:07:28,"and the outside, actually, you don't know that."
00:07:28,00:07:32,"It's in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is it, I think?"
00:07:32,00:07:35,And it was the first surrealist thing that they bought.
00:07:35,00:07:38,"But yeah, she decided she would do her own thing"
00:07:38,00:07:40,with books and make them really furry.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"- But it's 75,000. - 75,000?"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"- Yeah, it's mad."
00:07:43,00:07:45,"- Dan, you mentioned that you haven't read Good Night Moon,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"so you won't be aware, as I am,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"as someone who reads it every single night, my daughter."
00:07:49,00:07:52,The main character in that is also a rabbit.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"They're both rabbits, so having read this about her,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"I look at that completely differently now,"
00:07:57,00:08:00,every page where you see this old rabbit in a rocking chair.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"- It's a fantastic book, we should say."
00:08:02,00:08:03,- It's so good. - It's so good.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"- It's pretty good, it's like one of the first ones"
00:08:05,00:08:09,that just was slightly weird and just rhyming stuff.
00:08:09,00:08:10,- Yeah.
00:08:10,00:08:12,"- It's just a little bunny going to bed,"
00:08:12,00:08:13,"and it's all the stuff in the room,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,Good Night Blocks and Good Night Socks and all that.
00:08:15,00:08:18,"It's just very gentle, sort of lulling for child."
00:08:18,00:08:19,"I'm sure I was read it lots, I think."
00:08:19,00:08:21,"- But she also didn't like children,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,as well as not liking rabbits.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"It's kind of weird to make a book about rabbits for children,"
00:08:26,00:08:27,if you don't like either of those things.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- Yeah, 'cause she also did another book,"
00:08:29,00:08:30,"which had a print run of 80,000,"
00:08:30,00:08:34,which was entirely wrapped in the skin of five-year-olds.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- She said in an article for Life Magazine,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"she said, ""I don't especially like children."""
00:08:39,00:08:41,"And in another note to someone,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"she wrote, ""How many children have you got?"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"""I have 50 bucks."""
00:08:45,00:08:48,So I think she saw the bucks as her.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- All right, they are less trouble."
00:08:49,00:08:51,Have you seen all the Easter eggs in Good Night Moon?
00:08:51,00:08:52,This is just what happens
00:08:52,00:08:53,when you have read it over 100 times now.
00:08:53,00:08:55,- I don't know how to read it again.
00:08:55,00:08:55,- You are.
00:08:55,00:08:58,- There's so much you start to discover.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"- Don't tell me it's the same with Les Miserables,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,'cause I'm not reading that again.
00:09:02,00:09:04,- As long as you've got the illustrated version.
00:09:04,00:09:06,"Well, I won't give it away so you can discover it,"
00:09:06,00:09:07,"but if you do have a copy,"
00:09:07,00:09:10,look at the clock on every page and look at the moon.
00:09:10,00:09:11,- To go backwards?
00:09:11,00:09:12,"- No, it doesn't."
00:09:12,00:09:13,"- Oh, like memento."
00:09:13,00:09:15,- That would be so much better.
00:09:15,00:09:16,"Why didn't you, it just goes forwards."
00:09:16,00:09:17,Just goes forwards.
00:09:17,00:09:19,And so you know that it takes an hour and 10 minutes
00:09:19,00:09:22,"to get this rabbit to sleep when you want to go forwards,"
00:09:22,00:09:23,which is actually a long time.
00:09:23,00:09:26,And look at the book on the bedside table.
00:09:26,00:09:28,What do you think the book on the bedside table is?
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Is it the book itself?
00:09:29,00:09:30,- It's the book itself.
00:09:30,00:09:31,- Is it?
00:09:31,00:09:32,- That's surreal.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- It hasn't met her.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"- Good Night Moon, still innovating all these years later."
00:09:35,00:09:36,"- She wrote her book, she said,"
00:09:36,00:09:39,in a sort of 15 to 20 minute period.
00:09:39,00:09:40,That's the first draft.
00:09:40,00:09:41,And then the second draft.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"- This is all about your books, isn't it?"
00:09:43,00:09:43,"- This is all about your books, isn't it?"
00:09:43,00:09:46,(laughing)
00:09:46,00:09:48,- So it takes a 15 to 20 minutes for the first draft.
00:09:48,00:09:50,And then it takes her between one and two years
00:09:50,00:09:51,for the second draft.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"- Oh, and that's where you go and rub no second draft."
00:09:53,00:09:56,(laughing)
00:09:56,00:09:59,"- Oh, the edit is hard, the edit is hard."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Can we talk about the great thing she did
00:10:00,00:10:01,with the royalties?
00:10:01,00:10:02,- Yes.
00:10:02,00:10:03,- It's bizarre.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Margaret Weisbrand gave the royalties
00:10:04,00:10:06,"to every single one of her books,"
00:10:06,00:10:09,basically in her entire estate.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"She said, I leave it all to this little nine year old boy"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"who lives next door, who I'm friendly with,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"and you know, I'm 40."
00:10:15,00:10:16,Nothing's gonna happen to me.
00:10:16,00:10:17,I'll probably change the world
00:10:17,00:10:19,when I gain dependence or whatever.
00:10:19,00:10:20,"Anyway, she then dies."
00:10:20,00:10:21,"- Two years later, right?"
00:10:21,00:10:22,"- Two years later, she dies."
00:10:22,00:10:24,"So, and also Good Night Moon was on the,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,it was not selling big anymore.
00:10:26,00:10:28,It was probably gonna go out of print shortly.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Obviously it's never been out of print.
00:10:29,00:10:30,It's sold millions of copies.
00:10:30,00:10:32,And he was called Albert Clarke.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"And by the time he was 21, there was $75,000 waiting for him."
00:10:36,00:10:40,"Unfortunately, he had become a bit of a tear away."
00:10:40,00:10:41,- Oh yeah.
00:10:41,00:10:42,"- A bit of a, a bit of a."
00:10:42,00:10:43,- A bit of a rogue.
00:10:43,00:10:46,"- Bit of a rogue, burglary, joyriding, vandalism."
00:10:46,00:10:48,"He's a very, very, very naughty boy."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"- Kicked out of school for five,"
00:10:49,00:10:50,saw that sort of.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"- Yeah, and he had this bizarre life"
00:10:52,00:10:54,where he was always broke and getting into trouble
00:10:54,00:10:56,and being arrested and banged up.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"And then every year, publishers would say,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"right, there's another two million quid waiting for you."
00:11:00,00:11:02,- It's like the lotto lout.
00:11:02,00:11:03,Do you remember him?
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- No, I don't."
00:11:04,00:11:05,- Do you not remember him?
00:11:05,00:11:08,"He was like, when the lottery first started,"
00:11:08,00:11:09,I'm sure he's a very nice guy.
00:11:09,00:11:10,"So apologies if you're listening,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,but he won a load of money on the lottery
00:11:12,00:11:16,and then just spent it all within like two years or something.
00:11:16,00:11:19,And he was in all the tabloids as being a bit of a rogue.
00:11:19,00:11:20,But it's like that.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"But then if then, once he spent it all,"
00:11:22,00:11:23,he won the lottery again.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:11:24,00:11:25,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:25,00:11:27,"So the first initial batch of money that he got,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,"he gave a lot to his parents, which was nice."
00:11:29,00:11:30,"He gave $35,000 to his parents."
00:11:30,00:11:33,"He spent $4,000 on clothes for him and his two brothers."
00:11:33,00:11:34,He had two brothers.
00:11:34,00:11:36,And then he bought a Chevy Impala.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"As soon as he took it out of the shop,"
00:11:38,00:11:41,"got smashed into, immediately dented it."
00:11:41,00:11:42,- That's not his fault.
00:11:42,00:11:43,"- No, no, but I read an interview with him"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"where he was sort of saying, look, yes, I've done bad things."
00:11:46,00:11:48,"But also just like, bad things just happen all the time"
00:11:48,00:11:52,that throw me into situations of such weird details.
00:11:52,00:11:53,It's like he had a dented car
00:11:53,00:11:55,and 14 pairs of alligator shoes.
00:11:55,00:11:56,That's all he had in life.
00:11:56,00:11:58,And then the next check comes in.
00:11:58,00:12:00,And the only thing he's kept with him wherever he goes
00:12:00,00:12:01,is the will.
00:12:01,00:12:02,He keeps the will that she wrote.
00:12:02,00:12:04,- And the alligator shoes.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"The naked man wearing alligators on his feet,"
00:12:06,00:12:06,collapsing and weird.
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Isn't it weird?
00:12:07,00:12:10,Like she was putting rabbits on her bucks.
00:12:10,00:12:13,He was putting alligators on his feet.
00:12:13,00:12:15,This is like the least vegan fact we've ever done.
00:12:15,00:12:16,(all laughing)
00:12:16,00:12:18,"- I just mentioned her love life earlier,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,"which was, again, not something you imagine"
00:12:20,00:12:20,"when you're reading it,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,'cause you picture this old lady.
00:12:22,00:12:23,He's writing these books.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"- Also, her name sounds old, doesn't it?"
00:12:25,00:12:26,Margaret Wise Brown.
00:12:26,00:12:28,"It doesn't sound like wise, yeah."
00:12:28,00:12:31,"I suppose in the 1920s, that was a really sexy name."
00:12:31,00:12:33,- Margaret is now a more old fashioned name.
00:12:33,00:12:34,I think that's fair.
00:12:34,00:12:35,Is that fair to say?
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Well, my mom's a Margaret."
00:12:36,00:12:37,- There we go.
00:12:37,00:12:38,- And she's very cool.
00:12:38,00:12:38,- Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:39,- Coming every weekend.
00:12:39,00:12:40,(all laughing)
00:12:40,00:12:42,- She had an interesting love life.
00:12:42,00:12:43,- Oh yeah.
00:12:43,00:12:43,- She had his mom.
00:12:43,00:12:46,And so did Margaret Wise Brown.
00:12:46,00:12:51,"And she went out with a woman called Michael Strange,"
00:12:51,00:12:55,"confusingly, who, I like the LA Times in 1992,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,described Michael Strange as a writer and performer
00:12:58,00:13:00,of limited gifts and voracious ego.
00:13:00,00:13:02,And she did seem to be not a great partner
00:13:02,00:13:03,"for Margaret Wise Brown,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,but they got together in 1940
00:13:05,00:13:07,and pretty much lived together
00:13:07,00:13:08,or lived in next door apartments
00:13:08,00:13:11,until Strange died in 1950.
00:13:11,00:13:13,- They did share a butler.
00:13:13,00:13:15,- The two ladies.
00:13:15,00:13:18,"- Yeah, so they had an apartment opposite each other."
00:13:18,00:13:19,"So in the corridor,"
00:13:19,00:13:20,"the butler would just sort of go out the door,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,go through the next door and sort of just--
00:13:22,00:13:23,"- Wait, did they know?"
00:13:23,00:13:25,Did they know that they were sharing a butler?
00:13:25,00:13:25,Or was he doing a sort of--
00:13:25,00:13:28,(all laughing)
00:13:28,00:13:29,- This is terrifying.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"- Take the mustache off, yeah."
00:13:30,00:13:31,- You don't need to take the--
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- Yeah, why would you do that?"
00:13:33,00:13:34,- 'Cause they're dating.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Oh, you're right, yeah."
00:13:35,00:13:35,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:35,00:13:36,How's your butler?
00:13:36,00:13:38,"Well, he's still without a mustache."
00:13:38,00:13:39,- He must get one.
00:13:39,00:13:41,Mine looks dashing.
00:13:41,00:13:43,- That was pretty fun.
00:13:43,00:13:44,That's a great thing to do.
00:13:44,00:13:47,- I looked at a few other kids' authors.
00:13:47,00:13:50,"Well, basically I went through my daughter's books"
00:13:50,00:13:52,and googled all of their authors.
00:13:52,00:13:55,And I was looking at the tiger who came to tea.
00:13:55,00:13:56,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:56,00:13:58,- Which is by Judith Kerr.
00:13:58,00:14:01,"And Michael Rosen, who was the children's laureate"
00:14:01,00:14:02,"and the writer and stuff,"
00:14:02,00:14:05,he has drawn parallels between the tiger who came to tea
00:14:05,00:14:08,and Judith Kerr's early life.
00:14:08,00:14:11,'Cause Judith Kerr's father was on a death list
00:14:11,00:14:12,from the Nazis.
00:14:12,00:14:15,And they had to leave Nazi Germany
00:14:15,00:14:17,when she was nine years old.
00:14:17,00:14:18,- Wow.
00:14:18,00:14:20,- And Michael Rosen said that maybe the tiger
00:14:20,00:14:23,is based on the threat that they faced
00:14:23,00:14:25,"when they were children,"
00:14:25,00:14:26,because it disrupted their life so much.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"They took everything that the family owned,"
00:14:28,00:14:31,like the tiger who came to tea drinks all of the water
00:14:31,00:14:34,and eats everything in the cupboards and stuff like that.
00:14:34,00:14:36,And Judith Kerr has said
00:14:36,00:14:39,that the tiger represents nothing more than a tiger.
00:14:39,00:14:42,(all laughing)
00:14:42,00:14:43,"- Well, I believe Michael, though."
00:14:43,00:14:45,"- Yeah, I love you too."
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- It's got a very weird ending, the tiger who came to tea."
00:14:47,00:14:48,"- Yeah, well."
00:14:48,00:14:49,- Doesn't the tiger just leave?
00:14:49,00:14:51,"- No, I think daddy comes home."
00:14:51,00:14:53,"And it's really annoying because, you know,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"the tiger's had all his, like--"
00:14:55,00:14:55,- Drunk all his beer?
00:14:55,00:14:57,- Drunk all his beer and had all the food for tea.
00:14:57,00:14:58,- Yeah.
00:14:58,00:14:59,- So then--
00:14:59,00:15:01,"- He says, ""I've got a very good idea."
00:15:01,00:15:03,"""We'll go to the cafe and have sausage and chips"
00:15:03,00:15:04,"""and ice cream."""
00:15:04,00:15:05,- Oh yeah.
00:15:05,00:15:06,"- Yeah, daddy takes them all out for--"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- Meanwhile, there's a drunk tiger feeling that."
00:15:08,00:15:10,"- The tiger goes unaddressed, exactly, yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:12,"- No, because then the next morning,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,they buy loads of food to fill the pantry up
00:15:15,00:15:18,and they buy a tin of tiger food in case he comes back
00:15:18,00:15:19,and he never did.
00:15:19,00:15:20,"- Oh, really?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,- Hmm.
00:15:21,00:15:21,- Interesting.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"- I think if I was a dad walking back home,"
00:15:24,00:15:25,"I opened the door,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,I see my three kids and my wife sitting by a table.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"No, no, just like in my story."
00:15:30,00:15:33,And in the corner is a drunk tiger.
00:15:33,00:15:36,I do think my first instinct is to not make a deal of it.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"Take kids, we're going out now."
00:15:38,00:15:40,"- Okay, so, Dan, the tiger's already left"
00:15:40,00:15:41,when daddy comes home.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"- Oh, I thought you said he was drunk in the--"
00:15:42,00:15:46,"- No, so the daddy comes home and all the food's gone."
00:15:46,00:15:48,"All the water's gone, there's no water in the tub."
00:15:48,00:15:49,"- Oh yeah, wow."
00:15:49,00:15:52,- And Mummy and Sophie tell daddy what's happened
00:15:52,00:15:54,and said the tiger came in and ate all of the food
00:15:54,00:15:57,and drank all of the drinks and all of your beer
00:15:57,00:15:59,and took all the water out of the taps
00:15:59,00:16:00,"and then daddy goes, let's go to a cafe."
00:16:00,00:16:01,That's how it works.
00:16:01,00:16:04,- It sounds like daddy doesn't believe a word of this.
00:16:04,00:16:05,It sounds like it's happened before.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- And all the beer's gone, has it?"
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Oh, the tiger, right, yeah."
00:16:09,00:16:11,"- Someone's turned the water off, have they?"
00:16:11,00:16:12,- Okay.
00:16:12,00:16:14,"- And the water bill over here, that's not been paid."
00:16:14,00:16:16,But the interesting thing about that
00:16:16,00:16:18,"is when they walk to the cafe, it's nighttime,"
00:16:18,00:16:19,so all the street lights are on
00:16:19,00:16:21,"and all the cars have their headlights on,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,but there's a little cat that's walking by
00:16:24,00:16:27,"near where they live that looks exactly like a tiger,"
00:16:27,00:16:28,but it looks like a cat long.
00:16:28,00:16:29,- It's acknowledged as a--
00:16:29,00:16:30,"- No, it's not acknowledged,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,but it's obviously like what inspired her lies.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"This drunken, reprobate lady's lies,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,she booses up on her husband.
00:16:39,00:16:40,- I wish.
00:16:40,00:16:41,- Here's what we're gonna tell daddy.
00:16:41,00:16:43,(all laughing)
00:16:43,00:16:44,- Tiger.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"- He's never gonna believe it, man."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"- I wish I'd been able to,"
00:16:47,00:16:50,'cause I was on a sofa with Michael Rosen yesterday.
00:16:50,00:16:51,- Were you?
00:16:51,00:16:52,"- Yeah, but it was such a long sofa"
00:16:52,00:16:54,that I couldn't ask him about this.
00:16:54,00:16:55,It was an enormously long sofa.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- Well, he wouldn't have heard you."
00:16:57,00:16:58,"- Honestly, he wouldn't."
00:16:58,00:16:59,I would have had to get him and walk
00:16:59,00:16:59,to the other end of the sofa.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- Oh, wait, did you genuinely think,"
00:17:01,00:17:02,"ah, I'd love to talk to this man,"
00:17:02,00:17:05,this legend of literature?
00:17:05,00:17:07,"Ah, the sofa's too long."
00:17:07,00:17:08,- He had picked the absolute opposite.
00:17:08,00:17:10,He had picked the furthest other part of the sofa
00:17:10,00:17:11,and so on.
00:17:11,00:17:12,It was very clear to me
00:17:12,00:17:13,that he wasn't looking for a pal.
00:17:13,00:17:14,- Right.
00:17:14,00:17:15,"- Well, you were DFS."
00:17:15,00:17:17,(all laughing)
00:17:17,00:17:19,"- It was a call-as-o for as well,"
00:17:19,00:17:20,so I could have walked the hypotenuse.
00:17:20,00:17:23,(all laughing)
00:17:23,00:17:25,(upbeat music)
00:17:25,00:17:30,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:17:30,00:17:32,and that is Anna.
00:17:32,00:17:35,- My fact this week is that the city of Matsuyama
00:17:35,00:17:39,has over 90 post boxes specifically for mailing haiku.
00:17:39,00:17:41,"- Mm-hmm, lovely."
00:17:41,00:17:44,"- Or, as you could say, Matsuyama"
00:17:44,00:17:49,has over 90 post boxes for mailing haiku.
00:17:49,00:17:52,- Brilliant. - Is that right?
00:17:52,00:17:53,- It's right. - It's right.
00:17:53,00:17:54,- It's right. - It's amazing.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"- Well done, Anna. - Why?"
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Why?
00:17:57,00:17:58,Why?
00:17:58,00:18:00,- Why did you bother making that haiku?
00:18:00,00:18:02,(all laughing)
00:18:02,00:18:04,"- That's bloody easy to make, aren't they?"
00:18:04,00:18:07,"This is the capital city of Shikoku Island,"
00:18:07,00:18:09,which is one of Japan's islands.
00:18:09,00:18:12,And it's because the city sort of calls itself
00:18:12,00:18:15,the home of haiku because very famous haiku poets
00:18:15,00:18:16,lived there.
00:18:16,00:18:19,And so the first post box was installed in 1968
00:18:19,00:18:22,to commemorate one of these poets' births.
00:18:22,00:18:23,And now they're all over the place.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"They're like monuments and baths, public baths,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,and they're really beautiful as well
00:18:28,00:18:29,and lots of different designs.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"And every three months,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,the local haiku poets go to the post boxes
00:18:35,00:18:37,or they send an envoy and they empty them out
00:18:37,00:18:39,and then they judge all the entries.
00:18:39,00:18:40,"- Oh, yeah. - And the winner"
00:18:40,00:18:42,gets published on the city's website.
00:18:42,00:18:44,- It's so good. - It's so great.
00:18:44,00:18:47,- I hope there's a walking trail.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"There is between them, which is called the Taker Haiku."
00:18:50,00:18:51,- Lovely. - That would be good.
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Nice.
00:18:52,00:18:53,- But there is a walking trail.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Sorry to jump in on your joke.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't see it coming."
00:18:56,00:18:58,"- You should be able to see by now that long,"
00:18:58,00:18:59,"that distant look in my eyes,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,but it shows something's brewing.
00:19:01,00:19:03,"- The fact he's been silent for two minutes done,"
00:19:03,00:19:04,that should have been a clue.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"- Yeah, no, they do in this place as well,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,the Matsuyama area.
00:19:09,00:19:12,They have certain haiku bars that you go into
00:19:12,00:19:14,and you go up to the counter and you write a haiku
00:19:14,00:19:17,and the cocktail they make you is based on your haiku.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"- No. - It's just, you know,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"they love a haiku, they love a novelty thing to do there, yeah."
00:19:20,00:19:21,- What do you say?
00:19:21,00:19:23,"Gin and tonic, please."
00:19:23,00:19:24,(all laughing)
00:19:24,00:19:27,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
00:19:27,00:19:29,- Is it Bashou who was from this place
00:19:29,00:19:30,or is it someone else?
00:19:30,00:19:31,'Cause he's the most famous haiku guy.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"- He is, yeah, there seem to be sort of four kings of haiku"
00:19:33,00:19:35,and he's like the king of kings.
00:19:35,00:19:39,"But no, it's Masaoka Shiki who was the person"
00:19:39,00:19:41,who rejuvenated haiku in the 19th century.
00:19:41,00:19:45,"So it basically sort of died, it was really dying"
00:19:45,00:19:49,and he lit a fire under its arse and--
00:19:49,00:19:50,- Redamed it as well.
00:19:50,00:19:52,- And gave it its name. - Gave it its name haiku.
00:19:52,00:19:54,It was called like Hoku or something before.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"- Oh, so it didn't change it much."
00:19:55,00:19:57,"- No, he just put a stamp on it."
00:19:57,00:20:00,"He just, yeah, this is the Shiki stamp."
00:20:00,00:20:01,- It's really interesting what Shiki did
00:20:01,00:20:02,'cause he was obsessed with haiku.
00:20:02,00:20:04,"He failed his exams at university,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,partly because he was writing so many haiku
00:20:06,00:20:09,and reading haiku and he was engrossed in the world of haiku.
00:20:09,00:20:12,He sort of added to the rules about haiku
00:20:12,00:20:13,"and the first, the most important thing"
00:20:13,00:20:15,about haiku as we know them
00:20:15,00:20:17,is that it's an observation of what's around you.
00:20:17,00:20:18,It's an observation of nature.
00:20:18,00:20:21,So that's a key element to haiku.
00:20:21,00:20:24,- So actually what Anna did at the start was not a haiku.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- No, it was a culture."
00:20:25,00:20:27,- It had the right number of syllables in
00:20:27,00:20:29,but it has to have something to do with nature
00:20:29,00:20:31,"or something to do, it has to have a word"
00:20:31,00:20:33,that's something to do with one of the seasons.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"So for instance, there's a really famous one"
00:20:36,00:20:38,by Bashou who I mentioned earlier
00:20:38,00:20:41,"which goes an ancient pond, a frog jumps in,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,the splash of water.
00:20:43,00:20:46,In Japanese it works as a haiku.
00:20:46,00:20:50,"But for him, it's the word frog refers to spring."
00:20:50,00:20:51,It's a spring word.
00:20:51,00:20:53,And so you need one of those.
00:20:53,00:20:56,And so unless you're using the word postbox to refer to-
00:20:56,00:20:58,"- Yeah, it's a classic autumnal word, postbox."
00:20:58,00:20:59,It's in the glossaries.
00:20:59,00:21:00,- I get it now.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"So I read that earlier, that one."
00:21:02,00:21:03,"And I thought, you know, it was like,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,this was one that he published and became famous.
00:21:05,00:21:07,And he was like dining off it for years.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"Like, ""Where in that haiku was insane?"""
00:21:08,00:21:10,And I didn't find it impressive at all.
00:21:10,00:21:12,I didn't make the spring and the frog connection.
00:21:12,00:21:13,That's wonderful.
00:21:13,00:21:14,- And now are you wowed by it?
00:21:14,00:21:17,- I do like the punnery in the kind of double meaning.
00:21:17,00:21:19,- Are we saying it because frogs jump?
00:21:19,00:21:20,"- No, no, no, no."
00:21:20,00:21:20,"- No, that's not it."
00:21:20,00:21:21,"- Oh, then I just like it again."
00:21:21,00:21:23,I thought that is what was going on.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- Sorry, that wouldn't-"
00:21:24,00:21:25,- That wouldn't work at all in Japanese.
00:21:25,00:21:27,"- Please, no."
00:21:27,00:21:30,"- No, it's just that frogs come out in spring."
00:21:30,00:21:31,That's in their barn in spring.
00:21:31,00:21:33,So they're associated with spring time.
00:21:33,00:21:35,And it's supposed to you read it
00:21:35,00:21:37,and it just puts you in that position
00:21:37,00:21:40,of being in a garden in spring.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"The frog jumps in, you know exactly where you are."
00:21:42,00:21:43,You know what's happening.
00:21:43,00:21:44,You're one with nature.
00:21:44,00:21:45,That's it.
00:21:45,00:21:46,- Do you get it now?
00:21:46,00:21:46,- I get it now.
00:21:46,00:21:47,"Listen, it's no good night moon."
00:21:47,00:21:49,It's like-
00:21:49,00:21:50,"- What it's meant to be is like,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,it's like a shot in a film almost.
00:21:52,00:21:54,It's a shot that crystallizes something
00:21:54,00:21:56,and expresses something.
00:21:56,00:21:57,I really like them.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"I did not know they don't have to be five, seven, five."
00:21:59,00:22:01,- No.
00:22:01,00:22:02,You can be a bit flexible.
00:22:02,00:22:04,- And actually I was very interested
00:22:04,00:22:07,to message my Japanese friend after I'd read about this
00:22:07,00:22:09,"'cause yeah, people who write about haiku properly"
00:22:09,00:22:10,"and who know about it say,"
00:22:10,00:22:11,"look, the syllables thing,"
00:22:11,00:22:13,it's a misinterpretation in English anyway
00:22:13,00:22:15,"'cause it's not syllables, it sounds."
00:22:15,00:22:17,"And she wrote me a few haikus at random,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,"I think, while she was sitting on the toilet."
00:22:19,00:22:20,And none of them had the right number of syllables.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"And I was like,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,"sorry, I don't know if she would have wanted me to share that,"
00:22:22,00:22:23,but I have-
00:22:23,00:22:25,(laughing)
00:22:25,00:22:28,- She said an ancient toilet.
00:22:28,00:22:31,- And turds jumps in the splash of water.
00:22:31,00:22:33,(laughing)
00:22:33,00:22:34,"- And she said,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,the only thing I think a haiku needs
00:22:36,00:22:38,is the seasonal reference.
00:22:38,00:22:39,So there you go.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"And it is, they have done these glossaries"
00:22:40,00:22:41,"that you have to stick to, don't they?"
00:22:41,00:22:43,"You can buy a glossary, a haiku glossary."
00:22:43,00:22:46,"- Dan, could you maybe say some words"
00:22:46,00:22:48,that you think might be summer words?
00:22:48,00:22:48,- Summer words?
00:22:48,00:22:49,"- Yeah, like a word."
00:22:49,00:22:50,- Sun.
00:22:50,00:22:51,- That might do it.
00:22:51,00:22:52,- I reckon.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- Although you do get sun in the other, you know."
00:22:54,00:22:55,- True.
00:22:55,00:22:56,- A nice bright.
00:22:56,00:22:56,- You get it in most seasons.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- Winter sun.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"- All year round, don't you?"
00:22:58,00:22:59,The old sun.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- Harvest.
00:23:00,00:23:01,- Sorry.
00:23:01,00:23:02,- That'll be an autumn one.
00:23:02,00:23:03,- Bikini.
00:23:03,00:23:04,- Beach.
00:23:04,00:23:05,- Yeah.
00:23:05,00:23:06,- Bikini.
00:23:06,00:23:06,"- Yeah, yeah, that's a classic."
00:23:06,00:23:07,It's in the list of summer words.
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Blockbuster.
00:23:08,00:23:11,(laughing)
00:23:11,00:23:14,"- So summer could be insects,"
00:23:14,00:23:15,"autumn, scarecrow,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"resentment,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"winter, tangle, twigs, empty fields."
00:23:19,00:23:20,"- Oh, lovely."
00:23:20,00:23:21,- I really like it.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Can I show you the prop I've brought along?
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Yes.
00:23:23,00:23:24,- I like a related prop.
00:23:24,00:23:25,- Hang on.
00:23:25,00:23:27,'Cause I don't know if you guys know this.
00:23:27,00:23:28,- You're not on the news.
00:23:28,00:23:29,- Sorry.
00:23:29,00:23:30,I don't know if you guys know this.
00:23:30,00:23:32,- You've got Michael Rosen in your bag.
00:23:32,00:23:33,(laughing)
00:23:33,00:23:34,- I brought the sofa.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"- Okay, so there's a British Haiku Society."
00:23:37,00:23:37,"- Oh, yeah."
00:23:37,00:23:38,- Do you guys find that?
00:23:38,00:23:39,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:39,00:23:40,- Because of your research?
00:23:40,00:23:41,"Well, I'm very proud to announce"
00:23:41,00:23:42,they've gained a new member this week.
00:23:42,00:23:43,"- Oh, no way."
00:23:43,00:23:44,- I joined up.
00:23:44,00:23:45,- Yeah.
00:23:45,00:23:46,- Have you stopped your subscription
00:23:46,00:23:48,to the Lighthouse Society?
00:23:48,00:23:49,- The Association of Lighthouse Keepers
00:23:49,00:23:50,have lost a member.
00:23:50,00:23:52,(laughing)
00:23:52,00:23:53,- Is it like having citizenship?
00:23:53,00:23:55,You're only allowed to be a member of one or the other.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"- I think it's lapsed now,"
00:23:57,00:23:58,'cause I haven't received a copy of Lamp Magazine
00:23:58,00:24:01,"for a while, and I was a big fan of that."
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Lights out.
00:24:02,00:24:03,(laughing)
00:24:03,00:24:06,- I am now a member of the BHS.
00:24:06,00:24:07,- Yeah.
00:24:07,00:24:08,- British Home Stars.
00:24:08,00:24:09,- That's right.
00:24:09,00:24:10,"And look, I've got the journal here,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,which is called Blythe Spirit.
00:24:13,00:24:17,- So Andy's holding an A5 white book
00:24:17,00:24:18,with Blythe Spirit written on it.
00:24:18,00:24:20,Does it have a lot of haiku in it?
00:24:20,00:24:21,- Absolutely jam-packed with really good haiku.
00:24:21,00:24:23,It just randomly pick one.
00:24:23,00:24:24,"- Yeah, give us a good haiku."
00:24:24,00:24:25,A spring one if you can.
00:24:25,00:24:27,- You're not gonna believe this.
00:24:27,00:24:29,This is by Philip Murrell.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"Called home, I scrape away moss to find his name."
00:24:32,00:24:36,"And you can see why I signed up, 'cause he was full of this."
00:24:36,00:24:39,"- I like the way you pretended that was just random,"
00:24:39,00:24:39,but actually--
00:24:39,00:24:41,- It's fallen open to this page
00:24:41,00:24:43,because the spine is so cracked.
00:24:43,00:24:45,All right.
00:24:45,00:24:49,"A baby shower immersed by cherubs, Botticelli."
00:24:49,00:24:54,"- What do you guys, I admire the idea"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"of haikus, I really like them."
00:24:56,00:24:57,It doesn't do anything for me.
00:24:57,00:25:00,Certainly something like reading through a book like that.
00:25:00,00:25:03,"Just, I imagine if I was sitting in nature"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"and then someone sent me a haiku about the area,"
00:25:05,00:25:06,that would be really nice and poignant.
00:25:06,00:25:09,But do you guys get something from haiku?
00:25:09,00:25:11,"- I have done, having done research for this,"
00:25:11,00:25:12,"I would say until that I hadn't,"
00:25:12,00:25:14,"until I understood what it was,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,I didn't really get anything out of it.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"But I like the idea, they have these clubs"
00:25:18,00:25:22,where a hundred people will go to a beautiful place
00:25:22,00:25:25,in nature and they'll all just write as many haiku.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"- See, I get that, I get that."
00:25:26,00:25:27,"- And you're just kind of like,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,you're trying to capture one moment
00:25:29,00:25:31,where you're with nature
00:25:31,00:25:33,"in just this kind of slightly formulaic,"
00:25:33,00:25:36,but you can go out of the rules if you want to way.
00:25:36,00:25:36,"I kind of, I do."
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Oh, it's a lovely conceit, definitely."
00:25:38,00:25:39,I like it.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"- Yeah, I really like it."
00:25:40,00:25:43,"As James says, reading about it, the analysis of it,"
00:25:43,00:25:44,"as with any kind of poetry or art,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,'cause I'm not smart enough to understand it face on.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"But when you read the analysis, I think you get it."
00:25:49,00:25:53,And maybe you could be lured in by the punchline element.
00:25:53,00:25:55,"You know, often you'll do a comedy set"
00:25:55,00:25:58,where at the end it's got a big reveal.
00:25:58,00:25:59,And that--
00:25:59,00:26:00,- Or haikus have them.
00:26:00,00:26:01,"- Haikus, exactly."
00:26:01,00:26:04,"There's supposed to be this moment of realization, so."
00:26:04,00:26:07,- That's why I thought the spring with the frog thing.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- Sorry, not that kind of thing."
00:26:09,00:26:13,"More like the one I read that I really liked was bass,"
00:26:13,00:26:16,picking bugs off the moon.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"And the way it was explained was,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,"you have bass, it's a type of fish, it's plucking bugs,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,and then it's off the moon.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"'Cause suddenly you realize, to them,"
00:26:25,00:26:27,they think they're picking bugs off the surface of the moon
00:26:27,00:26:29,'cause they're always looking up at the moon.
00:26:29,00:26:30,"- Oh, that's lovely."
00:26:30,00:26:32,"- To us, they're picking up the surface of the moon."
00:26:32,00:26:34,"- And all of the haikus would have like a word in it,"
00:26:34,00:26:37,"which is kind of hard to translate into English,"
00:26:37,00:26:38,but they're like a surprise
00:26:38,00:26:42,or they call them a cutting word online a lot.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"And it might be, aha!"
00:26:44,00:26:45,Or--
00:26:45,00:26:46,- Sorry?
00:26:46,00:26:50,"- Yeah, it's almost like an exclamation point."
00:26:50,00:26:51,"- Oh, okay. - Do you know what I mean?"
00:26:51,00:26:54,"- My favorite haiku that I found is,"
00:26:54,00:26:55,"and I hadn't heard of this,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,"and I really think this is beautiful,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,the idea of the death poem.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"- Oh, yeah."
00:26:59,00:27:00,"- So the death poem is a Japanese tradition,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"whereby if you know that you're about to die,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,"let's say an execution is gonna happen,"
00:27:04,00:27:06,"'cause this has been going from centuries and centuries,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,this death poem idea.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"You are encouraged to write your final poem,"
00:27:10,00:27:13,and that can be presented in sometimes as a haiku.
00:27:13,00:27:15,So there was one that was written by a guy
00:27:15,00:27:17,"called Moriya Senan,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,"and his was, ""Bury me when I die"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"beneath a wine barrel in a tavern,"
00:27:21,00:27:24,"with luck the cask will leak."""
00:27:24,00:27:28,"Okay, so that's his thing."
00:27:28,00:27:30,"What's really nice is the line,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,"hopefully the cask will leak or the cask will leak,"
00:27:32,00:27:36,"the Japanese wording for that is Moriya Senan,"
00:27:36,00:27:37,which is his name.
00:27:37,00:27:38,- Lovely.
00:27:38,00:27:38,"- Oh, that's clever."
00:27:38,00:27:39,- Is that wonderful?
00:27:39,00:27:40,Yeah.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- That is clever.
00:27:41,00:27:42,"- No one else can do that, can they?"
00:27:42,00:27:45,No one else has a chance in that competition.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"- Hey doctor, watch this."
00:27:47,00:27:51,I'm doing a big kankam.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"Uh-oh, oh shit, shit."
00:27:53,00:27:55,(laughing)
00:27:55,00:27:56,- Beautiful.
00:27:56,00:27:57,- Yeah.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- Really good, where's the seasonal reference?"
00:27:58,00:28:00,(laughing)
00:28:00,00:28:05,"- Did you guys hear, hear tell of?"
00:28:05,00:28:06,(laughing)
00:28:06,00:28:09,- This is now he's a member of the Haiku Society.
00:28:09,00:28:10,This is how Andy speaks.
00:28:10,00:28:12,- Everything has to scan.
00:28:12,00:28:16,- Did you hear tell of the 2014 Haiku artist
00:28:16,00:28:19,who operated out of Sainsbury's in North London?
00:28:19,00:28:21,(laughing)
00:28:21,00:28:26,This was the board baker who smuggled complaint poems
00:28:26,00:28:30,into the Sainsbury's treats that he was bagging up.
00:28:30,00:28:33,"So for example, enjoy your cookies."
00:28:33,00:28:36,"Each bite is a minute, I'll never get back."
00:28:36,00:28:37,(laughing)
00:28:37,00:28:38,It's a nice one.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"Anyway, he was identified and immediately fired."
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Sainsbury's apologized to customers
00:28:41,00:28:43,and said it should never have happened.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"- I love it, come on, I love it."
00:28:45,00:28:45,- I liked it.
00:28:45,00:28:47,- You'd be delighted if you got it.
00:28:47,00:28:48,"It's like a fortune cookie, isn't it?"
00:28:48,00:28:51,"But instead of your future, you get some abuse."
00:28:51,00:28:54,"- This city is Matsuyama,"
00:28:54,00:28:57,"which led me to read about Hideki Matsuyama,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,who was the first to have a Japanese professional golfer
00:28:59,00:29:02,to win a men's major golf championship.
00:29:02,00:29:03,- What year are we talking?
00:29:03,00:29:04,- 2021.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- What, wow."
00:29:05,00:29:06,- That's the first time.
00:29:06,00:29:08,- The first time a Japanese man
00:29:08,00:29:11,at least has won a major golf championship.
00:29:11,00:29:14,And he was once disqualified from a competition
00:29:14,00:29:17,"due to Tipex, riddle me this."
00:29:17,00:29:18,"- Yeah, okay."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Just qualified for the competition.
00:29:19,00:29:20,- It's famous in the golfing world.
00:29:20,00:29:22,- Painting his balls.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"- Painting his balls with Tipex,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,where they're already white.
00:29:25,00:29:26,- But does it add weight to it?
00:29:26,00:29:29,Or some kind of grip that you wouldn't have?
00:29:29,00:29:33,"- You're getting really close, but it's not the balls."
00:29:33,00:29:36,- Did he Tipex over his score on the board?
00:29:36,00:29:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Different score."
00:29:38,00:29:41,- It's the club.
00:29:41,00:29:43,He would put it onto the club itself on the...
00:29:43,00:29:46,- So he put like a little target on the club
00:29:46,00:29:48,so that he could see where he wanted to hit the ball
00:29:48,00:29:50,"or with Tipex, and that's allowed."
00:29:50,00:29:51,You're allowed to do that.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"But he put too much Tipex on it,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,"which made it slightly raised,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,"which would change the grip that when the club hit the ball,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,it would change the way that the ball flew.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"And they measured it,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,and it was like a millionth of a millimeter too thick.
00:30:04,00:30:06,- How amazing is that? - From a competition.
00:30:06,00:30:07,- Gosh.
00:30:07,00:30:10,- The forensic down to the millimeter.
00:30:10,00:30:12,- Yeah. - That's so pedantic.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"- Like someone said, ""Yes, you are allowed to put Tipex"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"""on your club, but only a bit."""
00:30:17,00:30:19,(laughing)
00:30:19,00:30:20,- And he exceeds that bit. - How much is a bit?
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:21,00:30:22,- Wow.
00:30:22,00:30:24,- So that's just me shoehornin' some golf into this bag.
00:30:24,00:30:25,- I love it.
00:30:25,00:30:27,There was an exciting thing in the world.
00:30:27,00:30:29,"This is sort of, he was the first Japanese golfer"
00:30:29,00:30:29,"to do this. - Yeah, yeah."
00:30:29,00:30:31,- There was an exciting thing in the world
00:30:31,00:30:34,of Haiku in 2017 when a very prestigious competition
00:30:34,00:30:37,was won for the first time by a non-Japanese person.
00:30:37,00:30:38,- Really?
00:30:38,00:30:40,"- And it was Gracie Starkey,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,who was a 14 year old school girl from Gloucestershire.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- Wow. - Oh, wow."
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- And she was learning Japanese at the time,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,and her teacher encouraged her to enter it.
00:30:47,00:30:49,"I think there were 18,000 entries."
00:30:49,00:30:52,"- It doesn't say much for the entire population of Japan,"
00:30:52,00:30:53,does it?
00:30:53,00:30:53,(laughing)
00:30:53,00:30:56,"- It doesn't. - It's girl who I'm sure is great,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,but has only just started learning the language.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"- Yeah, it shows that the bar to entry is low for Haiku,"
00:31:01,00:31:01,I suppose.
00:31:01,00:31:04,"- Like, I can't imagine her winning the Japanese open"
00:31:04,00:31:06,golf for instance. (laughing)
00:31:06,00:31:08,"- And her poem was printed on millions of,"
00:31:08,00:31:11,"there's a green tea drink company that was sponsoring it,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,so her poem was printed on millions of these bottles.
00:31:13,00:31:15,And the coder to the story is that Gracie then decided
00:31:15,00:31:17,"to drop Japanese for GCSE,"
00:31:17,00:31:19,(laughing)
00:31:19,00:31:21,saying the Japanese language is so hard.
00:31:21,00:31:23,(laughing)
00:31:23,00:31:25,(upbeat music)
00:31:25,00:31:30,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,and that is Andy.
00:31:32,00:31:34,My fact is that in the early 1900s there was a debate
00:31:34,00:31:38,over whether cinemas should be dark or fully lit.
00:31:38,00:31:39,(laughing)
00:31:39,00:31:41,- Do we think they got it right?
00:31:41,00:31:42,- I think they did get it right.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"- For me, yes, I think dark is better."
00:31:44,00:31:46,"- For the screening purpose, yes."
00:31:46,00:31:48,"For the rest of society, maybe not."
00:31:48,00:31:49,"- Mmm, go on."
00:31:49,00:31:53,"- Well, this was the brainchild of a guy"
00:31:53,00:31:56,"called Roxy Rothafell, early cinema entrepreneur,"
00:31:56,00:32:00,and he announced in 1910 that he had perfected
00:32:00,00:32:02,what he called daylight pictures.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"He said they were absolutely flickerless,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"they wouldn't tie the sensitive eyes of the audience out,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,and you could see everything in the room.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"And that was a kind of crucial point,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,'cause he was a big part of making cinema
00:32:12,00:32:14,"socially acceptable, whereas, you know,"
00:32:14,00:32:16,"before it was fairgrounds and peep shows,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,"and it was a bit raucous, and it was dark,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"and you couldn't see what was going on,"
00:32:19,00:32:22,"and people might be, you know, getting up to hanky-panky,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,and men and women were sitting next to each other in the dark.
00:32:24,00:32:27,"You know, why have we allowed this to happen?"
00:32:27,00:32:29,"And he basically said, ""Look, here's a lovely bright,"
00:32:29,00:32:32,"""nicely lit screen,"" and he said,"
00:32:32,00:32:34,"""You can see the picture perfectly,"
00:32:34,00:32:35,"""but you can also see the room,"""
00:32:35,00:32:38,"and it's just a nice, more sociable way of watching."
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- But actually, even the very, very,"
00:32:40,00:32:41,"very, very earliest cinemas,"
00:32:41,00:32:45,so when Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company
00:32:45,00:32:48,"was first sending out projectors,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,they said that you should install ambient lighting
00:32:50,00:32:52,to deter misbehavior.
00:32:52,00:32:56,"So even from the very first moment of cinemas,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,"they were saying, ""Let's not have it too dark"
00:32:58,00:33:00,"""because you never know what's gonna happen."""
00:33:00,00:33:02,"- Exactly. - Imagine, if they'd stuck to it,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,I wonder how many children wouldn't have been conceived
00:33:04,00:33:07,in the back row of a cinema.
00:33:07,00:33:10,It could have done damage to the population of the world.
00:33:10,00:33:11,"- Seaved as well. - No, it would have ruined"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"a lot of people's cinema experiences,"
00:33:13,00:33:14,"wouldn't it, in their use?"
00:33:14,00:33:16,- There's a cinema that's reopened in Leeds recently
00:33:16,00:33:18,"called the Hyde Park Picture House,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"and they are gas lamp lit,"
00:33:20,00:33:23,and they basically were saying that the reason
00:33:23,00:33:24,that there were gas lamps in there
00:33:24,00:33:26,"was to stop the groping,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,"not necessarily hanky-panky,"
00:33:28,00:33:30,but actually attacking women in the dark
00:33:30,00:33:31,sitting in the cinema.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"And so as they were restoring it,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,they've been putting up photos online
00:33:34,00:33:36,"of all the things that they're finding,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,like sort of under the floorboards
00:33:38,00:33:38,"and the seats and stuff,"
00:33:38,00:33:42,and one thing they're finding is giant hatpins.
00:33:42,00:33:43,"And this used to be a suffragette thing,"
00:33:43,00:33:44,where it's suffins. - Hatpins.
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- Yeah, you would have,"
00:33:45,00:33:47,they had to legislate the length of hatpins
00:33:47,00:33:49,"because they were being used as weapons,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,"but in the cinemas, women would bring hatpins with them"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"because guys would come and letch onto them,"
00:33:53,00:33:54,"and no one could see it,"
00:33:54,00:33:56,and they would start poking them
00:33:56,00:33:57,"with the old hatpin. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:33:57,00:33:58,- Nice.
00:33:58,00:34:00,"- 'Cause it was a thing that you had on you anyway,"
00:34:00,00:34:01,"like you could say,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,"""Oh no, this hatpin, it's not for stabbing people,"
00:34:03,00:34:05,"it's for keeping my hat on."""
00:34:05,00:34:06,"- But if you're a pervert,"
00:34:06,00:34:08,"and the woman you were perving on tap fell off,"
00:34:08,00:34:09,you knew you were in trouble.
00:34:09,00:34:11,(laughing)
00:34:11,00:34:12,"Get out of there, it's my advice."
00:34:12,00:34:13,- It's really cool.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"If we ever get back to Leeds for a live show or whatever,"
00:34:15,00:34:17,"you know, the cinema's back open."
00:34:17,00:34:20,It's the only gas-lit cinema in the world now.
00:34:20,00:34:21,It's pretty cool. - Wow.
00:34:21,00:34:23,- One of the things about the darkness in cinemas
00:34:23,00:34:27,"is that you know how if you go to the theater,"
00:34:27,00:34:30,"or the opera, or you know, whatever, it's dark."
00:34:30,00:34:33,"Well, that wasn't always the case either."
00:34:33,00:34:36,"And it mostly came through Gustav Mahler,"
00:34:36,00:34:38,"who decided everything should be dark,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,and he was probably inspired by the cinemas.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"So I think it seems that in the early 20th century,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,he insisted on dimming the auditorium.
00:34:48,00:34:49,"And actually, when he did so,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"the audience were protesting,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"because if you go to the opera in Vienna,"
00:34:53,00:34:54,"in the early 20th century,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,"you're wearing all your best clothes,"
00:34:56,00:34:57,you want everyone to see you.
00:34:57,00:34:58,"- Oh, yeah, you didn't go to see the opera."
00:34:58,00:35:00,"You went to see your rivals, didn't you?"
00:35:00,00:35:01,- Exactly.
00:35:01,00:35:02,- And the box over the other side of the audience.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"- Well, you didn't want it to be dark,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,and you have to concentrate on the opera.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"'Cause as we all know, opera is incredibly dull."
00:35:08,00:35:09,(laughing)
00:35:09,00:35:13,- It's literally just a filler to go and make people stress.
00:35:13,00:35:14,"- Yeah, that's great."
00:35:14,00:35:15,I didn't really like it.
00:35:15,00:35:16,I'd love to have visited back then
00:35:16,00:35:18,just to watch the social situation.
00:35:18,00:35:20,"I didn't realize it was literally social gazing, basically."
00:35:20,00:35:21,"- Oh, people went like that."
00:35:21,00:35:23,"- Every night of the season,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,and they were not concentrating on the play
00:35:25,00:35:26,beyond night one.
00:35:26,00:35:27,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:35:27,00:35:28,- Wow.
00:35:28,00:35:30,- There's a thing now where there's a lot of controversy
00:35:30,00:35:33,about when the lights should come back up
00:35:33,00:35:35,in a cinema at the end of the movie.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"- Well, I think it's useful, right?"
00:35:36,00:35:39,Because if the lights haven't come up
00:35:39,00:35:41,"and the credits are starting,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,that's probably 'cause there's an end Marvel thing
00:35:43,00:35:44,"at the end, right?"
00:35:44,00:35:45,- Yeah.
00:35:45,00:35:46,- That's usually what happens.
00:35:46,00:35:48,- Do they do like a little scene at the end?
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Yeah, like all the Marvel movies"
00:35:49,00:35:51,would have a little scene at the very end.
00:35:51,00:35:53,"- And there's never ever a horse to Marvel movie,"
00:35:53,00:35:54,and I respect that.
00:35:54,00:35:55,It's like that.
00:35:55,00:35:56,"- But they wouldn't put the lights up,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,so you kind of knew that was coming.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- Right.
00:35:59,00:36:00,- That's very clever.
00:36:00,00:36:01,- So what's this red-hot debate
00:36:01,00:36:02,about when the lights go on?
00:36:02,00:36:03,"- What the red-hot debate is,"
00:36:03,00:36:04,"it's a health and safety thing, right?"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"Most people, when the credits start rolling,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,want to get out of the cinema as quick as possible.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Maybe they need to be somewhere.
00:36:09,00:36:10,If you're in--
00:36:10,00:36:12,- Just hate seeing the names of people who've worked.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"I think it's just not like, ""For fuck's sake, guys,"
00:36:15,00:36:16,you've done the job.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"I don't need to know about who's the best boy."""
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- Oh, it's the bragging."
00:36:20,00:36:21,- So they want to get out of there.
00:36:21,00:36:22,That can be very dangerous.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"They can fall over, trip hazards, all that sort of stuff."
00:36:23,00:36:27,The issue is modern cinema uses its credit sequence now
00:36:27,00:36:28,as part of the film.
00:36:28,00:36:31,So there's one film where basically the final scene
00:36:31,00:36:34,is happening as the credits are rolling.
00:36:34,00:36:37,But you don't have the old-day projectionists
00:36:37,00:36:38,in most cinemas these days.
00:36:38,00:36:39,"Let's say in modern cinema,"
00:36:39,00:36:41,"they get a hard drive,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,and it has stamped throughout the hard drive.
00:36:43,00:36:44,"This is when the credits arrive,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,so they'll pre-program the lights to come up.
00:36:46,00:36:48,So a lot of people are missing the end of movies
00:36:48,00:36:51,in terms of the Atmos because lights are coming up.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"And so, yeah, it's a raging debate."
00:36:53,00:36:54,- How many films are running their credits
00:36:54,00:36:55,over the final scene?
00:36:55,00:36:58,That feels very avant-garde to me.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Dan, have you ever been,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,I ask you this 'cause you're Australian.
00:37:01,00:37:03,Have you ever been to Broome?
00:37:03,00:37:04,"- No, haven't actually, no."
00:37:04,00:37:07,- 'Cause it's a very long way away from the rest of Australia.
00:37:07,00:37:09,"It's in the Northwest,"
00:37:09,00:37:11,and it's got a cinema called Sun Pictures.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"And it's one of the first,"
00:37:13,00:37:14,it's a very early cinema.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"I don't know if it's Australia's first,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"but it's very old, 1916."
00:37:18,00:37:20,"It was, I just like it so much"
00:37:20,00:37:25,"'cause every night, the cinema at Broome was flooded"
00:37:25,00:37:28,"by the tide, it was on the coast,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,and there was tidal flooding.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"And most nights, the street would be submerged."
00:37:32,00:37:35,And apparently some old-timers who remembered it
00:37:35,00:37:38,back in the early days said you would be able to catch a fish
00:37:38,00:37:41,"during the screening around, under your feet."
00:37:41,00:37:42,- That's so good.
00:37:42,00:37:43,- Yeah.
00:37:43,00:37:44,- Great if you're watching Titanic or something.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"- Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:37:46,00:37:48,- It was more fun when projectionists
00:37:48,00:37:50,"had a bit more control on the day, wasn't it?"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"'Cause people, you almost had a relationship"
00:37:52,00:37:53,with your projectionists.
00:37:53,00:37:54,"And actually, even,"
00:37:54,00:37:57,"I think momentarily when you're in the cinema,"
00:37:57,00:37:58,"you could say, you know,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,put the music on louder in Nickelodeons or whatever.
00:38:00,00:38:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:38:01,00:38:05,"- Or in 1939, a newspaper in Newcastle reported"
00:38:05,00:38:07,on a really exciting innovation that it said
00:38:07,00:38:09,"is gonna take off in cinemas,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"where in musical films, of which there were quite a lot,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,"I kinda like singing in the rain or whatever,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"after one of the good songs,"
00:38:15,00:38:17,"they'd bring the lights down to black,"
00:38:17,00:38:20,"and then that was the cue for the audience to shout encore,"
00:38:20,00:38:21,"and if they shouted encore long enough,"
00:38:21,00:38:23,then you rewound the song and you played it again.
00:38:23,00:38:24,- That's great.
00:38:24,00:38:25,"- Oh, that is good."
00:38:25,00:38:26,- That's really good.
00:38:26,00:38:29,"- Could you say, I didn't quite, who's this?"
00:38:29,00:38:32,Can you play that better again?
00:38:32,00:38:34,Is she married to him?
00:38:34,00:38:36,"- Yeah, we've been incredibly annoying"
00:38:36,00:38:39,watching it with a granny or a child or me.
00:38:39,00:38:42,- You mentioned Nickelodeons.
00:38:42,00:38:43,"So that was in America, right?"
00:38:43,00:38:46,"And it was, you paid a nickel to get in,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,"and it was like usually the shop or something like that,"
00:38:48,00:38:49,"and they would pull all the blinds down,"
00:38:49,00:38:50,"make it really, really dark,"
00:38:50,00:38:53,and you'd be able to watch one of these old movies.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"And obviously very dark, and it was very cheap,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,"so they attracted the poorer classes,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,and so it was worried by higher class people
00:39:01,00:39:02,that they'd get pickpocketed or whatever
00:39:02,00:39:04,as soon as they went in.
00:39:04,00:39:07,"So again, the darkness was thought to be a problem."
00:39:07,00:39:10,"But in the UK, we had our own version of the Nickelodeons,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,and they were called Pennygaffs.
00:39:13,00:39:16,"And obviously the difference being that in the UK,"
00:39:16,00:39:17,"there were one penny to go in,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,whereas in America it was a nickel.
00:39:19,00:39:23,But the problem was a nickel was worth 2.5 pennies.
00:39:23,00:39:26,And so the people who were making the Pennygaffs
00:39:26,00:39:28,were making two and a half times less
00:39:28,00:39:30,than the Nickelodeon people.
00:39:30,00:39:32,- They just did it for the catchy title.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Call them Topnygaffs.
00:39:33,00:39:35,"- I guess it was like the smallest,"
00:39:35,00:39:38,"although they didn't have pennies in America, didn't they?"
00:39:38,00:39:39,So they could have done pennies as well.
00:39:39,00:39:41,"But yeah, it was just, I suppose they thought"
00:39:41,00:39:43,that it was the only price they could charge.
00:39:43,00:39:45,But there was a worry at the time.
00:39:45,00:39:47,I read some newspaper articles saying
00:39:47,00:39:50,that young children were robbing from their parents
00:39:50,00:39:53,so they'd be able to attend the Pennygaffs.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"- Always, always social worries."
00:39:56,00:39:58,"Any new technology, it's so interesting."
00:39:58,00:40:01,Just how is this going to ruin the youth?
00:40:01,00:40:02,- And the other thing that they did is
00:40:02,00:40:04,'cause these Pennygaffs were in shops.
00:40:04,00:40:05,"So it was a normal shop and they'd be like,"
00:40:05,00:40:07,"""Okay, we'll put a load of chairs up."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"We'll charge people a penny to come in."""
00:40:09,00:40:12,"But there was, people tried to shut them down."
00:40:12,00:40:14,And one way they did it was saying
00:40:14,00:40:16,you don't have a music hall license.
00:40:16,00:40:17,'Cause there was no cinema licenses
00:40:17,00:40:19,'cause cinemas didn't exist.
00:40:19,00:40:21,And so loads of them would play the movies
00:40:21,00:40:22,in complete silence.
00:40:22,00:40:24,"And so you would go in, it was completely dark"
00:40:24,00:40:26,and it was completely silent.
00:40:26,00:40:27,"You'd be watching the moving pictures,"
00:40:27,00:40:28,but there'd be no music.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"- And that 'cause usually you'd have a piano or something,"
00:40:30,00:40:31,wouldn't you? - Yeah.
00:40:31,00:40:32,- You'd be played live along with it.
00:40:32,00:40:33,"- Exactly, but they couldn't do that"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"because if they did, they'd get closed down"
00:40:35,00:40:36,for being a musical.
00:40:36,00:40:37,"- To be fair, I think that's fine."
00:40:37,00:40:39,"I mean, most of you are watching a silent film,"
00:40:39,00:40:41,"you're not watching it for the piano music, are you?"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"- Oh, no, the lot of music was composed specifically"
00:40:43,00:40:47,"for the reels, so they'd be handed the sweet music."
00:40:47,00:40:48,"- Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:48,00:40:48,- Ambience matters.
00:40:48,00:40:50,"- Well, I don't think it matters as much as"
00:40:50,00:40:52,"with a film with dialogue, for instance,"
00:40:52,00:40:53,where you wouldn't know what was happening.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"If you're watching a silent film,"
00:40:54,00:40:55,you still know what's happening.
00:40:55,00:40:57,"- I would like more ambience in my movies, you know."
00:40:57,00:40:59,"Do you think Star Wars, which has dialogue,"
00:40:59,00:41:02,would be as good without the score?
00:41:02,00:41:03,The less experiment.
00:41:03,00:41:04,- So you should try that.
00:41:04,00:41:06,- Completely music-free or Indiana Jones or whatever.
00:41:06,00:41:08,"- Also, I need something to drown out James going,"
00:41:08,00:41:09,"""Who's that?"""
00:41:09,00:41:11,(all laughing)
00:41:11,00:41:12,- When did they marry?
00:41:12,00:41:15,(upbeat music)
00:41:15,00:41:19,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,and that is my fact.
00:41:21,00:41:24,My fact this week is that one of the oldest diving clubs
00:41:24,00:41:27,in Ireland is the Muff Diving Club.
00:41:27,00:41:28,- And?
00:41:28,00:41:29,What's so funny about that?
00:41:29,00:41:34,"- Nothing, it's interesting because it's how old it is."
00:41:34,00:41:37,It's one of the oldest.
00:41:37,00:41:38,- How old is it?
00:41:38,00:41:41,- We're talking a good like three decades.
00:41:41,00:41:42,- Wow.
00:41:42,00:41:43,- Oh my God.
00:41:43,00:41:47,"- Yeah, no, this is the Muff Diving Club."
00:41:47,00:41:48,"Yeah, it was just set up by a group of guys"
00:41:48,00:41:51,who obviously spotted a good gag and they wanted to do it.
00:41:51,00:41:52,And they've not only been pushing for it
00:41:52,00:41:55,"to be an old, long-lasting diving club,"
00:41:55,00:41:56,"but they want it to be the largest,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,the biggest membership of any diving club in the world.
00:41:59,00:42:02,"And so you go to their site, you can buy t-shirts,"
00:42:02,00:42:04,"you can buy, you can get a membership card."
00:42:04,00:42:06,- There's a lot more t-shirts selling
00:42:06,00:42:08,"than actual diving in this club, I think."
00:42:08,00:42:10,- I'm finding it so hard when I'm looking into it
00:42:10,00:42:11,and I still haven't got to the bottom of it
00:42:11,00:42:13,if any diving happens at all.
00:42:13,00:42:14,- What is a diving club?
00:42:14,00:42:15,What is a diving club?
00:42:15,00:42:16,- What do you get?
00:42:16,00:42:18,Diving instructors teach how to dive and scuba diving.
00:42:18,00:42:19,- Yeah.
00:42:19,00:42:21,"- Oh, I thought it was high diving."
00:42:21,00:42:24,"- Did you not even see the logo, did you research this?"
00:42:24,00:42:25,- I did not follow the link you said.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"I've tried, but I've got a child look on my computer."
00:42:28,00:42:31,- How interesting.
00:42:31,00:42:32,"I mean, you could have a high diving club as well."
00:42:32,00:42:35,People who like to high dive might get together
00:42:35,00:42:36,and practice together.
00:42:36,00:42:38,"- But if all your facts are about high diving,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,then you are going to be lost for the next half an hour.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"- I've gone purely Muff, actually, and Muff Directional."
00:42:43,00:42:44,"- Well, me too."
00:42:44,00:42:47,I went to the Irish version of companies house
00:42:47,00:42:50,to see how many other Muff companies there are in Ireland.
00:42:50,00:42:54,"Muff Engineering, Muff Service Station,"
00:42:54,00:42:56,"Muff Soap, Muff Direct."
00:42:56,00:42:57,- Muff Direct.
00:42:57,00:42:59,Is this all in Muff?
00:42:59,00:43:00,"- These are all real, they're all in Muff."
00:43:00,00:43:02,"Muff after school, and--"
00:43:02,00:43:03,(laughing)
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- I didn't know, you can't let other parents"
00:43:05,00:43:06,send your kids to that.
00:43:06,00:43:09,"- It's just like an after school place where kids go to,"
00:43:09,00:43:10,"like, while the parents are still working,"
00:43:10,00:43:13,and the Muff Liquor Company.
00:43:13,00:43:14,- No.
00:43:14,00:43:16,"- The Muff Liquor Company, this is really interesting."
00:43:16,00:43:18,"I went on their website,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,and it doesn't seem to be a joke at all.
00:43:20,00:43:21,"In fact, if you go on their website,"
00:43:21,00:43:22,it looks like they haven't realized
00:43:22,00:43:24,"that Muff Liquor could be quite rude,"
00:43:24,00:43:27,"because it's a proper, like, it's a vodka company,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"and they've got a history of this guy,"
00:43:29,00:43:32,the grandfather of the owner who started it
00:43:32,00:43:33,"all these years ago, and it's a--"
00:43:33,00:43:35,- So there's no sort of sly wink at the fact
00:43:35,00:43:37,"that this is an amusing phrase,"
00:43:37,00:43:39,like that salad company called Tost.
00:43:39,00:43:41,"- No, unless I've completely missed it."
00:43:41,00:43:42,- I think they've just gone deadpan.
00:43:42,00:43:43,"- No, I think you're right."
00:43:43,00:43:45,"I think it's just, we're in Muff, we make a liquor,"
00:43:45,00:43:46,let's put it out.
00:43:46,00:43:47,"- Well, fair enough."
00:43:47,00:43:50,"- They do know, but they've gone, we're above that."
00:43:50,00:43:51,"These fucking Muff Divers next door,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,we don't need to stoop to that level.
00:43:54,00:43:56,"We'll put it out there, we'll let people chuckle"
00:43:56,00:43:58,"to themselves, and we'll sell them some vodka."
00:43:58,00:44:00,No t-shirt necessary.
00:44:00,00:44:02,- I was reading an interview where a lady called Caitlyn
00:44:02,00:44:04,"was over in Australia, and she was on a TV show,"
00:44:04,00:44:05,"like a Family Fortunes kind of thing,"
00:44:05,00:44:07,"and she was from Muff, like, you know,"
00:44:07,00:44:10,"it's not got a big population Muff, but she was from there,"
00:44:10,00:44:13,"and the guy couldn't believe that she was from there,"
00:44:13,00:44:15,"and she said she went to a school that was called Holly Bush,"
00:44:15,00:44:17,"so that was a nice, another connection,"
00:44:17,00:44:20,"and she says that when you come, when you're driving in,"
00:44:20,00:44:24,"that there is a sign that says you are now entering Muff,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,"and I've not seen that online, I've been looking--"
00:44:27,00:44:28,- Seems plausible.
00:44:28,00:44:29,- It does seem plausible.
00:44:29,00:44:32,"You can say, you see welcome to Muff,"
00:44:32,00:44:33,but I haven't seen you are now entering Muff.
00:44:33,00:44:36,- House prices are struggling in Muff.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"- Oh yeah. - Yeah, apparently,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,the prices are lower than you might imagine.
00:44:40,00:44:42,- I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop on this joke.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"I can't tell what it is. - It's not joke, it's not joke."
00:44:44,00:44:46,"Well, it's for a slightly different reason you might think,"
00:44:46,00:44:50,"so you would find, like, people who live on shit house,"
00:44:50,00:44:53,"laying or whatever, they're always complaining,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"and the newspapers are like, ""I can't sell my house,"""
00:44:55,00:44:56,"or whatever. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:56,00:44:58,"- But in actual fact, the reason that they can't"
00:44:58,00:45:01,sell them very well is because they're on the border
00:45:01,00:45:04,"between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,"
00:45:04,00:45:08,and Brexit has meant that the bottom
00:45:08,00:45:11,has dropped out of the Muff market.
00:45:11,00:45:14,"- There we go, there we go."
00:45:14,00:45:16,"I knew, I knew something was coming."
00:45:16,00:45:17,- Was it worth it?
00:45:17,00:45:19,- It was worth it. - It was mortgage news
00:45:19,00:45:22,from Muff. - I was not a written joke.
00:45:22,00:45:24,(laughing)
00:45:24,00:45:27,- You were on the phone to a local estate agent.
00:45:27,00:45:30,"- So if I say this, am I technically right?"
00:45:30,00:45:32,(laughing)
00:45:32,00:45:34,"- Do you want to buy the house or not, it's dark in here."
00:45:34,00:45:37,(laughing)
00:45:37,00:45:39,"- Oh dear, shall we talk about muffs themselves?"
00:45:39,00:45:41,"- Yeah, let's do wet muffs. - Actual fur muffs"
00:45:41,00:45:44,"that people would wear, hand muffs, as it were,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,how you keep your hands warm.
00:45:46,00:45:48,They used to be completely gender-neutral.
00:45:48,00:45:49,"Men and women alike would wear muffs,"
00:45:49,00:45:53,"it was just a thing, 'cause it was really cold,"
00:45:53,00:45:54,it used to be a lot colder.
00:45:54,00:45:56,(laughing)
00:45:56,00:45:58,"- What, what, what, big guys?"
00:45:58,00:46:01,"- It used to be a big colder, but also they were more common."
00:46:01,00:46:03,"- In the 16th century, people did not have"
00:46:03,00:46:05,"well insulated homes, and clothes were,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,you didn't have lovely puffer jackets.
00:46:07,00:46:10,"People needed to keep warm, wearing fur muffs"
00:46:10,00:46:13,"to cover your hands, really useful."
00:46:13,00:46:15,- Furry muff. - Furry muff.
00:46:15,00:46:16,(laughing)
00:46:16,00:46:19,"And I think it came from muffulai,"
00:46:19,00:46:20,"which is a medieval Latin term,"
00:46:20,00:46:23,which describes these big leather winter mitts
00:46:23,00:46:24,that you'd wear in muffulai.
00:46:24,00:46:27,And there was a great article all about
00:46:27,00:46:28,"the history of the word muff,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,"on the Oxford University Press website,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,by Anatoly Lieberman.
00:46:33,00:46:35,"And it's all these different words come from muff,"
00:46:35,00:46:38,"so Danish moth means clown,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,"and Dickens uses muff to mean something,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,like an annoying person or a fool or whatever.
00:46:42,00:46:45,"German has muffeln, which means sulk,"
00:46:45,00:46:47,"miff, might come from muff."
00:46:47,00:46:49,"- Miff, miff. - I'm feeling a bit miffed."
00:46:49,00:46:50,"- Oh, miffed, right."
00:46:50,00:46:52,- You might really be actually muffed.
00:46:52,00:46:55,"- We say muff, we use muff in American football,"
00:46:55,00:46:55,it's a term. - Do you?
00:46:55,00:46:57,"Oh, you've muffed it?"
00:46:57,00:46:59,"- Yeah, that's what it means basically."
00:46:59,00:47:00,"As in someone kicks the ball to you,"
00:47:00,00:47:03,"and you try and catch it, and you don't quite catch it,"
00:47:03,00:47:04,"but the ball's still in place,"
00:47:04,00:47:06,"so someone else can get it, that's a muff."
00:47:06,00:47:08,"- Oh yeah, that's quite a technical term."
00:47:08,00:47:10,"'Cause I would say, yeah, you've muffed it to mean sort of,"
00:47:10,00:47:11,"oh, you just messed it up."
00:47:11,00:47:13,"- You do say that, and I actually checked"
00:47:13,00:47:15,"all my WhatsApp messages,"
00:47:15,00:47:17,and you're the only person who's ever
00:47:17,00:47:18,WhatsApp'd me the word muff.
00:47:18,00:47:19,- No. - Really?
00:47:19,00:47:20,- Yes. - And to mean muffed it up?
00:47:20,00:47:21,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:21,00:47:22,"- Oh, that is interesting."
00:47:22,00:47:23,I'm gonna search my WhatsApp.
00:47:23,00:47:25,"- Well, no, not now."
00:47:25,00:47:26,"- Oh, okay, yeah, I'll do it later."
00:47:26,00:47:28,"- Yeah, so be it."
00:47:28,00:47:29,- For a work.
00:47:29,00:47:31,(laughing)
00:47:31,00:47:34,- But muff is also slang for a woman's vulva.
00:47:34,00:47:35,- No.
00:47:35,00:47:36,- What?
00:47:36,00:47:37,(laughing)
00:47:37,00:47:37,- No.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"- I know, it's so weird."
00:47:38,00:47:39,- What? - Yeah.
00:47:39,00:47:41,"- Wait a minute, so what about the muff diving club?"
00:47:41,00:47:43,"That would be- - So I think that could be,"
00:47:43,00:47:44,that should be a euphemism.
00:47:44,00:47:45,"- It sounds like Cunningling Dist, doesn't it?"
00:47:45,00:47:46,- What about the thing that James said
00:47:46,00:47:48,about the bottom dropping out of the muff market?
00:47:48,00:47:50,(laughing)
00:47:50,00:47:52,- That's even funnier than it was originally.
00:47:52,00:47:53,(laughing)
00:47:53,00:47:54,- I thought it was just funny
00:47:54,00:47:55,"'cause James said the word bottom,"
00:47:55,00:47:56,which is a bit funny.
00:47:56,00:47:57,(laughing)
00:47:57,00:47:59,"- No, it's actually true."
00:47:59,00:48:01,But also it's been- (laughing)
00:48:01,00:48:03,But it has been slang for that for so long.
00:48:03,00:48:05,I like how quickly we turn this into slang.
00:48:05,00:48:08,So it started meaning a hand warmer in the 1590s.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"And by the 1690s, it meant a woman's pubic area."
00:48:11,00:48:13,"Because I suppose you carried it down there,"
00:48:13,00:48:15,it's big hairy things around your crotch.
00:48:15,00:48:16,So of course.
00:48:16,00:48:16,- It's 100 years.
00:48:16,00:48:18,That's a long time for it to make the leap.
00:48:18,00:48:19,"- Well, it's first written down there."
00:48:19,00:48:22,"- Yeah, I bet they've been saying it for decades."
00:48:22,00:48:24,"- Yeah, you can get muff warmers."
00:48:24,00:48:27,- Is that to warm your muff or?
00:48:27,00:48:27,- Yeah.
00:48:27,00:48:29,- I thought muff was a warmer.
00:48:29,00:48:30,- That's to warm you.
00:48:30,00:48:31,"- Yes, but the muff warmers warm the muff."
00:48:31,00:48:32,- I think you put your hand in the mouth.
00:48:32,00:48:33,- But who warms the muff warmers?
00:48:33,00:48:36,(laughing)
00:48:36,00:48:37,- They were little ceramic things
00:48:37,00:48:39,that you would fill up with hot water.
00:48:39,00:48:42,And I imagine actually that you'd leave them in the muff.
00:48:42,00:48:43,"- Yeah, you would."
00:48:43,00:48:44,- And then when you're going out.
00:48:44,00:48:45,- That's clever.
00:48:45,00:48:46,- You warm the muff up.
00:48:46,00:48:47,Maybe you're going out on an hour.
00:48:47,00:48:49,"You say, well, pop the muff warmer in the muff."
00:48:49,00:48:50,Then you come to go out.
00:48:50,00:48:52,You just get your muff as lovely and warm.
00:48:52,00:48:53,- Andy. - Yeah.
00:48:53,00:48:55,- Idea.
00:48:55,00:48:56,Have you got any money to invest?
00:48:56,00:48:57,- Yeah.
00:48:57,00:48:58,- Good.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"Okay, so a mannequin."
00:49:01,00:49:02,- Yeah.
00:49:02,00:49:05,- But it's heated and you put your coat on the mannequin.
00:49:05,00:49:06,"And then when you go out,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,you can take a nice warm coat and put it on.
00:49:08,00:49:09,"- Oh, yes."
00:49:09,00:49:10,- Ring the dragons.
00:49:10,00:49:11,(laughing)
00:49:11,00:49:12,- Ring the dragons.
00:49:12,00:49:13,- That's great.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"- Or if you're really wealthy,"
00:49:14,00:49:17,you just have a human coat warmer.
00:49:17,00:49:19,Someone who wears your coat for half an hour.
00:49:19,00:49:20,- Yeah.
00:49:20,00:49:20,- Before you go out.
00:49:20,00:49:21,- I see that.
00:49:21,00:49:22,"- Oh, yeah."
00:49:22,00:49:24,- Mine is just a one-off purchase
00:49:24,00:49:26,whereas yours is more of a subscription one.
00:49:26,00:49:27,(laughing)
00:49:27,00:49:28,"- Very much so, yes."
00:49:28,00:49:28,"- Yeah, I do see that."
00:49:28,00:49:30,"- I mean, when you get into bed,"
00:49:30,00:49:31,"it might be nice to,"
00:49:31,00:49:32,"I mean, a warmer bed is not,"
00:49:32,00:49:34,"I know you two are weird as you like cold beds,"
00:49:34,00:49:36,but I like getting into a bed that's slightly warm
00:49:36,00:49:38,on a winter's night.
00:49:38,00:49:39,- Yeah.
00:49:39,00:49:41,- Do you do like they used to do on the grand tour
00:49:41,00:49:43,where they would put a live pig in their bed
00:49:43,00:49:45,before they went to bed to warm it up
00:49:45,00:49:46,and to get rid of bed bugs?
00:49:46,00:49:47,- Is that a real thing?
00:49:47,00:49:48,"- Yeah, that's what they used to do."
00:49:48,00:49:49,- On the grand tour.
00:49:49,00:49:50,You saw the Clarkson show.
00:49:50,00:49:51,(laughing)
00:49:51,00:49:53,"- Wait, what were you talking about?"
00:49:53,00:49:54,That's what I thought you were talking about.
00:49:54,00:49:56,- I was talking about when would it have been
00:49:56,00:49:59,in the 18th century when you would go around Europe.
00:49:59,00:49:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:49:59,00:50:02,- Have you heard of Muff Boutiques?
00:50:02,00:50:03,This is great.
00:50:03,00:50:04,- Uh-huh.
00:50:04,00:50:05,- Okay.
00:50:05,00:50:06,"- Okay, not a company in Muff."
00:50:06,00:50:07,- No.
00:50:07,00:50:07,This was a thing.
00:50:07,00:50:10,It's from a book by a 19th century dandy
00:50:10,00:50:11,called Octave Ouzanne
00:50:11,00:50:13,and he was an admirer of ladies' accessories
00:50:13,00:50:15,and he wrote a book which was called
00:50:15,00:50:16,L'Hombre Legante Le Morgant
00:50:16,00:50:19,"which means the parasol, the glove, the muff."
00:50:19,00:50:21,"And he said that in Renaissance Italy,"
00:50:21,00:50:23,there were Muff Boutiques
00:50:23,00:50:26,where you could either go in and buy a Muff
00:50:26,00:50:28,"or in the off season when it gets nice and warm,"
00:50:28,00:50:29,"you don't need your Muff anymore,"
00:50:29,00:50:32,you go and you store it in the Muff Boutique
00:50:32,00:50:34,and they delouse them.
00:50:34,00:50:36,"I mean, if true, that's very funny."
00:50:36,00:50:38,"- It's a brilliant book that, isn't it?"
00:50:38,00:50:39,- It does sound great.
00:50:39,00:50:41,I've only read second hand about it.
00:50:41,00:50:42,"- There was a, it's actually quite,"
00:50:42,00:50:44,it's all available online and it's quite short.
00:50:44,00:50:45,"So I did read it and yeah,"
00:50:45,00:50:48,"there's the Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff"
00:50:48,00:50:49,and it was published by this guy
00:50:49,00:50:51,in response to the previous year's
00:50:51,00:50:54,incredibly successful The Fan
00:50:54,00:50:55,which was his history of The Fan.
00:50:55,00:50:56,"- Oh, that was great."
00:50:56,00:50:57,"Yeah, yeah, I know that book."
00:50:57,00:50:58,- Really?
00:50:58,00:50:59,Published in 1881.
00:50:59,00:51:00,Were you there for the first?
00:51:00,00:51:01,"- No, I know a modern one."
00:51:01,00:51:03,Someone wrote a whole book about.
00:51:03,00:51:06,(all laughing)
00:51:06,00:51:07,"- No, it's great."
00:51:07,00:51:08,"The Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff."
00:51:08,00:51:10,"And he tells, my favorite story from it was,"
00:51:10,00:51:12,he says there's an account in the late 1500s
00:51:12,00:51:14,of towers being besieged
00:51:14,00:51:16,and at the front line of defenders
00:51:16,00:51:19,who are defending themselves from the siege
00:51:19,00:51:22,"is a woman with muffs and a halberd in hand,"
00:51:22,00:51:25,a halberd being a sort of poke sticky thing.
00:51:25,00:51:26,- Spear.
00:51:26,00:51:27,"- Spear, thank you."
00:51:27,00:51:28,(all laughing)
00:51:28,00:51:30,A woman with a muff defending the city.
00:51:30,00:51:31,- Why?
00:51:31,00:51:32,For a reason.
00:51:32,00:51:33,- Keeping her hands.
00:51:33,00:51:34,"- Keeping her hands warm while,"
00:51:34,00:51:35,'cause you gotta be quite dexterous
00:51:35,00:51:37,"to operate a spear, I suppose."
00:51:37,00:51:38,- Absolutely.
00:51:38,00:51:39,- You can't prod a haldane with cold hands.
00:51:39,00:51:40,Can you?
00:51:40,00:51:41,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:51:41,00:51:42,"- Very difficult, yeah."
00:51:42,00:51:43,- There were muff chains
00:51:43,00:51:45,"which were to hang your muff, I think,"
00:51:45,00:51:46,when you're not using it.
00:51:46,00:51:47,"Your hands out of your muff,"
00:51:47,00:51:48,you just put it on your muff chain around your neck.
00:51:48,00:51:49,"- Oh, right."
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- Oh, right."
00:51:50,00:51:51,- Muff pistols.
00:51:51,00:51:52,- Okay.
00:51:52,00:51:52,- I don't think--
00:51:52,00:51:53,- To shoot your muff.
00:51:53,00:51:54,- To shoot from your muff
00:51:54,00:51:55,if you're approached by footpads.
00:51:55,00:51:56,"- Oh, I see."
00:51:56,00:51:58,They weren't like the sex pistols.
00:51:58,00:52:00,(all laughing)
00:52:00,00:52:02,It was like a female sex pistols.
00:52:02,00:52:04,(all laughing)
00:52:04,00:52:07,"- No, that was just a tiny gun for ladies"
00:52:07,00:52:08,to protect yourself if you were out and about
00:52:08,00:52:11,and someone approaches you to rob you.
00:52:11,00:52:12,- One place in Ireland
00:52:12,00:52:13,"that would have used the muff divers,"
00:52:13,00:52:15,"I think, quite usefully,"
00:52:15,00:52:19,is a town where the first transatlantic telegraph cable
00:52:19,00:52:21,was laid in the 1880s.
00:52:21,00:52:22,"- Oh, yeah."
00:52:22,00:52:24,"- So that was there, that was in Ireland."
00:52:24,00:52:27,It was a little place called Spunkane.
00:52:27,00:52:28,"- Mm-hmm, yeah."
00:52:28,00:52:31,- That's where the first transatlantic cable was laid.
00:52:31,00:52:31,- Spunkane.
00:52:31,00:52:32,- Spunkane.
00:52:32,00:52:33,- Sounds great.
00:52:33,00:52:34,"- Okay, here's another fact."
00:52:34,00:52:38,The word spunk also can mean ejaculate.
00:52:38,00:52:39,- No.
00:52:39,00:52:40,- What?
00:52:40,00:52:41,- But that's a really funny name
00:52:41,00:52:43,for a place to start the cable.
00:52:43,00:52:45,"- I thought it was just like a good-looking dude,"
00:52:45,00:52:47,"you know, spunky, you know?"
00:52:47,00:52:48,That's disgusting now.
00:52:48,00:52:51,"- Spunkane, and the town of Muff,"
00:52:51,00:52:53,"where the original fact was,"
00:52:53,00:52:55,is where Amelia Earhart landed
00:52:55,00:52:57,when she did her first solo flight.
00:52:57,00:52:58,- Cool.
00:52:58,00:52:59,- Not our last one.
00:52:59,00:53:01,"- No, unfortunately, we don't know exactly"
00:53:01,00:53:02,where she landed that time.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"But her first one, she landed"
00:53:04,00:53:06,just outside the village of Muff.
00:53:06,00:53:07,"- Oh, wow."
00:53:07,00:53:09,- The man who composed the theme music for Gladiators
00:53:09,00:53:11,is called Muff Murphy.

00:53:17,00:53:18,It's a man's name.
00:53:18,00:53:19,"- Muff, I don't know any Muffs."
00:53:19,00:53:21,- Or maybe it's a Nick name as well.
00:53:21,00:53:22,"- Yeah, I don't know any Muffs."
00:53:22,00:53:24,- I'm not familiar with the name Muff.
00:53:24,00:53:25,"- The brother of Spencer Davis,"
00:53:25,00:53:28,who obviously founded the Spencer Davis group.
00:53:28,00:53:28,- Obviously.
