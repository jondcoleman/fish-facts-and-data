00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.720
 Before we get going, we have a very exciting announcement.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.060
 Anna?

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.900
 - Thanks, Dan.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.180
 Our announcement is that our esteemed colleague,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.180
 Andrew Hunter Murray, famous podcaster, comedian galore.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.120
 Does one say that?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.760
 He's also a published author.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.800
 I'm sure you've read his first two novels,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.120
 which were brilliant thrillers.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.340
 He's written a third, which is so much fun so far.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400
 I'm only about a quarter of the way through,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.760
 because look, he didn't send me the proof on time,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.760
 but it is fantastic.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.200
 It's called a beginner's guide to breaking and entering.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.080
 It's really fun.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.440
 It's got elements of comedy.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.780
 It's got elements of thriller in it so far.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.000
 I really love the main character

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 'cause he's doing something

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.800
 that I can really imagine myself doing in life.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.400
 Don't just believe us.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 It's been complemented by The Guardian,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 which says it has a propulsive plot,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.040
 an ingenious narrator and lashings of intrigue,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.280
 making it a genuine and thoroughly enjoyable page turner.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.480
 The Sunday Times has called it hugely entertaining,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.120
 laugh out loud funny and impossible to put down.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.320
 Dan Shriver, what do you say?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.280
 - Well, I actually am a third of the way through the book.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.040
 And I can say-- - All right,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 and I need to break? - It absolutely gets better

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 after the first quarter.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.960
 So if you want your books great in the first quarter

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.120
 and then accelerating to an even better place,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.040
 you gotta get a beginner's guide to breaking and entering.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.420
 It is the story of a guy who breaks

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.320
 into the second homes of the wealthy.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.200
 He lives in them.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
 They don't know it.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 He steals nothing, but one day,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.080
 after he accidentally bumps into a group of people

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.740
 who also do the same thing, they witness a murder

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.400
 and they get embroiled in a thing that they can't escape.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 And it's one of those comedy capers

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.280
 that just gets further and further into the chaos of it.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.120
 If you've read Richard Osman's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.680
 The Thursday Murder Club series,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 this is the perfect accompaniment to it.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.240
 It's comedy, it's thriller, page turner, you're gonna love it.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.880
 - So go to your local bookshop or any online bookseller

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.480
 or Amazon, look up a beginner's guide

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 to breaking and entering by Andrew Hunter Murray now.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320
 - Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.240
 - On with the show.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.820
 (upbeat music)

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:15.840
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.040
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.200
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.320
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.640
 James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.400
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.520
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that children's author,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.560
 Margaret Wise Brown, died from doing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.600
 an over-enthusiastic can-can kick.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.400
 - I think now having read up on her,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.160
 she would like that we laughed just then.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.480
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.320
 - Definitely.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.400
 - So is there an under-enthusiastic can-can kick?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.480
 Is there such a thing as that?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.320
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.200
 I've been to the Moulin Rouge a few times

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.400
 and asked for my money back.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.200
 Barely got above the knee.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.520
 - You've got your protractor out in the front row.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.600
 (laughing)

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.720
 - That was disgusting, I mean.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.280
 They really looked out at that.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.560
 So Margaret Wise Brown is most famous

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.440
 for a children's book called Good Night Moon.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 She's written lots of others, but this is the biggie.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.960
 What I liked about this is in this podcast,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.240
 the number of times I've got a book out

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.920
 because we've talked about that author

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.840
 and I've got about 25% of the way through it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.280
 and never finished that one.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.360
 This is probably the first time

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.280
 I've got through the whole book.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.120
 - Oh, you finished it?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.960
 - I managed to finish it.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.400
 - All 140-ish words, right?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.640
 (laughing)

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.080
 - I thought you were going to say pages then.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.720
 I was going to say, no, that wasn't the book I read.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.960
 Yeah, it's a very short book.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.880
 Actually, the first, maybe the first of those board books,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.640
 you know, that you give to children,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.680
 apparently it was the first of those.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.720
 But she unfortunately died in 1952.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.680
 She just had emergency surgery on either an ovarian cyst

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.600
 or an inflamed appendix, depending on what you read.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.040
 And she was ready to leave the hospital

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.440
 and be carried, as she said,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.480
 in a sedentary by four of the village boys

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.880
 to a hilltop estate where she would convalesce,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.240
 but to show the medical staff that she was in good health.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.640
 She kicked up her leg, can-can style,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.280
 and she had a blood clot, dislodged it, blacked out,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.120
 and never died again.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.480
 - According to what I read, died instantly.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.320
 - Yeah.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.160
 - Like, can-can kicked and just out.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.680
 It's sad, obviously, but that's how I would love to go.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.200
 - Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 (laughing)

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 - It's a good way to go, I think,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.800
 if you've got to go at that age.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.880
 - Yeah, I mean, she was so young, she was 42.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.720
 And she was, the other cool thing about this,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.640
 she was on her way to meet, I think, her lover,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.480
 one of the junior rocker-fellas,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.800
 who was going to pick her up in a boat

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.440
 and sail away to Tunisia with her.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.920
 - Yeah, he was on his way, on the boat.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.760
 - Yeah.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.600
 - So sad.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.480
 - I think that was maybe the saddest thing,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.440
 is that she'd had a very unlucky love life,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.880
 and she'd met this guy sort of the year before, I think,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.880
 and I was reading a bit of a biography of her

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.720
 that he wrote many, many years later,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.160
 and he was so, obviously, so in love with her,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.760
 and she had finally found the love of her life.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.440
 And then, yeah, bam, he was nicknamed Pebble,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.160
 but it was a still, James Stillman, rocker-fella junior,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.360
 and he was junior, he was 24.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.280
 - Yeah. - Oh, wow.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.200
 - Toy boy.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.760
 - He later married a descendant of the Carnegie's.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.840
 So it's a real powerhouse couple of that,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.320
 the rocker-fellas and the Carnegie's.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.280
 - Yeah.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.000
 - Carnegie's. - Carnegie's, I would say.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.640
 - Carnegie's are the ones who come up to you in the bar

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.320
 and say, "That's a shit shirt."

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.640
 (all laughing)

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.400
 - That's not how you neg.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.920
 The neg is a compliment, and then a backhanded compliment.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.080
 - What? - What should I be doing?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.400
 - You should say, "I love your shirt.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.440
 "I saw six people wearing it earlier tonight."

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.920
 - Oh, that's good, that's a true better than mine.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.920
 (all laughing)

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.520
 - But yeah, Margaret Was Brown was a absolute legend.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.360
 - What a gal.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.800
 - She was, and she sort of, the fact is,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.360
 is that she's often referred to

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 as almost like a Hollywood dame.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.720
 Like she was going around in high-class parties,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.040
 she was doing the weirdest of stuff socially.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.360
 She took all the-- - Oh yeah.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.040
 - She had things like the Bird Brain Club,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.120
 which it was a club where the decision was

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.080
 anyone who was part of it.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.920
 If they said on the day, "It's Christmas,"

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.600
 you have to go over and celebrate Christmas.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.440
 - It's a fun idea.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.280
 - It's a great idea. - I got an idea.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.200
 - Oh, it's a tiresome idea.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.720
 It's a fun idea, the first two times you do it.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.920
 And even by the third time, it's annoying.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.560
 - I think it was used wisely.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.040
 - I'm sure some people were kicked out

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.560
 of the Christmas club or whatever it was.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.920
 - Bird Brain Society. - Bird Brain Society.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.480
 She could run as fast as a dog?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.120
 - There we go. (all laughing)

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.240
 - Which dog?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.400
 Not a Greyhound.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.880
 - No, you're absolutely right.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.080
 Well, I've written in my notes, she was a lifelong beagle.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.120
 She was actually a beagle-er,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.920
 which is where you trace hairs on foot,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.840
 and you have a load of beagle dogs with you.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.840
 And supposedly she was noted for her ability

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.640
 to keep pace with running beagles.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.280
 - Her relationship with rabbits gets intense

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.600
 when she's an author, because she published a book

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.400
 which was called Little Fur Family.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.200
 The illustrator was the same guy, Gareth Williams,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 who did the illustrations for Charlotte's Web.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.480
 She had a first print run of 75,000 copies for this book,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.880
 and each edition of it was wrapped entirely in the fur

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.080
 of a New Zealand rabbit.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.440
 - No. - Yeah, I don't believe you.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.400
 - And were they all ones that she caught herself

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.760
 while being a beagle? (all laughing)

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.600
 - Yeah, I have no idea.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.680
 - It's amazing, isn't it? - Sorry, no.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.800
 - Apparently it was because of a surrealist artist

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.680
 called Meret Oppenheim, who you might know this,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.600
 it's like a teacup with rabbit fur on the inside

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.480
 and the outside, actually, you don't know that.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.760
 It's in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is it, I think?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.960
 And it was the first surrealist thing that they bought.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.360
 But yeah, she decided she would do her own thing

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.520
 with books and make them really furry.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.600
 - But it's 75,000. - 75,000?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.440
 - Yeah, it's mad.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.560
 - Dan, you mentioned that you haven't read Good Night Moon,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.600
 so you won't be aware, as I am,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.880
 as someone who reads it every single night, my daughter.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.080
 The main character in that is also a rabbit.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.960
 They're both rabbits, so having read this about her,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.080
 I look at that completely differently now,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.680
 every page where you see this old rabbit in a rocking chair.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.280
 - It's a fantastic book, we should say.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.760
 - It's so good. - It's so good.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.680
 - It's pretty good, it's like one of the first ones

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.840
 that just was slightly weird and just rhyming stuff.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.680
 - Yeah.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.160
 - It's just a little bunny going to bed,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.440
 and it's all the stuff in the room,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.680
 Good Night Blocks and Good Night Socks and all that.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.240
 It's just very gentle, sort of lulling for child.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.960
 I'm sure I was read it lots, I think.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.520
 - But she also didn't like children,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.440
 as well as not liking rabbits.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.560
 It's kind of weird to make a book about rabbits for children,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.640
 if you don't like either of those things.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.000
 - Yeah, 'cause she also did another book,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.400
 which had a print run of 80,000,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.600
 which was entirely wrapped in the skin of five-year-olds.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.960
 - She said in an article for Life Magazine,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.120
 she said, "I don't especially like children."

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.040
 And in another note to someone,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.000
 she wrote, "How many children have you got?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.080
 "I have 50 bucks."

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.120
 So I think she saw the bucks as her.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.400
 - All right, they are less trouble.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.440
 Have you seen all the Easter eggs in Good Night Moon?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.280
 This is just what happens

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.760
 when you have read it over 100 times now.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.000
 - I don't know how to read it again.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.840
 - You are.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.520
 - There's so much you start to discover.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.480
 - Don't tell me it's the same with Les Miserables,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.680
 'cause I'm not reading that again.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.560
 - As long as you've got the illustrated version.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.040
 Well, I won't give it away so you can discover it,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.080
 but if you do have a copy,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.640
 look at the clock on every page and look at the moon.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.480
 - To go backwards?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.320
 - No, it doesn't.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.160
 - Oh, like memento.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.200
 - That would be so much better.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.960
 Why didn't you, it just goes forwards.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800
 Just goes forwards.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.840
 And so you know that it takes an hour and 10 minutes

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.280
 to get this rabbit to sleep when you want to go forwards,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.920
 which is actually a long time.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.080
 And look at the book on the bedside table.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.200
 What do you think the book on the bedside table is?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.360
 - Is it the book itself?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.800
 - It's the book itself.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.640
 - Is it?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.480
 - That's surreal.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.320
 - It hasn't met her.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.360
 - Good Night Moon, still innovating all these years later.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.680
 - She wrote her book, she said,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.320
 in a sort of 15 to 20 minute period.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.600
 That's the first draft.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.680
 And then the second draft.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.020
 - This is all about your books, isn't it?

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.860
 - This is all about your books, isn't it?

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.240
 (laughing)

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.600
 - So it takes a 15 to 20 minutes for the first draft.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.440
 And then it takes her between one and two years

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.280
 for the second draft.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.880
 - Oh, and that's where you go and rub no second draft.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.760
 (laughing)

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.340
 - Oh, the edit is hard, the edit is hard.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.960
 - Can we talk about the great thing she did

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.800
 with the royalties?

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.640
 - Yes.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.480
 - It's bizarre.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.920
 Margaret Weisbrand gave the royalties

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.960
 to every single one of her books,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.080
 basically in her entire estate.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.560
 She said, I leave it all to this little nine year old boy

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.200
 who lives next door, who I'm friendly with,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.000
 and you know, I'm 40.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.080
 Nothing's gonna happen to me.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.080
 I'll probably change the world

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.400
 when I gain dependence or whatever.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.560
 Anyway, she then dies.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.400
 - Two years later, right?

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.600
 - Two years later, she dies.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.280
 So, and also Good Night Moon was on the,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.000
 it was not selling big anymore.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.080
 It was probably gonna go out of print shortly.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.360
 Obviously it's never been out of print.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.900
 It's sold millions of copies.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.600
 And he was called Albert Clarke.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.320
 And by the time he was 21, there was $75,000 waiting for him.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.760
 Unfortunately, he had become a bit of a tear away.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.600
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.820
 - A bit of a, a bit of a.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.760
 - A bit of a rogue.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.440
 - Bit of a rogue, burglary, joyriding, vandalism.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.200
 He's a very, very, very naughty boy.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.680
 - Kicked out of school for five,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.520
 saw that sort of.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.840
 - Yeah, and he had this bizarre life

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920
 where he was always broke and getting into trouble

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.440
 and being arrested and banged up.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.840
 And then every year, publishers would say,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.360
 right, there's another two million quid waiting for you.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.200
 - It's like the lotto lout.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.040
 Do you remember him?

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.080
 - No, I don't.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.280
 - Do you not remember him?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.000
 He was like, when the lottery first started,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.080
 I'm sure he's a very nice guy.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.360
 So apologies if you're listening,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.520
 but he won a load of money on the lottery

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.280
 and then just spent it all within like two years or something.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.880
 And he was in all the tabloids as being a bit of a rogue.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.720
 But it's like that.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.320
 But then if then, once he spent it all,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.160
 he won the lottery again.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.600
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.560
 So the first initial batch of money that he got,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.160
 he gave a lot to his parents, which was nice.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.760
 He gave $35,000 to his parents.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.720
 He spent $4,000 on clothes for him and his two brothers.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.680
 He had two brothers.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.240
 And then he bought a Chevy Impala.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.720
 As soon as he took it out of the shop,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.000
 got smashed into, immediately dented it.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.080
 - That's not his fault.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.840
 - No, no, but I read an interview with him

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.200
 where he was sort of saying, look, yes, I've done bad things.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.680
 But also just like, bad things just happen all the time

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.440
 that throw me into situations of such weird details.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.840
 It's like he had a dented car

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.600
 and 14 pairs of alligator shoes.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.720
 That's all he had in life.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.360
 And then the next check comes in.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.160
 And the only thing he's kept with him wherever he goes

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.080
 is the will.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.840
 He keeps the will that she wrote.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.000
 - And the alligator shoes.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.120
 The naked man wearing alligators on his feet,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.960
 collapsing and weird.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.800
 - Isn't it weird?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.880
 Like she was putting rabbits on her bucks.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.120
 He was putting alligators on his feet.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.360
 This is like the least vegan fact we've ever done.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.960
 (all laughing)

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.400
 - I just mentioned her love life earlier,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.040
 which was, again, not something you imagine

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.880
 when you're reading it,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.080
 'cause you picture this old lady.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.240
 He's writing these books.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.120
 - Also, her name sounds old, doesn't it?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.160
 Margaret Wise Brown.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.800
 It doesn't sound like wise, yeah.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.120
 I suppose in the 1920s, that was a really sexy name.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.480
 - Margaret is now a more old fashioned name.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.320
 I think that's fair.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.160
 Is that fair to say?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.360
 - Well, my mom's a Margaret.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.200
 - There we go.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.040
 - And she's very cool.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.880
 - Yeah.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.720
 - Coming every weekend.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.880
 (all laughing)

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.240
 - She had an interesting love life.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.920
 - She had his mom.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.040
 And so did Margaret Wise Brown.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.040
 And she went out with a woman called Michael Strange,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.920
 confusingly, who, I like the LA Times in 1992,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.160
 described Michael Strange as a writer and performer

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.760
 of limited gifts and voracious ego.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.920
 And she did seem to be not a great partner

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920
 for Margaret Wise Brown,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.640
 but they got together in 1940

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.360
 and pretty much lived together

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.720
 or lived in next door apartments

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.360
 until Strange died in 1950.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.240
 - They did share a butler.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.200
 - The two ladies.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.040
 - Yeah, so they had an apartment opposite each other.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.400
 So in the corridor,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.920
 the butler would just sort of go out the door,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.720
 go through the next door and sort of just--

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.560
 - Wait, did they know?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.080
 Did they know that they were sharing a butler?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.920
 Or was he doing a sort of--

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.240
 (all laughing)

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.080
 - This is terrifying.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.680
 - Take the mustache off, yeah.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.520
 - You don't need to take the--

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.360
 - Yeah, why would you do that?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.280
 - 'Cause they're dating.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.120
 - Oh, you're right, yeah.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.960
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.800
 How's your butler?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.920
 Well, he's still without a mustache.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.760
 - He must get one.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.080
 Mine looks dashing.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.440
 - That was pretty fun.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440
 That's a great thing to do.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.880
 - I looked at a few other kids' authors.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.200
 Well, basically I went through my daughter's books

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.560
 and googled all of their authors.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.880
 And I was looking at the tiger who came to tea.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.720
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.520
 - Which is by Judith Kerr.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.440
 And Michael Rosen, who was the children's laureate

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.560
 and the writer and stuff,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.960
 he has drawn parallels between the tiger who came to tea

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.800
 and Judith Kerr's early life.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.160
 'Cause Judith Kerr's father was on a death list

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.380
 from the Nazis.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.880
 And they had to leave Nazi Germany

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.840
 when she was nine years old.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.680
 - Wow.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.480
 - And Michael Rosen said that maybe the tiger

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.600
 is based on the threat that they faced

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.080
 when they were children,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.880
 because it disrupted their life so much.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.560
 They took everything that the family owned,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.280
 like the tiger who came to tea drinks all of the water

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.200
 and eats everything in the cupboards and stuff like that.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.560
 And Judith Kerr has said

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.400
 that the tiger represents nothing more than a tiger.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.480
 (all laughing)

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.880
 - Well, I believe Michael, though.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.120
 - Yeah, I love you too.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.080
 - It's got a very weird ending, the tiger who came to tea.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.280
 - Yeah, well.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.560
 - Doesn't the tiger just leave?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.200
 - No, I think daddy comes home.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.080
 And it's really annoying because, you know,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.000
 the tiger's had all his, like--

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.840
 - Drunk all his beer?

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.840
 - Drunk all his beer and had all the food for tea.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.680
 - Yeah.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.520
 - So then--

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.000
 - He says, "I've got a very good idea.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.840
 "We'll go to the cafe and have sausage and chips

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.680
 "and ice cream."

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.520
 - Oh yeah.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.760
 - Yeah, daddy takes them all out for--

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.460
 - Meanwhile, there's a drunk tiger feeling that.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.440
 - The tiger goes unaddressed, exactly, yeah.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.160
 - No, because then the next morning,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.000
 they buy loads of food to fill the pantry up

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.080
 and they buy a tin of tiger food in case he comes back

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.280
 and he never did.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.240
 - Oh, really?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.080
 - Hmm.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.920
 - Interesting.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.660
 - I think if I was a dad walking back home,

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.880
 I opened the door,

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.400
 I see my three kids and my wife sitting by a table.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.760
 No, no, just like in my story.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.280
 And in the corner is a drunk tiger.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.040
 I do think my first instinct is to not make a deal of it.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.080
 Take kids, we're going out now.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.720
 - Okay, so, Dan, the tiger's already left

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.560
 when daddy comes home.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.880
 - Oh, I thought you said he was drunk in the--

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.640
 - No, so the daddy comes home and all the food's gone.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.520
 All the water's gone, there's no water in the tub.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.880
 - Oh yeah, wow.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.640
 - And Mummy and Sophie tell daddy what's happened

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.920
 and said the tiger came in and ate all of the food

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.160
 and drank all of the drinks and all of your beer

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.000
 and took all the water out of the taps

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.640
 and then daddy goes, let's go to a cafe.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.480
 That's how it works.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.120
 - It sounds like daddy doesn't believe a word of this.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.280
 It sounds like it's happened before.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.120
 - Yeah.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.120
 - And all the beer's gone, has it?

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.960
 Oh, the tiger, right, yeah.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.320
 - Someone's turned the water off, have they?

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.160
 - Okay.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.840
 - And the water bill over here, that's not been paid.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.120
 But the interesting thing about that

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.480
 is when they walk to the cafe, it's nighttime,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.680
 so all the street lights are on

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.520
 and all the cars have their headlights on,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.160
 but there's a little cat that's walking by

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.240
 near where they live that looks exactly like a tiger,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.720
 but it looks like a cat long.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.760
 - It's acknowledged as a--

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.640
 - No, it's not acknowledged,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.680
 but it's obviously like what inspired her lies.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.840
 - Yeah.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.240
 This drunken, reprobate lady's lies,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.280
 she booses up on her husband.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.120
 - I wish.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.560
 - Here's what we're gonna tell daddy.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.640
 (all laughing)

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.480
 - Tiger.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.520
 - He's never gonna believe it, man.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.480
 - I wish I'd been able to,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.240
 'cause I was on a sofa with Michael Rosen yesterday.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.080
 - Were you?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.560
 - Yeah, but it was such a long sofa

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.120
 that I couldn't ask him about this.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.480
 It was an enormously long sofa.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.360
 - Well, he wouldn't have heard you.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.200
 - Honestly, he wouldn't.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.040
 I would have had to get him and walk

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.880
 to the other end of the sofa.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.240
 - Oh, wait, did you genuinely think,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.840
 ah, I'd love to talk to this man,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.680
 this legend of literature?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.000
 Ah, the sofa's too long.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.720
 - He had picked the absolute opposite.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.360
 He had picked the furthest other part of the sofa

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.200
 and so on.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.400
 It was very clear to me

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.840
 that he wasn't looking for a pal.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.680
 - Right.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.520
 - Well, you were DFS.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.800
 (all laughing)

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.000
 - It was a call-as-o for as well,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.640
 so I could have walked the hypotenuse.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.140
 (all laughing)

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.720
 (upbeat music)

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.560
 and that is Anna.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.200
 - My fact this week is that the city of Matsuyama

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.680
 has over 90 post boxes specifically for mailing haiku.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.280
 - Mm-hmm, lovely.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.560
 - Or, as you could say, Matsuyama

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.560
 has over 90 post boxes for mailing haiku.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.000
 - Brilliant. - Is that right?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.120
 - It's right. - It's right.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.680
 - It's right. - It's amazing.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.280
 - Well done, Anna. - Why?

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.400
 - Why?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.240
 Why?

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.520
 - Why did you bother making that haiku?

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.960
 (all laughing)

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.440
 - That's bloody easy to make, aren't they?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.040
 This is the capital city of Shikoku Island,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.400
 which is one of Japan's islands.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.520
 And it's because the city sort of calls itself

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.240
 the home of haiku because very famous haiku poets

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.080
 lived there.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.560
 And so the first post box was installed in 1968

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.000
 to commemorate one of these poets' births.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.720
 And now they're all over the place.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.840
 They're like monuments and baths, public baths,

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.160
 and they're really beautiful as well

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.800
 and lots of different designs.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.680
 And every three months,

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.040
 the local haiku poets go to the post boxes

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.360
 or they send an envoy and they empty them out

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.280
 and then they judge all the entries.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.800
 - Oh, yeah. - And the winner

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.880
 gets published on the city's website.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.760
 - It's so good. - It's so great.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.240
 - I hope there's a walking trail.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.520
 There is between them, which is called the Taker Haiku.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.880
 - Lovely. - That would be good.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.720
 - Nice.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.560
 - But there is a walking trail.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.400
 Sorry to jump in on your joke.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.240
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't see it coming.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.720
 - You should be able to see by now that long,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.960
 that distant look in my eyes,

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.120
 but it shows something's brewing.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 - The fact he's been silent for two minutes done,

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.520
 that should have been a clue.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.400
 - Yeah, no, they do in this place as well,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.200
 the Matsuyama area.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.000
 They have certain haiku bars that you go into

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.360
 and you go up to the counter and you write a haiku

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.160
 and the cocktail they make you is based on your haiku.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.240
 - No. - It's just, you know,

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.800
 they love a haiku, they love a novelty thing to do there, yeah.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.920
 - What do you say?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.440
 Gin and tonic, please.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.320
 (all laughing)

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.720
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.360
 - Is it Bashou who was from this place

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.200
 or is it someone else?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.560
 'Cause he's the most famous haiku guy.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.920
 - He is, yeah, there seem to be sort of four kings of haiku

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.760
 and he's like the king of kings.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.880
 But no, it's Masaoka Shiki who was the person

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.760
 who rejuvenated haiku in the 19th century.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.760
 So it basically sort of died, it was really dying

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.160
 and he lit a fire under its arse and--

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.440
 - Redamed it as well.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.440
 - And gave it its name. - Gave it its name haiku.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.000
 It was called like Hoku or something before.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.840
 - Oh, so it didn't change it much.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.160
 - No, he just put a stamp on it.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.080
 He just, yeah, this is the Shiki stamp.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.360
 - It's really interesting what Shiki did

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.880
 'cause he was obsessed with haiku.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.440
 He failed his exams at university,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.280
 partly because he was writing so many haiku

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.520
 and reading haiku and he was engrossed in the world of haiku.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.360
 He sort of added to the rules about haiku

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.840
 and the first, the most important thing

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.280
 about haiku as we know them

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.280
 is that it's an observation of what's around you.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.880
 It's an observation of nature.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.160
 So that's a key element to haiku.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.240
 - So actually what Anna did at the start was not a haiku.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.080
 - No, it was a culture.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.120
 - It had the right number of syllables in

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.720
 but it has to have something to do with nature

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.360
 or something to do, it has to have a word

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.840
 that's something to do with one of the seasons.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.600
 So for instance, there's a really famous one

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.080
 by Bashou who I mentioned earlier

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.960
 which goes an ancient pond, a frog jumps in,

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.680
 the splash of water.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.000
 In Japanese it works as a haiku.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.320
 But for him, it's the word frog refers to spring.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.960
 It's a spring word.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.360
 And so you need one of those.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.400
 And so unless you're using the word postbox to refer to-

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.480
 - Yeah, it's a classic autumnal word, postbox.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.960
 It's in the glossaries.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.800
 - I get it now.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.160
 So I read that earlier, that one.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.320
 And I thought, you know, it was like,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.640
 this was one that he published and became famous.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.200
 And he was like dining off it for years.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.960
 Like, "Where in that haiku was insane?"

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.520
 And I didn't find it impressive at all.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.320
 I didn't make the spring and the frog connection.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.160
 That's wonderful.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.120
 - And now are you wowed by it?

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.480
 - I do like the punnery in the kind of double meaning.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.160
 - Are we saying it because frogs jump?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.000
 - No, no, no, no.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.840
 - No, that's not it.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.920
 - Oh, then I just like it again.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.200
 I thought that is what was going on.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.040
 - Sorry, that wouldn't-

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.760
 - That wouldn't work at all in Japanese.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.600
 - Please, no.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.160
 - No, it's just that frogs come out in spring.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.800
 That's in their barn in spring.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.760
 So they're associated with spring time.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.920
 And it's supposed to you read it

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.760
 and it just puts you in that position

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.480
 of being in a garden in spring.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.480
 The frog jumps in, you know exactly where you are.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.320
 You know what's happening.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.360
 You're one with nature.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.200
 That's it.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.040
 - Do you get it now?

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.880
 - I get it now.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.800
 Listen, it's no good night moon.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.120
 It's like-

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.680
 - What it's meant to be is like,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.400
 it's like a shot in a film almost.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.640
 It's a shot that crystallizes something

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.800
 and expresses something.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.720
 I really like them.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.960
 I did not know they don't have to be five, seven, five.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.000
 - No.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.520
 You can be a bit flexible.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.200
 - And actually I was very interested

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 to message my Japanese friend after I'd read about this

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.200
 'cause yeah, people who write about haiku properly

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.440
 and who know about it say,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.640
 look, the syllables thing,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.600
 it's a misinterpretation in English anyway

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.720
 'cause it's not syllables, it sounds.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.920
 And she wrote me a few haikus at random,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.120
 I think, while she was sitting on the toilet.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.640
 And none of them had the right number of syllables.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.480
 And I was like,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.720
 sorry, I don't know if she would have wanted me to share that,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.560
 but I have-

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.920
 (laughing)

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.280
 - She said an ancient toilet.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.160
 - And turds jumps in the splash of water.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.720
 (laughing)

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720
 - And she said,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.720
 the only thing I think a haiku needs

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.480
 is the seasonal reference.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.320
 So there you go.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.800
 And it is, they have done these glossaries

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.920
 that you have to stick to, don't they?

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.920
 You can buy a glossary, a haiku glossary.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.080
 - Dan, could you maybe say some words

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.120
 that you think might be summer words?

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.960
 - Summer words?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.800
 - Yeah, like a word.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.620
 - Sun.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.460
 - That might do it.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.300
 - I reckon.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.360
 - Although you do get sun in the other, you know.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.200
 - True.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.040
 - A nice bright.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.880
 - You get it in most seasons.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.720
 - Winter sun.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.560
 - All year round, don't you?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.400
 The old sun.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.880
 - Harvest.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.720
 - Sorry.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.800
 - That'll be an autumn one.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.640
 - Bikini.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.460
 - Beach.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.300
 - Yeah.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.140
 - Bikini.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:06.980
 - Yeah, yeah, that's a classic.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.980
 It's in the list of summer words.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.820
 - Blockbuster.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.560
 (laughing)

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.320
 - So summer could be insects,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.920
 autumn, scarecrow,

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.240
 resentment,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.920
 winter, tangle, twigs, empty fields.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.840
 - Oh, lovely.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.680
 - I really like it.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.780
 Can I show you the prop I've brought along?

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.620
 - Yes.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.460
 - I like a related prop.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.940
 - Hang on.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.840
 'Cause I don't know if you guys know this.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.920
 - You're not on the news.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.760
 - Sorry.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.600
 I don't know if you guys know this.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.000
 - You've got Michael Rosen in your bag.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.120
 (laughing)

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.880
 - I brought the sofa.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.040
 - Okay, so there's a British Haiku Society.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.880
 - Oh, yeah.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880
 - Do you guys find that?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.560
 - Because of your research?

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.400
 Well, I'm very proud to announce

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.520
 they've gained a new member this week.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.720
 - Oh, no way.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.560
 - I joined up.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.400
 - Yeah.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.600
 - Have you stopped your subscription

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.480
 to the Lighthouse Society?

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.800
 - The Association of Lighthouse Keepers

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.640
 have lost a member.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.100
 (laughing)

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.600
 - Is it like having citizenship?

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.920
 You're only allowed to be a member of one or the other.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.020
 - I think it's lapsed now,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.900
 'cause I haven't received a copy of Lamp Magazine

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.300
 for a while, and I was a big fan of that.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.140
 - Lights out.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.660
 (laughing)

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.380
 - I am now a member of the BHS.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.220
 - Yeah.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.060
 - British Home Stars.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.380
 - That's right.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.860
 And look, I've got the journal here,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.060
 which is called Blythe Spirit.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.060
 - So Andy's holding an A5 white book

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.460
 with Blythe Spirit written on it.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.020
 Does it have a lot of haiku in it?

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.980
 - Absolutely jam-packed with really good haiku.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.740
 It just randomly pick one.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.820
 - Yeah, give us a good haiku.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.960
 A spring one if you can.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.480
 - You're not gonna believe this.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.080
 This is by Philip Murrell.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.840
 Called home, I scrape away moss to find his name.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.880
 And you can see why I signed up, 'cause he was full of this.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.000
 - I like the way you pretended that was just random,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.840
 but actually--

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.760
 - It's fallen open to this page

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.560
 because the spine is so cracked.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.840
 All right.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.780
 A baby shower immersed by cherubs, Botticelli.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.800
 - What do you guys, I admire the idea

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.220
 of haikus, I really like them.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.980
 It doesn't do anything for me.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.900
 Certainly something like reading through a book like that.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.100
 Just, I imagine if I was sitting in nature

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.580
 and then someone sent me a haiku about the area,

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.980
 that would be really nice and poignant.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.340
 But do you guys get something from haiku?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.380
 - I have done, having done research for this,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.860
 I would say until that I hadn't,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.700
 until I understood what it was,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.460
 I didn't really get anything out of it.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.580
 But I like the idea, they have these clubs

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.660
 where a hundred people will go to a beautiful place

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.560
 in nature and they'll all just write as many haiku.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.400
 - See, I get that, I get that.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.720
 - And you're just kind of like,

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.240
 you're trying to capture one moment

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.000
 where you're with nature

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.840
 in just this kind of slightly formulaic,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.040
 but you can go out of the rules if you want to way.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:36.880
 I kind of, I do.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.760
 - Oh, it's a lovely conceit, definitely.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.600
 I like it.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.920
 - Yeah, I really like it.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.120
 As James says, reading about it, the analysis of it,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.640
 as with any kind of poetry or art,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.400
 'cause I'm not smart enough to understand it face on.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.600
 But when you read the analysis, I think you get it.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.500
 And maybe you could be lured in by the punchline element.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.660
 You know, often you'll do a comedy set

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.460
 where at the end it's got a big reveal.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.800
 And that--

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.820
 - Or haikus have them.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.860
 - Haikus, exactly.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.740
 There's supposed to be this moment of realization, so.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.100
 - That's why I thought the spring with the frog thing.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.620
 - Sorry, not that kind of thing.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.900
 More like the one I read that I really liked was bass,

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.660
 picking bugs off the moon.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.940
 And the way it was explained was,

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.920
 you have bass, it's a type of fish, it's plucking bugs,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.480
 and then it's off the moon.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.520
 'Cause suddenly you realize, to them,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.680
 they think they're picking bugs off the surface of the moon

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.640
 'cause they're always looking up at the moon.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.480
 - Oh, that's lovely.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.120
 - To us, they're picking up the surface of the moon.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.960
 - And all of the haikus would have like a word in it,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.360
 which is kind of hard to translate into English,

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.640
 but they're like a surprise

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.400
 or they call them a cutting word online a lot.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.520
 And it might be, aha!

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.840
 Or--

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.680
 - Sorry?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.380
 - Yeah, it's almost like an exclamation point.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.420
 - Oh, okay. - Do you know what I mean?

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.380
 - My favorite haiku that I found is,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.380
 and I hadn't heard of this,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.700
 and I really think this is beautiful,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.340
 the idea of the death poem.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.180
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.620
 - So the death poem is a Japanese tradition,

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.820
 whereby if you know that you're about to die,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.660
 let's say an execution is gonna happen,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.820
 'cause this has been going from centuries and centuries,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.100
 this death poem idea.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.660
 You are encouraged to write your final poem,

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.140
 and that can be presented in sometimes as a haiku.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.020
 So there was one that was written by a guy

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.560
 called Moriya Senan,

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.700
 and his was, "Bury me when I die

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.880
 beneath a wine barrel in a tavern,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.560
 with luck the cask will leak."

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.240
 Okay, so that's his thing.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.240
 What's really nice is the line,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.840
 hopefully the cask will leak or the cask will leak,

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.320
 the Japanese wording for that is Moriya Senan,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.160
 which is his name.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.000
 - Lovely.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.840
 - Oh, that's clever.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.680
 - Is that wonderful?

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.520
 Yeah.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.360
 - That is clever.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.680
 - No one else can do that, can they?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.000
 No one else has a chance in that competition.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.540
 - Hey doctor, watch this.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.160
 I'm doing a big kankam.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.480
 Uh-oh, oh shit, shit.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.540
 (laughing)

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.380
 - Beautiful.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.220
 - Yeah.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.740
 - Really good, where's the seasonal reference?

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.980
 (laughing)

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.040
 - Did you guys hear, hear tell of?

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.720
 (laughing)

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.040
 - This is now he's a member of the Haiku Society.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.260
 This is how Andy speaks.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.400
 - Everything has to scan.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.280
 - Did you hear tell of the 2014 Haiku artist

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.880
 who operated out of Sainsbury's in North London?

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.880
 (laughing)

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.880
 This was the board baker who smuggled complaint poems

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.360
 into the Sainsbury's treats that he was bagging up.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.760
 So for example, enjoy your cookies.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.320
 Each bite is a minute, I'll never get back.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.160
 (laughing)

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.000
 It's a nice one.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.200
 Anyway, he was identified and immediately fired.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.920
 - Sainsbury's apologized to customers

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.520
 and said it should never have happened.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.080
 - I love it, come on, I love it.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:45.920
 - I liked it.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.120
 - You'd be delighted if you got it.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.320
 It's like a fortune cookie, isn't it?

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.580
 But instead of your future, you get some abuse.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.440
 - This city is Matsuyama,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.320
 which led me to read about Hideki Matsuyama,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.840
 who was the first to have a Japanese professional golfer

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.560
 to win a men's major golf championship.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.400
 - What year are we talking?

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.480
 - 2021.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.560
 - What, wow.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.640
 - That's the first time.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.440
 - The first time a Japanese man

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.440
 at least has won a major golf championship.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.280
 And he was once disqualified from a competition

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.320
 due to Tipex, riddle me this.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.360
 - Yeah, okay.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.200
 Just qualified for the competition.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.440
 - It's famous in the golfing world.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.120
 - Painting his balls.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.880
 - Painting his balls with Tipex,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.440
 where they're already white.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.720
 - But does it add weight to it?

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.780
 Or some kind of grip that you wouldn't have?

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.520
 - You're getting really close, but it's not the balls.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.120
 - Did he Tipex over his score on the board?

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Different score.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.080
 - It's the club.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.640
 He would put it onto the club itself on the...

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.600
 - So he put like a little target on the club

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.760
 so that he could see where he wanted to hit the ball

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.520
 or with Tipex, and that's allowed.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.840
 You're allowed to do that.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.720
 But he put too much Tipex on it,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.520
 which made it slightly raised,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.920
 which would change the grip that when the club hit the ball,

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.840
 it would change the way that the ball flew.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.680
 And they measured it,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.560
 and it was like a millionth of a millimeter too thick.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.720
 - How amazing is that? - From a competition.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.560
 - Gosh.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.440
 - The forensic down to the millimeter.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.640
 - Yeah. - That's so pedantic.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.480
 - Like someone said, "Yes, you are allowed to put Tipex

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.880
 "on your club, but only a bit."

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.200
 (laughing)

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.520
 - And he exceeds that bit. - How much is a bit?

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.760
 Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.680
 - Wow.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.640
 - So that's just me shoehornin' some golf into this bag.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.480
 - I love it.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.160
 There was an exciting thing in the world.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.120
 This is sort of, he was the first Japanese golfer

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.960
 to do this. - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.080
 - There was an exciting thing in the world

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.360
 of Haiku in 2017 when a very prestigious competition

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.320
 was won for the first time by a non-Japanese person.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.160
 - Really?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.360
 - And it was Gracie Starkey,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.480
 who was a 14 year old school girl from Gloucestershire.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480
 - Wow. - Oh, wow.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.280
 - And she was learning Japanese at the time,

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.640
 and her teacher encouraged her to enter it.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.840
 I think there were 18,000 entries.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.200
 - It doesn't say much for the entire population of Japan,

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.040
 does it?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.880
 (laughing)

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.240
 - It doesn't. - It's girl who I'm sure is great,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.320
 but has only just started learning the language.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.040
 - Yeah, it shows that the bar to entry is low for Haiku,

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.880
 I suppose.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.080
 - Like, I can't imagine her winning the Japanese open

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.840
 golf for instance. (laughing)

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.360
 - And her poem was printed on millions of,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.280
 there's a green tea drink company that was sponsoring it,

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.720
 so her poem was printed on millions of these bottles.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.920
 And the coder to the story is that Gracie then decided

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.740
 to drop Japanese for GCSE,

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.080
 (laughing)

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.360
 saying the Japanese language is so hard.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.360
 (laughing)

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.940
 (upbeat music)

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.320
 and that is Andy.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.880
 My fact is that in the early 1900s there was a debate

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.200
 over whether cinemas should be dark or fully lit.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.760
 (laughing)

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.160
 - Do we think they got it right?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.680
 - I think they did get it right.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.520
 - For me, yes, I think dark is better.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.600
 - For the screening purpose, yes.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.320
 For the rest of society, maybe not.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.800
 - Mmm, go on.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.160
 - Well, this was the brainchild of a guy

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.240
 called Roxy Rothafell, early cinema entrepreneur,

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.320
 and he announced in 1910 that he had perfected

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.200
 what he called daylight pictures.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.040
 He said they were absolutely flickerless,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.720
 they wouldn't tie the sensitive eyes of the audience out,

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.720
 and you could see everything in the room.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.960
 And that was a kind of crucial point,

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.160
 'cause he was a big part of making cinema

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.440
 socially acceptable, whereas, you know,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.760
 before it was fairgrounds and peep shows,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.760
 and it was a bit raucous, and it was dark,

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.760
 and you couldn't see what was going on,

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.200
 and people might be, you know, getting up to hanky-panky,

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.960
 and men and women were sitting next to each other in the dark.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.720
 You know, why have we allowed this to happen?

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.640
 And he basically said, "Look, here's a lovely bright,

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.800
 "nicely lit screen," and he said,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.360
 "You can see the picture perfectly,

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.720
 "but you can also see the room,"

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.400
 and it's just a nice, more sociable way of watching.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.000
 - But actually, even the very, very,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.960
 very, very earliest cinemas,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.800
 so when Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.560
 was first sending out projectors,

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.960
 they said that you should install ambient lighting

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.400
 to deter misbehavior.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.800
 So even from the very first moment of cinemas,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 they were saying, "Let's not have it too dark

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.320
 "because you never know what's gonna happen."

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.160
 - Exactly. - Imagine, if they'd stuck to it,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.840
 I wonder how many children wouldn't have been conceived

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.160
 in the back row of a cinema.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.160
 It could have done damage to the population of the world.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.840
 - Seaved as well. - No, it would have ruined

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.040
 a lot of people's cinema experiences,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.640
 wouldn't it, in their use?

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.720
 - There's a cinema that's reopened in Leeds recently

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.160
 called the Hyde Park Picture House,

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.360
 and they are gas lamp lit,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.320
 and they basically were saying that the reason

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.720
 that there were gas lamps in there

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.280
 was to stop the groping,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.200
 not necessarily hanky-panky,

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.640
 but actually attacking women in the dark

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.800
 sitting in the cinema.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.160
 And so as they were restoring it,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.760
 they've been putting up photos online

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.240
 of all the things that they're finding,

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.040
 like sort of under the floorboards

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.880
 and the seats and stuff,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.040
 and one thing they're finding is giant hatpins.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.720
 And this used to be a suffragette thing,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.720
 where it's suffins. - Hatpins.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.960
 - Yeah, you would have,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.960
 they had to legislate the length of hatpins

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.320
 because they were being used as weapons,

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.520
 but in the cinemas, women would bring hatpins with them

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.720
 because guys would come and letch onto them,

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.560
 and no one could see it,

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.000
 and they would start poking them

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.320
 with the old hatpin. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.280
 - Nice.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.400
 - 'Cause it was a thing that you had on you anyway,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.520
 like you could say,

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.840
 "Oh no, this hatpin, it's not for stabbing people,

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.440
 it's for keeping my hat on."

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.920
 - But if you're a pervert,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.680
 and the woman you were perving on tap fell off,

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.760
 you knew you were in trouble.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.120
 (laughing)

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.840
 Get out of there, it's my advice.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.680
 - It's really cool.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.720
 If we ever get back to Leeds for a live show or whatever,

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.480
 you know, the cinema's back open.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.120
 It's the only gas-lit cinema in the world now.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.040
 It's pretty cool. - Wow.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.920
 - One of the things about the darkness in cinemas

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.920
 is that you know how if you go to the theater,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.760
 or the opera, or you know, whatever, it's dark.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.080
 Well, that wasn't always the case either.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.200
 And it mostly came through Gustav Mahler,

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.480
 who decided everything should be dark,

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.720
 and he was probably inspired by the cinemas.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.600
 So I think it seems that in the early 20th century,

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.520
 he insisted on dimming the auditorium.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.880
 And actually, when he did so,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.080
 the audience were protesting,

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.760
 because if you go to the opera in Vienna,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.800
 in the early 20th century,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.320
 you're wearing all your best clothes,

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.480
 you want everyone to see you.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.720
 - Oh, yeah, you didn't go to see the opera.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.320
 You went to see your rivals, didn't you?

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.160
 - Exactly.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.000
 - And the box over the other side of the audience.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.560
 - Well, you didn't want it to be dark,

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.480
 and you have to concentrate on the opera.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.040
 'Cause as we all know, opera is incredibly dull.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.680
 (laughing)

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.360
 - It's literally just a filler to go and make people stress.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.200
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.040
 I didn't really like it.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.720
 I'd love to have visited back then

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.040
 just to watch the social situation.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.880
 I didn't realize it was literally social gazing, basically.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.720
 - Oh, people went like that.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.800
 - Every night of the season,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.200
 and they were not concentrating on the play

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.360
 beyond night one.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.040
 - Wow.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.840
 - There's a thing now where there's a lot of controversy

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.320
 about when the lights should come back up

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.680
 in a cinema at the end of the movie.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.960
 - Well, I think it's useful, right?

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.280
 Because if the lights haven't come up

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.000
 and the credits are starting,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.880
 that's probably 'cause there's an end Marvel thing

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.720
 at the end, right?

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.560
 - Yeah.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.400
 - That's usually what happens.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.200
 - Do they do like a little scene at the end?

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.760
 - Yeah, like all the Marvel movies

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.480
 would have a little scene at the very end.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.760
 - And there's never ever a horse to Marvel movie,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.600
 and I respect that.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.440
 It's like that.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.840
 - But they wouldn't put the lights up,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.440
 so you kind of knew that was coming.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.280
 - Right.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280
 - That's very clever.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.960
 - So what's this red-hot debate

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.800
 about when the lights go on?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.640
 - What the red-hot debate is,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.920
 it's a health and safety thing, right?

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.720
 Most people, when the credits start rolling,

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.440
 want to get out of the cinema as quick as possible.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.680
 Maybe they need to be somewhere.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.520
 If you're in--

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.720
 - Just hate seeing the names of people who've worked.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.200
 I think it's just not like, "For fuck's sake, guys,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200
 you've done the job.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.200
 I don't need to know about who's the best boy."

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.120
 - Oh, it's the bragging.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.160
 - So they want to get out of there.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.000
 That can be very dangerous.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.920
 They can fall over, trip hazards, all that sort of stuff.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.320
 The issue is modern cinema uses its credit sequence now

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.280
 as part of the film.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.520
 So there's one film where basically the final scene

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.240
 is happening as the credits are rolling.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.320
 But you don't have the old-day projectionists

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.480
 in most cinemas these days.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.680
 Let's say in modern cinema,

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.200
 they get a hard drive,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.440
 and it has stamped throughout the hard drive.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.560
 This is when the credits arrive,

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.840
 so they'll pre-program the lights to come up.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.960
 So a lot of people are missing the end of movies

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.600
 in terms of the Atmos because lights are coming up.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.320
 And so, yeah, it's a raging debate.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.720
 - How many films are running their credits

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.560
 over the final scene?

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.120
 That feels very avant-garde to me.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.160
 Dan, have you ever been,

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.560
 I ask you this 'cause you're Australian.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.840
 Have you ever been to Broome?

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.960
 - No, haven't actually, no.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.520
 - 'Cause it's a very long way away from the rest of Australia.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.200
 It's in the Northwest,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.800
 and it's got a cinema called Sun Pictures.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.880
 And it's one of the first,

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880
 it's a very early cinema.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.120
 I don't know if it's Australia's first,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.240
 but it's very old, 1916.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.760
 It was, I just like it so much

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.560
 'cause every night, the cinema at Broome was flooded

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.640
 by the tide, it was on the coast,

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.440
 and there was tidal flooding.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.560
 And most nights, the street would be submerged.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.480
 And apparently some old-timers who remembered it

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.440
 back in the early days said you would be able to catch a fish

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.640
 during the screening around, under your feet.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.480
 - That's so good.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.320
 - Yeah.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.560
 - Great if you're watching Titanic or something.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.880
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.200
 - It was more fun when projectionists

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.760
 had a bit more control on the day, wasn't it?

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.600
 'Cause people, you almost had a relationship

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.480
 with your projectionists.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.640
 And actually, even,

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.680
 I think momentarily when you're in the cinema,

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.520
 you could say, you know,

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.920
 put the music on louder in Nickelodeons or whatever.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.760
 - Oh, yeah.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.400
 - Or in 1939, a newspaper in Newcastle reported

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.360
 on a really exciting innovation that it said

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.440
 is gonna take off in cinemas,

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.920
 where in musical films, of which there were quite a lot,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.880
 I kinda like singing in the rain or whatever,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.800
 after one of the good songs,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.900
 they'd bring the lights down to black,

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.160
 and then that was the cue for the audience to shout encore,

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.640
 and if they shouted encore long enough,

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.800
 then you rewound the song and you played it again.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.640
 - That's great.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.800
 - Oh, that is good.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.640
 - That's really good.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.560
 - Could you say, I didn't quite, who's this?

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.880
 Can you play that better again?

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.120
 Is she married to him?

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.980
 - Yeah, we've been incredibly annoying

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.520
 watching it with a granny or a child or me.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.600
 - You mentioned Nickelodeons.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.920
 So that was in America, right?

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.100
 And it was, you paid a nickel to get in,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.400
 and it was like usually the shop or something like that,

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.840
 and they would pull all the blinds down,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.880
 make it really, really dark,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.680
 and you'd be able to watch one of these old movies.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.520
 And obviously very dark, and it was very cheap,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.720
 so they attracted the poorer classes,

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.360
 and so it was worried by higher class people

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.880
 that they'd get pickpocketed or whatever

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.120
 as soon as they went in.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.040
 So again, the darkness was thought to be a problem.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.360
 But in the UK, we had our own version of the Nickelodeons,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.080
 and they were called Pennygaffs.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.260
 And obviously the difference being that in the UK,

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.620
 there were one penny to go in,

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.620
 whereas in America it was a nickel.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.020
 But the problem was a nickel was worth 2.5 pennies.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.660
 And so the people who were making the Pennygaffs

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.460
 were making two and a half times less

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.460
 than the Nickelodeon people.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.380
 - They just did it for the catchy title.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.660
 Call them Topnygaffs.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.660
 - I guess it was like the smallest,

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.140
 although they didn't have pennies in America, didn't they?

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.700
 So they could have done pennies as well.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.780
 But yeah, it was just, I suppose they thought

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.800
 that it was the only price they could charge.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.480
 But there was a worry at the time.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.160
 I read some newspaper articles saying

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.440
 that young children were robbing from their parents

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.880
 so they'd be able to attend the Pennygaffs.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.040
 - Always, always social worries.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.360
 Any new technology, it's so interesting.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.300
 Just how is this going to ruin the youth?

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.520
 - And the other thing that they did is

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.560
 'cause these Pennygaffs were in shops.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.920
 So it was a normal shop and they'd be like,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.560
 "Okay, we'll put a load of chairs up.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.800
 We'll charge people a penny to come in."

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.620
 But there was, people tried to shut them down.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.220
 And one way they did it was saying

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.500
 you don't have a music hall license.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.900
 'Cause there was no cinema licenses

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.420
 'cause cinemas didn't exist.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.100
 And so loads of them would play the movies

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.800
 in complete silence.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.900
 And so you would go in, it was completely dark

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.160
 and it was completely silent.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.560
 You'd be watching the moving pictures,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.800
 but there'd be no music.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.840
 - And that 'cause usually you'd have a piano or something,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.680
 wouldn't you? - Yeah.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.520
 - You'd be played live along with it.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.620
 - Exactly, but they couldn't do that

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.380
 because if they did, they'd get closed down

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.700
 for being a musical.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.800
 - To be fair, I think that's fine.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.300
 I mean, most of you are watching a silent film,

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.200
 you're not watching it for the piano music, are you?

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.840
 - Oh, no, the lot of music was composed specifically

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.160
 for the reels, so they'd be handed the sweet music.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.000
 - Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.840
 - Ambience matters.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.480
 - Well, I don't think it matters as much as

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.180
 with a film with dialogue, for instance,

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.360
 where you wouldn't know what was happening.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.340
 If you're watching a silent film,

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.560
 you still know what's happening.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.800
 - I would like more ambience in my movies, you know.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.680
 Do you think Star Wars, which has dialogue,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.440
 would be as good without the score?

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.840
 The less experiment.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.680
 - So you should try that.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.920
 - Completely music-free or Indiana Jones or whatever.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.760
 - Also, I need something to drown out James going,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.600
 "Who's that?"

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.420
 (all laughing)

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.740
 - When did they marry?

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.320
 (upbeat music)

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.900
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.040
 and that is my fact.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.060
 My fact this week is that one of the oldest diving clubs

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.660
 in Ireland is the Muff Diving Club.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.500
 - And?

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.340
 What's so funny about that?

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:34.340
 - Nothing, it's interesting because it's how old it is.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.600
 It's one of the oldest.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.920
 - How old is it?

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.560
 - We're talking a good like three decades.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.400
 - Wow.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.240
 - Oh my God.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.400
 - Yeah, no, this is the Muff Diving Club.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.960
 Yeah, it was just set up by a group of guys

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.720
 who obviously spotted a good gag and they wanted to do it.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.920
 And they've not only been pushing for it

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.160
 to be an old, long-lasting diving club,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.760
 but they want it to be the largest,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.760
 the biggest membership of any diving club in the world.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.680
 And so you go to their site, you can buy t-shirts,

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.880
 you can buy, you can get a membership card.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.720
 - There's a lot more t-shirts selling

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.680
 than actual diving in this club, I think.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.800
 - I'm finding it so hard when I'm looking into it

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.960
 and I still haven't got to the bottom of it

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.640
 if any diving happens at all.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.960
 - What is a diving club?

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.800
 What is a diving club?

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.640
 - What do you get?

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.640
 Diving instructors teach how to dive and scuba diving.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.480
 - Yeah.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.800
 - Oh, I thought it was high diving.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.080
 - Did you not even see the logo, did you research this?

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.680
 - I did not follow the link you said.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.040
 I've tried, but I've got a child look on my computer.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.040
 - How interesting.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.960
 I mean, you could have a high diving club as well.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.040
 People who like to high dive might get together

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.360
 and practice together.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.320
 - But if all your facts are about high diving,

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.280
 then you are going to be lost for the next half an hour.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.520
 - I've gone purely Muff, actually, and Muff Directional.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.360
 - Well, me too.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.000
 I went to the Irish version of companies house

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.680
 to see how many other Muff companies there are in Ireland.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.000
 Muff Engineering, Muff Service Station,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.560
 Muff Soap, Muff Direct.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.800
 - Muff Direct.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.120
 Is this all in Muff?

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.880
 - These are all real, they're all in Muff.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.440
 Muff after school, and--

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.680
 (laughing)

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.600
 - I didn't know, you can't let other parents

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.440
 send your kids to that.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.080
 - It's just like an after school place where kids go to,

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.960
 like, while the parents are still working,

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.280
 and the Muff Liquor Company.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.240
 - No.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.440
 - The Muff Liquor Company, this is really interesting.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.080
 I went on their website,

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.040
 and it doesn't seem to be a joke at all.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.280
 In fact, if you go on their website,

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.640
 it looks like they haven't realized

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.680
 that Muff Liquor could be quite rude,

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.640
 because it's a proper, like, it's a vodka company,

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.880
 and they've got a history of this guy,

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.120
 the grandfather of the owner who started it

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.480
 all these years ago, and it's a--

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.920
 - So there's no sort of sly wink at the fact

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.240
 that this is an amusing phrase,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.440
 like that salad company called Tost.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.600
 - No, unless I've completely missed it.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.920
 - I think they've just gone deadpan.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.760
 - No, I think you're right.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.920
 I think it's just, we're in Muff, we make a liquor,

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.760
 let's put it out.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.600
 - Well, fair enough.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.040
 - They do know, but they've gone, we're above that.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.960
 These fucking Muff Divers next door,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.240
 we don't need to stoop to that level.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.240
 We'll put it out there, we'll let people chuckle

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.560
 to themselves, and we'll sell them some vodka.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.040
 No t-shirt necessary.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.120
 - I was reading an interview where a lady called Caitlyn

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.160
 was over in Australia, and she was on a TV show,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.800
 like a Family Fortunes kind of thing,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.560
 and she was from Muff, like, you know,

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.560
 it's not got a big population Muff, but she was from there,

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.000
 and the guy couldn't believe that she was from there,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.760
 and she said she went to a school that was called Holly Bush,

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.680
 so that was a nice, another connection,

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.880
 and she says that when you come, when you're driving in,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.200
 that there is a sign that says you are now entering Muff,

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.440
 and I've not seen that online, I've been looking--

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.680
 - Seems plausible.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.600
 - It does seem plausible.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.080
 You can say, you see welcome to Muff,

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.960
 but I haven't seen you are now entering Muff.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.320
 - House prices are struggling in Muff.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.080
 - Oh yeah. - Yeah, apparently,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.840
 the prices are lower than you might imagine.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.960
 - I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop on this joke.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.360
 I can't tell what it is. - It's not joke, it's not joke.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.560
 Well, it's for a slightly different reason you might think,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.880
 so you would find, like, people who live on shit house,

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.080
 laying or whatever, they're always complaining,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.120
 and the newspapers are like, "I can't sell my house,"

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.240
 or whatever. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.600
 - But in actual fact, the reason that they can't

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.960
 sell them very well is because they're on the border

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.960
 between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.920
 and Brexit has meant that the bottom

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.280
 has dropped out of the Muff market.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.040
 - There we go, there we go.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.480
 I knew, I knew something was coming.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.640
 - Was it worth it?

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.280
 - It was worth it. - It was mortgage news

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.720
 from Muff. - I was not a written joke.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.480
 (laughing)

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.080
 - You were on the phone to a local estate agent.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.440
 - So if I say this, am I technically right?

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.240
 (laughing)

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.760
 - Do you want to buy the house or not, it's dark in here.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.400
 (laughing)

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.600
 - Oh dear, shall we talk about muffs themselves?

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.200
 - Yeah, let's do wet muffs. - Actual fur muffs

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.680
 that people would wear, hand muffs, as it were,

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.600
 how you keep your hands warm.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.560
 They used to be completely gender-neutral.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.880
 Men and women alike would wear muffs,

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.200
 it was just a thing, 'cause it was really cold,

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.960
 it used to be a lot colder.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.840
 (laughing)

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.640
 - What, what, what, big guys?

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.320
 - It used to be a big colder, but also they were more common.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.520
 - In the 16th century, people did not have

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.800
 well insulated homes, and clothes were,

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.960
 you didn't have lovely puffer jackets.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.680
 People needed to keep warm, wearing fur muffs

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.000
 to cover your hands, really useful.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.240
 - Furry muff. - Furry muff.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.720
 (laughing)

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.160
 And I think it came from muffulai,

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.880
 which is a medieval Latin term,

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.000
 which describes these big leather winter mitts

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.600
 that you'd wear in muffulai.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.240
 And there was a great article all about

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.960
 the history of the word muff,

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.200
 on the Oxford University Press website,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.160
 by Anatoly Lieberman.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.000
 And it's all these different words come from muff,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.680
 so Danish moth means clown,

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.600
 and Dickens uses muff to mean something,

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.640
 like an annoying person or a fool or whatever.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.680
 German has muffeln, which means sulk,

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.440
 miff, might come from muff.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.520
 - Miff, miff. - I'm feeling a bit miffed.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.840
 - Oh, miffed, right.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.480
 - You might really be actually muffed.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.040
 - We say muff, we use muff in American football,

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:55.880
 it's a term. - Do you?

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.400
 Oh, you've muffed it?

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.120
 - Yeah, that's what it means basically.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.680
 As in someone kicks the ball to you,

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.400
 and you try and catch it, and you don't quite catch it,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.520
 but the ball's still in place,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.280
 so someone else can get it, that's a muff.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.280
 - Oh yeah, that's quite a technical term.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.520
 'Cause I would say, yeah, you've muffed it to mean sort of,

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.800
 oh, you just messed it up.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.880
 - You do say that, and I actually checked

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.320
 all my WhatsApp messages,

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.040
 and you're the only person who's ever

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.360
 WhatsApp'd me the word muff.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.200
 - No. - Really?

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.920
 - Yes. - And to mean muffed it up?

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.680
 - Oh, that is interesting.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.800
 I'm gonna search my WhatsApp.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.240
 - Well, no, not now.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.800
 - Oh, okay, yeah, I'll do it later.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.600
 - Yeah, so be it.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.440
 - For a work.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.120
 (laughing)

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.600
 - But muff is also slang for a woman's vulva.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.440
 - No.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.280
 - What?

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.120
 (laughing)

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.960
 - No.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.800
 - I know, it's so weird.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.640
 - What? - Yeah.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.800
 - Wait a minute, so what about the muff diving club?

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.560
 That would be- - So I think that could be,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.480
 that should be a euphemism.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.800
 - It sounds like Cunningling Dist, doesn't it?

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.840
 - What about the thing that James said

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.760
 about the bottom dropping out of the muff market?

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.480
 (laughing)

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.920
 - That's even funnier than it was originally.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.760
 (laughing)

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.600
 - I thought it was just funny

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.440
 'cause James said the word bottom,

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.280
 which is a bit funny.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.080
 (laughing)

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.160
 - No, it's actually true.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.440
 But also it's been- (laughing)

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.760
 But it has been slang for that for so long.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.800
 I like how quickly we turn this into slang.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.440
 So it started meaning a hand warmer in the 1590s.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.800
 And by the 1690s, it meant a woman's pubic area.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.360
 Because I suppose you carried it down there,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.160
 it's big hairy things around your crotch.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.120
 So of course.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:16.960
 - It's 100 years.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.600
 That's a long time for it to make the leap.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.920
 - Well, it's first written down there.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.920
 - Yeah, I bet they've been saying it for decades.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.760
 - Yeah, you can get muff warmers.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.040
 - Is that to warm your muff or?

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.880
 - Yeah.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.200
 - I thought muff was a warmer.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.040
 - That's to warm you.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.800
 - Yes, but the muff warmers warm the muff.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.640
 - I think you put your hand in the mouth.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.960
 - But who warms the muff warmers?

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.160
 (laughing)

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.760
 - They were little ceramic things

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.360
 that you would fill up with hot water.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.200
 And I imagine actually that you'd leave them in the muff.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.400
 - Yeah, you would.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.840
 - And then when you're going out.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.680
 - That's clever.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.520
 - You warm the muff up.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.840
 Maybe you're going out on an hour.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.720
 You say, well, pop the muff warmer in the muff.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.960
 Then you come to go out.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.800
 You just get your muff as lovely and warm.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.720
 - Andy. - Yeah.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.060
 - Idea.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.720
 Have you got any money to invest?

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.560
 - Yeah.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.400
 - Good.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.280
 Okay, so a mannequin.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.120
 - Yeah.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.000
 - But it's heated and you put your coat on the mannequin.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.240
 And then when you go out,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.840
 you can take a nice warm coat and put it on.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.680
 - Oh, yes.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.760
 - Ring the dragons.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.600
 (laughing)

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.640
 - Ring the dragons.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.480
 - That's great.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.800
 - Or if you're really wealthy,

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.120
 you just have a human coat warmer.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.280
 Someone who wears your coat for half an hour.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.120
 - Yeah.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:20.940
 - Before you go out.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.780
 - I see that.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.620
 - Oh, yeah.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.240
 - Mine is just a one-off purchase

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.400
 whereas yours is more of a subscription one.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.240
 (laughing)

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.080
 - Very much so, yes.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:28.920
 - Yeah, I do see that.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.120
 - I mean, when you get into bed,

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.040
 it might be nice to,

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.080
 I mean, a warmer bed is not,

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.440
 I know you two are weird as you like cold beds,

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.840
 but I like getting into a bed that's slightly warm

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.200
 on a winter's night.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.040
 - Yeah.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.120
 - Do you do like they used to do on the grand tour

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.240
 where they would put a live pig in their bed

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.000
 before they went to bed to warm it up

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.280
 and to get rid of bed bugs?

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.400
 - Is that a real thing?

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.240
 - Yeah, that's what they used to do.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.080
 - On the grand tour.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.280
 You saw the Clarkson show.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.960
 (laughing)

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.020
 - Wait, what were you talking about?

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.360
 That's what I thought you were talking about.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.400
 - I was talking about when would it have been

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.080
 in the 18th century when you would go around Europe.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:49:59.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.360
 - Have you heard of Muff Boutiques?

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.400
 This is great.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.240
 - Uh-huh.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.060
 - Okay.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.080
 - Okay, not a company in Muff.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.080
 - No.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:07.920
 This was a thing.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.120
 It's from a book by a 19th century dandy

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.800
 called Octave Ouzanne

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.640
 and he was an admirer of ladies' accessories

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.080
 and he wrote a book which was called

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.600
 L'Hombre Legante Le Morgant

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.560
 which means the parasol, the glove, the muff.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.960
 And he said that in Renaissance Italy,

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.200
 there were Muff Boutiques

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.040
 where you could either go in and buy a Muff

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.680
 or in the off season when it gets nice and warm,

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.880
 you don't need your Muff anymore,

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.800
 you go and you store it in the Muff Boutique

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.080
 and they delouse them.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.400
 I mean, if true, that's very funny.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.360
 - It's a brilliant book that, isn't it?

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.200
 - It does sound great.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.120
 I've only read second hand about it.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.480
 - There was a, it's actually quite,

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.680
 it's all available online and it's quite short.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.880
 So I did read it and yeah,

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.160
 there's the Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.600
 and it was published by this guy

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.080
 in response to the previous year's

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.040
 incredibly successful The Fan

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.480
 which was his history of The Fan.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.320
 - Oh, that was great.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.600
 Yeah, yeah, I know that book.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.440
 - Really?

00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.560
 Published in 1881.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.480
 Were you there for the first?

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.640
 - No, I know a modern one.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.360
 Someone wrote a whole book about.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.200
 (all laughing)

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.040
 - No, it's great.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.280
 The Sunshade, the Glove, the Muff.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.160
 And he tells, my favorite story from it was,

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.600
 he says there's an account in the late 1500s

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.480
 of towers being besieged

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.200
 and at the front line of defenders

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.040
 who are defending themselves from the siege

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.720
 is a woman with muffs and a halberd in hand,

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.200
 a halberd being a sort of poke sticky thing.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.040
 - Spear.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.040
 - Spear, thank you.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.720
 (all laughing)

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.520
 A woman with a muff defending the city.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.640
 - Why?

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.560
 For a reason.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.400
 - Keeping her hands.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.880
 - Keeping her hands warm while,

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.880
 'cause you gotta be quite dexterous

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.200
 to operate a spear, I suppose.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.040
 - Absolutely.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.800
 - You can't prod a haldane with cold hands.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.640
 Can you?

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.320
 - Very difficult, yeah.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.800
 - There were muff chains

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.200
 which were to hang your muff, I think,

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.320
 when you're not using it.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.160
 Your hands out of your muff,

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.800
 you just put it on your muff chain around your neck.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.640
 - Oh, right.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.480
 - Oh, right.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.320
 - Muff pistols.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.140
 - Okay.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.980
 - I don't think--

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:53.800
 - To shoot your muff.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.640
 - To shoot from your muff

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.760
 if you're approached by footpads.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.600
 - Oh, I see.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.960
 They weren't like the sex pistols.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.800
 (all laughing)

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.760
 It was like a female sex pistols.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.520
 (all laughing)

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.160
 - No, that was just a tiny gun for ladies

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.800
 to protect yourself if you were out and about

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.320
 and someone approaches you to rob you.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.160
 - One place in Ireland

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.680
 that would have used the muff divers,

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.040
 I think, quite usefully,

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.120
 is a town where the first transatlantic telegraph cable

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.880
 was laid in the 1880s.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.720
 - Oh, yeah.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.520
 - So that was there, that was in Ireland.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.200
 It was a little place called Spunkane.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.520
 - Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.000
 - That's where the first transatlantic cable was laid.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.840
 - Spunkane.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.680
 - Spunkane.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.520
 - Sounds great.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.880
 - Okay, here's another fact.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.360
 The word spunk also can mean ejaculate.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.200
 - No.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.040
 - What?

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.800
 - But that's a really funny name

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.480
 for a place to start the cable.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.560
 - I thought it was just like a good-looking dude,

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.440
 you know, spunky, you know?

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.640
 That's disgusting now.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.400
 - Spunkane, and the town of Muff,

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.040
 where the original fact was,

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.440
 is where Amelia Earhart landed

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.440
 when she did her first solo flight.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.280
 - Cool.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280
 - Not our last one.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.000
 - No, unfortunately, we don't know exactly

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.720
 where she landed that time.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.320
 But her first one, she landed

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.200
 just outside the village of Muff.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.520
 - Oh, wow.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.480
 - The man who composed the theme music for Gladiators

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.080
 is called Muff Murphy.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.920
 (all laughing)

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.360
 - Gladiators of the TV show.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.200
 - Yeah.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.040
 - Ah.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:16.880
 - That's a good name.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.880
 - Muff Murphy, yeah, Muff is a name.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.960
 It's a man's name.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.800
 - Muff, I don't know any Muffs.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.040
 - Or maybe it's a Nick name as well.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.400
 - Yeah, I don't know any Muffs.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.280
 - I'm not familiar with the name Muff.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.720
 - The brother of Spencer Davis,

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.000
 who obviously founded the Spencer Davis group.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.840
 - Obviously.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.680
 - Obviously.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.520
 - It's called Muff.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.360
 - Really?

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360
 - You know the Spencer Davis group?

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.360
 Gimme some lovin'.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.200
 - Is that band?

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.040
 - Oh, it's a band.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:36.880
 - Yeah, it's a band.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.000
 - Gimme some lovin', that one.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:38.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.800
 - Oh, hang on, is that, I've always thought it was

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.200
 give me summer loving.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.040
 - No.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.560
 - I have thought it was give me some Muffin.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.280
 (all laughing)

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.720
 - James has inserted a Muffin there.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.000
 Anna has thought it was a haiku.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.840
 It has to be a summer reference.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.720
 (all laughing)

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.300
 (upbeat music)

00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:01.520
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.480
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.680
