WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 (audience cheering)

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.820
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.380
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.120
 this week coming to you live from Auckland.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.120
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
 (audience cheering)

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.300
 My name is Dan Schriver.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.760
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.740
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.440
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.560
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.640
 - My fact is that the German order of temperance

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 was founded in 1600, and members had to pledge

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.780
 to drink no more than 14 glasses of wine a day.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.360
 (audience laughing)

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 - Do you think you find that tough, Anna?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.280
 - I think, so long as that only means like before 6 p.m.,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.940
 that's vaguely generous, isn't it?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.600
 - Yeah, look, there are a couple of extra rules,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.700
 but I think you could handle it, Anna.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.800
 I think it would be fine.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.400
 So it's, this comes from a 1925 book called

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.000
 The Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol Problem.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.100
 Just a little light bedside reading for me.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.680
 (laughing)

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.800
 I found in that there was a reference to an 1872 paper,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 so all of this is quite a way distant.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.760
 The records of the society itself, obviously 400 years ago,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.560
 not very easy to find, but basically,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.080
 there was terrible drunkenness in the 16th century,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.640
 all over the place, and the rules of the temperance

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.120
 society were, look, firstly, never get drunk.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.960
 That's rule one.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.800
 - Yeah.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.120
 - Rule two, you can only have seven glasses

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.280
 of wine at a meal.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 (audience laughing)

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.280
 - Rule three, you can only have two meals a day.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.520
 - Okay, so they didn't mind you drinking a little bit.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.680
 I think that's the idea, isn't it?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.760
 'Cause temperance is like to temper your drinking.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.360
 So they weren't banning drinking,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 they were just trying to make you drink less.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.920
 - And even if you had your 14 glasses,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.960
 even if you then wanted a bit of wine to help you sleep,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.080
 you weren't allowed it.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 It was very strict.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.600
 - Even if you have another meal.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.160
 - Even if you have another meal.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.000
 - Oh, God.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.240
 - When they started doing things like,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.800
 "Okay, why don't we cut out certain bits of alcohol?"

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.640
 So they set up a brewery for people who didn't wanna drink,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880
 hasn't, didn't wanna drink spirits, but only beer.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.160
 So they would go there instead.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.440
 And then very slowly it would sort of morph into,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.760
 "Let's just maybe not drink at all.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.240
 Maybe we'll just stop it now."

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.520
 - And it was also, wasn't it?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.800
 The evil that was alcohol wasn't really wine and beer.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.840
 For a long time, it was spirits.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.800
 And actually a lot of beer especially,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.920
 but wine a little bit was promoted as temperance drinking.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.360
 I think Guinness was promoted quite a lot

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.440
 of temperance drink in the 1700s.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.320
 'Cause spirits distilled liquor

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 was thought to be the evil thing.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.040
 And actually temperance, I didn't realize.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.600
 It may be slightly more sympathetic towards it.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.360
 Had a bit of a socialist undertone

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.720
 because all the distilled liquor was all sold

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.480
 by landowners who were exploiting their peasants

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 working on their land because they were the only people

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.720
 who could grow all that liquor.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.120
 And so by being a teetotaler

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.720
 and the only drinking 14 glasses of wine a day,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.760
 you were sticking it to the landlords.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.520
 - We're glasses a lot.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.560
 You know how people were smaller back.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.520
 Yeah, we're glasses smaller back.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.800
 - People were not as much smaller as the glasses were.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.640
 This was not a--

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.480
 - It wasn't relative.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.400
 - I know we're the land of the hobbits here, but--

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.640
 (laughing)

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 - But so they were smaller glasses.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.640
 - Glasses were way smaller.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.960
 This would have been an insane glut.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.480
 The glass I'm pointing at now would have been

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.240
 a demented volume in the 16th century.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.640
 People would have freaked out.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.800
 They would have said that that's a bucket.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.640
 - Okay.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.480
 - They weren't genuinely--

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.320
 - Would that be all 14 of your glasses, do you think?

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.640
 - This would probably be a few of them.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.080
 And for anyone listening at home,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.240
 this is not a lot of wine at my glass.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.760
 I think it's easy to say picture a wine glass

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.600
 with some wine in it.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 That's what Andy's got.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.760
 (laughing)

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.760
 - Yeah.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 - Okay.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.440
 It's not a lot.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.280
 I'm fine.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.120
 And I can stop any time I like, okay?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.640
 (laughing)

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.920
 - The rules that I think you sent round a source

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.880
 with all the rules of this original temperate society.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.920
 There are some other really good ones,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.360
 but one of them was that the society wanted to ban

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.800
 the practice of drinking to people's health.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.640
 Cheers.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.000
 Here's to you, sir.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.840
 Et cetera.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.880
 Because that promoted drinking in it,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.760
 it got to a stage where you'd promote everyone's health

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.600
 around the table.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.040
 And by the time you'd started talking,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.720
 then everyone's had 15 pints.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480
 So I was wondering about toasting.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.400
 And do you know why it's called toasting?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.240
 - Ooh.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.320
 - Well, it was always about putting toast

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.960
 in the beer or something.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.800
 - There was.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.960
 I think we probably haven't mentioned before

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.000
 that people used to put soaked toast in their beer.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.400
 But I liked, and this is just a theory about

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.800
 why it was called toasting from 1837,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.960
 a thing I stumbled on.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.800
 This was in Tatler.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.160
 He said toasting, as a word, comes from the 1660s

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.640
 when a beautiful lady was bathing in one of the baths

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.240
 at Baths, Baths Bar, town in the UK.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.400
 And the men around were all admiring her as she bathed.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.600
 So far, so good.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.200
 One of them dipped his cup into the water,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.280
 'cause it's like health-giving waters at Baths Bar.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.480
 So one of them dips his cup into the water,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.880
 holds it up and says, cheers, here's to the health of the lady.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.960
 And another person who's described in the source

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.200
 as a gay fellow half-fuddled,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.240
 which I think he's absolutely hammered,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.280
 swore he was going to jump in the water

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.600
 because though he did not like the liquor,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.480
 he would have the toast.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.560
 Well, I believe in this instance was the lady.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.920
 So the toast, when you're doing a toast,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.960
 is the naked woman bathing in the pool of wine before you.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.760
 - Is that a slang term for a hot lady?

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.360
 - No, it was because, as James said,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.560
 they used to drink their beer with a bit of toast in it.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.480
 - So we did come from that.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
 This is just a sort of fun riff on the...

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.800
 - No, no, but this says that's why we call it a toast,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.960
 because someone drank to the health using the water,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.120
 and then someone made the toast gag, very funny, at the time.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760
 - 'Cause I was thinking,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.520
 is it related to the term crumpet for someone who's attractive?

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.480
 But is that... - Oh, yes.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.320
 - That's not that, is it?

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320
 - I'm sure you could make a case.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.080
 - The Temperance Movement in Glasgow.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.360
 That was an interesting one, 'cause it banned barmaids.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 It said, "We've worked out what the problem is.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 "These men are getting incredibly drunk.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.720
 "It must be the fault of the barmaids."

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.720
 - So are these crumpets that we're toasting?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.720
 Get them out of here.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.920
 - Basically, the idea was men would dally in the bar,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.080
 'cause they wanted to talk to the barmaids.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.920
 - Yeah, makes sense.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.040
 - Yeah, I mean, and if you let a woman into a pub also,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.840
 they're at risk of being exposed to language and to jests,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.920
 and we cannot have that sort of thing in our society.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.440
 We need, you know, the men to be just getting actually

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.920
 passionate in peace.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.240
 - The Temperance Lobby, who were trying to convince people

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.040
 not to drink, started with health about sort of

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.120
 what it would do to you,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.200
 and then they just started lying about things.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.960
 So they would say, "Well, you're drinking that."

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.000
 You know what they put in it?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.200
 Crunched up cockroaches.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.600
 They put feces.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.680
 They make it with feces.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.280
 They started just spreading all these rumors

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.840
 about what alcohol was mixed with

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.000
 in order to get people to go,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 "I guess I don't want to drink."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.120
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.640
 - You know what, that wouldn't work on me.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.480
 - Wouldn't it?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.800
 (laughing)

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.480
 - See, this is why it didn't take over.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.480
 Have you guys heard of the Wausers?

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.920
 - Hmm. - Wauser?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.760
 - Wauser.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.920
 This was a New Zealand thing and Australia, actually.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.920
 And a wauser was a person who had a real sense of morality

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.720
 and wanted other people not to do sinful things.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.600
 It actually, the name originally was a loud

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.080
 or an annoying person,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.120
 and then it kind of changed to that meaning.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.400
 But the Wausers were usually the women's

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.520
 Christian Temperance Union in New Zealand,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.560
 and not just were they campaigning for less alcohol,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.440
 but they were really the main people

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.280
 behind women's suffrage in New Zealand.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.120
 - Oh.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.560
 - 'Cause I don't know if the guys in the audience know,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.960
 but it was one of the first places

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.000
 where women got the vote.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.080
 - It's that sorry.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.080
 (audience cheering)

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.960
 - There's a lot of women showing there,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.800
 but not many men.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.040
 (laughing)

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.600
 - And here's another thing about New Zealand.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.480
 In 1917, there was, as part of the Temperance Movement,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.960
 they came up with a new law which said

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.440
 that all bars and pubs had to close at six o'clock,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.920
 so six p.m.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.280
 And the thing is that everyone finished work at five p.m.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.440
 And so what ended up happening is everyone who was working

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.760
 just legged it to the pub at five p.m.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.760
 and drank as much as they could for an hour.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.160
 And it was called the six o'clock swill.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.840
 And basically you would--

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.280
 - Did that lead to any problems at all?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.120
 Or was it absolutely fine?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.080
 - I'll be honest, it didn't go that well.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.400
 Some bars changed their wallpaper for tiling

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.920
 so it could be easily cleaned.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.760
 - Oh my God.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.960
 (laughing)

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.600
 - A lot of people would drink,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.680
 load to drinks and then keep all the glasses

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.280
 and then at like five to six,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.960
 they would go, "Fill these up."

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.200
 And then they would all get filled up

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.320
 and then they would neck as many as they could.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.160
 - Oh my God.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.920
 - But one interesting innovation

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.640
 that might have come from this is,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.240
 you know if you ask for Coca-Cola in a bar,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.200
 and they say, "We've got Pepsi, is that all right?"

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.480
 And you say, "Yeah, fine."

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.840
 They sometimes give it you out of like a long tube

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.280
 with a gun on the end.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.120
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.600
 - And that was invented for this

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.040
 because it made it easier to get beer quickly

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.720
 into people's glasses

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.440
 without having to get them to come away from the table.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440
 - Oh wow. - Really?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.280
 - How long?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.360
 (laughing)

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.720
 - Was it really, really, really long?

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.680
 - It was really long, yeah.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.320
 - There were these amazing maps as well.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.160
 Have you heard of these?

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.320
 The wet and dry maps of the USA.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.160
 - No.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.000
 - This is very cool.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.280
 America obviously had a very complex relationship

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.120
 with alcohol.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.880
 They're anti-saloon league,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.240
 and this was all pre-prohibition.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.360
 This is when they were still trying to do it

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.920
 just through social pressure rather than through banning it.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.360
 But there were temperance advocates,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.000
 and this happened in the UK as well actually.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.360
 Temperance advocates would map out pubs.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.680
 They would produce maps of pubs

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.240
 so that people could avoid them.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.120
 (laughing)

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.400
 Which did not backfire at all.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.120
 - Yeah, I'm gonna need one of those maps

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.840
 just to make sure that I don't go near any of these pubs.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.160
 - It was, that's basically it.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.000
 That's basically it.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.840
 I'm being a bit flippant,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.480
 but the anti-alcohol movement,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.320
 they printed these maps saying,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.120
 "Look at how many pubs there are in this town.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.840
 "We can't need any more."

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.920
 And that was like, "Don't grant a licence,"

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.440
 because look, this place is absolutely loaded with...

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.320
 - It wasn't for normal people, like a trigger warning.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.200
 So, you know, if you really don't like pubs,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.840
 if you're offended by them, don't go here.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.280
 - No, but it wasn't quite that.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.440
 It was a thing called persuasive cartography,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.280
 which is quite cool.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.840
 You produce a map showing something that you desire

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.640
 or something that you don't want.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.480
 Yeah.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.240
 - I read about, we were recently in Melbourne,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.160
 and I read about a group of friends

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.880
 who almost had the equivalent of a map.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.720
 It was the yellow pages of Melbourne,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.520
 and it had every single pub listed in it, as you would.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.360
 And this was back in the early '90s,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.400
 and they decided that they were gonna try

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.000
 and visit every single pub

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.880
 on the ultimate pub crawl that they could go on.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.160
 And they managed it.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.160
 32 years later, they had completed all 400 plus pubs.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.800
 Some of them had shut,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.040
 so they had to just stand outside

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.960
 and have a ceremonial beer outside of there.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.480
 Three of the five pulled out,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.480
 and it was only two that made it to the end.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.320
 And yeah.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.140
 - When we say pulled out,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.980
 do we mean died of alcohol poisoning?

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.640
 Or are we just saying, okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.680
 - Yes, pulled out of breathing.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.120
 - Well, they still have those maps of the US now, don't they?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.200
 'Cause there are dry counties in America, and wet counties.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.640
 But I didn't realize there were also lots of moist counties.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.760
 And this is, people should term,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.800
 and it's nothing disgusting.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.680
 Well, it depends on your opinions.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.760
 But like in Kentucky,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.840
 there are 120 counties in Kentucky,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.800
 11 are dry, 53 are wet, and 56 are moist.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.040
 Which is just like some rules,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.640
 can't drink vodka on a Wednesday,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.800
 you know, don't drink beer all night long.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.640
 That kind of just, you know,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.880
 there's some rules around alcohol.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.280
 But not many, but it actually backfired this

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.720
 when there were lots of little counties,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.320
 because they did a study in 2003,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.720
 looking at drink driving.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.920
 But they found that a higher proportion

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.440
 of dry counties residents

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.680
 were involved in alcohol-related crashes.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.160
 And they realized is because they're having to drive

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.960
 across the bloody border to pick up alcohol

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.440
 from the wet county.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.000
 (laughing)

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.920
 - That's amazing.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.080
 - That's incredible.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.760
 - There was a Greek playwright called Ubalas,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.440
 and he wrote, "The three glasses of wine

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.280
 "is a perfect amount for you to have before you go to bed.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.120
 "If you have a fourth that will induce arrogance,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.680
 "a fifth causes shouting,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.960
 "a sixth causes quarrelling,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.720
 "a seventh leads to punch-ups.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.840
 "In the eighth, furniture was smashed

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.600
 "and the police were called.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.560
 "By the ninth, deranged madness set in,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.560
 "and by the tenth, you pass out."

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.600
 (laughing)

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.800
 - And that is very much a description

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.040
 of how this podcast's gonna go throughout the evening.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.520
 (laughing)

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.100
 (upbeat music)

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.200
 - It is time for fact number two,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.480
 and that is my fact.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.800
 My fact this week is that Bob Dylan

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.920
 found Jimi Hendrix's cover of one of his songs

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.320
 to be so much better than the original

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.800
 that whenever he plays the song live now,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.000
 he plays a cover of the cover.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.840
 That's such a rare thing for a musician.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.120
 He plays the restructured--

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.960
 - How do we know?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.800
 Does it sound different?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.640
 - He's restructured it.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.280
 So yeah, he's moved lyrics around and so on.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.320
 - What's the song?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.680
 - It's All Along the Watchtower.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.000
 So this was a song,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.440
 I'd say, "Oh, thank you, yeah."

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.800
 - You didn't write it, that's not yours to thank.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.600
 - I felt like I did in that moment.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.920
 You are welcome.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.520
 So this appeared on an album called John Wesley Harding.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.520
 It was 1967 and it's a great song.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.360
 Hendrix heard it.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.160
 Hendrix actually did a few covers of Dylan's songs.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.040
 He really loved how Dylan was expressing himself.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.400
 He said, "Sometimes I play Dylan's songs

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.680
 "and they're so much like me

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.640
 "that it seems that I wrote them."

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.800
 And that's what Dylan felt

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.400
 when he heard Hendrix playing his song.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.520
 He was like, "I feel like that's his song now.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.600
 "When I play it, it's tribute to him."

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.680
 And so yeah, so I mean,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.200
 Dylan concerts, I don't know if anyone's been

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.320
 to any recent ones.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.440
 They have got a bit weird.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.640
 - I find them really fun.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.320
 I've seen him quite a few times live

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.440
 and it's always, 'cause he messes around with his song so much.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.760
 It's always a case of working out

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.160
 what an earth song he is playing

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.200
 that you know incredibly well

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.240
 that he is hidden under 900 layers of nonsense.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.680
 - There's a joke which is that it's so different

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.960
 that while he's on stage playing Blowing in the Wind,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.120
 someone will jump in and go,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.400
 "Play Blowing in the Wind!"

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.040
 And you'll go, "I am."

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.920
 - He's a very interesting guy, isn't he?

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.240
 For someone who's very, very iconic and still alive,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.680
 albeit old, he is old, but he is alive.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.520
 So that's the-- - He's sort of very active.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.280
 - At a time of recording. - At a time of recording.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.440
 But he's incredibly unreliable.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.280
 - Okay.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.320
 - I don't know if that's the wrong term.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.200
 Unreliable suggests he's a bit disorganized.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.200
 He's a hard person to grab hold of.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.040
 - He lies.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.880
 - He lies, he lies.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.320
 - He lies like a rug.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.160
 It's amazing.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.320
 He's done so many different versions of events

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.160
 of his own life.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.280
 Like all of them, well, a lot of them are provably wrong.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.800
 So was he sent to reform school, as he claimed?

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 Was he foster parented?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.360
 Did he run away from home age 12?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.920
 No.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.400
 He was brought up by a completely normal

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.680
 middle-class family.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.560
 When he played Carnegie Hall for the first time,

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.760
 he told a reporter he had lost contact with his parents

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.960
 and he didn't know them anymore.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.760
 They were in the audience at the time.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.680
 - Well, he was incredibly private, so.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.880
 - I know he was, but I'm still saying he fibs, fibs, fibs.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.360
 Was he really a chess hustler in Greenwich Village

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.320
 in the 1950s?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.160
 - Right.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.360
 - Well, I'm not worried by all of the research,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.440
 'cause I don't know anything about what they're like.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.360
 And I've been researching him going, "This is amazing."

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.440
 - I didn't even know he tried to get to Mars.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.280
 That's incredible.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.560
 - Oh, the Wimbledon finals, really, '75.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.640
 I couldn't believe the naivety of a journalist

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.840
 who interviewed him after he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.880
 Do you remember he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.880
 And he didn't say anything about it

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.840
 when it was announced he'd won it.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.800
 There was a tiny announcement that came onto his website

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.360
 and then vanished very quickly.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.000
 And so everyone was like, "Oh, we can't get hold

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.360
 of the Nobel Committee, can't get hold of him,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.200
 not picking up his phone.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.040
 Where is he?"

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.960
 And eventually, weeks and weeks later,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.200
 a journalist finally managed to get an interview with him

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.800
 and he wrote, "Poor guy."

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.000
 He wrote, "I can now put people out of their misery,"

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.040
 'cause everyone was saying,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.160
 "Is he going to turn up to the ceremony?

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.000
 Is he gonna come?"

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.200
 The journalist went, "I can put people out of their misery.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.760
 Yes, of course, he's planning to turn up

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.800
 to the award ceremony."

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.240
 I asked him about that and he said,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.640
 "Absolutely, if it's a tool possible."

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.040
 Now, obviously, he didn't turn up to the award ceremony.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.080
 (laughing)

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.360
 Because of pre-existing commitments.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.080
 Who has pre-existing commitments more important

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.960
 than accepting a Nobel Prize?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.520
 Did he win it for his lyrics and his songs?

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.640
 So like this one,

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.280
 "Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.880
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling coop.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.160
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.040
 Wiggle, you can raise the dead."

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.360
 That was one of his.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.200
 Yeah.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.040
 It's genius.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.880
 (laughing)

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.000
 It's how he tells it, weirdly.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.280
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.120
 Okay.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.280
 (laughing)

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.440
 That's what the Pulitzer saw.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.280
 I see it now.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.840
 Yeah, go, go, go, good.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.880
 He's just taken the piss his whole life, isn't he?

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.040
 Like, he, someone, and I appreciate so much

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.920
 the research genius who found this out,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.960
 that the lyrics from "Dean Tweedledum,"

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.440
 which is a very good song,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.920
 are poached from various places.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.480
 So it's unlike "Pruce" and "Hemingway,"

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.920
 fine, a time magazine article from 1961.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.720
 Bit weird to take your lyrics from there.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.400
 And also a lot of them were taken

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.000
 from a travel guide to New Orleans

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.560
 by a woman called Bethany Boltman.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.400
 So.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.240
 Is that allowed?

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.800
 Isn't it copyrighted or something?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.640
 Do you know what?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.680
 I don't think anyone would have the balls to sue.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.680
 (laughing)

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.680
 But there were, there were things,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.200
 you know, so if you hear lines in that song,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.480
 like "Dripping in Garlic and Olive Oil,"

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.200
 or "Parade Permit and Police Escort,"

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.960
 just think, just from a guidebook.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.600
 Three stars, yeah.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.840
 Yeah.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.680
 Wow.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.040
 "Nicolas Cage's Grave."

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.880
 (laughing)

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.440
 That's all I know about New Orleans.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.280
 Very good.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.120
 "Nicolas Cage."

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.920
 "Bought a Grave" in New Orleans

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.920
 is like this amazing pyramid.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.760
 Yeah.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.600
 But he's not dead.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.800
 Unlike, no, like Bob Dylan.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.640
 Yeah.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.480
 That's so similar.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.320
 (laughing)

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.040
 Again, as time of recording.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.640
 Oh God, I really hope we don't curse anything

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.600
 'cause he is an incredibly valuable guy to the world.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.640
 I don't know, do you think we have that power?

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.480
 I don't know.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.320
 We might.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.160
 That's not worth a try, is it?

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.800
 Another song, "Mr. Tambourine Man."

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.640
 Yeah.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.960
 Very, very beautiful, mysterious song.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.800
 What does the lyrics mean?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.720
 Can I just say James is actually shaking his head at that.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.000
 This is how important James is about Bob Dylan music.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.560
 It's one of his really, really famous early songs

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.320
 and it's very beautiful.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.200
 The lyrics are very sort of rhythmic and poetic.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600
 It turns out it was just inspired by a musician he knew

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.040
 who owned an enormous tambourine.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.880
 You know what?

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.960
 I would have guessed that, actually.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.800
 Really?

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.160
 If it was from a greengrocer who had an enormous marrow,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.840
 I would have been really surprised.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.960
 That's "Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man."

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.400
 You think he's a greengrocer, right?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.240
 He's good.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.080
 (laughing)

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.040
 But he was called Bruce Langhorn

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.600
 and he just had a big old tambourine.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.280
 He went on to start "Brother Bru Bru's African Hot Sauce."

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.120
 So, you know.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.960
 (laughing)

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.800
 Wow, amazing.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.640
 What a career.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.200
 He never had a number one hit in the UK, Bob Dylan.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.040
 Okay.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.600
 And his highest ever charter was one

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 that's called "Like a Rolling Stone."

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.560
 (laughing)

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.600
 It is.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.320
 Yes, I think a couple of people in the audience

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.160
 might have heard that one.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.480
 Okay, you might know it.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.360
 It got to number four in September 1965

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.200
 and that was his highest ever charting.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.600
 But when that was at number four,

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.240
 the number two and number one,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.360
 where I got you, babe, by Sonny and Cher,

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.200
 and I can't get no satisfaction by the Rolling Stones.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.840
 That's a tough week, isn't it?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.200
 Yes, you can't block that.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.640
 He should have waited until 2019 to release

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.400
 "Like a Rolling Stone"

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.200
 when it wouldn't have been up against the Sausage Roll,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.520
 Christmas song was up there.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.360
 (laughing)

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.120
 But he's largely,

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.040
 his most popular songs are the ones that are covered.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.480
 So, like Hendricks doing "All Along the Watchtower"

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.320
 or Adele doing "Make You Feel My Love."

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.400
 Not many people know that that's a Bob Dylan song

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.240
 from a much later album, which was a big hit for her.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.080
 Like for someone who's as famous as he is,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.440
 he's not a fame chaser.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.440
 In his early days, he had to do interviews.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.280
 You had to do them.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.720
 By the way, if you haven't read his autobiography,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.160
 it's incredibly good.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.320
 I highly recommend it.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.800
 None of it's true, but it's very good.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.880
 Yeah, brilliant bit of fiction.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.680
 Yeah, but so when you read some stories about him,

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.120
 I picture him as a sitting at home,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.440
 just like, "Oh, don't see anyone."

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.680
 Just he sits on his own, not wanting to do anything.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.120
 But he's got all these multitudes of interests

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.960
 that I didn't know about.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.600
 One is he loves comedy.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.560
 He's really into Jerry Lewis slapstick-style comedy.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.200
 And he approached a guy called Larry Charles,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.520
 who wrote a lot of Seinfeld episodes

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.840
 and was a big collaborator with Larry David

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.440
 on "Curb Your Enthusiasm."

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.560
 And he said, "I want to write a sitcom

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.560
 where I'm in it as a slapstick comedian star."

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.800
 And Larry was like, "Really?"

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.640
 And he said, "Yeah."

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.640
 And he took out...

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.840
 (audience laughing)

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.560
 He took out a box that he has.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.040
 You've got a very good Dylan on you.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.880
 (audience laughing)

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.800
 "Yeah, man, I want to be funny."

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.320
 (audience laughing)

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.760
 - Honestly, as someone who has no idea who this person is,

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.920
 this is very funny.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.760
 (audience laughing)

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.600
 - This person?

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.280
 - I mean, he's like, "Hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.680
 What do you mean, man?"

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.760
 - Probably maybe the most mysterious incident in his life

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.000
 was his bike accident,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.520
 because it changed the course of his career.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.920
 This is in 1966.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.840
 He had an accident on his most bike,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.160
 and it was quite bad,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.440
 and he ended up having to have healthcare

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.720
 for a period of time.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.680
 And it meant that he sort of became a recluse for a long time.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.000
 He didn't work for a bit.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.680
 No one heard from him.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680
 But the thing is, we don't know

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.760
 what actually happened in the accident.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.360
 We don't know how badly injured he was.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.600
 We don't actually know if it happened at all.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.400
 But it's the most debated thing ever.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.720
 Any Bob Dylan fan has opinions on it.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.680
 So, and he always has a different thing

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680
 about what caused the accident.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.720
 The sun got in his eyes.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.400
 His bike slipped onto some oil.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.600
 Sometimes he broke his back.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.720
 Sometimes he was concussed.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.400
 Sometimes he was fine.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.240
 But all we know was he turned up at a doctor's house,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.600
 which I didn't know he could do.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.440
 He knew a doctor.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.480
 He turned up at their house,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.360
 and he stayed there for about a month,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.360
 sleeping on their sofa or whatever.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.640
 And that was it.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.320
 And I think he has admitted since

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.120
 that he basically was trying to get out of the whole fame thing.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.920
 Didn't like the competitive rat race.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.880
 So, baked a bike accident.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.720
 - Wow.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.160
 - I think you can walk into most places

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.040
 if you're the level of Bob Dylan.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.160
 And if you know where the doctor lives,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.000
 you just go to their house.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.240
 They're not going to go, "Sorry, Bob."

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.240
 - Yeah, it was rural, wasn't it?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.080
 It was neighborhood stuff.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.920
 - Yeah.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.920
 And do you think you should let them stay for a month?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.200
 How many months could they stay before

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.640
 you kick them out even if they're Bob Dylan?

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.280
 - How many months can you stay at a doctor's house?

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.880
 There's actually a rejected line from

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.760
 "How many roads must a man walk down?"

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.120
 (audience laughing)

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.960
 - Very close.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.440
 - Before he will chuck you out.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.840
 - James has no idea what that means.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.600
 (audience laughing)

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.560
 - I assume it's one of his songs.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.240
 - Can I do another thing that,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.640
 another bit of James Bating here?

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.480
 - Yeah, of course.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.600
 - Okay, I'll see if you like this, okay.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.600
 'Cause you will like a bit of it.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.920
 There was for 20 years at least,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.240
 there was a huge competition between some academics.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.400
 In 1997, there were two researchers in Stockholm.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.040
 They released a paper called "Nitric Oxide and Inflammation."

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.440
 The answer is "Blowin' in the Wind,"

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.840
 which is clever.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.800
 And then several years later,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.960
 two other researchers coincidentally published a piece

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.160
 called "Blood on the Tracks, A Simple Twist of Fate,"

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.440
 which I think might have been genealogical.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.120
 Anyway, they decided to compete to see

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.120
 how many Dylan lyrics they could get into their papers

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.840
 before retirement.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.240
 And then a fifth one joined after he wrote something

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.400
 called "Tangled Up in Blue, Molecular Cardiology

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.840
 in the Post-Molecular Era."

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.680
 (audience laughing)

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.880
 And this has just been going on for a very long time.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.760
 - Did you come across Karl Gornitsky

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.000
 when you were reading about this?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.840
 - I don't think so.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.480
 - So Karl Gornitsky is a librarian

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.440
 who found out about this and he thought,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.920
 well, what I'm gonna do is see how often people

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.400
 use Bob Dylan lyrics in all of the papers.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.440
 And he found that there are at least 200 examples

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.080
 of papers that unequivocably use Bob Dylan's words

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.200
 in their titles.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.960
 And he found that they are cited slightly less often

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.920
 than other similar articles.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.760
 (audience laughing)

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.800
 And he said in his papers,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.880
 he thinks that there will be fewer Dylan references

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.960
 in the future because, and I quote,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.560
 "Researchers concede they weren't quite as clever

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.960
 as they were intending."

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.400
 (audience laughing)

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.640
 - Maybe he didn't write them

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.240
 in order to be included in the scientific papers.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.360
 - Well, maybe they were trying to quote

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.200
 an old tourist guide that actually,

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.920
 they've never heard of the songs.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.880
 - Do you know the oldest recording we have of Bob Dylan?

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.720
 At least according to my research.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.920
 So this was one that was made in St. Paul in 1960.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.360
 And it resurfaced in 1978.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.760
 And a fan-zine writer called Brian Stiball

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.520
 went to the person's house who found it

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.360
 and said, "Oh, can I listen to this Bob Dylan tape?"

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.040
 And the guy, the owner,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.880
 insisted that his partner did the dishes

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.040
 while they played it because he was so sure

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.160
 that they were going to record the tape

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.760
 when he played it for them.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.960
 So you'd have all that background noise.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.760
 And sure enough, they did record it.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.840
 (laughing)

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.200
 And the bootleg is known as the armpit tape

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.120
 because it's such bad quality.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.320
 - Lovely. - It still exists.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.280
 - People get so weird about him.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.000
 There's an Institute of Dylanology

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.280
 in the University of Tulsa,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.520
 which is not officially called that,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.080
 it's the Institute for Bob Dylan Studies.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.560
 But they bought his archive in 2016

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.800
 for about $15 million and it's 100,000 documents

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.640
 from his library. - Wow.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.000
 - It's really intense.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.360
 I was in, people get so far into him.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.200
 - They do.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.880
 But also, you know, he's not the easiest person

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.120
 to recognize sometimes, which works in his favor,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.000
 because he does all of these weird things in public.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.080
 Like he went through a phase in 2008, 2009

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.320
 of wanting to turn up at the houses

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.840
 where musicians had lived in their childhoods.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.680
 - Oh, yes.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.600
 - He turned up in this random house in Winnipeg

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.280
 where Neil Young had grown up

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.960
 and it was now occupied by just a couple

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.400
 called Kean and Passie,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.920
 who came home from their shopping trip

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.800
 to find a guy on their doorstep who they didn't recognize.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.760
 - Is that your holiday home today, is there any chance?

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.560
 - Didn't he get on a magical mystery tour bus in Liverpool

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.200
 and go around all of the Beatles childhoods?

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.120
 - I think he might have, I think he might have.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.960
 - He's a big fan of musicians.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.360
 He loved the Beatles.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.040
 He said that Beatles transformed America at a time

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.160
 when it desperately needed to come out of a depression

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.640
 and have a hit of happiness.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.200
 And when Elvis died, he stayed silent for a week.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.840
 He was so distraught from his death.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.680
 - Yeah.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.080
 - I'm just showing my own tribute there.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:25:59.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.200
 He was going to play for the Pope in 1997

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.680
 and then the next Pope next it.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.040
 So he was going to play for John Paul II.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.880
 - Yeah.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.080
 - The second in 1997.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.440
 - That's John Paul II squared, isn't it John Paul II?

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.680
 - He was going to play John Paul IV.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.720
 But then Cardinal Ratzinger tried to stop it happening.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.560
 Benedict the 16th.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.880
 - Why did he try to stop it happening?

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.720
 - He said it was inappropriate.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.320
 He thought it was wrong.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.560
 He thought it was sort of a bit profite.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.280
 But John Paul II did give a sermon saying,

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.440
 "You asked me how many roads a man must walk down

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.240
 "before he becomes a man.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.880
 "I answer, there is only one road for man

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.840
 "and it is the road of Jesus Christ."

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.240
 - Doesn't scan as well, does it?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.920
 - Yeah, it doesn't.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.160
 - See why he didn't incorporate that.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.000
 - Yeah.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.580
 (upbeat music)

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.720
 - Time for fact number three and that is Anna.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.880
 - My fact this week is that the US government

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.240
 runs a lottery where if you win,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.200
 you get to go and watch fireflies light up.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.480
 - Ah.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.320
 - It's so sweet.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.160
 - No, as good as winning 10 million quid.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.160
 - Well, you know, in some ways it's better, James,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.080
 'cause what's richer than nature?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.920
 - That's good money.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.560
 (laughing)

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.040
 - You can buy that forest.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.080
 (laughing)

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.440
 - She had just cut to you guys waving your wallet

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.320
 to the firefly, light up.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.560
 (laughing)

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.280
 - Well, millionaire Dan,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.720
 you can't buy the forest 'cause it's in a national park.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.560
 - Okay.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.400
 - And this is a national park.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.440
 It's the Great Smoky Mountains National Park

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.760
 in Tennessee and a bit of North Carolina.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.920
 And the fireflies every year put on this incredible display,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.680
 not for the humans, just for each other,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.720
 but it is amazing.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.080
 It's two weeks early June

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.440
 and it's the synchronous fireflies.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.440
 It's one of the only places that it happens in the US

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.320
 and the only place it happens on this scale.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.560
 And basically it started happening

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.240
 about mid-1990s when the national park

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.280
 removed the street lights.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.960
 So it got really dark there

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.960
 and fireflies love darkness 'cause their lights show up

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.520
 and people realized it was a thing

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520
 and they started flocking to this national park

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.280
 to see these fireflies all lighting up in synchrony.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.200
 It's extraordinary, it's millions of them,

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.520
 like a Mexican wave going on and off.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.280
 And there were so many that at first

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.160
 they decided to do a first come, first serve thing

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.040
 with ticketing and the queues were just insanely long.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.040
 So now there are 1,800 parking passes given out every year

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.480
 and you can apply for them.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.600
 About 30,000 people applied in 2019.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.360
 So it's round that level and you might win.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.120
 And if you win, you bring your foldable chairs,

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.400
 you bring your inflatable sofas, some people do.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.640
 You bring your teddy bear.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.160
 You really settle in for the night

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.920
 and then you wait for the fireflies to light up.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.760
 - It's pretty cool.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.240
 - Are there rules about what you can or can't bring?

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.520
 Are you not allowed to bring a torch

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.320
 in case that's confusing to them?

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.880
 - You have to have red light so that they can't see it.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.920
 - You certainly can't have normal white light, yes.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.760
 - Yeah.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.080
 'Cause they get confused by the lights, don't they?

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.920
 - Yes.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.000
 - If you get a load of fireflies

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.840
 and there's street lights around,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.920
 they just won't mate with each other.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.320
 And it's so much so that you can get two fireflies

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.520
 and you can put them right next to each other

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.920
 and they might be really horny, but they won't mate.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.760
 - Right.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.360
 - And we don't really show why they won't do it,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.120
 but we think what it is is it's 'cause they think it's daytime

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.360
 and they only do it at nighttime.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.080
 - Oh, sensible fellows.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.120
 (laughing)

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.600
 Doesn't it look a bit like Godzilla to them?

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.320
 Isn't it just like a giant version?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.120
 - And does that put you in the mood, Dan?

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.520
 Because if it doesn't, I think we've got our answer.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.760
 - I reckon if you and your wife are there

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.800
 and a huge Yeti walks in, I can only imagine

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.600
 that's gonna help things in the bedroom.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600
 (laughing)

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.640
 - I think in a very one-sided way, sure.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.880
 (laughing)

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.960
 - Honey, you can leave.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.920
 We'll tell them this.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.320
 (laughing)

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.280
 - You know what they say about big feet?

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.520
 (laughing)

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.840
 - They're pretty amazing fireflies.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.600
 I've never looked into them before.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600
 They're astonishing.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.640
 I mean, the fire in them, it's guys, it's not a real fire.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.360
 It is like a, yeah, I know, right?

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.000
 It's like a bioluminescence.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.200
 It's a thing that is made in them

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.560
 as a combination of chemicals that combine together.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.640
 The main thing that people try and extract

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.560
 is a thing called luciferase.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.200
 It sounds like lucifer's being used

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.680
 as the etymology term there.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.560
 - Well, lucifer means light bringer,

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.040
 which is where lucifer, the devil comes from, so, yeah.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.280
 - So I was correct.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.360
 (laughing)

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.560
 Sometimes I like to assume

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.920
 and have it confirmed on stage by the others.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.920
 And it's amazing what they can do with it.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.000
 It's used for mating reasons.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.560
 It's used for competitive advantage.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.320
 You will have female fireflies of one species,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.680
 and there are many thousands of different species,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.760
 and they will mimic the light of the male

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.840
 and another subspecies to attract the female from mating

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.080
 only to eat them up so that they can steal

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.480
 certain bits of them.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.760
 - That's not feminism hasn't got to the firefly community,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.600
 has it?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.200
 - But do you know why they do that?

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.400
 It's not only for food.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.560
 - It's a toxin, right?

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.360
 - Yes, there's this predator repelling toxin,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.800
 and part of the firefly flash, gee, whiz.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.720
 - I know, it's really tough.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.640
 - Just hadn't had a run up at that.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.640
 - Part of the firefly flashing is to attract a mate,

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.520
 but a part of it is also to say to predators, I am toxic.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.000
 And they have this, it's Lusibufegin toxin.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.280
 Why can't I say that first time?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.920
 Don't know.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.720
 But these, the females, the sort of femme fatale females,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.240
 they can't make their own version of that toxin,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.720
 so they have to eat the males,

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.760
 so they gather, they harvest it from the corpses

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.360
 of the males they devour.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.720
 And I just think that's pretty cool.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.120
 - It's cool, if you order a hamburger

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.920
 that I wanted, it's like me eating you together.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.320
 (audience laughing)

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.360
 - Yes.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.400
 - But these poor males are trying desperately

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.320
 to find females of their own species,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.160
 then they know it's a risk as well.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.320
 And sometimes it takes them a week

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.000
 to find an actual female of their own species,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.440
 and they're just constantly dodging, you know,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.800
 predator fireflies. - False flags.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.640
 - False flags, yeah.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.560
 - Can I just ask a quick, sorry to cut you off,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.600
 but Andy, well, you've just raised a good point,

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.080
 which is to eat Andy if he's had the hamburger, right?

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.360
 We were coming into New Zealand,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.120
 and you obviously aren't allowed to bring in fruit, right?

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.600
 So I had a banana just before we came in, right?

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.760
 So I ate it on the plane, and I got off.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.320
 And the sniffer dogs went past us,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.000
 and I just thought, why can't it smell it in me?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.840
 Why can't it?

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.040
 (audience laughing)

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.440
 Like it's still quite fresh.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.960
 - You're a messy eater, but you didn't rub it

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.080
 all over your, if you could.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.440
 - If you wanted to sneak something into the country,

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.560
 if you could get the stomach of a person,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.360
 it seems like you could put it in there.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.200
 - Yeah.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.040
 - Yeah, it says it back.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.880
 - Yeah.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.920
 (audience laughing)

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.840
 - You just invented smuggling, that's it.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.680
 - Oh yeah, and a bottom might be even better.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.520
 - Oh my God.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.800
 - You've blown this shit wide open?

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.080
 No, I'm not sure you have.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.320
 - We should say the ones, the fireflies

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.440
 that are visited by all these tourists,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.520
 and for whom the lottery is run,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.080
 that is just flirting, the flashing.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.160
 But it was quite confusing at first, I think,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.560
 because it's not usual.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.400
 The vast majority of firefly species

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.160
 just flash as individuals, and these ones flash in unison,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.080
 and it starts off like one will do a flash,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.280
 and then another will pick up on it,

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.840
 and it starts off looking quite random,

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.480
 and gradually as more and more do it,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.680
 they manage to tune like an orchestra,

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.080
 and do it all together.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.240
 But the reason they're doing it in unison

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.600
 is 'cause it's all males doing that flashing.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.240
 The females flash back, but it's very dim,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.680
 you can't really see it if you're a human.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.400
 It's all males doing the flashing,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.760
 and it tells the female that that is the right species,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.960
 because if there's any other species flashing,

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.160
 then it'll not be flashing in time.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.720
 But it's quite a shit show for the males,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.560
 because I think the ratio is about 100 to one

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.920
 often, males to females.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.600
 So even so, if you're the male,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.880
 you're just accepting as you flash in unison,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.520
 it's like we have to work together on this,

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.360
 even though probably I'm not gonna be the one who gets it.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.200
 Isn't that sad?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.960
 - In a way, it's also a kind of lottery, isn't it?

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.760
 - Oh my God. - Oh, yeah.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.680
 - There's a lottery to see the firefly lottery, wow.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.080
 - That's good. - How deep does this go?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.920
 - Yeah.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.760
 Well, the females, they can have dialogues

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.120
 with 10 males at once.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.280
 If there's some species chat back and forth

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.120
 with the flashing. - Really?

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.200
 Oh, with the flashing, right?

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.040
 - Yeah, yeah, and so-- - Only the slags.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.160
 - Ah, no. (laughing)

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.680
 They mate with only one they pick,

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.880
 they sort of winnow down from.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.120
 It's a bit Love Island, actually.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.360
 They start with 10 males who they're chatting to,

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.200
 and then they end up.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.480
 - But are they sending the same message?

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.480
 Is it kind of like when you go onto a chatbot thing,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.120
 and you think you're flirting,

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.880
 and then you realize it's automated answers?

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.640
 This is an insurance website.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.040
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.560
 - No, I've never seen Godzilla.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.320
 (laughing)

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.320
 - One thing about these, the flashing,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.680
 it's kind of like, I guess it's like dancing

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.240
 'cause it's in rhythm, isn't it?

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.560
 But if you get two fireflies next to each other,

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.000
 and they're from the same species,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.720
 and they're supposed to be able to do it in rhythm,

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.040
 they can't, they just get all over the place.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.480
 If you get three, they still can't,

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.480
 and if you get 10, they still can't,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.600
 and it takes about 20 of them to get together,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 and suddenly they all start doing it in rhythm together.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600
 - That's really interesting.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.240
 - It's true of dancing, isn't it?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.760
 You know, if there's just two of you on a dance floor,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.200
 it's incredibly awkward.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.280
 - But as soon as there's 20.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.640
 - It feels like it.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.080
 We are the same.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.480
 - There's a scary thing which is that

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.880
 their population is declining globally,

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.440
 and one of the main reasons is,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.880
 let's say there's a group of fireflies that are in an area,

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.120
 and then that gets urbanized,

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.480
 and it gets concreted over.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.160
 They don't then fly and find another place.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.040
 They just disappear.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.600
 The species just dies as this thing in it,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.200
 where it just goes, "All right, that's us done.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.120
 "We can't move over there."

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.160
 So that's really sad as we continue to urbanize.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.160
 But also, we kind of don't know

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.080
 how many fireflies there are necessarily,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.240
 because a lot of them hang out in the day,

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.480
 so we can't see them.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.800
 - Yeah, and don't glow, right?

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.160
 - They don't glow, so they use pheromones instead

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.640
 of their glow.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.120
 - There could be a million in here right now.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.960
 - Yeah.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.800
 - We wouldn't know.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.560
 - We would, 'cause it's quite dark, but it's, yeah.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.720
 - Another reason why they're endangered

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.520
 is that we used to farm them.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.560
 Well, not farm them as collect them.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.480
 So there's a company called the Sigma Chemical Company

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.480
 that harvested about 3 million of fireflies every year,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.880
 and they were trying to get this Luciferase,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.080
 which Dan was talking about,

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.680
 because you can use it in food safety testing and research.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.200
 - Oh, cool.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.200
 Well, they have come in very useful to science, generally.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.840
 They are particularly useful in energy efficiency.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.240
 So I think they let out the most efficient light we know of.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.120
 It's the most efficient light in the world,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.600
 in the universe that we're aware of,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.960
 because when they let off their light,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.360
 almost no heat is emitted,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.240
 so almost 100% of the energy is emitted as light.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.080
 And so--

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.240
 - Wait, do you mean they're like LED,

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.080
 as in they're not hot?

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.440
 - Yeah, exactly, but LED is a bit hot.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.480
 They are not hot, but they made LEDs better.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.520
 So there's a so cool thing where there was a physicist

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.840
 called Jean-Paul Vigneron, who went, he was Belgian,

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.400
 and he went on a trip to Central America in, I think, about 2012,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.040
 and he saw a bunch of fireflies glowing,

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.080
 and he thought, "I wonder how they do that?"

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.360
 And this is a science brain.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.400
 He just, he took some, he brought them back to his lab,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.040
 and he looked inside them,

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.880
 and he saw that the way they were making their light

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.640
 efficiently was that they had these,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.080
 like, really jagged, irregular scales on their abdomen,

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.040
 and that meant that the light was shining really efficiently,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.120
 so that meant that you could get the maximum amount of light

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.760
 coming out for the minimum amount of energy,

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.720
 and that's how LED lights are designed now,

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.360
 and he increased the energy efficiency by 50%.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.200
 - You're joking.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.040
 - Wow.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.200
 - So that's how-- - That is insane.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.280
 - I know, they, it's good old fireflies.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.160
 - Could we ethically replace LEDs with them, somehow?

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.840
 Like, picture your Christmas tree, right?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.680
 - Oh, lovely.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.680
 - If we had, like, some kind of pheromone

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.520
 that meant they were happy hanging out by the tree,

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.320
 and you had flying LED lights around your entire tree,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.160
 is that possible?

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.080
 - I think the audience doesn't like the sound of it.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.440
 I think it's less convenient, I do.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.960
 - They have to be, if your lights had to be in the mood,

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.040
 (audience laughing)

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.000
 to be on, probably, you might have a few dark Christmases,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.880
 you know. (audience laughing)

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.880
 Can I tell you one more thing about the dangerous lady

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.000
 fireflies, the ones who eat the males?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.120
 - These. - Them fatals, yeah.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.600
 - So not only do they eat males of a different genus,

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.360
 they will sometimes eat males of their own genus

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.040
 if they're merely hungry.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.800
 Some of them will break off mid-sex to eat their partner.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.120
 Mid?

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.960
 - Wait, that can't be mid-sex.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.080
 That's just the end of sex.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.880
 - Yeah. (audience laughing)

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.480
 Fair point, fair point.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.400
 - It's an unexpectedly abrupt ending of sex.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.000
 - But the poor man, oh, this is the end, is it?

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.320
 Where's the end?

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.440
 I've got more, I've got more in the tank.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.640
 I've got more moves.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.440
 (audience laughing)

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.280
 Ow.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.120
 Some.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.600
 (audience laughing)

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.440
 Some males in this genus, the prey genus of fireflies,

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.640
 they have special arms on either side of their penis

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.720
 that remain outside the female for copulation.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.000
 And some scientists believe this might be

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.520
 an incoming cannibalism alert system.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.360
 (audience laughing)

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.280
 And if the female starts wriggling around

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.560
 because she's started to feel a bit peckish,

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.000
 the male is notified that this is a risk

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.520
 and it gets a sort of early warning.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.360
 - Amazing.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.400
 The arms, what, hold on to her or what?

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.160
 - I think they just stick out at the base, if you like.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.960
 - Maybe they tap her on the shoulder

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.360
 from behind to distract her then.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.000
 (audience laughing)

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.920
 And then they're off.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.760
 (audience laughing)

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.360
 - Ah, we're, shit!

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.360
 (audience laughing)

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.640
 - I was mid-sex.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.640
 (audience laughing)

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.220
 (upbeat music)

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:43.120
 - It is now time for our final fact of the show

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.680
 and that is James.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.960
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the scientific paper,

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.560
 "Detection of Noda Virus in Barramundi"

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.560
 was co-authored by Dr. Barry Munday.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.960
 (audience laughing)

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.680
 - I feel like that's shut down the show.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.720
 That's the greatest fact ever.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.240
 Do you know it, everyone? - That's incredible.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.640
 - It is amazing. - It's incredible.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.600
 - So I found out that this guy called Dr. Barry Munday

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.520
 worked in Tasmanian fisheries

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.480
 and I know that he'd done some studies.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.720
 So I went through a list of all of the studies

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.760
 that he'd done in the hope and the dream

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.520
 that one of them was about Barry Munday

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.520
 and sure enough, he did do this one very obscure one.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.120
 - That's incredible.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.840
 He passed away a few years ago.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.680
 - Yeah, 2003.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.240
 - Yeah, 2003 and I found this really beautiful obituary

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.800
 of his entire career online and it's so detailed.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.480
 They do not say he wrote a paper

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.760
 on a fucking Barry Munday.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.960
 (audience laughing)

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.800
 It's unbelievable.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.120
 - It was really important.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.720
 - Do you have any idea if he, sorry,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.160
 I do want to know about the important things he did,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.840
 but mostly I want to know if he wrote this paper

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.680
 because his name is Barry Munday.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.200
 - I don't think so, genuinely don't think so.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.280
 - He mops in his head, I'm sure.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.120
 - Do you reckon?

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:51.960
 - Surely.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.200
 - I don't know, I reckon.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.880
 There's a lot of this about, actually,

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.800
 'cause I basically Googled every fish name

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.480
 I could think of to see if there are other people like this.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.040
 There's a guy called Stephen Haddock

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.960
 who's working on Deep Sea Gelatinous zooplankton.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.800
 - Amazing.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.800
 - John Salmon was a fish spotter in the 1980s.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.840
 - Fish spotter.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.960
 - Yeah, he would fly over in his plane and go,

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.880
 there's one.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.920
 (audience laughing)

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.760
 - Really?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.600
 - No, he wouldn't say there's one.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.200
 He said like there's a school of fish

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.880
 and then he would give the coordinates

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.920
 and people would be able to go and catch them if they want.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.760
 - Right.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.800
 - Do you know, so weirdly, I thought when he says

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.680
 fish spotter, he meant someone who put spots on fish

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.240
 and I don't know why they would do that,

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.560
 so that's what I thought.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.240
 - Courtney Pike was the angling correspondent

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.360
 for the Suffolk Gazette.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.280
 - That's brilliant.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.360
 - Jack Trout was the person who read

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.800
 the fishing report show from San Francisco's KNBR 680.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.200
 - Jesus, what happened, James?

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.040
 - Frank E...

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.880
 (laughing)

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.720
 - What?

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.560
 - Is everyone still here?

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.520
 (audience laughing)

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.360
 - What?

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.200
 - Frank...

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.440
 - Frank E. Fish wrote lots of papers all about fish,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.120
 especially the biomechanics of manoeuvrability

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.960
 and jet propulsion in fish.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.880
 - Wow.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.000
 - That took you most of 2024.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.840
 (laughing)

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.680
 - We know it.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.160
 - Courtney Trout.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.480
 - Oh, no, Courtney Pike.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.360
 - Oh, sorry, Courtney Pike is the question

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.000
 that an angling correspondent would ask.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.360
 - It's brilliant, that, isn't it?

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.200
 - What do you mean?

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.040
 - So, Courtney Pike.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:15.880
 - Have you Courtney Pike?

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.720
 - Oh, Courtney Pike.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.880
 - Courtney Pike, got that.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.200
 - Beautiful.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.040
 - Amazing.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:20.880
 - Beautiful.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.800
 - Baramundi, the fish itself.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.640
 - Oh, yeah.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.520
 - Hugely popular in Australia.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.720
 It's massively popular, right?

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.560
 - They're obsessed with it.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.400
 - They're obsessed with it.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.720
 But one of the issues is that they're discovering

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.080
 that a lot of Baramundi is being imported

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.960
 that aren't Baramundi.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.520
 It's almost like they're a fake cosplaying fish.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.840
 Not the fish on doing it.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.200
 It's the humans that are selling it.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.040
 - Okay.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.880
 - But there are rules in Australia

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.080
 that mean that the food service is under no obligation

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.920
 to label whether or not it is a local or imported fish.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.280
 So, people don't know the better.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.200
 They're being misled.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.400
 And so this is a big problem,

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.680
 according to the head of the Northern Territory

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.760
 Seafood Council, who's called Rob Fish.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.600
 So.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.440
 - Brilliant.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.680
 - Do you want to do a full 15 minutes of these?

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.800
 - Hopefully, no.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.920
 - Do you know one of the main fish

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.600
 that scandalously has been disguised as Baramundi

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.960
 is from New Zealand?

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.800
 It's the New Zealand grouper.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.480
 Why do you have a fish called a grouper?

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.840
 I imagine it's from the same origin as grouper,

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.640
 which is the normal fish we have in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.920
 But yes, a New Zealand grouper.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.840
 - The New Zealand grouper has tiny arms on its penis,

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.680
 doesn't it?

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.160
 (audience laughing)

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:33.480
 - It's actually, do you guys know, do you eat grouper a lot?

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.680
 Not many, but it's really popular.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.640
 And it was very popular in Maori culture.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.520
 And in Maori it's called hapuka.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.320
 But I think hapuka, the word means

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.880
 that it means to stuff your face with food,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.360
 because it's so popular.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.200
 - That's cool.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.640
 - Baramundi, a couple more things about them.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.920
 They can eat food up to 60% of their own length,

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.400
 which is the equivalent of me eating a four foot long sausage.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.720
 So that's food for thought, isn't it?

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.560
 - Wow.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.400
 (laughing)

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.840
 - What is the longest sausage you've ever eaten?

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.680
 - I did go.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.440
 There's a restaurant in Viennical Centre meter

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.200
 where you order your food by the length.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.040
 - Really?

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.880
 - Really.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.720
 - And we ordered the special,

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.160
 which is a wheelbarrow for the sausages.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.160
 - Wow.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.520
 - It's unbelievable.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.880
 They bring this wheelbarrow.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.840
 It's a small barrow,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.240
 but you don't realize how big a small wheelbarrow is,

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.600
 'cause you know what I mean.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.280
 - And it's big, it's big.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.840
 So I probably got through them.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.120
 No, I don't know if I got through a meter of sausages then.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:25.960
 No, I can't get done.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.640
 - I think you could easily eat a four foot sausage.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.480
 - In one go?

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.300
 - In one go?

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.080
 - Well, you can chew it.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.440
 You're allowed to chew.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.280
 - You're allowed to chew,

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.760
 but you can't eat it.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.760
 (audience laughs)

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.920
 I mean, James, that is just gonna get clipped out

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.760
 at that centre.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.740
 (audience laughs)

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.860
 - Didn't even cross my mind.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.640
 - No, four foot of sausage.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.400
 Come on, even a cumberland's only about eight feet.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.240
 - If it's very thin, easy.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.040
 - Is it not thin, it's a sausage?

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:51.880
 - No.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.400
 You can't just turn it into a pepper army and wolf it.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.080
 I'm talking a thick old cumberland.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.920
 - We're talking about.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.720
 (audience laughs)

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.680
 - Please guys, we are talking about sausages.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.380
 This is not, there's no sight to this.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.140
 - We need to start.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.820
 - So four foot, that's the length that you think,

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.180
 no, because I read varying accounts

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.940
 of what the largest barramundi that's ever been caught is.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.260
 And one went as far as saying it was five foot 10.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.180
 And that's massive.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.180
 I can't believe that's true.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.820
 That's if you want to picture that size,

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.620
 that's the same height as Neil Finn.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.460
 That's how big a five foot nine, five foot 10.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.780
 - Who's that, sorry?

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.540
 (audience laughs)

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.920
 - Okay, it's a New Zealander.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.600
 I thought you'd literally just Googled

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.240
 everyone who was the height.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.120
 I got, oh, they've got a funny fish sounding name.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.820
 - Neil Finn is, there's a very famous Australian band called.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.160
 (audience laughs)

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.200
 There's an incredibly famous New Zealand band

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.280
 called Split Ends, which became Crowded House.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.580
 And Neil Finn is the, is from Crowded House.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.800
 - But Dan would have said Neil Finn

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.760
 because of the word Finn.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.600
 - Exactly, well, I'll tell you my working.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.900
 I found out it was five foot 10.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.340
 And I sat at the computer and went,

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.060
 please tell me Neil Finn is five foot 10.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:03.900
 And he is.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.220
 (audience laughs)

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.060
 - That's the way to do it, James.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.100
 - That's how you save time.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:07.940
 - That's how you do it.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.340
 Just claim is right.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.020
 - You assume and let other things confirm it.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.820
 - No, they are very cool though.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.820
 They sometimes eat baby crocodiles per a Monday.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.760
 I mean, they're really--

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.140
 - Yeah, they'll eat any old stuff.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.100
 - They'll eat any old stuff.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.420
 - They have a relation called the Antarctic Toothfish

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.620
 and they eat lots of rocks.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.460
 (audience laughs)

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.220
 And we're not really sure why they do it,

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.200
 but it seems like the reason they do it

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.240
 is 'cause they just want to eat everything

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.120
 and the rocks get in the way.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.960
 - Really?

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.800
 - Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.160
 - So it's not an eating thing, they don't--

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.440
 - No, it doesn't seem that way.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.320
 It seems like it's just useful for them

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.760
 because they're so rare for them to get food

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.920
 just that if they see anything, they just go for it.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.760
 - Right.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.320
 - It's like when you get really greedy people

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.960
 and you look at their finished meal

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.700
 and all the cutlery's gone and everything.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.520
 (audience laughs)

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.360
 - It's amazing.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.800
 They do this extraordinary thing as well, Baramundi,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.300
 which is the males, they will start off as male

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.580
 and then there's a first wave in their life cycle

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.980
 of mating that goes on and they'll go around

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.900
 impregnating as many female Baramundi as possible

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.300
 and then once that's done and they grow a bit bigger,

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.780
 they then turn into female themselves

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.940
 and the reason they do that is partially

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.300
 because they can store more eggs inside of them

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.180
 to give birth more.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.100
 So it's the equivalent of if you picture like NFL,

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.700
 it's like being a quarterback, throwing the ball

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.960
 and then running up and catching it yourself

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.680
 because they're impregnating and then they're becoming

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.720
 the ones that are being impregnated.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.760
 It's an extraordinary thing.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.980
 - Although what I find quite sad is that scientists think

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.520
 that they can't transform into the female

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.400
 until they've done their first kind of copulation,

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.900
 which for enough is just releasing sperm,

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.880
 but it does make you think like, what if you couldn't do it?

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.960
 You know, and you're like a 59 year old Baramundi

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.640
 who's still male and all the other ones age three have changed.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.600
 I just think that's embarrassing and sad.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.220
 (audience laughing)

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.500
 Have you not seen that film, "The 40 Year Old Baramundi?"

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.340
 It's good.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.680
 (audience laughing)

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.220
 And it's actually a lot more interesting

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.160
 than you think it is.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.980
 - Just on Australian fishes,

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.980
 there's one called Plecto rinches carolinthus,

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.460
 but it's better known as the blue bastard.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.400
 - Oh yeah.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.840
 - Can you guess how it gets its name, the blue bastard?

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.600
 - From the poetic minds of the Australian people.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.840
 (audience laughing)

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.080
 - It must be blue.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:23.920
 - Is it blue?

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.360
 - It's blue, that's half of it.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.800
 - Is it a bastard to catch?

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.980
 - It does the other half.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.980
 (audience laughing)

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:37.280
 - This fact was about nominative determinism, right?

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.080
 So Baramundi is doing a thing that his name is associated to.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.040
 And I found a few New Zealand examples of that.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:51.040
 So there is a composer who wrote a Romeo and Juliet opera

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:56.460
 who is called Peter van de Vlut, which is very sweet.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.520
 It's just a very sweet name.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.560
 There's an activist who's quite a famous actress

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.240
 who's been being, she's getting arrested

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.080
 for all her climate change protests.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.320
 And that's Lucy Lawless.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.880
 Xena Warrior-Princess.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.720
 - Very good.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.760
 - Lawless, she's constantly getting taken

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.480
 to police stations for what she's doing.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.000
 But I was, so I was sitting in a room today in New Zealand

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.880
 and a guy randomly overheard me talking about this

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.920
 called Wade and he came over and he said,

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.360
 "My grandfather is an example of nominative determinism.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.400
 "Can I tell you it?"

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.160
 So his grandfather was the first person in New Zealand

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.000
 to artificially inseminate a bee.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 (audience laughing)

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 - They've been trying for years and years and years,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.160
 haven't they?

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.080
 We just can't find anyone with a small enough penis.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.240
 (audience laughing)

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.120
 We will keep looking.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.200
 Is this, is this guessable or is it?

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.360
 - Oh, he's called Richard Beebe.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.240
 Like that's his name.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.000
 And he did it on a kitchen table in Balcluthur.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.400
 - Dick, wait, that's very, that's a bit racy, isn't it?

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.440
 Many would have started in bed.

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.960
 - Sounds like the women takes you.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.280
 - It's called Dick Beebe.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.360
 (audience laughing)

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.040
 - Come on, mate.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.840
 - Oh my goodness.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.680
 So yeah.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.320
 - The only, I mean, the only thing I have,

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.720
 'cause what I like about this original fact

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.880
 is that it's a double nominative determinism.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.160
 It's a Barry Monday, twice as unlikely.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.000
 And I think my favorite example of that

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.280
 is probably the world's leading expert in Pete Boggs,

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.040
 was called Pete Glob.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.160
 (audience laughing)

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.880
 - We've got a couple in the fish inbox,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.320
 if you don't mind me sharing that, Fred.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.440
 - Yeah, Fred.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.760
 - This was sent in by Pruma Kutcher

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.600
 and she had a dentist called Jintar Gumbyte.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.440
 - Brilliant.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.280
 - Pretty good.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.360
 And Peter Drake sent in the fact that John Ramsbottom

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.280
 invented a new kind of high-speed piston.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.440
 (audience laughing)

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.280
 - It's brilliant.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.280
 (audience laughing)

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.020
 (upbeat music)

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.600
 - Okay, we need to get out of here.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.160
 That is it, that is all of our facts.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.120
 Thank you so much for listening, Auckland.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.960
 You were awesome, that was amazing.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.880
 We will be back.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.800
 We'll see you then.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.640
 Goodbye!

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.640
 (audience cheering)

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.140
 (upbeat music)

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.720
 (upbeat music)

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:32.040
