1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,820
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,380
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,120
 this week coming to you live from Auckland.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,120
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,300
 My name is Dan Schriver.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,760
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,740
 and James Harkin, and once again,

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,440
 we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,560
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,640
 - My fact is that the German order of temperance

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
 was founded in 1600, and members had to pledge

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,780
 to drink no more than 14 glasses of wine a day.

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,360
 (audience laughing)

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
 - Do you think you find that tough, Anna?

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,280
 - I think, so long as that only means like before 6 p.m.,

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,940
 that's vaguely generous, isn't it?

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,600
 - Yeah, look, there are a couple of extra rules,

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,700
 but I think you could handle it, Anna.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,800
 I think it would be fine.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,400
 So it's, this comes from a 1925 book called

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,000
 The Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol Problem.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,100
 Just a little light bedside reading for me.

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,680
 (laughing)

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,800
 I found in that there was a reference to an 1872 paper,

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,560
 so all of this is quite a way distant.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,760
 The records of the society itself, obviously 400 years ago,

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,560
 not very easy to find, but basically,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,080
 there was terrible drunkenness in the 16th century,

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,640
 all over the place, and the rules of the temperance

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,120
 society were, look, firstly, never get drunk.

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
 That's rule one.

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,800
 - Yeah.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,120
 - Rule two, you can only have seven glasses

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,280
 of wine at a meal.

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
 (audience laughing)

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,280
 - Rule three, you can only have two meals a day.

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,520
 - Okay, so they didn't mind you drinking a little bit.

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
 I think that's the idea, isn't it?

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,760
 'Cause temperance is like to temper your drinking.

46
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
 So they weren't banning drinking,

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,200
 they were just trying to make you drink less.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,920
 - And even if you had your 14 glasses,

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,960
 even if you then wanted a bit of wine to help you sleep,

50
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
 you weren't allowed it.

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
 It was very strict.

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,600
 - Even if you have another meal.

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,160
 - Even if you have another meal.

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
 - Oh, God.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
 - When they started doing things like,

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,800
 "Okay, why don't we cut out certain bits of alcohol?"

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,640
 So they set up a brewery for people who didn't wanna drink,

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,880
 hasn't, didn't wanna drink spirits, but only beer.

59
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,160
 So they would go there instead.

60
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,440
 And then very slowly it would sort of morph into,

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
 "Let's just maybe not drink at all.

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,240
 Maybe we'll just stop it now."

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
 - And it was also, wasn't it?

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,800
 The evil that was alcohol wasn't really wine and beer.

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,840
 For a long time, it was spirits.

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,800
 And actually a lot of beer especially,

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,920
 but wine a little bit was promoted as temperance drinking.

68
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
 I think Guinness was promoted quite a lot

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,440
 of temperance drink in the 1700s.

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,320
 'Cause spirits distilled liquor

71
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
 was thought to be the evil thing.

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,040
 And actually temperance, I didn't realize.

73
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,600
 It may be slightly more sympathetic towards it.

74
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,360
 Had a bit of a socialist undertone

75
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,720
 because all the distilled liquor was all sold

76
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
 by landowners who were exploiting their peasants

77
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,200
 working on their land because they were the only people

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,720
 who could grow all that liquor.

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,120
 And so by being a teetotaler

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,720
 and the only drinking 14 glasses of wine a day,

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
 you were sticking it to the landlords.

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,520
 - We're glasses a lot.

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,560
 You know how people were smaller back.

84
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,520
 Yeah, we're glasses smaller back.

85
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,800
 - People were not as much smaller as the glasses were.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,640
 This was not a--

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,480
 - It wasn't relative.

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
 - I know we're the land of the hobbits here, but--

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,640
 (laughing)

90
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
 - But so they were smaller glasses.

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,640
 - Glasses were way smaller.

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,960
 This would have been an insane glut.

93
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,480
 The glass I'm pointing at now would have been

94
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,240
 a demented volume in the 16th century.

95
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
 People would have freaked out.

96
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,800
 They would have said that that's a bucket.

97
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
 - Okay.

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,480
 - They weren't genuinely--

99
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,320
 - Would that be all 14 of your glasses, do you think?

100
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,640
 - This would probably be a few of them.

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,080
 And for anyone listening at home,

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
 this is not a lot of wine at my glass.

103
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,760
 I think it's easy to say picture a wine glass

104
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
 with some wine in it.

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 That's what Andy's got.

106
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,760
 (laughing)

107
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 - Yeah.

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
 - Okay.

109
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,440
 It's not a lot.

110
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,280
 I'm fine.

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
 And I can stop any time I like, okay?

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,640
 (laughing)

113
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,920
 - The rules that I think you sent round a source

114
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,880
 with all the rules of this original temperate society.

115
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,920
 There are some other really good ones,

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
 but one of them was that the society wanted to ban

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,800
 the practice of drinking to people's health.

118
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
 Cheers.

119
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,000
 Here's to you, sir.

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
 Et cetera.

121
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,880
 Because that promoted drinking in it,

122
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,760
 it got to a stage where you'd promote everyone's health

123
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
 around the table.

124
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
 And by the time you'd started talking,

125
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
 then everyone's had 15 pints.

126
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
 So I was wondering about toasting.

127
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,400
 And do you know why it's called toasting?

128
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,240
 - Ooh.

129
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
 - Well, it was always about putting toast

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,960
 in the beer or something.

131
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
 - There was.

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
 I think we probably haven't mentioned before

133
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,000
 that people used to put soaked toast in their beer.

134
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
 But I liked, and this is just a theory about

135
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
 why it was called toasting from 1837,

136
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,960
 a thing I stumbled on.

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
 This was in Tatler.

138
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,160
 He said toasting, as a word, comes from the 1660s

139
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,640
 when a beautiful lady was bathing in one of the baths

140
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,240
 at Baths, Baths Bar, town in the UK.

141
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,400
 And the men around were all admiring her as she bathed.

142
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
 So far, so good.

143
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,200
 One of them dipped his cup into the water,

144
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,280
 'cause it's like health-giving waters at Baths Bar.

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,480
 So one of them dips his cup into the water,

146
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,880
 holds it up and says, cheers, here's to the health of the lady.

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,960
 And another person who's described in the source

148
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,200
 as a gay fellow half-fuddled,

149
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,240
 which I think he's absolutely hammered,

150
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,280
 swore he was going to jump in the water

151
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,600
 because though he did not like the liquor,

152
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,480
 he would have the toast.

153
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,560
 Well, I believe in this instance was the lady.

154
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,920
 So the toast, when you're doing a toast,

155
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,960
 is the naked woman bathing in the pool of wine before you.

156
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,760
 - Is that a slang term for a hot lady?

157
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,360
 - No, it was because, as James said,

158
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,560
 they used to drink their beer with a bit of toast in it.

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,480
 - So we did come from that.

160
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
 This is just a sort of fun riff on the...

161
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,800
 - No, no, but this says that's why we call it a toast,

162
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,960
 because someone drank to the health using the water,

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,120
 and then someone made the toast gag, very funny, at the time.

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,760
 - 'Cause I was thinking,

165
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,520
 is it related to the term crumpet for someone who's attractive?

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,480
 But is that... - Oh, yes.

167
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
 - That's not that, is it?

168
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 - I'm sure you could make a case.

169
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,080
 - The Temperance Movement in Glasgow.

170
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,360
 That was an interesting one, 'cause it banned barmaids.

171
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 It said, "We've worked out what the problem is.

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 "These men are getting incredibly drunk.

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,720
 "It must be the fault of the barmaids."

174
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 - So are these crumpets that we're toasting?

175
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
 Get them out of here.

176
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,920
 - Basically, the idea was men would dally in the bar,

177
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,080
 'cause they wanted to talk to the barmaids.

178
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
 - Yeah, makes sense.

179
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,040
 - Yeah, I mean, and if you let a woman into a pub also,

180
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,840
 they're at risk of being exposed to language and to jests,

181
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,920
 and we cannot have that sort of thing in our society.

182
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,440
 We need, you know, the men to be just getting actually

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,920
 passionate in peace.

184
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,240
 - The Temperance Lobby, who were trying to convince people

185
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,040
 not to drink, started with health about sort of

186
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
 what it would do to you,

187
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,200
 and then they just started lying about things.

188
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,960
 So they would say, "Well, you're drinking that."

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
 You know what they put in it?

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
 Crunched up cockroaches.

191
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
 They put feces.

192
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
 They make it with feces.

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
 They started just spreading all these rumors

194
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,840
 about what alcohol was mixed with

195
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,000
 in order to get people to go,

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 "I guess I don't want to drink."

197
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
 - Really? - Yeah.

198
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,640
 - You know what, that wouldn't work on me.

199
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,480
 - Wouldn't it?

200
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,800
 (laughing)

201
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,480
 - See, this is why it didn't take over.

202
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 Have you guys heard of the Wausers?

203
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
 - Hmm. - Wauser?

204
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
 - Wauser.

205
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,920
 This was a New Zealand thing and Australia, actually.

206
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 And a wauser was a person who had a real sense of morality

207
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,720
 and wanted other people not to do sinful things.

208
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,600
 It actually, the name originally was a loud

209
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,080
 or an annoying person,

210
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,120
 and then it kind of changed to that meaning.

211
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,400
 But the Wausers were usually the women's

212
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,520
 Christian Temperance Union in New Zealand,

213
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,560
 and not just were they campaigning for less alcohol,

214
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,440
 but they were really the main people

215
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,280
 behind women's suffrage in New Zealand.

216
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,120
 - Oh.

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
 - 'Cause I don't know if the guys in the audience know,

218
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
 but it was one of the first places

219
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,000
 where women got the vote.

220
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,080
 - It's that sorry.

221
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 (audience cheering)

222
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,960
 - There's a lot of women showing there,

223
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
 but not many men.

224
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,040
 (laughing)

225
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,600
 - And here's another thing about New Zealand.

226
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,480
 In 1917, there was, as part of the Temperance Movement,

227
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,960
 they came up with a new law which said

228
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,440
 that all bars and pubs had to close at six o'clock,

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
 so six p.m.

230
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,280
 And the thing is that everyone finished work at five p.m.

231
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,440
 And so what ended up happening is everyone who was working

232
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,760
 just legged it to the pub at five p.m.

233
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,760
 and drank as much as they could for an hour.

234
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,160
 And it was called the six o'clock swill.

235
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
 And basically you would--

236
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,280
 - Did that lead to any problems at all?

237
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,120
 Or was it absolutely fine?

238
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,080
 - I'll be honest, it didn't go that well.

239
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,400
 Some bars changed their wallpaper for tiling

240
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,920
 so it could be easily cleaned.

241
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
 - Oh my God.

242
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,960
 (laughing)

243
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
 - A lot of people would drink,

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
 load to drinks and then keep all the glasses

245
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,280
 and then at like five to six,

246
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
 they would go, "Fill these up."

247
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,200
 And then they would all get filled up

248
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,320
 and then they would neck as many as they could.

249
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,160
 - Oh my God.

250
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,920
 - But one interesting innovation

251
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,640
 that might have come from this is,

252
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,240
 you know if you ask for Coca-Cola in a bar,

253
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,200
 and they say, "We've got Pepsi, is that all right?"

254
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
 And you say, "Yeah, fine."

255
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,840
 They sometimes give it you out of like a long tube

256
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
 with a gun on the end.

257
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,120
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
 - And that was invented for this

259
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,040
 because it made it easier to get beer quickly

260
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
 into people's glasses

261
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
 without having to get them to come away from the table.

262
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
 - Oh wow. - Really?

263
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
 - How long?

264
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,360
 (laughing)

265
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
 - Was it really, really, really long?

266
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,680
 - It was really long, yeah.

267
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,320
 - There were these amazing maps as well.

268
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
 Have you heard of these?

269
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
 The wet and dry maps of the USA.

270
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
 - No.

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,000
 - This is very cool.

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280
 America obviously had a very complex relationship

273
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,120
 with alcohol.

274
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
 They're anti-saloon league,

275
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
 and this was all pre-prohibition.

276
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
 This is when they were still trying to do it

277
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,920
 just through social pressure rather than through banning it.

278
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,360
 But there were temperance advocates,

279
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,000
 and this happened in the UK as well actually.

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,360
 Temperance advocates would map out pubs.

281
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
 They would produce maps of pubs

282
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,240
 so that people could avoid them.

283
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,120
 (laughing)

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,400
 Which did not backfire at all.

285
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,120
 - Yeah, I'm gonna need one of those maps

286
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,840
 just to make sure that I don't go near any of these pubs.

287
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,160
 - It was, that's basically it.

288
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
 That's basically it.

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,840
 I'm being a bit flippant,

290
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,480
 but the anti-alcohol movement,

291
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320
 they printed these maps saying,

292
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120
 "Look at how many pubs there are in this town.

293
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
 "We can't need any more."

294
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,920
 And that was like, "Don't grant a licence,"

295
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,440
 because look, this place is absolutely loaded with...

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,320
 - It wasn't for normal people, like a trigger warning.

297
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,200
 So, you know, if you really don't like pubs,

298
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,840
 if you're offended by them, don't go here.

299
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
 - No, but it wasn't quite that.

300
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,440
 It was a thing called persuasive cartography,

301
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,280
 which is quite cool.

302
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,840
 You produce a map showing something that you desire

303
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,640
 or something that you don't want.

304
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,480
 Yeah.

305
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
 - I read about, we were recently in Melbourne,

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
 and I read about a group of friends

307
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
 who almost had the equivalent of a map.

308
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
 It was the yellow pages of Melbourne,

309
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,520
 and it had every single pub listed in it, as you would.

310
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,360
 And this was back in the early '90s,

311
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,400
 and they decided that they were gonna try

312
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
 and visit every single pub

313
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,880
 on the ultimate pub crawl that they could go on.

314
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,160
 And they managed it.

315
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,160
 32 years later, they had completed all 400 plus pubs.

316
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,800
 Some of them had shut,

317
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,040
 so they had to just stand outside

318
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,960
 and have a ceremonial beer outside of there.

319
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
 Three of the five pulled out,

320
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 and it was only two that made it to the end.

321
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
 And yeah.

322
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,140
 - When we say pulled out,

323
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,980
 do we mean died of alcohol poisoning?

324
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,640
 Or are we just saying, okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.

325
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,680
 - Yes, pulled out of breathing.

326
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,120
 - Well, they still have those maps of the US now, don't they?

328
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,200
 'Cause there are dry counties in America, and wet counties.

329
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,640
 But I didn't realize there were also lots of moist counties.

330
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,760
 And this is, people should term,

331
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,800
 and it's nothing disgusting.

332
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,680
 Well, it depends on your opinions.

333
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,760
 But like in Kentucky,

334
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,840
 there are 120 counties in Kentucky,

335
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,800
 11 are dry, 53 are wet, and 56 are moist.

336
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,040
 Which is just like some rules,

337
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,640
 can't drink vodka on a Wednesday,

338
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,800
 you know, don't drink beer all night long.

339
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
 That kind of just, you know,

340
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
 there's some rules around alcohol.

341
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
 But not many, but it actually backfired this

342
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
 when there were lots of little counties,

343
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,320
 because they did a study in 2003,

344
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,720
 looking at drink driving.

345
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,920
 But they found that a higher proportion

346
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,440
 of dry counties residents

347
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,680
 were involved in alcohol-related crashes.

348
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,160
 And they realized is because they're having to drive

349
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,960
 across the bloody border to pick up alcohol

350
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
 from the wet county.

351
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,000
 (laughing)

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,920
 - That's amazing.

353
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
 - That's incredible.

354
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,760
 - There was a Greek playwright called Ubalas,

355
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,440
 and he wrote, "The three glasses of wine

356
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,280
 "is a perfect amount for you to have before you go to bed.

357
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,120
 "If you have a fourth that will induce arrogance,

358
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,680
 "a fifth causes shouting,

359
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,960
 "a sixth causes quarrelling,

360
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,720
 "a seventh leads to punch-ups.

361
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,840
 "In the eighth, furniture was smashed

362
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,600
 "and the police were called.

363
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,560
 "By the ninth, deranged madness set in,

364
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
 "and by the tenth, you pass out."

365
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,600
 (laughing)

366
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
 - And that is very much a description

367
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,040
 of how this podcast's gonna go throughout the evening.

368
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,520
 (laughing)

369
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,100
 (upbeat music)

370
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,200
 - It is time for fact number two,

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
 and that is my fact.

372
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,800
 My fact this week is that Bob Dylan

373
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,920
 found Jimi Hendrix's cover of one of his songs

374
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,320
 to be so much better than the original

375
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,800
 that whenever he plays the song live now,

376
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,000
 he plays a cover of the cover.

377
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,840
 That's such a rare thing for a musician.

378
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,120
 He plays the restructured--

379
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,960
 - How do we know?

380
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
 Does it sound different?

381
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,640
 - He's restructured it.

382
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,280
 So yeah, he's moved lyrics around and so on.

383
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,320
 - What's the song?

384
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,680
 - It's All Along the Watchtower.

385
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,000
 So this was a song,

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
 I'd say, "Oh, thank you, yeah."

387
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,800
 - You didn't write it, that's not yours to thank.

388
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
 - I felt like I did in that moment.

389
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,920
 You are welcome.

390
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,520
 So this appeared on an album called John Wesley Harding.

391
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,520
 It was 1967 and it's a great song.

392
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,360
 Hendrix heard it.

393
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
 Hendrix actually did a few covers of Dylan's songs.

394
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
 He really loved how Dylan was expressing himself.

395
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,400
 He said, "Sometimes I play Dylan's songs

396
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,680
 "and they're so much like me

397
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,640
 "that it seems that I wrote them."

398
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,800
 And that's what Dylan felt

399
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,400
 when he heard Hendrix playing his song.

400
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,520
 He was like, "I feel like that's his song now.

401
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,600
 "When I play it, it's tribute to him."

402
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,680
 And so yeah, so I mean,

403
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,200
 Dylan concerts, I don't know if anyone's been

404
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,320
 to any recent ones.

405
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,440
 They have got a bit weird.

406
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
 - I find them really fun.

407
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,320
 I've seen him quite a few times live

408
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,440
 and it's always, 'cause he messes around with his song so much.

409
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
 It's always a case of working out

410
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,160
 what an earth song he is playing

411
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,200
 that you know incredibly well

412
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,240
 that he is hidden under 900 layers of nonsense.

413
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,680
 - There's a joke which is that it's so different

414
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,960
 that while he's on stage playing Blowing in the Wind,

415
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,120
 someone will jump in and go,

416
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
 "Play Blowing in the Wind!"

417
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,040
 And you'll go, "I am."

418
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,920
 - He's a very interesting guy, isn't he?

419
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,240
 For someone who's very, very iconic and still alive,

420
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,680
 albeit old, he is old, but he is alive.

421
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,520
 So that's the-- - He's sort of very active.

422
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,280
 - At a time of recording. - At a time of recording.

423
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,440
 But he's incredibly unreliable.

424
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,280
 - Okay.

425
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,320
 - I don't know if that's the wrong term.

426
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,200
 Unreliable suggests he's a bit disorganized.

427
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 He's a hard person to grab hold of.

428
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,040
 - He lies.

429
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,880
 - He lies, he lies.

430
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
 - He lies like a rug.

431
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,160
 It's amazing.

432
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,320
 He's done so many different versions of events

433
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,160
 of his own life.

434
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,280
 Like all of them, well, a lot of them are provably wrong.

435
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,800
 So was he sent to reform school, as he claimed?

436
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 Was he foster parented?

437
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,360
 Did he run away from home age 12?

438
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,920
 No.

439
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,400
 He was brought up by a completely normal

440
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,680
 middle-class family.

441
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,560
 When he played Carnegie Hall for the first time,

442
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,760
 he told a reporter he had lost contact with his parents

443
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,960
 and he didn't know them anymore.

444
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,760
 They were in the audience at the time.

445
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,680
 - Well, he was incredibly private, so.

446
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,880
 - I know he was, but I'm still saying he fibs, fibs, fibs.

447
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,360
 Was he really a chess hustler in Greenwich Village

448
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,320
 in the 1950s?

449
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,160
 - Right.

450
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,360
 - Well, I'm not worried by all of the research,

451
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,440
 'cause I don't know anything about what they're like.

452
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,360
 And I've been researching him going, "This is amazing."

453
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
 - I didn't even know he tried to get to Mars.

454
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
 That's incredible.

455
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,560
 - Oh, the Wimbledon finals, really, '75.

456
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,640
 I couldn't believe the naivety of a journalist

457
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,840
 who interviewed him after he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

458
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,880
 Do you remember he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016?

459
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 And he didn't say anything about it

460
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
 when it was announced he'd won it.

461
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,800
 There was a tiny announcement that came onto his website

462
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,360
 and then vanished very quickly.

463
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
 And so everyone was like, "Oh, we can't get hold

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,360
 of the Nobel Committee, can't get hold of him,

465
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
 not picking up his phone.

466
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,040
 Where is he?"

467
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,960
 And eventually, weeks and weeks later,

468
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,200
 a journalist finally managed to get an interview with him

469
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
 and he wrote, "Poor guy."

470
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,000
 He wrote, "I can now put people out of their misery,"

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,040
 'cause everyone was saying,

472
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,160
 "Is he going to turn up to the ceremony?

473
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,000
 Is he gonna come?"

474
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,200
 The journalist went, "I can put people out of their misery.

475
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,760
 Yes, of course, he's planning to turn up

476
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,800
 to the award ceremony."

477
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
 I asked him about that and he said,

478
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,640
 "Absolutely, if it's a tool possible."

479
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,040
 Now, obviously, he didn't turn up to the award ceremony.

480
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,080
 (laughing)

481
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,360
 Because of pre-existing commitments.

482
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
 Who has pre-existing commitments more important

483
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,960
 than accepting a Nobel Prize?

484
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,520
 Did he win it for his lyrics and his songs?

485
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,360
 Yeah, yeah.

486
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
 So like this one,

487
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
 "Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup.

488
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,880
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling coop.

489
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,160
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead.

490
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,040
 Wiggle, you can raise the dead."

491
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,360
 That was one of his.

492
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,200
 Yeah.

493
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
 It's genius.

494
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,880
 (laughing)

495
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,000
 It's how he tells it, weirdly.

496
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,280
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.

497
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
 Okay.

498
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,280
 (laughing)

499
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,440
 That's what the Pulitzer saw.

500
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
 I see it now.

501
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,840
 Yeah, go, go, go, good.

502
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,880
 He's just taken the piss his whole life, isn't he?

503
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
 Like, he, someone, and I appreciate so much

504
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,920
 the research genius who found this out,

505
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,960
 that the lyrics from "Dean Tweedledum,"

506
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,440
 which is a very good song,

507
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,920
 are poached from various places.

508
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,480
 So it's unlike "Pruce" and "Hemingway,"

509
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,920
 fine, a time magazine article from 1961.

510
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,720
 Bit weird to take your lyrics from there.

511
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,400
 And also a lot of them were taken

512
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,000
 from a travel guide to New Orleans

513
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,560
 by a woman called Bethany Boltman.

514
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,400
 So.

515
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,240
 Is that allowed?

516
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,800
 Isn't it copyrighted or something?

517
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,640
 Do you know what?

518
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,680
 I don't think anyone would have the balls to sue.

519
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
 (laughing)

520
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
 But there were, there were things,

521
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
 you know, so if you hear lines in that song,

522
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,480
 like "Dripping in Garlic and Olive Oil,"

523
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,200
 or "Parade Permit and Police Escort,"

524
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,960
 just think, just from a guidebook.

525
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
 Three stars, yeah.

526
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,840
 Yeah.

527
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,680
 Wow.

528
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,040
 "Nicolas Cage's Grave."

529
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,880
 (laughing)

530
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,440
 That's all I know about New Orleans.

531
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,280
 Very good.

532
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,120
 "Nicolas Cage."

533
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,920
 "Bought a Grave" in New Orleans

534
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
 is like this amazing pyramid.

535
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
 Yeah.

536
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,600
 But he's not dead.

537
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
 Unlike, no, like Bob Dylan.

538
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,640
 Yeah.

539
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,480
 That's so similar.

540
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,320
 (laughing)

541
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,040
 Again, as time of recording.

542
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
 Oh God, I really hope we don't curse anything

543
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,600
 'cause he is an incredibly valuable guy to the world.

544
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,640
 I don't know, do you think we have that power?

545
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,480
 I don't know.

546
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,320
 We might.

547
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,160
 That's not worth a try, is it?

548
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,800
 Another song, "Mr. Tambourine Man."

549
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,640
 Yeah.

550
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
 Very, very beautiful, mysterious song.

551
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,800
 What does the lyrics mean?

552
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,720
 Can I just say James is actually shaking his head at that.

553
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,000
 This is how important James is about Bob Dylan music.

554
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,560
 It's one of his really, really famous early songs

555
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,320
 and it's very beautiful.

556
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
 The lyrics are very sort of rhythmic and poetic.

557
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
 It turns out it was just inspired by a musician he knew

558
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,040
 who owned an enormous tambourine.

559
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,880
 You know what?

560
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,960
 I would have guessed that, actually.

561
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
 Really?

562
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,160
 If it was from a greengrocer who had an enormous marrow,

563
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,840
 I would have been really surprised.

564
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,960
 That's "Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man."

565
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,400
 You think he's a greengrocer, right?

566
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
 He's good.

567
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,080
 (laughing)

568
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,040
 But he was called Bruce Langhorn

569
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,600
 and he just had a big old tambourine.

570
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,280
 He went on to start "Brother Bru Bru's African Hot Sauce."

571
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,120
 So, you know.

572
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,960
 (laughing)

573
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,800
 Wow, amazing.

574
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
 What a career.

575
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,200
 He never had a number one hit in the UK, Bob Dylan.

576
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,040
 Okay.

577
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,600
 And his highest ever charter was one

578
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 that's called "Like a Rolling Stone."

579
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,560
 (laughing)

580
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,600
 It is.

581
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,320
 Yes, I think a couple of people in the audience

582
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,160
 might have heard that one.

583
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,480
 Okay, you might know it.

584
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,360
 It got to number four in September 1965

585
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
 and that was his highest ever charting.

586
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,600
 But when that was at number four,

587
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,240
 the number two and number one,

588
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,360
 where I got you, babe, by Sonny and Cher,

589
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,200
 and I can't get no satisfaction by the Rolling Stones.

590
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,840
 That's a tough week, isn't it?

591
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,200
 Yes, you can't block that.

592
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,640
 He should have waited until 2019 to release

593
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,400
 "Like a Rolling Stone"

594
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
 when it wouldn't have been up against the Sausage Roll,

595
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,520
 Christmas song was up there.

596
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,360
 (laughing)

597
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
 But he's largely,

598
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
 his most popular songs are the ones that are covered.

599
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,480
 So, like Hendricks doing "All Along the Watchtower"

600
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,320
 or Adele doing "Make You Feel My Love."

601
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,400
 Not many people know that that's a Bob Dylan song

602
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,240
 from a much later album, which was a big hit for her.

603
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
 Like for someone who's as famous as he is,

604
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,440
 he's not a fame chaser.

605
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
 In his early days, he had to do interviews.

606
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,280
 You had to do them.

607
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,720
 By the way, if you haven't read his autobiography,

608
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
 it's incredibly good.

609
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,320
 I highly recommend it.

610
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,800
 None of it's true, but it's very good.

611
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,880
 Yeah, brilliant bit of fiction.

612
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,680
 Yeah, but so when you read some stories about him,

613
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,120
 I picture him as a sitting at home,

614
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,440
 just like, "Oh, don't see anyone."

615
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,680
 Just he sits on his own, not wanting to do anything.

616
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,120
 But he's got all these multitudes of interests

617
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,960
 that I didn't know about.

618
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,600
 One is he loves comedy.

619
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,560
 He's really into Jerry Lewis slapstick-style comedy.

620
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,200
 And he approached a guy called Larry Charles,

621
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
 who wrote a lot of Seinfeld episodes

622
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
 and was a big collaborator with Larry David

623
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
 on "Curb Your Enthusiasm."

624
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,560
 And he said, "I want to write a sitcom

625
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,560
 where I'm in it as a slapstick comedian star."

626
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,800
 And Larry was like, "Really?"

627
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,640
 And he said, "Yeah."

628
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
 And he took out...

629
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
 (audience laughing)

630
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,560
 He took out a box that he has.

631
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,040
 You've got a very good Dylan on you.

632
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,880
 (audience laughing)

633
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,800
 "Yeah, man, I want to be funny."

634
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,320
 (audience laughing)

635
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,760
 - Honestly, as someone who has no idea who this person is,

636
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,920
 this is very funny.

637
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
 (audience laughing)

638
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,600
 - This person?

639
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,280
 - I mean, he's like, "Hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr.

640
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,680
 What do you mean, man?"

641
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,760
 - Probably maybe the most mysterious incident in his life

642
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,000
 was his bike accident,

643
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,520
 because it changed the course of his career.

644
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,920
 This is in 1966.

645
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,840
 He had an accident on his most bike,

646
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,160
 and it was quite bad,

647
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,440
 and he ended up having to have healthcare

648
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
 for a period of time.

649
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,680
 And it meant that he sort of became a recluse for a long time.

650
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,000
 He didn't work for a bit.

651
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,680
 No one heard from him.

652
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
 But the thing is, we don't know

653
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,760
 what actually happened in the accident.

654
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,360
 We don't know how badly injured he was.

655
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,600
 We don't actually know if it happened at all.

656
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,400
 But it's the most debated thing ever.

657
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,720
 Any Bob Dylan fan has opinions on it.

658
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,680
 So, and he always has a different thing

659
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
 about what caused the accident.

660
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
 The sun got in his eyes.

661
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,400
 His bike slipped onto some oil.

662
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
 Sometimes he broke his back.

663
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,720
 Sometimes he was concussed.

664
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,400
 Sometimes he was fine.

665
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,240
 But all we know was he turned up at a doctor's house,

666
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,600
 which I didn't know he could do.

667
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,440
 He knew a doctor.

668
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,480
 He turned up at their house,

669
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,360
 and he stayed there for about a month,

670
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 sleeping on their sofa or whatever.

671
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,640
 And that was it.

672
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,320
 And I think he has admitted since

673
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,120
 that he basically was trying to get out of the whole fame thing.

674
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,920
 Didn't like the competitive rat race.

675
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,880
 So, baked a bike accident.

676
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
 - Wow.

677
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,160
 - I think you can walk into most places

678
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,040
 if you're the level of Bob Dylan.

679
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,160
 And if you know where the doctor lives,

680
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,000
 you just go to their house.

681
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,240
 They're not going to go, "Sorry, Bob."

682
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
 - Yeah, it was rural, wasn't it?

683
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,080
 It was neighborhood stuff.

684
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,920
 - Yeah.

685
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
 And do you think you should let them stay for a month?

686
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,200
 How many months could they stay before

687
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,640
 you kick them out even if they're Bob Dylan?

688
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,280
 - How many months can you stay at a doctor's house?

689
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
 There's actually a rejected line from

690
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,760
 "How many roads must a man walk down?"

691
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,120
 (audience laughing)

692
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,960
 - Very close.

693
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,440
 - Before he will chuck you out.

694
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,840
 - James has no idea what that means.

695
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
 (audience laughing)

696
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,560
 - I assume it's one of his songs.

697
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,240
 - Can I do another thing that,

698
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
 another bit of James Bating here?

699
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,480
 - Yeah, of course.

700
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,600
 - Okay, I'll see if you like this, okay.

701
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 'Cause you will like a bit of it.

702
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,920
 There was for 20 years at least,

703
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,240
 there was a huge competition between some academics.

704
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
 In 1997, there were two researchers in Stockholm.

705
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,040
 They released a paper called "Nitric Oxide and Inflammation."

706
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,440
 The answer is "Blowin' in the Wind,"

707
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,840
 which is clever.

708
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,800
 And then several years later,

709
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,960
 two other researchers coincidentally published a piece

710
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,160
 called "Blood on the Tracks, A Simple Twist of Fate,"

711
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,440
 which I think might have been genealogical.

712
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
 Anyway, they decided to compete to see

713
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
 how many Dylan lyrics they could get into their papers

714
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,840
 before retirement.

715
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,240
 And then a fifth one joined after he wrote something

716
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,400
 called "Tangled Up in Blue, Molecular Cardiology

717
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,840
 in the Post-Molecular Era."

718
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,680
 (audience laughing)

719
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,880
 And this has just been going on for a very long time.

720
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,760
 - Did you come across Karl Gornitsky

721
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,000
 when you were reading about this?

722
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
 - I don't think so.

723
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,480
 - So Karl Gornitsky is a librarian

724
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,440
 who found out about this and he thought,

725
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,920
 well, what I'm gonna do is see how often people

726
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,400
 use Bob Dylan lyrics in all of the papers.

727
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,440
 And he found that there are at least 200 examples

728
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,080
 of papers that unequivocably use Bob Dylan's words

729
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,200
 in their titles.

730
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,960
 And he found that they are cited slightly less often

731
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,920
 than other similar articles.

732
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
 (audience laughing)

733
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,800
 And he said in his papers,

734
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,880
 he thinks that there will be fewer Dylan references

735
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,960
 in the future because, and I quote,

736
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,560
 "Researchers concede they weren't quite as clever

737
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
 as they were intending."

738
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,400
 (audience laughing)

739
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,640
 - Maybe he didn't write them

740
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,240
 in order to be included in the scientific papers.

741
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,360
 - Well, maybe they were trying to quote

742
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,200
 an old tourist guide that actually,

743
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,920
 they've never heard of the songs.

744
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,880
 - Do you know the oldest recording we have of Bob Dylan?

745
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
 At least according to my research.

746
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,920
 So this was one that was made in St. Paul in 1960.

747
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,360
 And it resurfaced in 1978.

748
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,760
 And a fan-zine writer called Brian Stiball

749
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,520
 went to the person's house who found it

750
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,360
 and said, "Oh, can I listen to this Bob Dylan tape?"

751
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,040
 And the guy, the owner,

752
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,880
 insisted that his partner did the dishes

753
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,040
 while they played it because he was so sure

754
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,160
 that they were going to record the tape

755
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
 when he played it for them.

756
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,960
 So you'd have all that background noise.

757
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,760
 And sure enough, they did record it.

758
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,840
 (laughing)

759
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,200
 And the bootleg is known as the armpit tape

760
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
 because it's such bad quality.

761
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,320
 - Lovely. - It still exists.

762
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,280
 - People get so weird about him.

763
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,000
 There's an Institute of Dylanology

764
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,280
 in the University of Tulsa,

765
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,520
 which is not officially called that,

766
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,080
 it's the Institute for Bob Dylan Studies.

767
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,560
 But they bought his archive in 2016

768
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,800
 for about $15 million and it's 100,000 documents

769
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,640
 from his library. - Wow.

770
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,000
 - It's really intense.

771
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,360
 I was in, people get so far into him.

772
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,200
 - They do.

773
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,880
 But also, you know, he's not the easiest person

774
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,120
 to recognize sometimes, which works in his favor,

775
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,000
 because he does all of these weird things in public.

776
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
 Like he went through a phase in 2008, 2009

777
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,320
 of wanting to turn up at the houses

778
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,840
 where musicians had lived in their childhoods.

779
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,680
 - Oh, yes.

780
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,600
 - He turned up in this random house in Winnipeg

781
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,280
 where Neil Young had grown up

782
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,960
 and it was now occupied by just a couple

783
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
 called Kean and Passie,

784
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
 who came home from their shopping trip

785
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,800
 to find a guy on their doorstep who they didn't recognize.

786
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,760
 - Is that your holiday home today, is there any chance?

787
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,560
 - Didn't he get on a magical mystery tour bus in Liverpool

788
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,200
 and go around all of the Beatles childhoods?

789
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,120
 - I think he might have, I think he might have.

790
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,960
 - He's a big fan of musicians.

791
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
 He loved the Beatles.

792
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,040
 He said that Beatles transformed America at a time

793
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,160
 when it desperately needed to come out of a depression

794
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,640
 and have a hit of happiness.

795
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,200
 And when Elvis died, he stayed silent for a week.

796
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
 He was so distraught from his death.

797
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,680
 - Yeah.

798
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,080
 - I'm just showing my own tribute there.

799
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,920
 - Oh, yeah.

800
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,200
 He was going to play for the Pope in 1997

802
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,680
 and then the next Pope next it.

803
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,040
 So he was going to play for John Paul II.

804
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,880
 - Yeah.

805
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,080
 - The second in 1997.

806
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,440
 - That's John Paul II squared, isn't it John Paul II?

807
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,680
 - He was going to play John Paul IV.

808
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,720
 But then Cardinal Ratzinger tried to stop it happening.

809
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,560
 Benedict the 16th.

810
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
 - Why did he try to stop it happening?

811
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,720
 - He said it was inappropriate.

812
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,320
 He thought it was wrong.

813
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,560
 He thought it was sort of a bit profite.

814
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,280
 But John Paul II did give a sermon saying,

815
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,440
 "You asked me how many roads a man must walk down

816
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,240
 "before he becomes a man.

817
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
 "I answer, there is only one road for man

818
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,840
 "and it is the road of Jesus Christ."

819
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,240
 - Doesn't scan as well, does it?

820
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,920
 - Yeah, it doesn't.

821
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
 - See why he didn't incorporate that.

822
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,000
 - Yeah.

823
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,580
 (upbeat music)

824
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,720
 - Time for fact number three and that is Anna.

825
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
 - My fact this week is that the US government

826
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,240
 runs a lottery where if you win,

827
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,200
 you get to go and watch fireflies light up.

828
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,480
 - Ah.

829
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,320
 - It's so sweet.

830
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,160
 - No, as good as winning 10 million quid.

831
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
 - Well, you know, in some ways it's better, James,

832
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,080
 'cause what's richer than nature?

833
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
 - That's good money.

834
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,560
 (laughing)

835
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,040
 - You can buy that forest.

836
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,080
 (laughing)

837
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,440
 - She had just cut to you guys waving your wallet

838
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,320
 to the firefly, light up.

839
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,560
 (laughing)

840
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,280
 - Well, millionaire Dan,

841
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,720
 you can't buy the forest 'cause it's in a national park.

842
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,560
 - Okay.

843
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,400
 - And this is a national park.

844
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,440
 It's the Great Smoky Mountains National Park

845
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,760
 in Tennessee and a bit of North Carolina.

846
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,920
 And the fireflies every year put on this incredible display,

847
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
 not for the humans, just for each other,

848
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,720
 but it is amazing.

849
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,080
 It's two weeks early June

850
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,440
 and it's the synchronous fireflies.

851
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,440
 It's one of the only places that it happens in the US

852
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,320
 and the only place it happens on this scale.

853
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,560
 And basically it started happening

854
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,240
 about mid-1990s when the national park

855
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,280
 removed the street lights.

856
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,960
 So it got really dark there

857
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,960
 and fireflies love darkness 'cause their lights show up

858
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,520
 and people realized it was a thing

859
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
 and they started flocking to this national park

860
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,280
 to see these fireflies all lighting up in synchrony.

861
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,200
 It's extraordinary, it's millions of them,

862
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,520
 like a Mexican wave going on and off.

863
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,280
 And there were so many that at first

864
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,160
 they decided to do a first come, first serve thing

865
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,040
 with ticketing and the queues were just insanely long.

866
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 So now there are 1,800 parking passes given out every year

867
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,480
 and you can apply for them.

868
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,600
 About 30,000 people applied in 2019.

869
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,360
 So it's round that level and you might win.

870
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,120
 And if you win, you bring your foldable chairs,

871
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,400
 you bring your inflatable sofas, some people do.

872
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,640
 You bring your teddy bear.

873
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160
 You really settle in for the night

874
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,920
 and then you wait for the fireflies to light up.

875
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,760
 - It's pretty cool.

876
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,240
 - Are there rules about what you can or can't bring?

877
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,520
 Are you not allowed to bring a torch

878
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,320
 in case that's confusing to them?

879
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
 - You have to have red light so that they can't see it.

880
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,920
 - You certainly can't have normal white light, yes.

881
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,760
 - Yeah.

882
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,080
 'Cause they get confused by the lights, don't they?

883
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,920
 - Yes.

884
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,000
 - If you get a load of fireflies

885
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,840
 and there's street lights around,

886
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,920
 they just won't mate with each other.

887
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,320
 And it's so much so that you can get two fireflies

888
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,520
 and you can put them right next to each other

889
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,920
 and they might be really horny, but they won't mate.

890
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,760
 - Right.

891
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,360
 - And we don't really show why they won't do it,

892
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,120
 but we think what it is is it's 'cause they think it's daytime

893
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,360
 and they only do it at nighttime.

894
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,080
 - Oh, sensible fellows.

895
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,120
 (laughing)

896
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,600
 Doesn't it look a bit like Godzilla to them?

897
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,320
 Isn't it just like a giant version?

898
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,120
 - And does that put you in the mood, Dan?

899
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,520
 Because if it doesn't, I think we've got our answer.

900
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,760
 - I reckon if you and your wife are there

901
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,800
 and a huge Yeti walks in, I can only imagine

902
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,600
 that's gonna help things in the bedroom.

903
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
 (laughing)

904
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,640
 - I think in a very one-sided way, sure.

905
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,880
 (laughing)

906
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
 - Honey, you can leave.

907
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,920
 We'll tell them this.

908
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,320
 (laughing)

909
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,280
 - You know what they say about big feet?

910
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,520
 (laughing)

911
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,840
 - They're pretty amazing fireflies.

912
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,600
 I've never looked into them before.

913
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
 They're astonishing.

914
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,640
 I mean, the fire in them, it's guys, it's not a real fire.

915
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,360
 It is like a, yeah, I know, right?

916
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,000
 It's like a bioluminescence.

917
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
 It's a thing that is made in them

918
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,560
 as a combination of chemicals that combine together.

919
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,640
 The main thing that people try and extract

920
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,560
 is a thing called luciferase.

921
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,200
 It sounds like lucifer's being used

922
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,680
 as the etymology term there.

923
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,560
 - Well, lucifer means light bringer,

924
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,040
 which is where lucifer, the devil comes from, so, yeah.

925
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,280
 - So I was correct.

926
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
 (laughing)

927
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,560
 Sometimes I like to assume

928
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,920
 and have it confirmed on stage by the others.

929
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,920
 And it's amazing what they can do with it.

930
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,000
 It's used for mating reasons.

931
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,560
 It's used for competitive advantage.

932
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,320
 You will have female fireflies of one species,

933
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,680
 and there are many thousands of different species,

934
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,760
 and they will mimic the light of the male

935
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,840
 and another subspecies to attract the female from mating

936
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
 only to eat them up so that they can steal

937
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,480
 certain bits of them.

938
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,760
 - That's not feminism hasn't got to the firefly community,

939
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,600
 has it?

940
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
 - But do you know why they do that?

941
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,400
 It's not only for food.

942
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,560
 - It's a toxin, right?

943
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,360
 - Yes, there's this predator repelling toxin,

944
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,800
 and part of the firefly flash, gee, whiz.

945
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,720
 - I know, it's really tough.

946
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,640
 - Just hadn't had a run up at that.

947
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,640
 - Part of the firefly flashing is to attract a mate,

948
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,520
 but a part of it is also to say to predators, I am toxic.

949
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,000
 And they have this, it's Lusibufegin toxin.

950
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,280
 Why can't I say that first time?

951
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,920
 Don't know.

952
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,720
 But these, the females, the sort of femme fatale females,

953
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,240
 they can't make their own version of that toxin,

954
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,720
 so they have to eat the males,

955
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,760
 so they gather, they harvest it from the corpses

956
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
 of the males they devour.

957
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,720
 And I just think that's pretty cool.

958
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
 - It's cool, if you order a hamburger

959
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,920
 that I wanted, it's like me eating you together.

960
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,320
 (audience laughing)

961
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,360
 - Yes.

962
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,400
 - But these poor males are trying desperately

963
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,320
 to find females of their own species,

964
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,160
 then they know it's a risk as well.

965
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,320
 And sometimes it takes them a week

966
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,000
 to find an actual female of their own species,

967
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,440
 and they're just constantly dodging, you know,

968
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,800
 predator fireflies. - False flags.

969
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,640
 - False flags, yeah.

970
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,560
 - Can I just ask a quick, sorry to cut you off,

971
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,600
 but Andy, well, you've just raised a good point,

972
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,080
 which is to eat Andy if he's had the hamburger, right?

973
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,360
 We were coming into New Zealand,

974
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,120
 and you obviously aren't allowed to bring in fruit, right?

975
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,600
 So I had a banana just before we came in, right?

976
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,760
 So I ate it on the plane, and I got off.

977
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,320
 And the sniffer dogs went past us,

978
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,000
 and I just thought, why can't it smell it in me?

979
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,840
 Why can't it?

980
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,040
 (audience laughing)

981
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,440
 Like it's still quite fresh.

982
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,960
 - You're a messy eater, but you didn't rub it

983
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,080
 all over your, if you could.

984
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,440
 - If you wanted to sneak something into the country,

985
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,560
 if you could get the stomach of a person,

986
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,360
 it seems like you could put it in there.

987
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,200
 - Yeah.

988
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,040
 - Yeah, it says it back.

989
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,880
 - Yeah.

990
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,920
 (audience laughing)

991
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,840
 - You just invented smuggling, that's it.

992
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,680
 - Oh yeah, and a bottom might be even better.

993
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
 - Oh my God.

994
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,800
 - You've blown this shit wide open?

995
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,080
 No, I'm not sure you have.

996
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,320
 - We should say the ones, the fireflies

997
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,440
 that are visited by all these tourists,

998
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,520
 and for whom the lottery is run,

999
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,080
 that is just flirting, the flashing.

1000
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,160
 But it was quite confusing at first, I think,

1001
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,560
 because it's not usual.

1002
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,400
 The vast majority of firefly species

1003
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,160
 just flash as individuals, and these ones flash in unison,

1004
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,080
 and it starts off like one will do a flash,

1005
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,280
 and then another will pick up on it,

1006
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,840
 and it starts off looking quite random,

1007
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,480
 and gradually as more and more do it,

1008
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,680
 they manage to tune like an orchestra,

1009
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,080
 and do it all together.

1010
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
 But the reason they're doing it in unison

1011
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,600
 is 'cause it's all males doing that flashing.

1012
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,240
 The females flash back, but it's very dim,

1013
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,680
 you can't really see it if you're a human.

1014
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,400
 It's all males doing the flashing,

1015
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,760
 and it tells the female that that is the right species,

1016
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,960
 because if there's any other species flashing,

1017
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,160
 then it'll not be flashing in time.

1018
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,720
 But it's quite a shit show for the males,

1019
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,560
 because I think the ratio is about 100 to one

1020
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,920
 often, males to females.

1021
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,600
 So even so, if you're the male,

1022
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,880
 you're just accepting as you flash in unison,

1023
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,520
 it's like we have to work together on this,

1024
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,360
 even though probably I'm not gonna be the one who gets it.

1025
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,200
 Isn't that sad?

1026
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,960
 - In a way, it's also a kind of lottery, isn't it?

1027
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,760
 - Oh my God. - Oh, yeah.

1028
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,680
 - There's a lottery to see the firefly lottery, wow.

1029
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,080
 - That's good. - How deep does this go?

1030
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,920
 - Yeah.

1031
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,760
 Well, the females, they can have dialogues

1032
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,120
 with 10 males at once.

1033
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,280
 If there's some species chat back and forth

1034
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,120
 with the flashing. - Really?

1035
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,200
 Oh, with the flashing, right?

1036
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,040
 - Yeah, yeah, and so-- - Only the slags.

1037
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,160
 - Ah, no. (laughing)

1038
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,680
 They mate with only one they pick,

1039
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,880
 they sort of winnow down from.

1040
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,120
 It's a bit Love Island, actually.

1041
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,360
 They start with 10 males who they're chatting to,

1042
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,200
 and then they end up.

1043
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,480
 - But are they sending the same message?

1044
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,480
 Is it kind of like when you go onto a chatbot thing,

1045
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,120
 and you think you're flirting,

1046
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,880
 and then you realize it's automated answers?

1047
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,640
 This is an insurance website.

1048
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,040
 - Yeah. (laughing)

1049
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,560
 - No, I've never seen Godzilla.

1050
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,320
 (laughing)

1051
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,320
 - One thing about these, the flashing,

1052
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,680
 it's kind of like, I guess it's like dancing

1053
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,240
 'cause it's in rhythm, isn't it?

1054
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,560
 But if you get two fireflies next to each other,

1055
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,000
 and they're from the same species,

1056
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,720
 and they're supposed to be able to do it in rhythm,

1057
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,040
 they can't, they just get all over the place.

1058
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,480
 If you get three, they still can't,

1059
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
 and if you get 10, they still can't,

1060
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,600
 and it takes about 20 of them to get together,

1061
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 and suddenly they all start doing it in rhythm together.

1062
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
 - That's really interesting.

1063
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,240
 - It's true of dancing, isn't it?

1064
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,760
 You know, if there's just two of you on a dance floor,

1065
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,200
 it's incredibly awkward.

1066
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

1067
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,280
 - But as soon as there's 20.

1068
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
 - It feels like it.

1069
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,080
 We are the same.

1070
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,480
 - There's a scary thing which is that

1071
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,880
 their population is declining globally,

1072
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,440
 and one of the main reasons is,

1073
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,880
 let's say there's a group of fireflies that are in an area,

1074
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,120
 and then that gets urbanized,

1075
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,480
 and it gets concreted over.

1076
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,160
 They don't then fly and find another place.

1077
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,040
 They just disappear.

1078
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,600
 The species just dies as this thing in it,

1079
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,200
 where it just goes, "All right, that's us done.

1080
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,120
 "We can't move over there."

1081
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,160
 So that's really sad as we continue to urbanize.

1082
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
 But also, we kind of don't know

1083
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,080
 how many fireflies there are necessarily,

1084
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,240
 because a lot of them hang out in the day,

1085
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,480
 so we can't see them.

1086
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,800
 - Yeah, and don't glow, right?

1087
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,160
 - They don't glow, so they use pheromones instead

1088
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,640
 of their glow.

1089
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,120
 - There could be a million in here right now.

1090
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
 - Yeah.

1091
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,800
 - We wouldn't know.

1092
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,560
 - We would, 'cause it's quite dark, but it's, yeah.

1093
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,720
 - Another reason why they're endangered

1094
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,520
 is that we used to farm them.

1095
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,560
 Well, not farm them as collect them.

1096
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,480
 So there's a company called the Sigma Chemical Company

1097
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,480
 that harvested about 3 million of fireflies every year,

1098
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,880
 and they were trying to get this Luciferase,

1099
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,080
 which Dan was talking about,

1100
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,680
 because you can use it in food safety testing and research.

1101
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,200
 - Oh, cool.

1102
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,200
 Well, they have come in very useful to science, generally.

1103
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,840
 They are particularly useful in energy efficiency.

1104
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,240
 So I think they let out the most efficient light we know of.

1105
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,120
 It's the most efficient light in the world,

1106
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,600
 in the universe that we're aware of,

1107
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,960
 because when they let off their light,

1108
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
 almost no heat is emitted,

1109
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,240
 so almost 100% of the energy is emitted as light.

1110
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,080
 And so--

1111
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,240
 - Wait, do you mean they're like LED,

1112
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,080
 as in they're not hot?

1113
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

1114
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,440
 - Yeah, exactly, but LED is a bit hot.

1115
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,480
 They are not hot, but they made LEDs better.

1116
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,520
 So there's a so cool thing where there was a physicist

1117
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,840
 called Jean-Paul Vigneron, who went, he was Belgian,

1118
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,400
 and he went on a trip to Central America in, I think, about 2012,

1119
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,040
 and he saw a bunch of fireflies glowing,

1120
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,080
 and he thought, "I wonder how they do that?"

1121
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,360
 And this is a science brain.

1122
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,400
 He just, he took some, he brought them back to his lab,

1123
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,040
 and he looked inside them,

1124
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,880
 and he saw that the way they were making their light

1125
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,640
 efficiently was that they had these,

1126
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,080
 like, really jagged, irregular scales on their abdomen,

1127
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,040
 and that meant that the light was shining really efficiently,

1128
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
 so that meant that you could get the maximum amount of light

1129
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,760
 coming out for the minimum amount of energy,

1130
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,720
 and that's how LED lights are designed now,

1131
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,360
 and he increased the energy efficiency by 50%.

1132
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,200
 - You're joking.

1133
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,040
 - Wow.

1134
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,200
 - So that's how-- - That is insane.

1135
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,280
 - I know, they, it's good old fireflies.

1136
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,160
 - Could we ethically replace LEDs with them, somehow?

1137
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,840
 Like, picture your Christmas tree, right?

1138
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,680
 - Oh, lovely.

1139
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
 - If we had, like, some kind of pheromone

1140
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,520
 that meant they were happy hanging out by the tree,

1141
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,320
 and you had flying LED lights around your entire tree,

1142
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,160
 is that possible?

1143
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,080
 - I think the audience doesn't like the sound of it.

1144
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,440
 I think it's less convenient, I do.

1145
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,960
 - They have to be, if your lights had to be in the mood,

1146
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
 (audience laughing)

1147
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,000
 to be on, probably, you might have a few dark Christmases,

1148
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,880
 you know. (audience laughing)

1149
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,880
 Can I tell you one more thing about the dangerous lady

1150
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,000
 fireflies, the ones who eat the males?

1151
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,120
 - These. - Them fatals, yeah.

1152
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,600
 - So not only do they eat males of a different genus,

1153
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,360
 they will sometimes eat males of their own genus

1154
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,040
 if they're merely hungry.

1155
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,800
 Some of them will break off mid-sex to eat their partner.

1156
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,120
 Mid?

1157
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,960
 - Wait, that can't be mid-sex.

1158
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,080
 That's just the end of sex.

1159
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,880
 - Yeah. (audience laughing)

1160
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,480
 Fair point, fair point.

1161
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,400
 - It's an unexpectedly abrupt ending of sex.

1162
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,000
 - But the poor man, oh, this is the end, is it?

1163
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,320
 Where's the end?

1164
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
 I've got more, I've got more in the tank.

1165
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,640
 I've got more moves.

1166
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,440
 (audience laughing)

1167
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,280
 Ow.

1168
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,120
 Some.

1169
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,600
 (audience laughing)

1170
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,440
 Some males in this genus, the prey genus of fireflies,

1171
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,640
 they have special arms on either side of their penis

1172
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,720
 that remain outside the female for copulation.

1173
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,000
 And some scientists believe this might be

1174
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,520
 an incoming cannibalism alert system.

1175
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,360
 (audience laughing)

1176
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,280
 And if the female starts wriggling around

1177
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,560
 because she's started to feel a bit peckish,

1178
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,000
 the male is notified that this is a risk

1179
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
 and it gets a sort of early warning.

1180
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,360
 - Amazing.

1181
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,400
 The arms, what, hold on to her or what?

1182
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,160
 - I think they just stick out at the base, if you like.

1183
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,960
 - Maybe they tap her on the shoulder

1184
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,360
 from behind to distract her then.

1185
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,000
 (audience laughing)

1186
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,920
 And then they're off.

1187
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,760
 (audience laughing)

1188
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,360
 - Ah, we're, shit!

1189
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
 (audience laughing)

1190
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,640
 - I was mid-sex.

1191
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,640
 (audience laughing)

1192
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,220
 (upbeat music)

1193
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,120
 - It is now time for our final fact of the show

1194
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,680
 and that is James.

1195
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,960
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the scientific paper,

1196
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,560
 "Detection of Noda Virus in Barramundi"

1197
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,560
 was co-authored by Dr. Barry Munday.

1198
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,960
 (audience laughing)

1199
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,680
 - I feel like that's shut down the show.

1200
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,720
 That's the greatest fact ever.

1201
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
 Do you know it, everyone? - That's incredible.

1202
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,640
 - It is amazing. - It's incredible.

1203
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,600
 - So I found out that this guy called Dr. Barry Munday

1204
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,520
 worked in Tasmanian fisheries

1205
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,480
 and I know that he'd done some studies.

1206
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,720
 So I went through a list of all of the studies

1207
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,760
 that he'd done in the hope and the dream

1208
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,520
 that one of them was about Barry Munday

1209
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,520
 and sure enough, he did do this one very obscure one.

1210
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,120
 - That's incredible.

1211
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,840
 He passed away a few years ago.

1212
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,680
 - Yeah, 2003.

1213
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,240
 - Yeah, 2003 and I found this really beautiful obituary

1214
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,800
 of his entire career online and it's so detailed.

1215
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,480
 They do not say he wrote a paper

1216
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,760
 on a fucking Barry Munday.

1217
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,960
 (audience laughing)

1218
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,800
 It's unbelievable.

1219
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,120
 - It was really important.

1220
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,720
 - Do you have any idea if he, sorry,

1221
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,160
 I do want to know about the important things he did,

1222
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,840
 but mostly I want to know if he wrote this paper

1223
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,680
 because his name is Barry Munday.

1224
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,200
 - I don't think so, genuinely don't think so.

1225
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,280
 - He mops in his head, I'm sure.

1226
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,120
 - Do you reckon?

1227
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,960
 - Surely.

1228
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,200
 - I don't know, I reckon.

1229
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,880
 There's a lot of this about, actually,

1230
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,800
 'cause I basically Googled every fish name

1231
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,480
 I could think of to see if there are other people like this.

1232
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,040
 There's a guy called Stephen Haddock

1233
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,960
 who's working on Deep Sea Gelatinous zooplankton.

1234
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,800
 - Amazing.

1235
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,800
 - John Salmon was a fish spotter in the 1980s.

1236
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,840
 - Fish spotter.

1237
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,960
 - Yeah, he would fly over in his plane and go,

1238
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,880
 there's one.

1239
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,920
 (audience laughing)

1240
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,760
 - Really?

1241
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,600
 - No, he wouldn't say there's one.

1242
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,200
 He said like there's a school of fish

1243
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,880
 and then he would give the coordinates

1244
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,920
 and people would be able to go and catch them if they want.

1245
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
 - Right.

1246
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,800
 - Do you know, so weirdly, I thought when he says

1247
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,680
 fish spotter, he meant someone who put spots on fish

1248
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,240
 and I don't know why they would do that,

1249
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,560
 so that's what I thought.

1250
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,240
 - Courtney Pike was the angling correspondent

1251
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,360
 for the Suffolk Gazette.

1252
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,280
 - That's brilliant.

1253
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,360
 - Jack Trout was the person who read

1254
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,800
 the fishing report show from San Francisco's KNBR 680.

1255
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,200
 - Jesus, what happened, James?

1256
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,040
 - Frank E...

1257
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,880
 (laughing)

1258
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,720
 - What?

1259
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,560
 - Is everyone still here?

1260
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,520
 (audience laughing)

1261
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,360
 - What?

1262
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,200
 - Frank...

1263
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,440
 - Frank E. Fish wrote lots of papers all about fish,

1264
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,120
 especially the biomechanics of manoeuvrability

1265
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,960
 and jet propulsion in fish.

1266
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,880
 - Wow.

1267
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,000
 - That took you most of 2024.

1268
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,840
 (laughing)

1269
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,680
 - We know it.

1270
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,160
 - Courtney Trout.

1271
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,480
 - Oh, no, Courtney Pike.

1272
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,360
 - Oh, sorry, Courtney Pike is the question

1273
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,000
 that an angling correspondent would ask.

1274
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,360
 - It's brilliant, that, isn't it?

1275
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,200
 - What do you mean?

1276
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,040
 - So, Courtney Pike.

1277
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,880
 - Have you Courtney Pike?

1278
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,720
 - Oh, Courtney Pike.

1279
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,880
 - Courtney Pike, got that.

1280
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,200
 - Beautiful.

1281
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,040
 - Amazing.

1282
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,880
 - Beautiful.

1283
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,800
 - Baramundi, the fish itself.

1284
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,640
 - Oh, yeah.

1285
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,520
 - Hugely popular in Australia.

1286
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,720
 It's massively popular, right?

1287
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,560
 - They're obsessed with it.

1288
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,400
 - They're obsessed with it.

1289
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,720
 But one of the issues is that they're discovering

1290
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,080
 that a lot of Baramundi is being imported

1291
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,960
 that aren't Baramundi.

1292
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,520
 It's almost like they're a fake cosplaying fish.

1293
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,840
 Not the fish on doing it.

1294
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,200
 It's the humans that are selling it.

1295
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,040
 - Okay.

1296
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,880
 - But there are rules in Australia

1297
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,080
 that mean that the food service is under no obligation

1298
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,920
 to label whether or not it is a local or imported fish.

1299
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,280
 So, people don't know the better.

1300
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,200
 They're being misled.

1301
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,400
 And so this is a big problem,

1302
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,680
 according to the head of the Northern Territory

1303
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,760
 Seafood Council, who's called Rob Fish.

1304
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,600
 So.

1305
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,440
 - Brilliant.

1306
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,680
 - Do you want to do a full 15 minutes of these?

1307
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,800
 - Hopefully, no.

1308
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,920
 - Do you know one of the main fish

1309
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,600
 that scandalously has been disguised as Baramundi

1310
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,960
 is from New Zealand?

1311
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,800
 It's the New Zealand grouper.

1312
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,480
 Why do you have a fish called a grouper?

1313
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,840
 I imagine it's from the same origin as grouper,

1314
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,640
 which is the normal fish we have in the Northern Hemisphere.

1315
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,920
 But yes, a New Zealand grouper.

1316
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,840
 - The New Zealand grouper has tiny arms on its penis,

1317
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,680
 doesn't it?

1318
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,160
 (audience laughing)

1319
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,480
 - It's actually, do you guys know, do you eat grouper a lot?

1320
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,680
 Not many, but it's really popular.

1321
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,640
 And it was very popular in Maori culture.

1322
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,520
 And in Maori it's called hapuka.

1323
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,320
 But I think hapuka, the word means

1324
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,880
 that it means to stuff your face with food,

1325
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,360
 because it's so popular.

1326
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,200
 - That's cool.

1327
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,640
 - Baramundi, a couple more things about them.

1328
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,920
 They can eat food up to 60% of their own length,

1329
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,400
 which is the equivalent of me eating a four foot long sausage.

1330
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,720
 So that's food for thought, isn't it?

1331
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,560
 - Wow.

1332
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,400
 (laughing)

1333
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,840
 - What is the longest sausage you've ever eaten?

1334
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,680
 - I did go.

1335
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,440
 There's a restaurant in Viennical Centre meter

1336
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,200
 where you order your food by the length.

1337
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,040
 - Really?

1338
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,880
 - Really.

1339
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,720
 - And we ordered the special,

1340
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,160
 which is a wheelbarrow for the sausages.

1341
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
 - Wow.

1342
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,520
 - It's unbelievable.

1343
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,880
 They bring this wheelbarrow.

1344
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,840
 It's a small barrow,

1345
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,240
 but you don't realize how big a small wheelbarrow is,

1346
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,600
 'cause you know what I mean.

1347
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1348
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

1349
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
 - And it's big, it's big.

1350
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,840
 So I probably got through them.

1351
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,120
 No, I don't know if I got through a meter of sausages then.

1352
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,960
 No, I can't get done.

1353
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,640
 - I think you could easily eat a four foot sausage.

1354
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,480
 - In one go?

1355
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,300
 - In one go?

1356
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,080
 - Well, you can chew it.

1357
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,440
 You're allowed to chew.

1358
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,280
 - You're allowed to chew,

1359
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,760
 but you can't eat it.

1360
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
 (audience laughs)

1361
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,920
 I mean, James, that is just gonna get clipped out

1362
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,760
 at that centre.

1363
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,740
 (audience laughs)

1364
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,860
 - Didn't even cross my mind.

1365
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,640
 - No, four foot of sausage.

1366
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,400
 Come on, even a cumberland's only about eight feet.

1367
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,240
 - If it's very thin, easy.

1368
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,040
 - Is it not thin, it's a sausage?

1369
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,880
 - No.

1370
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,400
 You can't just turn it into a pepper army and wolf it.

1371
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,080
 I'm talking a thick old cumberland.

1372
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,920
 - We're talking about.

1373
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,720
 (audience laughs)

1374
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,680
 - Please guys, we are talking about sausages.

1375
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,380
 This is not, there's no sight to this.

1376
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,140
 - We need to start.

1377
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,820
 - So four foot, that's the length that you think,

1378
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,180
 no, because I read varying accounts

1379
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,940
 of what the largest barramundi that's ever been caught is.

1380
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,260
 And one went as far as saying it was five foot 10.

1381
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,180
 And that's massive.

1382
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,180
 I can't believe that's true.

1383
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,820
 That's if you want to picture that size,

1384
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,620
 that's the same height as Neil Finn.

1385
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,460
 That's how big a five foot nine, five foot 10.

1386
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,780
 - Who's that, sorry?

1387
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,540
 (audience laughs)

1388
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,920
 - Okay, it's a New Zealander.

1389
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,600
 I thought you'd literally just Googled

1390
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,240
 everyone who was the height.

1391
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,120
 I got, oh, they've got a funny fish sounding name.

1392
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,820
 - Neil Finn is, there's a very famous Australian band called.

1393
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,160
 (audience laughs)

1394
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,200
 There's an incredibly famous New Zealand band

1395
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,280
 called Split Ends, which became Crowded House.

1396
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,580
 And Neil Finn is the, is from Crowded House.

1397
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,800
 - But Dan would have said Neil Finn

1398
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,760
 because of the word Finn.

1399
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,600
 - Exactly, well, I'll tell you my working.

1400
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,900
 I found out it was five foot 10.

1401
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,340
 And I sat at the computer and went,

1402
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,060
 please tell me Neil Finn is five foot 10.

1403
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,900
 And he is.

1404
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,220
 (audience laughs)

1405
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,060
 - That's the way to do it, James.

1406
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,100
 - That's how you save time.

1407
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,940
 - That's how you do it.

1408
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,340
 Just claim is right.

1409
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,020
 - You assume and let other things confirm it.

1410
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,820
 - No, they are very cool though.

1411
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,820
 They sometimes eat baby crocodiles per a Monday.

1412
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,760
 I mean, they're really--

1413
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,140
 - Yeah, they'll eat any old stuff.

1414
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,100
 - They'll eat any old stuff.

1415
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,420
 - They have a relation called the Antarctic Toothfish

1416
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,620
 and they eat lots of rocks.

1417
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,460
 (audience laughs)

1418
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,220
 And we're not really sure why they do it,

1419
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,200
 but it seems like the reason they do it

1420
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,240
 is 'cause they just want to eat everything

1421
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,120
 and the rocks get in the way.

1422
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,960
 - Really?

1423
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,800
 - Yeah, that's pretty good.

1424
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,160
 - So it's not an eating thing, they don't--

1425
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,440
 - No, it doesn't seem that way.

1426
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,320
 It seems like it's just useful for them

1427
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,760
 because they're so rare for them to get food

1428
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,920
 just that if they see anything, they just go for it.

1429
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,760
 - Right.

1430
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,320
 - It's like when you get really greedy people

1431
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,960
 and you look at their finished meal

1432
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,700
 and all the cutlery's gone and everything.

1433
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,520
 (audience laughs)

1434
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,360
 - It's amazing.

1435
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,800
 They do this extraordinary thing as well, Baramundi,

1436
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,300
 which is the males, they will start off as male

1437
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,580
 and then there's a first wave in their life cycle

1438
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,980
 of mating that goes on and they'll go around

1439
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,900
 impregnating as many female Baramundi as possible

1440
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,300
 and then once that's done and they grow a bit bigger,

1441
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,780
 they then turn into female themselves

1442
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,940
 and the reason they do that is partially

1443
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,300
 because they can store more eggs inside of them

1444
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,180
 to give birth more.

1445
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,100
 So it's the equivalent of if you picture like NFL,

1446
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,700
 it's like being a quarterback, throwing the ball

1447
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,960
 and then running up and catching it yourself

1448
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,680
 because they're impregnating and then they're becoming

1449
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,720
 the ones that are being impregnated.

1450
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,760
 It's an extraordinary thing.

1451
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,980
 - Although what I find quite sad is that scientists think

1452
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,520
 that they can't transform into the female

1453
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,400
 until they've done their first kind of copulation,

1454
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,900
 which for enough is just releasing sperm,

1455
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,880
 but it does make you think like, what if you couldn't do it?

1456
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,960
 You know, and you're like a 59 year old Baramundi

1457
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,640
 who's still male and all the other ones age three have changed.

1458
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,600
 I just think that's embarrassing and sad.

1459
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,220
 (audience laughing)

1460
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,500
 Have you not seen that film, "The 40 Year Old Baramundi?"

1461
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,340
 It's good.

1462
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,680
 (audience laughing)

1463
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,220
 And it's actually a lot more interesting

1464
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,160
 than you think it is.

1465
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,980
 - Just on Australian fishes,

1466
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,980
 there's one called Plecto rinches carolinthus,

1467
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,460
 but it's better known as the blue bastard.

1468
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,400
 - Oh yeah.

1469
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,840
 - Can you guess how it gets its name, the blue bastard?

1470
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,600
 - From the poetic minds of the Australian people.

1471
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,840
 (audience laughing)

1472
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,080
 - It must be blue.

1473
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,920
 - Is it blue?

1474
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,360
 - It's blue, that's half of it.

1475
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,800
 - Is it a bastard to catch?

1476
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,980
 - It does the other half.

1477
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,980
 (audience laughing)

1478
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:37,280
 - This fact was about nominative determinism, right?

1479
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,080
 So Baramundi is doing a thing that his name is associated to.

1480
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,040
 And I found a few New Zealand examples of that.

1481
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,040
 So there is a composer who wrote a Romeo and Juliet opera

1482
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,460
 who is called Peter van de Vlut, which is very sweet.

1483
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,520
 It's just a very sweet name.

1484
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,560
 There's an activist who's quite a famous actress

1485
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,240
 who's been being, she's getting arrested

1486
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,080
 for all her climate change protests.

1487
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,320
 And that's Lucy Lawless.

1488
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,880
 Xena Warrior-Princess.

1489
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,720
 - Very good.

1490
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,760
 - Lawless, she's constantly getting taken

1491
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,480
 to police stations for what she's doing.

1492
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,000
 But I was, so I was sitting in a room today in New Zealand

1493
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,880
 and a guy randomly overheard me talking about this

1494
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,920
 called Wade and he came over and he said,

1495
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,360
 "My grandfather is an example of nominative determinism.

1496
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,400
 "Can I tell you it?"

1497
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,160
 So his grandfather was the first person in New Zealand

1498
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,000
 to artificially inseminate a bee.

1499
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 (audience laughing)

1500
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 - They've been trying for years and years and years,

1501
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,160
 haven't they?

1502
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,080
 We just can't find anyone with a small enough penis.

1503
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,240
 (audience laughing)

1504
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,120
 We will keep looking.

1505
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,200
 Is this, is this guessable or is it?

1506
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,360
 - Oh, he's called Richard Beebe.

1507
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,240
 Like that's his name.

1508
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,000
 And he did it on a kitchen table in Balcluthur.

1509
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,400
 - Dick, wait, that's very, that's a bit racy, isn't it?

1510
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,440
 Many would have started in bed.

1511
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,960
 - Sounds like the women takes you.

1512
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,280
 - It's called Dick Beebe.

1513
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,360
 (audience laughing)

1514
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,040
 - Come on, mate.

1515
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,840
 - Oh my goodness.

1516
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,680
 So yeah.

1517
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,320
 - The only, I mean, the only thing I have,

1518
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,720
 'cause what I like about this original fact

1519
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,880
 is that it's a double nominative determinism.

1520
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,160
 It's a Barry Monday, twice as unlikely.

1521
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
 And I think my favorite example of that

1522
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,280
 is probably the world's leading expert in Pete Boggs,

1523
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,040
 was called Pete Glob.

1524
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,160
 (audience laughing)

1525
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,880
 - We've got a couple in the fish inbox,

1526
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,320
 if you don't mind me sharing that, Fred.

1527
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,440
 - Yeah, Fred.

1528
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,760
 - This was sent in by Pruma Kutcher

1529
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,600
 and she had a dentist called Jintar Gumbyte.

1530
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,440
 - Brilliant.

1531
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,280
 - Pretty good.

1532
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,360
 And Peter Drake sent in the fact that John Ramsbottom

1533
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,280
 invented a new kind of high-speed piston.

1534
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,440
 (audience laughing)

1535
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,280
 - It's brilliant.

1536
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,280
 (audience laughing)

1537
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,020
 (upbeat music)

1538
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,600
 - Okay, we need to get out of here.

1539
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,160
 That is it, that is all of our facts.

1540
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,120
 Thank you so much for listening, Auckland.

1541
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,960
 You were awesome, that was amazing.

1542
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,880
 We will be back.

1543
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,800
 We'll see you then.

1544
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,640
 Goodbye!

1545
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,640
 (audience cheering)

1546
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,140
 (upbeat music)

1547
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,720
 (upbeat music)
