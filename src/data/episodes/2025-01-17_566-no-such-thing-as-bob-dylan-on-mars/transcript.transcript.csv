00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:06,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:06,00:00:13,(audience cheering)
00:00:13,00:00:18,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:18,00:00:22,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,this week coming to you live from Auckland.
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:31,(audience cheering)
00:00:31,00:00:34,My name is Dan Schriver.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:41,00:00:44,"with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:44,00:00:47,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:47,00:00:51,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:51,00:00:54,- My fact is that the German order of temperance
00:00:54,00:00:58,"was founded in 1600, and members had to pledge"
00:00:58,00:01:02,to drink no more than 14 glasses of wine a day.
00:01:02,00:01:05,(audience laughing)
00:01:05,00:01:07,"- Do you think you find that tough, Anna?"
00:01:07,00:01:10,"- I think, so long as that only means like before 6 p.m.,"
00:01:10,00:01:11,"that's vaguely generous, isn't it?"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"- Yeah, look, there are a couple of extra rules,"
00:01:14,00:01:15,"but I think you could handle it, Anna."
00:01:15,00:01:16,I think it would be fine.
00:01:16,00:01:19,"So it's, this comes from a 1925 book called"
00:01:19,00:01:22,The Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol Problem.
00:01:23,00:01:26,Just a little light bedside reading for me.
00:01:26,00:01:27,(laughing)
00:01:27,00:01:30,"I found in that there was a reference to an 1872 paper,"
00:01:30,00:01:32,so all of this is quite a way distant.
00:01:32,00:01:35,"The records of the society itself, obviously 400 years ago,"
00:01:35,00:01:37,"not very easy to find, but basically,"
00:01:37,00:01:40,"there was terrible drunkenness in the 16th century,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"all over the place, and the rules of the temperance"
00:01:42,00:01:45,"society were, look, firstly, never get drunk."
00:01:45,00:01:45,That's rule one.
00:01:45,00:01:46,- Yeah.
00:01:46,00:01:49,"- Rule two, you can only have seven glasses"
00:01:49,00:01:50,of wine at a meal.
00:01:50,00:01:52,(audience laughing)
00:01:52,00:01:54,"- Rule three, you can only have two meals a day."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"- Okay, so they didn't mind you drinking a little bit."
00:01:56,00:01:57,"I think that's the idea, isn't it?"
00:01:57,00:02:00,'Cause temperance is like to temper your drinking.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"So they weren't banning drinking,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,they were just trying to make you drink less.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- And even if you had your 14 glasses,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,"even if you then wanted a bit of wine to help you sleep,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,you weren't allowed it.
00:02:10,00:02:11,It was very strict.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- Even if you have another meal.
00:02:12,00:02:14,- Even if you have another meal.
00:02:14,00:02:15,"- Oh, God."
00:02:15,00:02:16,"- When they started doing things like,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"""Okay, why don't we cut out certain bits of alcohol?"""
00:02:18,00:02:21,"So they set up a brewery for people who didn't wanna drink,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,"hasn't, didn't wanna drink spirits, but only beer."
00:02:23,00:02:25,So they would go there instead.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"And then very slowly it would sort of morph into,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"""Let's just maybe not drink at all."
00:02:29,00:02:31,"Maybe we'll just stop it now."""
00:02:31,00:02:32,"- And it was also, wasn't it?"
00:02:32,00:02:36,The evil that was alcohol wasn't really wine and beer.
00:02:36,00:02:38,"For a long time, it was spirits."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"And actually a lot of beer especially,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,but wine a little bit was promoted as temperance drinking.
00:02:42,00:02:44,I think Guinness was promoted quite a lot
00:02:44,00:02:46,of temperance drink in the 1700s.
00:02:46,00:02:48,'Cause spirits distilled liquor
00:02:48,00:02:49,was thought to be the evil thing.
00:02:49,00:02:52,"And actually temperance, I didn't realize."
00:02:52,00:02:54,It may be slightly more sympathetic towards it.
00:02:54,00:02:56,Had a bit of a socialist undertone
00:02:56,00:02:59,because all the distilled liquor was all sold
00:02:59,00:03:01,by landowners who were exploiting their peasants
00:03:01,00:03:03,working on their land because they were the only people
00:03:03,00:03:04,who could grow all that liquor.
00:03:04,00:03:08,And so by being a teetotaler
00:03:08,00:03:10,"and the only drinking 14 glasses of wine a day,"
00:03:10,00:03:13,you were sticking it to the landlords.
00:03:13,00:03:15,- We're glasses a lot.
00:03:15,00:03:17,You know how people were smaller back.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"Yeah, we're glasses smaller back."
00:03:18,00:03:20,- People were not as much smaller as the glasses were.
00:03:20,00:03:21,This was not a--
00:03:21,00:03:22,- It wasn't relative.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"- I know we're the land of the hobbits here, but--"
00:03:24,00:03:27,(laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:28,- But so they were smaller glasses.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- Glasses were way smaller.
00:03:29,00:03:31,This would have been an insane glut.
00:03:31,00:03:33,The glass I'm pointing at now would have been
00:03:33,00:03:36,a demented volume in the 16th century.
00:03:36,00:03:37,People would have freaked out.
00:03:37,00:03:39,They would have said that that's a bucket.
00:03:39,00:03:40,- Okay.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- They weren't genuinely--
00:03:41,00:03:43,"- Would that be all 14 of your glasses, do you think?"
00:03:43,00:03:44,- This would probably be a few of them.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"And for anyone listening at home,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,this is not a lot of wine at my glass.
00:03:48,00:03:50,I think it's easy to say picture a wine glass
00:03:50,00:03:51,with some wine in it.
00:03:51,00:03:52,That's what Andy's got.
00:03:52,00:03:54,(laughing)
00:03:54,00:03:55,- Yeah.
00:03:55,00:03:56,- Okay.
00:03:56,00:03:58,It's not a lot.
00:03:58,00:03:59,I'm fine.
00:03:59,00:04:01,"And I can stop any time I like, okay?"
00:04:01,00:04:03,(laughing)
00:04:03,00:04:05,- The rules that I think you sent round a source
00:04:05,00:04:08,with all the rules of this original temperate society.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"There are some other really good ones,"
00:04:09,00:04:13,but one of them was that the society wanted to ban
00:04:13,00:04:15,the practice of drinking to people's health.
00:04:15,00:04:16,Cheers.
00:04:16,00:04:18,"Here's to you, sir."
00:04:18,00:04:18,Et cetera.
00:04:18,00:04:19,"Because that promoted drinking in it,"
00:04:19,00:04:21,it got to a stage where you'd promote everyone's health
00:04:21,00:04:22,around the table.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"And by the time you'd started talking,"
00:04:24,00:04:25,then everyone's had 15 pints.
00:04:25,00:04:27,So I was wondering about toasting.
00:04:27,00:04:29,And do you know why it's called toasting?
00:04:29,00:04:30,- Ooh.
00:04:30,00:04:32,"- Well, it was always about putting toast"
00:04:32,00:04:33,in the beer or something.
00:04:33,00:04:34,- There was.
00:04:34,00:04:35,I think we probably haven't mentioned before
00:04:35,00:04:39,that people used to put soaked toast in their beer.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"But I liked, and this is just a theory about"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"why it was called toasting from 1837,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,a thing I stumbled on.
00:04:44,00:04:45,This was in Tatler.
00:04:45,00:04:49,"He said toasting, as a word, comes from the 1660s"
00:04:49,00:04:52,when a beautiful lady was bathing in one of the baths
00:04:52,00:04:55,"at Baths, Baths Bar, town in the UK."
00:04:55,00:04:59,And the men around were all admiring her as she bathed.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"So far, so good."
00:05:00,00:05:03,"One of them dipped his cup into the water,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,'cause it's like health-giving waters at Baths Bar.
00:05:05,00:05:07,"So one of them dips his cup into the water,"
00:05:07,00:05:10,"holds it up and says, cheers, here's to the health of the lady."
00:05:10,00:05:13,And another person who's described in the source
00:05:13,00:05:16,"as a gay fellow half-fuddled,"
00:05:16,00:05:19,"which I think he's absolutely hammered,"
00:05:19,00:05:22,swore he was going to jump in the water
00:05:22,00:05:24,"because though he did not like the liquor,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,he would have the toast.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"Well, I believe in this instance was the lady."
00:05:29,00:05:32,"So the toast, when you're doing a toast,"
00:05:32,00:05:36,is the naked woman bathing in the pool of wine before you.
00:05:36,00:05:39,- Is that a slang term for a hot lady?
00:05:39,00:05:42,"- No, it was because, as James said,"
00:05:42,00:05:44,they used to drink their beer with a bit of toast in it.
00:05:44,00:05:45,- So we did come from that.
00:05:45,00:05:47,This is just a sort of fun riff on the...
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- No, no, but this says that's why we call it a toast,"
00:05:49,00:05:52,"because someone drank to the health using the water,"
00:05:52,00:05:57,"and then someone made the toast gag, very funny, at the time."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"- 'Cause I was thinking,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,is it related to the term crumpet for someone who's attractive?
00:06:01,00:06:03,"But is that... - Oh, yes."
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- That's not that, is it?"
00:06:04,00:06:06,- I'm sure you could make a case.
00:06:06,00:06:08,- The Temperance Movement in Glasgow.
00:06:08,00:06:11,"That was an interesting one, 'cause it banned barmaids."
00:06:11,00:06:13,"It said, ""We've worked out what the problem is."
00:06:13,00:06:15,"""These men are getting incredibly drunk."
00:06:15,00:06:17,"""It must be the fault of the barmaids."""
00:06:17,00:06:19,- So are these crumpets that we're toasting?
00:06:19,00:06:21,Get them out of here.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- Basically, the idea was men would dally in the bar,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,'cause they wanted to talk to the barmaids.
00:06:25,00:06:25,"- Yeah, makes sense."
00:06:25,00:06:29,"- Yeah, I mean, and if you let a woman into a pub also,"
00:06:29,00:06:33,"they're at risk of being exposed to language and to jests,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,and we cannot have that sort of thing in our society.
00:06:35,00:06:39,"We need, you know, the men to be just getting actually"
00:06:39,00:06:40,passionate in peace.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"- The Temperance Lobby, who were trying to convince people"
00:06:43,00:06:46,"not to drink, started with health about sort of"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"what it would do to you,"
00:06:47,00:06:49,and then they just started lying about things.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"So they would say, ""Well, you're drinking that."""
00:06:50,00:06:52,You know what they put in it?
00:06:52,00:06:53,Crunched up cockroaches.
00:06:53,00:06:54,They put feces.
00:06:54,00:06:55,They make it with feces.
00:06:55,00:06:57,They started just spreading all these rumors
00:06:57,00:06:58,about what alcohol was mixed with
00:06:58,00:07:00,"in order to get people to go,"
00:07:00,00:07:01,"""I guess I don't want to drink."""
00:07:01,00:07:02,- Really? - Yeah.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"- You know what, that wouldn't work on me."
00:07:03,00:07:04,- Wouldn't it?
00:07:04,00:07:05,(laughing)
00:07:05,00:07:08,"- See, this is why it didn't take over."
00:07:08,00:07:11,Have you guys heard of the Wausers?
00:07:11,00:07:12,- Hmm. - Wauser?
00:07:12,00:07:13,- Wauser.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"This was a New Zealand thing and Australia, actually."
00:07:16,00:07:21,And a wauser was a person who had a real sense of morality
00:07:21,00:07:25,and wanted other people not to do sinful things.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"It actually, the name originally was a loud"
00:07:28,00:07:30,"or an annoying person,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,and then it kind of changed to that meaning.
00:07:32,00:07:34,But the Wausers were usually the women's
00:07:34,00:07:37,"Christian Temperance Union in New Zealand,"
00:07:37,00:07:40,"and not just were they campaigning for less alcohol,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,but they were really the main people
00:07:42,00:07:44,behind women's suffrage in New Zealand.
00:07:44,00:07:45,- Oh.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"- 'Cause I don't know if the guys in the audience know,"
00:07:46,00:07:47,but it was one of the first places
00:07:47,00:07:49,where women got the vote.
00:07:49,00:07:50,- It's that sorry.
00:07:50,00:07:53,(audience cheering)
00:07:53,00:07:55,"- There's a lot of women showing there,"
00:07:55,00:07:56,but not many men.
00:07:56,00:07:59,(laughing)
00:07:59,00:08:03,- And here's another thing about New Zealand.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"In 1917, there was, as part of the Temperance Movement,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,they came up with a new law which said
00:08:09,00:08:13,"that all bars and pubs had to close at six o'clock,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,so six p.m.
00:08:14,00:08:18,And the thing is that everyone finished work at five p.m.
00:08:18,00:08:21,And so what ended up happening is everyone who was working
00:08:21,00:08:23,just legged it to the pub at five p.m.
00:08:23,00:08:26,and drank as much as they could for an hour.
00:08:26,00:08:29,And it was called the six o'clock swill.
00:08:29,00:08:30,And basically you would--
00:08:30,00:08:32,- Did that lead to any problems at all?
00:08:32,00:08:34,Or was it absolutely fine?
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- I'll be honest, it didn't go that well."
00:08:37,00:08:40,Some bars changed their wallpaper for tiling
00:08:40,00:08:41,so it could be easily cleaned.
00:08:41,00:08:42,- Oh my God.
00:08:42,00:08:43,(laughing)
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- A lot of people would drink,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,load to drinks and then keep all the glasses
00:08:47,00:08:49,"and then at like five to six,"
00:08:49,00:08:50,"they would go, ""Fill these up."""
00:08:50,00:08:52,And then they would all get filled up
00:08:52,00:08:54,and then they would neck as many as they could.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- Oh my God.
00:08:55,00:08:56,- But one interesting innovation
00:08:56,00:08:58,"that might have come from this is,"
00:08:58,00:09:03,"you know if you ask for Coca-Cola in a bar,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"and they say, ""We've got Pepsi, is that all right?"""
00:09:05,00:09:06,"And you say, ""Yeah, fine."""
00:09:06,00:09:08,They sometimes give it you out of like a long tube
00:09:08,00:09:10,with a gun on the end.
00:09:10,00:09:11,"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:09:11,00:09:12,- And that was invented for this
00:09:12,00:09:15,because it made it easier to get beer quickly
00:09:15,00:09:16,into people's glasses
00:09:16,00:09:19,without having to get them to come away from the table.
00:09:19,00:09:20,- Oh wow. - Really?
00:09:20,00:09:21,- How long?
00:09:21,00:09:23,(laughing)
00:09:23,00:09:24,"- Was it really, really, really long?"
00:09:24,00:09:26,"- It was really long, yeah."
00:09:26,00:09:28,- There were these amazing maps as well.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Have you heard of these?
00:09:29,00:09:31,The wet and dry maps of the USA.
00:09:31,00:09:32,- No.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- This is very cool.
00:09:33,00:09:34,America obviously had a very complex relationship
00:09:34,00:09:35,with alcohol.
00:09:35,00:09:36,"They're anti-saloon league,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,and this was all pre-prohibition.
00:09:38,00:09:39,This is when they were still trying to do it
00:09:39,00:09:42,just through social pressure rather than through banning it.
00:09:42,00:09:44,"But there were temperance advocates,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,and this happened in the UK as well actually.
00:09:46,00:09:48,Temperance advocates would map out pubs.
00:09:48,00:09:49,They would produce maps of pubs
00:09:49,00:09:51,so that people could avoid them.
00:09:51,00:09:53,(laughing)
00:09:53,00:09:54,Which did not backfire at all.
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- Yeah, I'm gonna need one of those maps"
00:09:56,00:09:59,just to make sure that I don't go near any of these pubs.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"- It was, that's basically it."
00:10:01,00:10:02,That's basically it.
00:10:02,00:10:02,"I'm being a bit flippant,"
00:10:02,00:10:04,"but the anti-alcohol movement,"
00:10:04,00:10:05,"they printed these maps saying,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,"""Look at how many pubs there are in this town."
00:10:07,00:10:08,"""We can't need any more."""
00:10:08,00:10:10,"And that was like, ""Don't grant a licence,"""
00:10:10,00:10:13,"because look, this place is absolutely loaded with..."
00:10:13,00:10:15,"- It wasn't for normal people, like a trigger warning."
00:10:15,00:10:17,"So, you know, if you really don't like pubs,"
00:10:17,00:10:18,"if you're offended by them, don't go here."
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- No, but it wasn't quite that."
00:10:20,00:10:22,"It was a thing called persuasive cartography,"
00:10:22,00:10:23,which is quite cool.
00:10:23,00:10:25,You produce a map showing something that you desire
00:10:25,00:10:27,or something that you don't want.
00:10:27,00:10:28,Yeah.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"- I read about, we were recently in Melbourne,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,and I read about a group of friends
00:10:32,00:10:34,who almost had the equivalent of a map.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"It was the yellow pages of Melbourne,"
00:10:36,00:10:39,"and it had every single pub listed in it, as you would."
00:10:39,00:10:41,"And this was back in the early '90s,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,and they decided that they were gonna try
00:10:43,00:10:45,and visit every single pub
00:10:45,00:10:47,on the ultimate pub crawl that they could go on.
00:10:47,00:10:50,And they managed it.
00:10:50,00:10:55,"32 years later, they had completed all 400 plus pubs."
00:10:55,00:10:56,"Some of them had shut,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,so they had to just stand outside
00:10:58,00:11:00,and have a ceremonial beer outside of there.
00:11:00,00:11:02,"Three of the five pulled out,"
00:11:02,00:11:05,and it was only two that made it to the end.
00:11:05,00:11:06,And yeah.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"- When we say pulled out,"
00:11:07,00:11:07,do we mean died of alcohol poisoning?
00:11:07,00:11:09,"Or are we just saying, okay, got it, got it, got it, got it."
00:11:09,00:11:10,"- Yes, pulled out of breathing."
00:11:10,00:11:12,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"- Well, they still have those maps of the US now, don't they?"
00:11:16,00:11:19,"'Cause there are dry counties in America, and wet counties."
00:11:19,00:11:21,But I didn't realize there were also lots of moist counties.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"And this is, people should term,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,and it's nothing disgusting.
00:11:25,00:11:27,"Well, it depends on your opinions."
00:11:27,00:11:28,"But like in Kentucky,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,"there are 120 counties in Kentucky,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"11 are dry, 53 are wet, and 56 are moist."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"Which is just like some rules,"
00:11:36,00:11:37,"can't drink vodka on a Wednesday,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,"you know, don't drink beer all night long."
00:11:39,00:11:40,"That kind of just, you know,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,there's some rules around alcohol.
00:11:42,00:11:45,"But not many, but it actually backfired this"
00:11:45,00:11:46,"when there were lots of little counties,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"because they did a study in 2003,"
00:11:49,00:11:50,looking at drink driving.
00:11:50,00:11:52,But they found that a higher proportion
00:11:52,00:11:54,of dry counties residents
00:11:54,00:11:56,were involved in alcohol-related crashes.
00:11:56,00:11:59,And they realized is because they're having to drive
00:11:59,00:12:00,across the bloody border to pick up alcohol
00:12:00,00:12:02,from the wet county.
00:12:02,00:12:04,(laughing)
00:12:04,00:12:04,- That's amazing.
00:12:04,00:12:06,- That's incredible.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"- There was a Greek playwright called Ubalas,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"and he wrote, ""The three glasses of wine"
00:12:10,00:12:14,"""is a perfect amount for you to have before you go to bed."
00:12:14,00:12:18,"""If you have a fourth that will induce arrogance,"
00:12:18,00:12:21,"""a fifth causes shouting,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"""a sixth causes quarrelling,"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"""a seventh leads to punch-ups."
00:12:26,00:12:28,"""In the eighth, furniture was smashed"
00:12:28,00:12:30,"""and the police were called."
00:12:30,00:12:33,"""By the ninth, deranged madness set in,"
00:12:33,00:12:35,"""and by the tenth, you pass out."""
00:12:35,00:12:36,(laughing)
00:12:36,00:12:37,- And that is very much a description
00:12:37,00:12:40,of how this podcast's gonna go throughout the evening.
00:12:40,00:12:41,(laughing)
00:12:41,00:12:44,(upbeat music)
00:12:44,00:12:47,"- It is time for fact number two,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,and that is my fact.
00:12:48,00:12:51,My fact this week is that Bob Dylan
00:12:51,00:12:54,found Jimi Hendrix's cover of one of his songs
00:12:54,00:12:57,to be so much better than the original
00:12:57,00:12:59,"that whenever he plays the song live now,"
00:12:59,00:13:02,he plays a cover of the cover.
00:13:02,00:13:05,That's such a rare thing for a musician.
00:13:05,00:13:08,He plays the restructured--
00:13:08,00:13:08,- How do we know?
00:13:08,00:13:09,Does it sound different?
00:13:09,00:13:10,- He's restructured it.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"So yeah, he's moved lyrics around and so on."
00:13:12,00:13:13,- What's the song?
00:13:13,00:13:14,- It's All Along the Watchtower.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"So this was a song,"
00:13:16,00:13:17,"I'd say, ""Oh, thank you, yeah."""
00:13:17,00:13:19,"- You didn't write it, that's not yours to thank."
00:13:19,00:13:21,- I felt like I did in that moment.
00:13:21,00:13:22,You are welcome.
00:13:23,00:13:27,So this appeared on an album called John Wesley Harding.
00:13:27,00:13:30,It was 1967 and it's a great song.
00:13:30,00:13:31,Hendrix heard it.
00:13:31,00:13:34,Hendrix actually did a few covers of Dylan's songs.
00:13:34,00:13:37,He really loved how Dylan was expressing himself.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"He said, ""Sometimes I play Dylan's songs"
00:13:39,00:13:40,"""and they're so much like me"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"""that it seems that I wrote them."""
00:13:42,00:13:43,And that's what Dylan felt
00:13:43,00:13:46,when he heard Hendrix playing his song.
00:13:46,00:13:48,"He was like, ""I feel like that's his song now."
00:13:48,00:13:50,"""When I play it, it's tribute to him."""
00:13:50,00:13:52,"And so yeah, so I mean,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,"Dylan concerts, I don't know if anyone's been"
00:13:54,00:13:55,to any recent ones.
00:13:55,00:13:57,They have got a bit weird.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- I find them really fun.
00:13:58,00:14:00,I've seen him quite a few times live
00:14:00,00:14:02,"and it's always, 'cause he messes around with his song so much."
00:14:02,00:14:03,It's always a case of working out
00:14:03,00:14:05,what an earth song he is playing
00:14:05,00:14:06,that you know incredibly well
00:14:06,00:14:09,that he is hidden under 900 layers of nonsense.
00:14:09,00:14:11,- There's a joke which is that it's so different
00:14:11,00:14:13,"that while he's on stage playing Blowing in the Wind,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,"someone will jump in and go,"
00:14:15,00:14:16,"""Play Blowing in the Wind!"""
00:14:16,00:14:18,"And you'll go, ""I am."""
00:14:18,00:14:20,"- He's a very interesting guy, isn't he?"
00:14:20,00:14:24,"For someone who's very, very iconic and still alive,"
00:14:24,00:14:27,"albeit old, he is old, but he is alive."
00:14:27,00:14:29,So that's the-- - He's sort of very active.
00:14:29,00:14:32,- At a time of recording. - At a time of recording.
00:14:32,00:14:34,But he's incredibly unreliable.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- Okay.
00:14:35,00:14:36,- I don't know if that's the wrong term.
00:14:36,00:14:38,Unreliable suggests he's a bit disorganized.
00:14:38,00:14:41,He's a hard person to grab hold of.
00:14:41,00:14:42,- He lies.
00:14:42,00:14:42,"- He lies, he lies."
00:14:42,00:14:44,- He lies like a rug.
00:14:44,00:14:45,It's amazing.
00:14:45,00:14:48,He's done so many different versions of events
00:14:48,00:14:49,of his own life.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"Like all of them, well, a lot of them are provably wrong."
00:14:52,00:14:55,"So was he sent to reform school, as he claimed?"
00:14:55,00:14:56,Was he foster parented?
00:14:56,00:14:58,Did he run away from home age 12?
00:14:58,00:14:59,No.
00:14:59,00:15:01,He was brought up by a completely normal
00:15:01,00:15:02,middle-class family.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"When he played Carnegie Hall for the first time,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,he told a reporter he had lost contact with his parents
00:15:06,00:15:07,and he didn't know them anymore.
00:15:07,00:15:10,They were in the audience at the time.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"- Well, he was incredibly private, so."
00:15:12,00:15:15,"- I know he was, but I'm still saying he fibs, fibs, fibs."
00:15:15,00:15:18,Was he really a chess hustler in Greenwich Village
00:15:18,00:15:19,in the 1950s?
00:15:19,00:15:20,- Right.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"- Well, I'm not worried by all of the research,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,'cause I don't know anything about what they're like.
00:15:24,00:15:27,"And I've been researching him going, ""This is amazing."""
00:15:27,00:15:29,- I didn't even know he tried to get to Mars.
00:15:29,00:15:30,That's incredible.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"- Oh, the Wimbledon finals, really, '75."
00:15:33,00:15:35,I couldn't believe the naivety of a journalist
00:15:35,00:15:37,who interviewed him after he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
00:15:37,00:15:40,Do you remember he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016?
00:15:40,00:15:43,And he didn't say anything about it
00:15:43,00:15:44,when it was announced he'd won it.
00:15:44,00:15:46,There was a tiny announcement that came onto his website
00:15:46,00:15:48,and then vanished very quickly.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"And so everyone was like, ""Oh, we can't get hold"
00:15:50,00:15:51,"of the Nobel Committee, can't get hold of him,"
00:15:51,00:15:52,not picking up his phone.
00:15:52,00:15:53,"Where is he?"""
00:15:53,00:15:54,"And eventually, weeks and weeks later,"
00:15:54,00:15:57,a journalist finally managed to get an interview with him
00:15:57,00:15:58,"and he wrote, ""Poor guy."""
00:15:58,00:16:01,"He wrote, ""I can now put people out of their misery,"""
00:16:01,00:16:02,"'cause everyone was saying,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"""Is he going to turn up to the ceremony?"
00:16:04,00:16:05,"Is he gonna come?"""
00:16:05,00:16:07,"The journalist went, ""I can put people out of their misery."
00:16:07,00:16:08,"Yes, of course, he's planning to turn up"
00:16:08,00:16:09,"to the award ceremony."""
00:16:09,00:16:11,"I asked him about that and he said,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"""Absolutely, if it's a tool possible."""
00:16:13,00:16:16,"Now, obviously, he didn't turn up to the award ceremony."
00:16:16,00:16:17,(laughing)
00:16:17,00:16:19,Because of pre-existing commitments.
00:16:19,00:16:21,Who has pre-existing commitments more important
00:16:21,00:16:22,than accepting a Nobel Prize?
00:16:22,00:16:25,Did he win it for his lyrics and his songs?
00:16:25,00:16:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:26,00:16:27,"So like this one,"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"""Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling coop."
00:16:32,00:16:35,"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead."
00:16:35,00:16:37,"Wiggle, you can raise the dead."""
00:16:37,00:16:38,That was one of his.
00:16:38,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:40,It's genius.
00:16:40,00:16:40,(laughing)
00:16:40,00:16:43,"It's how he tells it, weirdly."
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah."
00:16:45,00:16:46,Okay.
00:16:46,00:16:47,(laughing)
00:16:47,00:16:48,That's what the Pulitzer saw.
00:16:48,00:16:49,I see it now.
00:16:49,00:16:50,"Yeah, go, go, go, good."
00:16:50,00:16:52,"He's just taken the piss his whole life, isn't he?"
00:16:52,00:16:55,"Like, he, someone, and I appreciate so much"
00:16:55,00:16:56,"the research genius who found this out,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"that the lyrics from ""Dean Tweedledum,"""
00:16:58,00:17:00,"which is a very good song,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,are poached from various places.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"So it's unlike ""Pruce"" and ""Hemingway,"""
00:17:04,00:17:07,"fine, a time magazine article from 1961."
00:17:07,00:17:09,Bit weird to take your lyrics from there.
00:17:09,00:17:11,And also a lot of them were taken
00:17:11,00:17:15,from a travel guide to New Orleans
00:17:15,00:17:17,by a woman called Bethany Boltman.
00:17:17,00:17:18,So.
00:17:18,00:17:19,Is that allowed?
00:17:19,00:17:20,Isn't it copyrighted or something?
00:17:20,00:17:21,Do you know what?
00:17:21,00:17:23,I don't think anyone would have the balls to sue.
00:17:23,00:17:24,(laughing)
00:17:24,00:17:25,"But there were, there were things,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"you know, so if you hear lines in that song,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,"like ""Dripping in Garlic and Olive Oil,"""
00:17:29,00:17:32,"or ""Parade Permit and Police Escort,"""
00:17:32,00:17:34,"just think, just from a guidebook."
00:17:34,00:17:36,"Three stars, yeah."
00:17:36,00:17:37,Yeah.
00:17:37,00:17:38,Wow.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"""Nicolas Cage's Grave."""
00:17:40,00:17:40,(laughing)
00:17:40,00:17:42,That's all I know about New Orleans.
00:17:42,00:17:43,Very good.
00:17:43,00:17:44,"""Nicolas Cage."""
00:17:44,00:17:45,"""Bought a Grave"" in New Orleans"
00:17:45,00:17:47,is like this amazing pyramid.
00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:49,But he's not dead.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"Unlike, no, like Bob Dylan."
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:52,That's so similar.
00:17:52,00:17:53,(laughing)
00:17:53,00:17:55,"Again, as time of recording."
00:17:55,00:17:56,"Oh God, I really hope we don't curse anything"
00:17:56,00:17:59,'cause he is an incredibly valuable guy to the world.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"I don't know, do you think we have that power?"
00:18:01,00:18:02,I don't know.
00:18:02,00:18:03,We might.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"That's not worth a try, is it?"
00:18:04,00:18:05,"Another song, ""Mr. Tambourine Man."""
00:18:05,00:18:06,Yeah.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Very, very beautiful, mysterious song."
00:18:08,00:18:09,What does the lyrics mean?
00:18:09,00:18:11,Can I just say James is actually shaking his head at that.
00:18:11,00:18:14,This is how important James is about Bob Dylan music.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"It's one of his really, really famous early songs"
00:18:16,00:18:18,and it's very beautiful.
00:18:18,00:18:21,The lyrics are very sort of rhythmic and poetic.
00:18:21,00:18:23,It turns out it was just inspired by a musician he knew
00:18:23,00:18:26,who owned an enormous tambourine.
00:18:26,00:18:26,You know what?
00:18:26,00:18:27,"I would have guessed that, actually."
00:18:27,00:18:28,Really?
00:18:28,00:18:33,"If it was from a greengrocer who had an enormous marrow,"
00:18:33,00:18:34,I would have been really surprised.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"That's ""Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man."""
00:18:35,00:18:37,"You think he's a greengrocer, right?"
00:18:37,00:18:38,He's good.
00:18:38,00:18:39,(laughing)
00:18:39,00:18:40,But he was called Bruce Langhorn
00:18:40,00:18:42,and he just had a big old tambourine.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"He went on to start ""Brother Bru Bru's African Hot Sauce."""
00:18:45,00:18:46,"So, you know."
00:18:46,00:18:46,(laughing)
00:18:46,00:18:47,"Wow, amazing."
00:18:47,00:18:48,What a career.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"He never had a number one hit in the UK, Bob Dylan."
00:18:51,00:18:52,Okay.
00:18:52,00:18:54,And his highest ever charter was one
00:18:54,00:18:56,"that's called ""Like a Rolling Stone."""
00:18:56,00:18:58,(laughing)
00:18:58,00:18:59,It is.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"Yes, I think a couple of people in the audience"
00:19:01,00:19:02,might have heard that one.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"Okay, you might know it."
00:19:03,00:19:06,It got to number four in September 1965
00:19:06,00:19:08,and that was his highest ever charting.
00:19:08,00:19:10,"But when that was at number four,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"the number two and number one,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,"where I got you, babe, by Sonny and Cher,"
00:19:14,00:19:17,and I can't get no satisfaction by the Rolling Stones.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"That's a tough week, isn't it?"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"Yes, you can't block that."
00:19:20,00:19:23,He should have waited until 2019 to release
00:19:23,00:19:25,"""Like a Rolling Stone"""
00:19:25,00:19:27,"when it wouldn't have been up against the Sausage Roll,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,Christmas song was up there.
00:19:28,00:19:29,(laughing)
00:19:29,00:19:31,"But he's largely,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,his most popular songs are the ones that are covered.
00:19:33,00:19:36,"So, like Hendricks doing ""All Along the Watchtower"""
00:19:36,00:19:39,"or Adele doing ""Make You Feel My Love."""
00:19:39,00:19:41,Not many people know that that's a Bob Dylan song
00:19:41,00:19:44,"from a much later album, which was a big hit for her."
00:19:44,00:19:46,"Like for someone who's as famous as he is,"
00:19:46,00:19:47,he's not a fame chaser.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"In his early days, he had to do interviews."
00:19:49,00:19:50,You had to do them.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"By the way, if you haven't read his autobiography,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,it's incredibly good.
00:19:54,00:19:55,I highly recommend it.
00:19:55,00:19:56,"None of it's true, but it's very good."
00:19:56,00:19:58,"Yeah, brilliant bit of fiction."
00:19:58,00:20:02,"Yeah, but so when you read some stories about him,"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"I picture him as a sitting at home,"
00:20:05,00:20:06,"just like, ""Oh, don't see anyone."""
00:20:06,00:20:08,"Just he sits on his own, not wanting to do anything."
00:20:08,00:20:11,But he's got all these multitudes of interests
00:20:11,00:20:11,that I didn't know about.
00:20:11,00:20:13,One is he loves comedy.
00:20:13,00:20:16,He's really into Jerry Lewis slapstick-style comedy.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"And he approached a guy called Larry Charles,"
00:20:19,00:20:21,who wrote a lot of Seinfeld episodes
00:20:21,00:20:23,and was a big collaborator with Larry David
00:20:23,00:20:25,"on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."""
00:20:25,00:20:27,"And he said, ""I want to write a sitcom"
00:20:27,00:20:30,"where I'm in it as a slapstick comedian star."""
00:20:30,00:20:31,"And Larry was like, ""Really?"""
00:20:31,00:20:32,"And he said, ""Yeah."""
00:20:32,00:20:33,And he took out...
00:20:33,00:20:34,(audience laughing)
00:20:34,00:20:36,He took out a box that he has.
00:20:36,00:20:38,You've got a very good Dylan on you.
00:20:38,00:20:38,(audience laughing)
00:20:38,00:20:41,"""Yeah, man, I want to be funny."""
00:20:41,00:20:44,(audience laughing)
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- Honestly, as someone who has no idea who this person is,"
00:20:46,00:20:47,this is very funny.
00:20:47,00:20:48,(audience laughing)
00:20:48,00:20:49,- This person?
00:20:49,00:20:52,"- I mean, he's like, ""Hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr."
00:20:52,00:20:54,"What do you mean, man?"""
00:20:54,00:20:57,- Probably maybe the most mysterious incident in his life
00:20:57,00:20:59,"was his bike accident,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,because it changed the course of his career.
00:21:01,00:21:02,This is in 1966.
00:21:02,00:21:05,"He had an accident on his most bike,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"and it was quite bad,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,and he ended up having to have healthcare
00:21:10,00:21:11,for a period of time.
00:21:11,00:21:14,And it meant that he sort of became a recluse for a long time.
00:21:14,00:21:16,He didn't work for a bit.
00:21:16,00:21:17,No one heard from him.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"But the thing is, we don't know"
00:21:19,00:21:20,what actually happened in the accident.
00:21:20,00:21:22,We don't know how badly injured he was.
00:21:22,00:21:24,We don't actually know if it happened at all.
00:21:24,00:21:27,But it's the most debated thing ever.
00:21:27,00:21:29,Any Bob Dylan fan has opinions on it.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"So, and he always has a different thing"
00:21:31,00:21:32,about what caused the accident.
00:21:32,00:21:33,The sun got in his eyes.
00:21:33,00:21:35,His bike slipped onto some oil.
00:21:35,00:21:36,Sometimes he broke his back.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Sometimes he was concussed.
00:21:37,00:21:39,Sometimes he was fine.
00:21:39,00:21:43,"But all we know was he turned up at a doctor's house,"
00:21:43,00:21:44,which I didn't know he could do.
00:21:44,00:21:45,He knew a doctor.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"He turned up at their house,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,"and he stayed there for about a month,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,sleeping on their sofa or whatever.
00:21:50,00:21:51,And that was it.
00:21:51,00:21:53,And I think he has admitted since
00:21:53,00:21:56,that he basically was trying to get out of the whole fame thing.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Didn't like the competitive rat race.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"So, baked a bike accident."
00:21:59,00:22:00,- Wow.
00:22:00,00:22:02,- I think you can walk into most places
00:22:02,00:22:04,if you're the level of Bob Dylan.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"And if you know where the doctor lives,"
00:22:06,00:22:07,you just go to their house.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"They're not going to go, ""Sorry, Bob."""
00:22:08,00:22:09,"- Yeah, it was rural, wasn't it?"
00:22:09,00:22:10,It was neighborhood stuff.
00:22:10,00:22:10,- Yeah.
00:22:10,00:22:12,And do you think you should let them stay for a month?
00:22:12,00:22:14,How many months could they stay before
00:22:14,00:22:15,you kick them out even if they're Bob Dylan?
00:22:15,00:22:17,- How many months can you stay at a doctor's house?
00:22:17,00:22:18,There's actually a rejected line from
00:22:18,00:22:20,"""How many roads must a man walk down?"""
00:22:20,00:22:22,(audience laughing)
00:22:22,00:22:22,- Very close.
00:22:22,00:22:24,- Before he will chuck you out.
00:22:24,00:22:27,- James has no idea what that means.
00:22:27,00:22:29,(audience laughing)
00:22:29,00:22:31,- I assume it's one of his songs.
00:22:31,00:22:33,"- Can I do another thing that,"
00:22:33,00:22:34,another bit of James Bating here?
00:22:34,00:22:35,"- Yeah, of course."
00:22:35,00:22:36,"- Okay, I'll see if you like this, okay."
00:22:36,00:22:37,'Cause you will like a bit of it.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"There was for 20 years at least,"
00:22:39,00:22:42,there was a huge competition between some academics.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"In 1997, there were two researchers in Stockholm."
00:22:44,00:22:48,"They released a paper called ""Nitric Oxide and Inflammation."""
00:22:48,00:22:50,"The answer is ""Blowin' in the Wind,"""
00:22:50,00:22:51,which is clever.
00:22:51,00:22:52,"And then several years later,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,two other researchers coincidentally published a piece
00:22:54,00:22:57,"called ""Blood on the Tracks, A Simple Twist of Fate,"""
00:22:57,00:22:59,which I think might have been genealogical.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Anyway, they decided to compete to see"
00:23:01,00:23:03,how many Dylan lyrics they could get into their papers
00:23:03,00:23:04,before retirement.
00:23:04,00:23:07,And then a fifth one joined after he wrote something
00:23:07,00:23:09,"called ""Tangled Up in Blue, Molecular Cardiology"
00:23:09,00:23:10,"in the Post-Molecular Era."""
00:23:10,00:23:11,(audience laughing)
00:23:11,00:23:13,And this has just been going on for a very long time.
00:23:13,00:23:15,- Did you come across Karl Gornitsky
00:23:15,00:23:17,when you were reading about this?
00:23:17,00:23:17,- I don't think so.
00:23:17,00:23:19,- So Karl Gornitsky is a librarian
00:23:19,00:23:21,"who found out about this and he thought,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,"well, what I'm gonna do is see how often people"
00:23:23,00:23:27,use Bob Dylan lyrics in all of the papers.
00:23:27,00:23:30,And he found that there are at least 200 examples
00:23:30,00:23:34,of papers that unequivocably use Bob Dylan's words
00:23:34,00:23:35,in their titles.
00:23:35,00:23:37,And he found that they are cited slightly less often
00:23:37,00:23:39,than other similar articles.
00:23:39,00:23:40,(audience laughing)
00:23:40,00:23:41,"And he said in his papers,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,he thinks that there will be fewer Dylan references
00:23:43,00:23:45,"in the future because, and I quote,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"""Researchers concede they weren't quite as clever"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"as they were intending."""
00:23:49,00:23:51,(audience laughing)
00:23:51,00:23:52,- Maybe he didn't write them
00:23:52,00:23:55,in order to be included in the scientific papers.
00:23:55,00:23:56,"- Well, maybe they were trying to quote"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"an old tourist guide that actually,"
00:23:58,00:24:01,they've never heard of the songs.
00:24:01,00:24:04,- Do you know the oldest recording we have of Bob Dylan?
00:24:04,00:24:06,At least according to my research.
00:24:06,00:24:09,So this was one that was made in St. Paul in 1960.
00:24:09,00:24:12,And it resurfaced in 1978.
00:24:12,00:24:14,And a fan-zine writer called Brian Stiball
00:24:14,00:24:17,went to the person's house who found it
00:24:17,00:24:20,"and said, ""Oh, can I listen to this Bob Dylan tape?"""
00:24:20,00:24:23,"And the guy, the owner,"
00:24:23,00:24:25,insisted that his partner did the dishes
00:24:25,00:24:28,while they played it because he was so sure
00:24:28,00:24:30,that they were going to record the tape
00:24:30,00:24:31,when he played it for them.
00:24:31,00:24:33,So you'd have all that background noise.
00:24:33,00:24:35,"And sure enough, they did record it."
00:24:35,00:24:36,(laughing)
00:24:36,00:24:39,And the bootleg is known as the armpit tape
00:24:39,00:24:41,because it's such bad quality.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- Lovely. - It still exists.
00:24:42,00:24:44,- People get so weird about him.
00:24:44,00:24:46,There's an Institute of Dylanology
00:24:46,00:24:48,"in the University of Tulsa,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,"which is not officially called that,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,it's the Institute for Bob Dylan Studies.
00:24:51,00:24:53,But they bought his archive in 2016
00:24:53,00:24:56,"for about $15 million and it's 100,000 documents"
00:24:56,00:24:57,from his library. - Wow.
00:24:57,00:24:59,- It's really intense.
00:24:59,00:25:01,"I was in, people get so far into him."
00:25:01,00:25:02,- They do.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"But also, you know, he's not the easiest person"
00:25:04,00:25:07,"to recognize sometimes, which works in his favor,"
00:25:07,00:25:10,because he does all of these weird things in public.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"Like he went through a phase in 2008, 2009"
00:25:12,00:25:14,of wanting to turn up at the houses
00:25:14,00:25:16,where musicians had lived in their childhoods.
00:25:16,00:25:17,"- Oh, yes."
00:25:17,00:25:19,- He turned up in this random house in Winnipeg
00:25:19,00:25:21,where Neil Young had grown up
00:25:21,00:25:22,and it was now occupied by just a couple
00:25:22,00:25:24,"called Kean and Passie,"
00:25:24,00:25:25,who came home from their shopping trip
00:25:25,00:25:29,to find a guy on their doorstep who they didn't recognize.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"- Is that your holiday home today, is there any chance?"
00:25:32,00:25:36,- Didn't he get on a magical mystery tour bus in Liverpool
00:25:36,00:25:38,and go around all of the Beatles childhoods?
00:25:38,00:25:40,"- I think he might have, I think he might have."
00:25:40,00:25:41,- He's a big fan of musicians.
00:25:41,00:25:43,He loved the Beatles.
00:25:43,00:25:46,He said that Beatles transformed America at a time
00:25:46,00:25:48,when it desperately needed to come out of a depression
00:25:48,00:25:49,and have a hit of happiness.
00:25:49,00:25:53,"And when Elvis died, he stayed silent for a week."
00:25:53,00:25:55,He was so distraught from his death.
00:25:55,00:25:56,- Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:59,- I'm just showing my own tribute there.
00:25:59,00:25:59,"- Oh, yeah."
00:25:59,00:26:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:00,00:26:03,He was going to play for the Pope in 1997
00:26:03,00:26:06,and then the next Pope next it.
00:26:06,00:26:09,So he was going to play for John Paul II.
00:26:09,00:26:09,- Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:12,- The second in 1997.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- That's John Paul II squared, isn't it John Paul II?"
00:26:14,00:26:17,- He was going to play John Paul IV.
00:26:17,00:26:20,But then Cardinal Ratzinger tried to stop it happening.
00:26:20,00:26:21,Benedict the 16th.
00:26:21,00:26:22,- Why did he try to stop it happening?
00:26:22,00:26:23,- He said it was inappropriate.
00:26:23,00:26:25,He thought it was wrong.
00:26:25,00:26:27,He thought it was sort of a bit profite.
00:26:27,00:26:30,"But John Paul II did give a sermon saying,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,"""You asked me how many roads a man must walk down"
00:26:32,00:26:34,"""before he becomes a man."
00:26:34,00:26:36,"""I answer, there is only one road for man"
00:26:36,00:26:39,"""and it is the road of Jesus Christ."""
00:26:39,00:26:41,"- Doesn't scan as well, does it?"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"- Yeah, it doesn't."
00:26:42,00:26:44,- See why he didn't incorporate that.
00:26:44,00:26:45,- Yeah.
00:26:45,00:26:47,(upbeat music)
00:26:47,00:26:52,- Time for fact number three and that is Anna.
00:26:52,00:26:54,- My fact this week is that the US government
00:26:54,00:26:57,"runs a lottery where if you win,"
00:26:57,00:27:00,you get to go and watch fireflies light up.
00:27:00,00:27:01,- Ah.
00:27:01,00:27:02,- It's so sweet.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"- No, as good as winning 10 million quid."
00:27:05,00:27:07,"- Well, you know, in some ways it's better, James,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,'cause what's richer than nature?
00:27:10,00:27:10,- That's good money.
00:27:10,00:27:12,(laughing)
00:27:12,00:27:14,- You can buy that forest.
00:27:14,00:27:16,(laughing)
00:27:16,00:27:18,- She had just cut to you guys waving your wallet
00:27:18,00:27:20,"to the firefly, light up."
00:27:20,00:27:22,(laughing)
00:27:22,00:27:24,"- Well, millionaire Dan,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,you can't buy the forest 'cause it's in a national park.
00:27:26,00:27:27,- Okay.
00:27:27,00:27:28,- And this is a national park.
00:27:28,00:27:30,It's the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
00:27:30,00:27:32,in Tennessee and a bit of North Carolina.
00:27:32,00:27:36,"And the fireflies every year put on this incredible display,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"not for the humans, just for each other,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,but it is amazing.
00:27:39,00:27:41,It's two weeks early June
00:27:41,00:27:44,and it's the synchronous fireflies.
00:27:44,00:27:47,It's one of the only places that it happens in the US
00:27:47,00:27:50,and the only place it happens on this scale.
00:27:50,00:27:52,And basically it started happening
00:27:52,00:27:55,about mid-1990s when the national park
00:27:55,00:27:56,removed the street lights.
00:27:56,00:27:57,So it got really dark there
00:27:57,00:28:00,and fireflies love darkness 'cause their lights show up
00:28:00,00:28:02,and people realized it was a thing
00:28:02,00:28:04,and they started flocking to this national park
00:28:04,00:28:07,to see these fireflies all lighting up in synchrony.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"It's extraordinary, it's millions of them,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,like a Mexican wave going on and off.
00:28:12,00:28:14,And there were so many that at first
00:28:14,00:28:16,"they decided to do a first come, first serve thing"
00:28:16,00:28:19,with ticketing and the queues were just insanely long.
00:28:19,00:28:24,"So now there are 1,800 parking passes given out every year"
00:28:24,00:28:25,and you can apply for them.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"About 30,000 people applied in 2019."
00:28:28,00:28:31,So it's round that level and you might win.
00:28:31,00:28:34,"And if you win, you bring your foldable chairs,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,"you bring your inflatable sofas, some people do."
00:28:36,00:28:37,You bring your teddy bear.
00:28:37,00:28:39,You really settle in for the night
00:28:39,00:28:40,and then you wait for the fireflies to light up.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- It's pretty cool.
00:28:41,00:28:43,- Are there rules about what you can or can't bring?
00:28:43,00:28:44,Are you not allowed to bring a torch
00:28:44,00:28:46,in case that's confusing to them?
00:28:46,00:28:48,- You have to have red light so that they can't see it.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"- You certainly can't have normal white light, yes."
00:28:50,00:28:51,- Yeah.
00:28:51,00:28:54,"'Cause they get confused by the lights, don't they?"
00:28:54,00:28:54,- Yes.
00:28:54,00:28:56,- If you get a load of fireflies
00:28:56,00:28:57,"and there's street lights around,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,they just won't mate with each other.
00:28:59,00:29:03,And it's so much so that you can get two fireflies
00:29:03,00:29:05,and you can put them right next to each other
00:29:05,00:29:07,"and they might be really horny, but they won't mate."
00:29:07,00:29:08,- Right.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"- And we don't really show why they won't do it,"
00:29:10,00:29:13,but we think what it is is it's 'cause they think it's daytime
00:29:13,00:29:14,and they only do it at nighttime.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"- Oh, sensible fellows."
00:29:16,00:29:18,(laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:20,Doesn't it look a bit like Godzilla to them?
00:29:20,00:29:23,Isn't it just like a giant version?
00:29:23,00:29:25,"- And does that put you in the mood, Dan?"
00:29:25,00:29:27,"Because if it doesn't, I think we've got our answer."
00:29:27,00:29:29,- I reckon if you and your wife are there
00:29:29,00:29:32,"and a huge Yeti walks in, I can only imagine"
00:29:32,00:29:34,that's gonna help things in the bedroom.
00:29:34,00:29:35,(laughing)
00:29:35,00:29:37,"- I think in a very one-sided way, sure."
00:29:37,00:29:39,(laughing)
00:29:39,00:29:40,"- Honey, you can leave."
00:29:40,00:29:41,We'll tell them this.
00:29:41,00:29:43,(laughing)
00:29:43,00:29:45,- You know what they say about big feet?
00:29:45,00:29:47,(laughing)
00:29:47,00:29:52,- They're pretty amazing fireflies.
00:29:52,00:29:54,I've never looked into them before.
00:29:54,00:29:55,They're astonishing.
00:29:55,00:30:00,"I mean, the fire in them, it's guys, it's not a real fire."
00:30:00,00:30:03,"It is like a, yeah, I know, right?"
00:30:03,00:30:05,It's like a bioluminescence.
00:30:05,00:30:07,It's a thing that is made in them
00:30:07,00:30:10,as a combination of chemicals that combine together.
00:30:10,00:30:12,The main thing that people try and extract
00:30:12,00:30:15,is a thing called luciferase.
00:30:15,00:30:18,It sounds like lucifer's being used
00:30:18,00:30:19,as the etymology term there.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"- Well, lucifer means light bringer,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"which is where lucifer, the devil comes from, so, yeah."
00:30:24,00:30:25,- So I was correct.
00:30:25,00:30:27,(laughing)
00:30:27,00:30:28,Sometimes I like to assume
00:30:28,00:30:30,and have it confirmed on stage by the others.
00:30:30,00:30:33,And it's amazing what they can do with it.
00:30:33,00:30:36,It's used for mating reasons.
00:30:36,00:30:38,It's used for competitive advantage.
00:30:38,00:30:41,"You will have female fireflies of one species,"
00:30:41,00:30:43,"and there are many thousands of different species,"
00:30:43,00:30:46,and they will mimic the light of the male
00:30:46,00:30:49,and another subspecies to attract the female from mating
00:30:49,00:30:52,only to eat them up so that they can steal
00:30:52,00:30:53,certain bits of them.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- That's not feminism hasn't got to the firefly community,"
00:30:55,00:30:56,has it?
00:30:56,00:30:58,- But do you know why they do that?
00:30:58,00:30:59,It's not only for food.
00:30:59,00:31:00,"- It's a toxin, right?"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"- Yes, there's this predator repelling toxin,"
00:31:02,00:31:05,"and part of the firefly flash, gee, whiz."
00:31:05,00:31:07,"- I know, it's really tough."
00:31:07,00:31:09,- Just hadn't had a run up at that.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"- Part of the firefly flashing is to attract a mate,"
00:31:12,00:31:17,"but a part of it is also to say to predators, I am toxic."
00:31:17,00:31:21,"And they have this, it's Lusibufegin toxin."
00:31:21,00:31:22,Why can't I say that first time?
00:31:22,00:31:23,Don't know.
00:31:23,00:31:26,"But these, the females, the sort of femme fatale females,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"they can't make their own version of that toxin,"
00:31:29,00:31:30,"so they have to eat the males,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"so they gather, they harvest it from the corpses"
00:31:32,00:31:34,of the males they devour.
00:31:34,00:31:36,And I just think that's pretty cool.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"- It's cool, if you order a hamburger"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"that I wanted, it's like me eating you together."
00:31:41,00:31:43,(audience laughing)
00:31:43,00:31:44,- Yes.
00:31:44,00:31:46,- But these poor males are trying desperately
00:31:46,00:31:48,"to find females of their own species,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,then they know it's a risk as well.
00:31:50,00:31:51,And sometimes it takes them a week
00:31:51,00:31:53,"to find an actual female of their own species,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"and they're just constantly dodging, you know,"
00:31:55,00:31:56,predator fireflies. - False flags.
00:31:56,00:31:57,"- False flags, yeah."
00:31:57,00:31:59,"- Can I just ask a quick, sorry to cut you off,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"but Andy, well, you've just raised a good point,"
00:32:01,00:32:05,"which is to eat Andy if he's had the hamburger, right?"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"We were coming into New Zealand,"
00:32:07,00:32:10,"and you obviously aren't allowed to bring in fruit, right?"
00:32:10,00:32:13,"So I had a banana just before we came in, right?"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"So I ate it on the plane, and I got off."
00:32:15,00:32:17,"And the sniffer dogs went past us,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,"and I just thought, why can't it smell it in me?"
00:32:20,00:32:20,Why can't it?
00:32:20,00:32:22,(audience laughing)
00:32:22,00:32:23,Like it's still quite fresh.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"- You're a messy eater, but you didn't rub it"
00:32:24,00:32:27,"all over your, if you could."
00:32:27,00:32:29,"- If you wanted to sneak something into the country,"
00:32:29,00:32:32,"if you could get the stomach of a person,"
00:32:32,00:32:34,it seems like you could put it in there.
00:32:34,00:32:35,- Yeah.
00:32:35,00:32:36,"- Yeah, it says it back."
00:32:36,00:32:36,- Yeah.
00:32:36,00:32:37,(audience laughing)
00:32:37,00:32:41,"- You just invented smuggling, that's it."
00:32:41,00:32:44,"- Oh yeah, and a bottom might be even better."
00:32:44,00:32:45,- Oh my God.
00:32:45,00:32:47,- You've blown this shit wide open?
00:32:47,00:32:50,"No, I'm not sure you have."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"- We should say the ones, the fireflies"
00:32:52,00:32:54,"that are visited by all these tourists,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,"and for whom the lottery is run,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,"that is just flirting, the flashing."
00:32:59,00:33:01,"But it was quite confusing at first, I think,"
00:33:01,00:33:02,because it's not usual.
00:33:02,00:33:04,The vast majority of firefly species
00:33:04,00:33:08,"just flash as individuals, and these ones flash in unison,"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"and it starts off like one will do a flash,"
00:33:10,00:33:11,"and then another will pick up on it,"
00:33:11,00:33:12,"and it starts off looking quite random,"
00:33:12,00:33:14,"and gradually as more and more do it,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,"they manage to tune like an orchestra,"
00:33:16,00:33:18,and do it all together.
00:33:18,00:33:20,But the reason they're doing it in unison
00:33:20,00:33:22,is 'cause it's all males doing that flashing.
00:33:22,00:33:24,"The females flash back, but it's very dim,"
00:33:24,00:33:25,you can't really see it if you're a human.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"It's all males doing the flashing,"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"and it tells the female that that is the right species,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,"because if there's any other species flashing,"
00:33:32,00:33:35,then it'll not be flashing in time.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"But it's quite a shit show for the males,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,because I think the ratio is about 100 to one
00:33:38,00:33:39,"often, males to females."
00:33:39,00:33:41,"So even so, if you're the male,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"you're just accepting as you flash in unison,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,"it's like we have to work together on this,"
00:33:45,00:33:49,even though probably I'm not gonna be the one who gets it.
00:33:49,00:33:50,Isn't that sad?
00:33:50,00:33:52,"- In a way, it's also a kind of lottery, isn't it?"
00:33:52,00:33:55,"- Oh my God. - Oh, yeah."
00:33:55,00:33:58,"- There's a lottery to see the firefly lottery, wow."
00:33:58,00:34:01,- That's good. - How deep does this go?
00:34:01,00:34:01,- Yeah.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Well, the females, they can have dialogues"
00:34:03,00:34:05,with 10 males at once.
00:34:05,00:34:07,If there's some species chat back and forth
00:34:07,00:34:08,with the flashing. - Really?
00:34:08,00:34:09,"Oh, with the flashing, right?"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"- Yeah, yeah, and so-- - Only the slags."
00:34:11,00:34:13,"- Ah, no. (laughing)"
00:34:13,00:34:14,"They mate with only one they pick,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,they sort of winnow down from.
00:34:15,00:34:17,"It's a bit Love Island, actually."
00:34:17,00:34:20,"They start with 10 males who they're chatting to,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,and then they end up.
00:34:21,00:34:22,- But are they sending the same message?
00:34:22,00:34:25,"Is it kind of like when you go onto a chatbot thing,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,"and you think you're flirting,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,and then you realize it's automated answers?
00:34:29,00:34:31,This is an insurance website.
00:34:31,00:34:35,- Yeah. (laughing)
00:34:35,00:34:36,"- No, I've never seen Godzilla."
00:34:36,00:34:39,(laughing)
00:34:39,00:34:42,"- One thing about these, the flashing,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"it's kind of like, I guess it's like dancing"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"'cause it's in rhythm, isn't it?"
00:34:46,00:34:49,"But if you get two fireflies next to each other,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"and they're from the same species,"
00:34:51,00:34:52,"and they're supposed to be able to do it in rhythm,"
00:34:52,00:34:55,"they can't, they just get all over the place."
00:34:55,00:34:56,"If you get three, they still can't,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,"and if you get 10, they still can't,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,"and it takes about 20 of them to get together,"
00:35:00,00:35:03,and suddenly they all start doing it in rhythm together.
00:35:03,00:35:04,- That's really interesting.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"- It's true of dancing, isn't it?"
00:35:06,00:35:07,"You know, if there's just two of you on a dance floor,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,it's incredibly awkward.
00:35:09,00:35:10,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:35:10,00:35:11,- But as soon as there's 20.
00:35:11,00:35:12,- It feels like it.
00:35:12,00:35:14,We are the same.
00:35:14,00:35:15,- There's a scary thing which is that
00:35:15,00:35:17,"their population is declining globally,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,"and one of the main reasons is,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"let's say there's a group of fireflies that are in an area,"
00:35:21,00:35:23,"and then that gets urbanized,"
00:35:23,00:35:24,and it gets concreted over.
00:35:24,00:35:27,They don't then fly and find another place.
00:35:27,00:35:28,They just disappear.
00:35:28,00:35:30,"The species just dies as this thing in it,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,"where it just goes, ""All right, that's us done."
00:35:32,00:35:33,"""We can't move over there."""
00:35:33,00:35:35,So that's really sad as we continue to urbanize.
00:35:35,00:35:37,"But also, we kind of don't know"
00:35:37,00:35:39,"how many fireflies there are necessarily,"
00:35:39,00:35:42,"because a lot of them hang out in the day,"
00:35:42,00:35:43,so we can't see them.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"- Yeah, and don't glow, right?"
00:35:44,00:35:47,"- They don't glow, so they use pheromones instead"
00:35:47,00:35:48,of their glow.
00:35:48,00:35:51,- There could be a million in here right now.
00:35:51,00:35:51,- Yeah.
00:35:51,00:35:52,- We wouldn't know.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"- We would, 'cause it's quite dark, but it's, yeah."
00:35:56,00:35:58,- Another reason why they're endangered
00:35:58,00:36:00,is that we used to farm them.
00:36:00,00:36:02,"Well, not farm them as collect them."
00:36:02,00:36:05,So there's a company called the Sigma Chemical Company
00:36:05,00:36:09,"that harvested about 3 million of fireflies every year,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"and they were trying to get this Luciferase,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,"which Dan was talking about,"
00:36:13,00:36:16,because you can use it in food safety testing and research.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"- Oh, cool."
00:36:18,00:36:22,"Well, they have come in very useful to science, generally."
00:36:22,00:36:25,They are particularly useful in energy efficiency.
00:36:25,00:36:29,So I think they let out the most efficient light we know of.
00:36:29,00:36:31,"It's the most efficient light in the world,"
00:36:31,00:36:32,"in the universe that we're aware of,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"because when they let off their light,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,"almost no heat is emitted,"
00:36:36,00:36:40,so almost 100% of the energy is emitted as light.
00:36:40,00:36:41,And so--
00:36:41,00:36:42,"- Wait, do you mean they're like LED,"
00:36:42,00:36:43,as in they're not hot?
00:36:43,00:36:43,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:43,00:36:47,"- Yeah, exactly, but LED is a bit hot."
00:36:47,00:36:50,"They are not hot, but they made LEDs better."
00:36:50,00:36:52,So there's a so cool thing where there was a physicist
00:36:52,00:36:55,"called Jean-Paul Vigneron, who went, he was Belgian,"
00:36:55,00:36:59,"and he went on a trip to Central America in, I think, about 2012,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"and he saw a bunch of fireflies glowing,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,"and he thought, ""I wonder how they do that?"""
00:37:03,00:37:04,And this is a science brain.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"He just, he took some, he brought them back to his lab,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,"and he looked inside them,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,and he saw that the way they were making their light
00:37:10,00:37:12,"efficiently was that they had these,"
00:37:12,00:37:16,"like, really jagged, irregular scales on their abdomen,"
00:37:16,00:37:19,"and that meant that the light was shining really efficiently,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,so that meant that you could get the maximum amount of light
00:37:21,00:37:22,"coming out for the minimum amount of energy,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,"and that's how LED lights are designed now,"
00:37:24,00:37:27,and he increased the energy efficiency by 50%.
00:37:27,00:37:28,- You're joking.
00:37:28,00:37:29,- Wow.
00:37:29,00:37:30,- So that's how-- - That is insane.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"- I know, they, it's good old fireflies."
00:37:32,00:37:36,"- Could we ethically replace LEDs with them, somehow?"
00:37:36,00:37:38,"Like, picture your Christmas tree, right?"
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- Oh, lovely."
00:37:39,00:37:40,"- If we had, like, some kind of pheromone"
00:37:40,00:37:42,"that meant they were happy hanging out by the tree,"
00:37:42,00:37:46,"and you had flying LED lights around your entire tree,"
00:37:46,00:37:47,is that possible?
00:37:47,00:37:50,- I think the audience doesn't like the sound of it.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"I think it's less convenient, I do."
00:37:52,00:37:54,"- They have to be, if your lights had to be in the mood,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,(audience laughing)
00:37:56,00:38:00,"to be on, probably, you might have a few dark Christmases,"
00:38:00,00:38:01,you know. (audience laughing)
00:38:01,00:38:04,Can I tell you one more thing about the dangerous lady
00:38:04,00:38:07,"fireflies, the ones who eat the males?"
00:38:07,00:38:09,"- These. - Them fatals, yeah."
00:38:09,00:38:12,"- So not only do they eat males of a different genus,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,they will sometimes eat males of their own genus
00:38:14,00:38:16,if they're merely hungry.
00:38:17,00:38:20,Some of them will break off mid-sex to eat their partner.
00:38:20,00:38:22,Mid?
00:38:22,00:38:23,"- Wait, that can't be mid-sex."
00:38:23,00:38:25,That's just the end of sex.
00:38:25,00:38:28,- Yeah. (audience laughing)
00:38:28,00:38:31,"Fair point, fair point."
00:38:31,00:38:34,- It's an unexpectedly abrupt ending of sex.
00:38:34,00:38:37,"- But the poor man, oh, this is the end, is it?"
00:38:37,00:38:38,Where's the end?
00:38:38,00:38:41,"I've got more, I've got more in the tank."
00:38:41,00:38:42,I've got more moves.
00:38:42,00:38:44,(audience laughing)
00:38:44,00:38:45,Ow.
00:38:45,00:38:46,Some.
00:38:46,00:38:47,(audience laughing)
00:38:47,00:38:52,"Some males in this genus, the prey genus of fireflies,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,they have special arms on either side of their penis
00:38:55,00:38:59,that remain outside the female for copulation.
00:38:59,00:39:02,And some scientists believe this might be
00:39:02,00:39:04,an incoming cannibalism alert system.
00:39:04,00:39:05,(audience laughing)
00:39:05,00:39:07,And if the female starts wriggling around
00:39:07,00:39:09,"because she's started to feel a bit peckish,"
00:39:09,00:39:12,the male is notified that this is a risk
00:39:12,00:39:13,and it gets a sort of early warning.
00:39:13,00:39:14,- Amazing.
00:39:14,00:39:17,"The arms, what, hold on to her or what?"
00:39:17,00:39:21,"- I think they just stick out at the base, if you like."
00:39:21,00:39:22,- Maybe they tap her on the shoulder
00:39:22,00:39:24,from behind to distract her then.
00:39:24,00:39:26,(audience laughing)
00:39:26,00:39:26,And then they're off.
00:39:26,00:39:27,(audience laughing)
00:39:27,00:39:29,"- Ah, we're, shit!"
00:39:29,00:39:31,(audience laughing)
00:39:31,00:39:32,- I was mid-sex.
00:39:32,00:39:35,(audience laughing)
00:39:35,00:39:38,(upbeat music)
00:39:38,00:39:43,- It is now time for our final fact of the show
00:39:43,00:39:44,and that is James.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the scientific paper,"
00:39:47,00:39:51,"""Detection of Noda Virus in Barramundi"""
00:39:51,00:39:54,was co-authored by Dr. Barry Munday.
00:39:54,00:39:56,(audience laughing)
00:39:56,00:39:58,- I feel like that's shut down the show.
00:39:58,00:40:00,That's the greatest fact ever.
00:40:00,00:40:02,"Do you know it, everyone? - That's incredible."
00:40:02,00:40:03,- It is amazing. - It's incredible.
00:40:03,00:40:06,- So I found out that this guy called Dr. Barry Munday
00:40:06,00:40:09,worked in Tasmanian fisheries
00:40:09,00:40:11,and I know that he'd done some studies.
00:40:11,00:40:13,So I went through a list of all of the studies
00:40:13,00:40:16,that he'd done in the hope and the dream
00:40:16,00:40:18,that one of them was about Barry Munday
00:40:18,00:40:21,"and sure enough, he did do this one very obscure one."
00:40:21,00:40:23,- That's incredible.
00:40:23,00:40:24,He passed away a few years ago.
00:40:24,00:40:25,"- Yeah, 2003."
00:40:25,00:40:30,"- Yeah, 2003 and I found this really beautiful obituary"
00:40:30,00:40:33,of his entire career online and it's so detailed.
00:40:33,00:40:35,They do not say he wrote a paper
00:40:35,00:40:36,on a fucking Barry Munday.
00:40:36,00:40:37,(audience laughing)
00:40:37,00:40:38,It's unbelievable.
00:40:38,00:40:40,- It was really important.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"- Do you have any idea if he, sorry,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,"I do want to know about the important things he did,"
00:40:44,00:40:45,but mostly I want to know if he wrote this paper
00:40:45,00:40:46,because his name is Barry Munday.
00:40:46,00:40:48,"- I don't think so, genuinely don't think so."
00:40:48,00:40:50,"- He mops in his head, I'm sure."
00:40:50,00:40:51,- Do you reckon?
00:40:51,00:40:51,- Surely.
00:40:51,00:40:53,"- I don't know, I reckon."
00:40:53,00:40:54,"There's a lot of this about, actually,"
00:40:54,00:40:57,'cause I basically Googled every fish name
00:40:57,00:41:01,I could think of to see if there are other people like this.
00:41:01,00:41:03,There's a guy called Stephen Haddock
00:41:03,00:41:05,who's working on Deep Sea Gelatinous zooplankton.
00:41:05,00:41:06,- Amazing.
00:41:06,00:41:11,- John Salmon was a fish spotter in the 1980s.
00:41:11,00:41:12,- Fish spotter.
00:41:12,00:41:14,"- Yeah, he would fly over in his plane and go,"
00:41:14,00:41:15,there's one.
00:41:15,00:41:16,(audience laughing)
00:41:16,00:41:17,- Really?
00:41:17,00:41:18,"- No, he wouldn't say there's one."
00:41:18,00:41:20,He said like there's a school of fish
00:41:20,00:41:21,and then he would give the coordinates
00:41:21,00:41:23,and people would be able to go and catch them if they want.
00:41:23,00:41:24,- Right.
00:41:24,00:41:25,"- Do you know, so weirdly, I thought when he says"
00:41:25,00:41:27,"fish spotter, he meant someone who put spots on fish"
00:41:27,00:41:29,"and I don't know why they would do that,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,so that's what I thought.
00:41:31,00:41:34,- Courtney Pike was the angling correspondent
00:41:34,00:41:35,for the Suffolk Gazette.
00:41:35,00:41:36,- That's brilliant.
00:41:36,00:41:39,- Jack Trout was the person who read
00:41:39,00:41:43,the fishing report show from San Francisco's KNBR 680.
00:41:43,00:41:46,"- Jesus, what happened, James?"
00:41:46,00:41:47,- Frank E...
00:41:47,00:41:47,(laughing)
00:41:47,00:41:48,- What?
00:41:48,00:41:49,- Is everyone still here?
00:41:49,00:41:50,(audience laughing)
00:41:50,00:41:51,- What?
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Frank...
00:41:52,00:41:55,"- Frank E. Fish wrote lots of papers all about fish,"
00:41:55,00:41:58,especially the biomechanics of manoeuvrability
00:41:58,00:41:59,and jet propulsion in fish.
00:41:59,00:42:00,- Wow.
00:42:00,00:42:03,- That took you most of 2024.
00:42:03,00:42:03,(laughing)
00:42:03,00:42:04,- We know it.
00:42:04,00:42:07,- Courtney Trout.
00:42:07,00:42:08,"- Oh, no, Courtney Pike."
00:42:08,00:42:10,"- Oh, sorry, Courtney Pike is the question"
00:42:10,00:42:12,that an angling correspondent would ask.
00:42:12,00:42:13,"- It's brilliant, that, isn't it?"
00:42:13,00:42:14,- What do you mean?
00:42:14,00:42:15,"- So, Courtney Pike."
00:42:15,00:42:15,- Have you Courtney Pike?
00:42:15,00:42:16,"- Oh, Courtney Pike."
00:42:16,00:42:17,"- Courtney Pike, got that."
00:42:17,00:42:19,- Beautiful.
00:42:19,00:42:20,- Amazing.
00:42:20,00:42:20,- Beautiful.
00:42:20,00:42:22,"- Baramundi, the fish itself."
00:42:22,00:42:23,"- Oh, yeah."
00:42:23,00:42:25,- Hugely popular in Australia.
00:42:25,00:42:26,"It's massively popular, right?"
00:42:26,00:42:27,- They're obsessed with it.
00:42:27,00:42:28,- They're obsessed with it.
00:42:28,00:42:30,But one of the issues is that they're discovering
00:42:30,00:42:34,that a lot of Baramundi is being imported
00:42:34,00:42:34,that aren't Baramundi.
00:42:34,00:42:38,It's almost like they're a fake cosplaying fish.
00:42:38,00:42:40,Not the fish on doing it.
00:42:40,00:42:42,It's the humans that are selling it.
00:42:42,00:42:43,- Okay.
00:42:43,00:42:43,- But there are rules in Australia
00:42:43,00:42:47,that mean that the food service is under no obligation
00:42:47,00:42:49,to label whether or not it is a local or imported fish.
00:42:49,00:42:51,"So, people don't know the better."
00:42:51,00:42:52,They're being misled.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"And so this is a big problem,"
00:42:53,00:42:55,according to the head of the Northern Territory
00:42:55,00:42:58,"Seafood Council, who's called Rob Fish."
00:42:58,00:42:59,So.
00:42:59,00:43:00,- Brilliant.
00:43:00,00:43:03,- Do you want to do a full 15 minutes of these?
00:43:03,00:43:04,"- Hopefully, no."
00:43:04,00:43:06,- Do you know one of the main fish
00:43:06,00:43:09,that scandalously has been disguised as Baramundi
00:43:09,00:43:10,is from New Zealand?
00:43:10,00:43:12,It's the New Zealand grouper.
00:43:12,00:43:14,Why do you have a fish called a grouper?
00:43:14,00:43:16,"I imagine it's from the same origin as grouper,"
00:43:16,00:43:19,which is the normal fish we have in the Northern Hemisphere.
00:43:19,00:43:21,"But yes, a New Zealand grouper."
00:43:21,00:43:24,"- The New Zealand grouper has tiny arms on its penis,"
00:43:24,00:43:25,doesn't it?
00:43:25,00:43:29,(audience laughing)
00:43:29,00:43:33,"- It's actually, do you guys know, do you eat grouper a lot?"
00:43:33,00:43:35,"Not many, but it's really popular."
00:43:35,00:43:37,And it was very popular in Maori culture.
00:43:37,00:43:39,And in Maori it's called hapuka.
00:43:39,00:43:42,"But I think hapuka, the word means"
00:43:42,00:43:44,"that it means to stuff your face with food,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,because it's so popular.
00:43:46,00:43:47,- That's cool.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"- Baramundi, a couple more things about them."
00:43:49,00:43:52,"They can eat food up to 60% of their own length,"
00:43:52,00:43:55,which is the equivalent of me eating a four foot long sausage.
00:43:55,00:43:56,"So that's food for thought, isn't it?"
00:43:56,00:43:57,- Wow.
00:43:57,00:43:58,(laughing)
00:43:58,00:44:01,- What is the longest sausage you've ever eaten?
00:44:01,00:44:02,- I did go.
00:44:02,00:44:04,There's a restaurant in Viennical Centre meter
00:44:04,00:44:06,where you order your food by the length.
00:44:06,00:44:07,- Really?
00:44:07,00:44:07,- Really.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"- And we ordered the special,"
00:44:08,00:44:10,which is a wheelbarrow for the sausages.
00:44:10,00:44:11,- Wow.
00:44:11,00:44:12,- It's unbelievable.
00:44:12,00:44:13,They bring this wheelbarrow.
00:44:13,00:44:14,"It's a small barrow,"
00:44:14,00:44:17,"but you don't realize how big a small wheelbarrow is,"
00:44:17,00:44:18,'cause you know what I mean.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:19,00:44:20,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:44:20,00:44:21,"- And it's big, it's big."
00:44:21,00:44:22,So I probably got through them.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"No, I don't know if I got through a meter of sausages then."
00:44:25,00:44:25,"No, I can't get done."
00:44:25,00:44:28,- I think you could easily eat a four foot sausage.
00:44:28,00:44:29,- In one go?
00:44:29,00:44:30,- In one go?
00:44:30,00:44:32,"- Well, you can chew it."
00:44:32,00:44:33,You're allowed to chew.
00:44:33,00:44:34,"- You're allowed to chew,"
00:44:34,00:44:35,but you can't eat it.
00:44:35,00:44:36,(audience laughs)
00:44:36,00:44:39,"I mean, James, that is just gonna get clipped out"
00:44:39,00:44:40,at that centre.
00:44:40,00:44:42,(audience laughs)
00:44:42,00:44:43,- Didn't even cross my mind.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"- No, four foot of sausage."
00:44:45,00:44:47,"Come on, even a cumberland's only about eight feet."
00:44:47,00:44:49,"- If it's very thin, easy."
00:44:49,00:44:51,"- Is it not thin, it's a sausage?"
00:44:51,00:44:51,- No.
00:44:51,00:44:55,You can't just turn it into a pepper army and wolf it.
00:44:55,00:44:57,I'm talking a thick old cumberland.
00:44:57,00:44:57,- We're talking about.
00:44:57,00:44:59,(audience laughs)
00:44:59,00:45:01,"- Please guys, we are talking about sausages."
00:45:01,00:45:04,"This is not, there's no sight to this."
00:45:04,00:45:06,- We need to start.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"- So four foot, that's the length that you think,"
00:45:08,00:45:11,"no, because I read varying accounts"
00:45:11,00:45:13,of what the largest barramundi that's ever been caught is.
00:45:13,00:45:17,And one went as far as saying it was five foot 10.
00:45:17,00:45:18,And that's massive.
00:45:18,00:45:19,I can't believe that's true.
00:45:19,00:45:20,"That's if you want to picture that size,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,that's the same height as Neil Finn.
00:45:22,00:45:26,"That's how big a five foot nine, five foot 10."
00:45:26,00:45:27,"- Who's that, sorry?"
00:45:27,00:45:30,(audience laughs)
00:45:30,00:45:32,"- Okay, it's a New Zealander."
00:45:32,00:45:34,I thought you'd literally just Googled
00:45:34,00:45:36,everyone who was the height.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"I got, oh, they've got a funny fish sounding name."
00:45:39,00:45:42,"- Neil Finn is, there's a very famous Australian band called."
00:45:42,00:45:46,(audience laughs)
00:45:46,00:45:48,There's an incredibly famous New Zealand band
00:45:48,00:45:50,"called Split Ends, which became Crowded House."
00:45:50,00:45:53,"And Neil Finn is the, is from Crowded House."
00:45:53,00:45:54,- But Dan would have said Neil Finn
00:45:54,00:45:55,because of the word Finn.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"- Exactly, well, I'll tell you my working."
00:45:57,00:45:58,I found out it was five foot 10.
00:45:58,00:46:00,"And I sat at the computer and went,"
00:46:00,00:46:03,please tell me Neil Finn is five foot 10.
00:46:03,00:46:03,And he is.
00:46:03,00:46:05,(audience laughs)
00:46:05,00:46:06,"- That's the way to do it, James."
00:46:06,00:46:07,- That's how you save time.
00:46:07,00:46:07,- That's how you do it.
00:46:07,00:46:10,Just claim is right.
00:46:10,00:46:13,- You assume and let other things confirm it.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"- No, they are very cool though."
00:46:14,00:46:16,They sometimes eat baby crocodiles per a Monday.
00:46:16,00:46:17,"I mean, they're really--"
00:46:17,00:46:19,"- Yeah, they'll eat any old stuff."
00:46:19,00:46:20,- They'll eat any old stuff.
00:46:20,00:46:22,- They have a relation called the Antarctic Toothfish
00:46:22,00:46:24,and they eat lots of rocks.
00:46:24,00:46:25,(audience laughs)
00:46:25,00:46:27,"And we're not really sure why they do it,"
00:46:27,00:46:29,but it seems like the reason they do it
00:46:29,00:46:31,is 'cause they just want to eat everything
00:46:31,00:46:33,and the rocks get in the way.
00:46:33,00:46:33,- Really?
00:46:33,00:46:34,"- Yeah, that's pretty good."
00:46:34,00:46:36,"- So it's not an eating thing, they don't--"
00:46:36,00:46:37,"- No, it doesn't seem that way."
00:46:37,00:46:39,It seems like it's just useful for them
00:46:39,00:46:41,because they're so rare for them to get food
00:46:41,00:46:43,"just that if they see anything, they just go for it."
00:46:43,00:46:44,- Right.
00:46:44,00:46:46,- It's like when you get really greedy people
00:46:46,00:46:47,and you look at their finished meal
00:46:47,00:46:49,and all the cutlery's gone and everything.
00:46:49,00:46:51,(audience laughs)
00:46:51,00:46:52,- It's amazing.
00:46:52,00:46:54,"They do this extraordinary thing as well, Baramundi,"
00:46:54,00:46:57,"which is the males, they will start off as male"
00:46:57,00:47:00,and then there's a first wave in their life cycle
00:47:00,00:47:02,of mating that goes on and they'll go around
00:47:02,00:47:06,impregnating as many female Baramundi as possible
00:47:06,00:47:09,"and then once that's done and they grow a bit bigger,"
00:47:09,00:47:11,they then turn into female themselves
00:47:11,00:47:13,and the reason they do that is partially
00:47:13,00:47:16,because they can store more eggs inside of them
00:47:16,00:47:17,to give birth more.
00:47:17,00:47:20,"So it's the equivalent of if you picture like NFL,"
00:47:20,00:47:22,"it's like being a quarterback, throwing the ball"
00:47:22,00:47:24,and then running up and catching it yourself
00:47:24,00:47:27,because they're impregnating and then they're becoming
00:47:27,00:47:28,the ones that are being impregnated.
00:47:28,00:47:29,It's an extraordinary thing.
00:47:29,00:47:32,- Although what I find quite sad is that scientists think
00:47:32,00:47:35,that they can't transform into the female
00:47:35,00:47:38,"until they've done their first kind of copulation,"
00:47:38,00:47:39,"which for enough is just releasing sperm,"
00:47:39,00:47:42,"but it does make you think like, what if you couldn't do it?"
00:47:42,00:47:45,"You know, and you're like a 59 year old Baramundi"
00:47:45,00:47:49,who's still male and all the other ones age three have changed.
00:47:49,00:47:51,I just think that's embarrassing and sad.
00:47:51,00:47:53,(audience laughing)
00:47:53,00:47:55,"Have you not seen that film, ""The 40 Year Old Baramundi?"""
00:47:55,00:47:56,It's good.
00:47:56,00:47:57,(audience laughing)
00:47:57,00:47:59,And it's actually a lot more interesting
00:47:59,00:48:01,than you think it is.
00:48:01,00:48:02,"- Just on Australian fishes,"
00:48:02,00:48:07,"there's one called Plecto rinches carolinthus,"
00:48:07,00:48:11,but it's better known as the blue bastard.
00:48:11,00:48:12,- Oh yeah.
00:48:12,00:48:14,"- Can you guess how it gets its name, the blue bastard?"
00:48:14,00:48:17,- From the poetic minds of the Australian people.
00:48:17,00:48:20,(audience laughing)
00:48:20,00:48:23,- It must be blue.
00:48:23,00:48:23,- Is it blue?
00:48:23,00:48:25,"- It's blue, that's half of it."
00:48:25,00:48:26,- Is it a bastard to catch?
00:48:26,00:48:27,- It does the other half.
00:48:27,00:48:30,(audience laughing)
00:48:30,00:48:37,"- This fact was about nominative determinism, right?"
00:48:37,00:48:42,So Baramundi is doing a thing that his name is associated to.
00:48:42,00:48:46,And I found a few New Zealand examples of that.
00:48:46,00:48:51,So there is a composer who wrote a Romeo and Juliet opera
00:48:51,00:48:56,"who is called Peter van de Vlut, which is very sweet."
00:48:56,00:48:58,It's just a very sweet name.
00:48:58,00:49:01,There's an activist who's quite a famous actress
00:49:01,00:49:03,"who's been being, she's getting arrested"
00:49:03,00:49:06,for all her climate change protests.
00:49:06,00:49:08,And that's Lucy Lawless.
00:49:08,00:49:09,Xena Warrior-Princess.
00:49:09,00:49:10,- Very good.
00:49:10,00:49:12,"- Lawless, she's constantly getting taken"
00:49:12,00:49:14,to police stations for what she's doing.
00:49:14,00:49:18,"But I was, so I was sitting in a room today in New Zealand"
00:49:18,00:49:20,and a guy randomly overheard me talking about this
00:49:20,00:49:22,"called Wade and he came over and he said,"
00:49:22,00:49:26,"""My grandfather is an example of nominative determinism."
00:49:26,00:49:27,"""Can I tell you it?"""
00:49:27,00:49:31,So his grandfather was the first person in New Zealand
00:49:31,00:49:34,to artificially inseminate a bee.
00:49:34,00:49:37,(audience laughing)
00:49:37,00:49:41,"- They've been trying for years and years and years,"
00:49:41,00:49:42,haven't they?
00:49:42,00:49:45,We just can't find anyone with a small enough penis.
00:49:45,00:49:46,(audience laughing)
00:49:46,00:49:47,We will keep looking.
00:49:47,00:49:51,"Is this, is this guessable or is it?"
00:49:51,00:49:53,"- Oh, he's called Richard Beebe."
00:49:53,00:49:55,Like that's his name.
00:49:55,00:49:58,And he did it on a kitchen table in Balcluthur.
00:49:58,00:50:02,"- Dick, wait, that's very, that's a bit racy, isn't it?"
00:50:02,00:50:04,Many would have started in bed.
00:50:04,00:50:06,- Sounds like the women takes you.
00:50:06,00:50:08,- It's called Dick Beebe.
00:50:08,00:50:11,(audience laughing)
00:50:11,00:50:13,"- Come on, mate."
00:50:13,00:50:14,- Oh my goodness.
00:50:14,00:50:15,So yeah.
00:50:15,00:50:17,"- The only, I mean, the only thing I have,"
00:50:17,00:50:18,'cause what I like about this original fact
00:50:18,00:50:20,is that it's a double nominative determinism.
00:50:20,00:50:24,"It's a Barry Monday, twice as unlikely."
00:50:24,00:50:26,And I think my favorite example of that
00:50:26,00:50:29,"is probably the world's leading expert in Pete Boggs,"
00:50:29,00:50:31,was called Pete Glob.
00:50:31,00:50:34,(audience laughing)
00:50:34,00:50:36,"- We've got a couple in the fish inbox,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,"if you don't mind me sharing that, Fred."
00:50:38,00:50:39,"- Yeah, Fred."
00:50:39,00:50:40,- This was sent in by Pruma Kutcher
00:50:40,00:50:44,and she had a dentist called Jintar Gumbyte.
00:50:44,00:50:45,- Brilliant.
00:50:45,00:50:46,- Pretty good.
00:50:46,00:50:48,And Peter Drake sent in the fact that John Ramsbottom
00:50:48,00:50:51,invented a new kind of high-speed piston.
00:50:51,00:50:53,(audience laughing)
00:50:53,00:50:54,- It's brilliant.
00:50:54,00:50:57,(audience laughing)
00:50:57,00:51:02,(upbeat music)
00:51:02,00:51:06,"- Okay, we need to get out of here."
00:51:06,00:51:08,"That is it, that is all of our facts."
00:51:08,00:51:10,"Thank you so much for listening, Auckland."
00:51:10,00:51:11,"You were awesome, that was amazing."
00:51:11,00:51:12,We will be back.
00:51:12,00:51:13,We'll see you then.
00:51:13,00:51:14,Goodbye!
00:51:14,00:51:17,(audience cheering)
00:51:18,00:51:21,(upbeat music)
00:51:21,00:51:23,(upbeat music)
