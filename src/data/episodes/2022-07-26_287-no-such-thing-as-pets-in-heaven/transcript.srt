1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (bells ringing)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,600
 - Do you know what it, or who don't want to wake us up?

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,420
 (bells ringing)

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,020
 - Do you know what it is?

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,600
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,520
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,320
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,360
 This week, coming to you live from Antwerp.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,360
 (audience cheering)

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,080
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,440
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
 and James Harkin.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,080
 Starting with you, James.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Pope Leo the 10th

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,600
 had a pet elephant who was killed

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,040
 when doctors gave it a gold enema.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,560
 (audience laughing)

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,400
 So there's quite a lot to unpack.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,440
 - It's the fact that really has everything.

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,280
 (audience laughing)

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,160
 It has popes, it has elephants,

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,440
 it has gold and it has bottoms.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,560
 (laughing)

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,280
 So anyway, so this was in 1514,

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,240
 there was King Manuel I of Portugal.

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,840
 He gave Leo the 10th this white elephant called Hano.

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,440
 And the Pope liked absolutely loved this elephant.

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,400
 He thought it was the greatest thing in the world.

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
 It almost made him understand

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,320
 why people worshipped false idols.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,960
 As long as they were white elephants called Hano.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,800
 But unfortunately, Hano didn't really like it living

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,400
 in Rome and he stopped eating and it turned out

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,840
 he had very severe constipation.

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,480
 And so Leo called in all the best doctor's in the land

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,840
 and they decided to use the normal thing

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,600
 that you would do for a normal human

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,800
 who had constipation, fire some gold up the bum.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,880
 And unfortunately, that doesn't work well with elephants.

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 - Gold.

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 - Is it in like in bar form?

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,200
 - Or powder?

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
 - Was it coins?

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,160
 Was it the way they slotting it in?

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
 Like a...

50
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
 (laughing)

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,480
 - And then you pull the trunk and hopefully you win.

52
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,880
 (laughing)

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,160
 No, it was, so they would dilute it with water

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
 and presumably some other thing.

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,440
 - It's quite amazing to have an elephant in Rome

56
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,240
 at that time because they didn't really have it.

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,600
 That was such a great thing.

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,080
 I think the Pope was told about elephants

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,360
 and he thought I'd love to get one and it was arranged.

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,760
 And those stories about when Hano actually arrived in Rome,

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,200
 they had a sort of procession for when he was introduced

62
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,280
 to the Pope and it says that he was walking through the streets

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,720
 and he had sort of clothing on him

64
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
 that made him look very royal.

65
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,560
 He had a little silver tower on his back.

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,440
 And when, apparently when he got to the Pope,

67
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,720
 he bent down on one of his knees and bowed his head low

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,960
 as if to say, "Hello, sir."

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,400
 You know, to the Pope and in my head, I've seen that scene

70
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
 it's in Aladdin.

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
 When they're going down the street for...

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,520
 - You're right. - Why, they never show

73
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,880
 the tragic sequel to that scene in Aladdin, don't they?

74
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,920
 (laughing)

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,080
 - You haven't seen the uncut version.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,920
 - Great.

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,160
 - After he did that, Hano lifted his head,

78
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,760
 trumpeted three times and then sucked some nearby water

79
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,280
 into his trunk and blew it over the adoring crowd.

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
 - I mean, he didn't do any of this stuff.

81
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
 That's face it.

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,600
 There was a bald person making up the reports at the time.

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,160
 But people were madly excited, weren't they?

84
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,400
 Even the general population.

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,760
 Another report said that people left the town,

86
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
 and they left a wreckage in their wake,

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,080
 just trying to get a glimpse of this elephant.

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
 There was trampling of fields and crops.

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
 There was crashing through roofs

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,480
 and there was tearing down walls to see the elephant.

91
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
 - Well, tearing down walls.

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,880
 - Yeah, I don't even know how you do that.

93
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
 - Yeah.

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,480
 - You can do it with an elephant if you like one.

95
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,320
 - It is.

96
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,160
 - I'm not sure, Hano could do it.

97
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
 Hano was quite a small elephant.

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,960
 He was at about four feet tall.

99
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,840
 - What did he say? - He was quite a sweet.

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,680
 - No way.

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,320
 - Yeah, that's true.

102
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,800
 - And then, so anyway, he was a massive hit,

103
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,920
 and then obviously it was extremely sad that Hano died.

104
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,640
 So King Manuel had to think of a sequel present

105
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
 for the Pope.

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,880
 So two years later, he sent a rhino.

107
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,120
 He thought, you think you've seen something.

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
 You ain't seen nothing yet.

109
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,840
 He sent a rhino tragically drowned on route.

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,880
 - Oh. - I know.

111
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
 But then, no, don't worry.

112
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,800
 It's got a kind of happy ending because it washed ashore

113
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
 and then the king had its stuffed and mounted

114
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,360
 and sent to Rome as a sort of,

115
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,440
 is that a happy ending?

116
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,280
 - Yeah.

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,400
 - Well, I don't want you as my doctor

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,360
 when you tell me one of my family members had passed.

119
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
 - Good news, though.

120
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,160
 I also run a taxi doing me shot down the road.

121
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
 (laughing)

122
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
 - That's great.

123
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
 So he presumably sent a letter ahead saying,

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,720
 "I've got you a lovely live rhino."

125
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
 And then a follow-up saying, correction,

126
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
 "I've got you a dead stuffed rhino."

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
 (laughing)

128
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
 Cool.

129
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,840
 But he got slightly in trouble for this,

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,560
 the Pope from some corners, didn't he?

131
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,320
 'Cause this 16th century was around the time

132
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,160
 of the Protestantism and the Reformation

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
 and the elephant was really the pinnacle

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,080
 of the Pope's profligate kind of extravagant lifestyle.

135
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,000
 And people thought the church was wasting

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,400
 their money left right and center.

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
 And the following year, I think,

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,560
 after Hano died, was the year that Martin Luther came

139
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,240
 and nailed his points to a door.

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,760
 - But he didn't mention the elephant though, did he?

141
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,960
 - He didn't explicitly mention,

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
 but I think the elephant ran as a theme

143
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,360
 through a lot of those Protestant demands.

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,760
 And the reason that that happened,

145
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,800
 well, the main problem that Luther had

146
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,480
 is that they were selling indulgences, right?

147
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,920
 So basically, if you'd committed a crime,

148
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,640
 you could pay for them to let you off.

149
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,400
 And the reason that they started doing that

150
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,760
 is because Leo the 10th was extremely profligate

151
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,040
 and was just spending all of his money.

152
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,800
 So within two years of becoming Pope,

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
 he'd spent all of the treasure

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,800
 amassed by the previous Pope,

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
 who was the extremely frugal Julius II.

156
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 And he just spent it all.

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
 He just was like, I'm the Pope now.

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,440
 I'm going to do what the fuck I want.

159
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,640
 - That's an actual quote.

160
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,400
 Although, like before he became Pope,

161
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,840
 he was known as Giovanni the Wise.

162
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,680
 - Was he?

163
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,120
 - Yeah, and he had a brother called Giuliano the Good,

164
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,520
 who became his helper.

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
 And then there was one other brother

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,480
 called Pierro the Fatuous.

167
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 And he became the ruler of Florence.

168
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,680
 - That's a bit of a burn on Florence, isn't it?

169
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,920
 - He'll send you the fatuous one.

170
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,720
 And one of the things that Leo might have spent the money on,

171
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,880
 I don't know if it was exactly him

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,920
 who spent the money on this, was the Vatican's

173
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,440
 secret erotic bathroom.

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,280
 - What?

175
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
 Have you heard of this?

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
 - Keep talking.

177
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,560
 The Vatican used to have a secret erotic bathroom.

178
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
 - How is it, I mean, all bathrooms can be erotic,

179
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,880
 I suppose, if you want them to be,

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
 but how is this one specifically?

181
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,520
 - How is it secret as well?

182
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,120
 Was it like you would say to the Pope,

183
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,360
 "Can you tell me where the bathroom is?"

184
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
 And he went, "God, the stairs turn left."

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
 - No, right!

186
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,720
 - Well, it's covered in erotic frescoes.

187
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,040
 They're extremely explicit drawings all over the place.

188
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,920
 And this was commissioned by an official,

189
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,640
 and it was painted by Raphael.

190
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
 So this was actually almost exactly,

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,840
 this was at the same time,

192
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,360
 because he was contemporary of Leo the 10th.

193
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,400
 And it was rediscovered recently,

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
 of journalists kept writing to the Vatican saying,

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,160
 "I know it's there somewhere, and you know it is too,

196
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
 and you're gonna let me come and see it."

197
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
 And eventually the Vatican cave, they said,

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
 "Yeah, all right, will that you see it?"

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
 - So it's still there?

200
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
 - It's still there.

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,360
 - Wow!

202
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,200
 - The frescoes are there,

203
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
 but it is not open to the public.

204
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,880
 - No.

205
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
 - That is so weird to think of the Pope

206
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,160
 just going in there for some quiet time, isn't it?

207
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
 (laughing)

208
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,960
 Which I'm sure he doesn't.

209
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,680
 - Yeah, that's amazing though,

210
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,640
 that there's now artwork by Raphael,

211
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
 that we're not gonna get to see,

212
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
 because they're a bit weird.

213
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,760
 So Raphael, actually, with Hano, the elephant,

214
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,360
 we're missing a bit of art, which is,

215
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
 when Hano died, the Pope was so sad,

216
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,840
 that he wrote a big piece to commemorate him,

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
 commissioned Raphael to do some paintings of Hano,

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,680
 and we lost that in fires and things that have happened

219
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
 over the years, but...

220
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,840
 - That's amazing.

221
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 Unseen Raphael?

222
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,120
 - It sounds like it's doodles rather than art,

223
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,440
 from what I've heard so far.

224
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,280
 - Sounds like it's...

225
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
 - There's a lot of doodles.

226
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
 (laughing)

227
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
 Just cock some balls all over the wall.

228
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,120
 (laughing)

229
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,080
 - Just on popes and animals,

230
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,680
 there's a lot of stories that you can find

231
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,960
 about a Pope meeting an animal.

232
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,040
 My favorite one is Pope Fabian.

233
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,640
 Pope Fabian I've never read about before,

234
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,880
 but he became Pope, and he wasn't a contender,

235
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,640
 but while they were all trying to decide who the next Pope was,

236
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,000
 and they had 13 people that were front runners,

237
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,320
 or several of them, a dove landed on his head,

238
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,600
 at a really odd moment,

239
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,960
 and they went, well, clearly, that's the Holy Spirit,

240
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,080
 telling us that he's...

241
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
 (laughing)

242
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,360
 And that's how he became the Pope,

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,280
 a bird landed on his head.

244
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
 Do you think we could do that

245
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,760
 for the next leader of the United Kingdom?

246
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,840
 - Like, yes.

247
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,160
 - I believe it.

248
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,240
 I mean, how often does a dove land on your head?

249
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,760
 - It depends if you've got bird seeds hidden in your hat.

250
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,000
 (laughing)

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
 - It's good to move. - Of course.

252
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,880
 - Pope's have very mixed relationships

253
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,080
 with the issue of animals and religions,

254
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,640
 so a few years ago, Pope Francis allegedly,

255
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,400
 he was quoted everywhere as saying

256
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,360
 that all pets will go to heaven.

257
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
 - All of them.

258
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,560
 - He did not say this.

259
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,120
 He did not say it, but it was reported everywhere.

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
 The Vatican had to clarify it.

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,520
 No, your pet will not go to heaven.

262
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,360
 - Whoa.

263
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 - It's quite a tricky thing to say.

264
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,480
 It's two people, isn't it?

265
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
 - Yes.

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,480
 - So he didn't say anything like that.

267
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,240
 - So he didn't even say it's not even some pets.

268
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,680
 - No, he didn't even say only good boys go to heaven.

269
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,880
 (laughing)

270
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,600
 - He was quoting Pope Paul VI, who had died in 1978,

271
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
 and he said Pope Paul VI had said that feet idiot,

272
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
 (laughing)

273
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,160
 but they thought that he'd said it himself.

274
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
 - Oh, okay.

275
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,040
 - We're gonna have to move on to our next factory soon.

276
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,880
 - Oh, okay.

277
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,720
 - Well, just, they are kind of cat lovers,

278
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
 historically, Pope's, aren't they?

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
 So a lot of Pope's have had cats as pets,

280
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,760
 and I don't think he was supposed to have pets

281
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,040
 in the Vatican, but for instance, Pope Benedict,

282
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,440
 so the Pope for this one, wasn't he?

283
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,840
 Yes, he was.

284
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,800
 He had, he actually had a biography of himself,

285
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,080
 written by a cat.

286
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,880
 - Stop it, cool.

287
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,720
 - Yeah, his pet cat, Chico,

288
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,080
 who stayed in the house that he'd hoped to retire to,

289
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,040
 before becoming Pope, Hassel,

290
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,280
 his pet cat Chico stayed in his house with the house's caretakers,

291
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,320
 and wrote the life of Pope Benedict as told by a cat.

292
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
 - Oh.

293
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,600
 - And it was with some help, so there was...

294
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,760
 (laughing)

295
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,000
 - That was a ghost writer, was there?

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,800
 - Well, look, a ghost writer is a strong word.

297
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,840
 I think a copy editor helped, yeah.

298
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
 (laughing)

299
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,280
 Leo V12, he gave papal audiences with his cat hidden

300
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,560
 in his lap underneath all his vestments,

301
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,680
 and occasionally it would give the game away

302
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,080
 by just having the swishing tail just below

303
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
 this kind of small...

304
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
 - Oh, God.

305
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
 - That would be very unsettling to see

306
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
 if you didn't know about the cat.

307
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,160
 - Yeah.

308
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,640
 - If you saw that a bulge come up underneath the actual,

309
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,520
 someone's just been in the sexy bathroom.

310
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,240
 (laughing)

311
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,960
 - The current Pope, Pope Francis has cows,

312
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,960
 and those cows are used to paint the Belvedere Palace,

313
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,320
 which houses all the precious art

314
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
 from the Vatican Museums.

315
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,720
 - What do you mean they're used to paint?

316
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,600
 - 'Cause they're not good painters' cows usually.

317
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
 - No, they're not part of the process.

318
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
 They just help with the materials.

319
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,040
 So, the milk of these cows is used to paint

320
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,760
 the walls of the outside of the museum, hoes.

321
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,840
 They do just grab an utter and sort of angle it

322
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,640
 to where you need it to be.

323
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
 - No, it's a very old recipe that they found

324
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,120
 where if you added cows milk to it,

325
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,200
 it makes it a better thing to paint with,

326
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,800
 and so they don't do it out in nostalgia.

327
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,160
 They do it out of it's the best way

328
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,120
 to paint their walls in the way that they have them.

329
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,840
 So yeah, all the walls out there.

330
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
 And I wonder the cats like the Vatican so much,

331
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,760
 it's full of milk.

332
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,940
 (laughing)

333
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,520
 (upbeat music)

334
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,760
 Okay, we need to move on to fact number two.

335
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,960
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

336
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,800
 My fact this week is that Johnny Cash,

337
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,880
 who released the song "Walk the Line,"

338
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,200
 had a lesser known musician brother called Tommy Cash,

339
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,120
 who released a song called "I Didn't Walk the Line."

340
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
 (audience laughing)

341
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,840
 This is, so Tommy Cash, Tommy Cash is still alive,

342
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,480
 he's 79 years old, and his whole career,

343
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,640
 he's been a country music star just like his brother,

344
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,360
 but not quite to the, you haven't heard of him.

345
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,640
 But, and he has other great songs,

346
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,560
 like one is called "My Brother, Johnny Cash,"

347
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,400
 and another one called "My Mother's Other Son."

348
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
 Oh!

349
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,720
 So it's because he doesn't really play

350
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
 off the Johnny Cash connection, it sounds like at all.

351
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,040
 No, he's a very, actually I've listened some of his songs,

352
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,720
 it's, they're genuinely really good,

353
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,680
 and he has a lot of songs with,

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,080
 I think those ones are done, you know,

355
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,960
 Johnny Cash has a very good sense of humor,

356
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,440
 these were done with a sense of humor as well, I think,

357
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,360
 as far as I can tell.

358
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,000
 Johnny Cash was an amazing guy.

359
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,480
 Yeah, so there's a story about him,

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,720
 that he was the first American person

361
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,960
 to find out that Stalin was dead.

362
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,160
 Yeah, really?

363
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,680
 And it's a, yeah, it's a, it's really repeated error.

364
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
 So he worked as a radio operator

365
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,040
 for the American Air Force between 1950 and 1954,

366
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,680
 yeah, and Stalin died in '53, didn't he?

367
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,560
 Yeah, so, so according to him,

368
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,240
 he claimed he located the signal

369
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,200
 'cause he was in West Germany at the time, I think,

370
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,000
 when a Soviet bomber was flying from Moscow to small,

371
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,720
 and the news was being transmitted internally in Russia,

372
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,360
 but it hadn't made it outside yet.

373
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
 Yeah, he didn't.

374
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,520
 But I don't think he did, I think he didn't.

375
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,720
 'Cause another biography pointed out that he didn't speak Russian,

376
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,880
 and it would have been in code,

377
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,680
 and he wouldn't have been able to decipher the code,

378
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
 and even if he had been able to decipher it,

379
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
 he didn't speak Russian, so.

380
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,640
 He was amazing that Johnny Cash, he had an incredible life.

381
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,760
 He was obviously famous for singing in lots of prisons,

382
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
 but he also spent quite a lot of time in prisons himself

383
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
 for doing bad stuff.

384
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,240
 And so one time, there was one time

385
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,760
 which sounded kind of sweet, where he was jailed,

386
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
 and he only ever spent one night in jail.

387
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,000
 It was for stuff like once he broke into some property

388
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,160
 to pick some flowers, really hardcore stuff like that.

389
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,760
 So he spent one night in a small town jail,

390
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,520
 and the warden who was jailing him said,

391
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,920
 "My wife's a big fan of yours,

392
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,400
 "and when I went home last night and told her

393
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,360
 "I had Johnny Cash in my jail, she cried all night."

394
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,680
 (laughing)

395
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,880
 Well, he did only spend one night in jail,

396
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,680
 but he did get in a lot of trouble, didn't he?

397
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
 Like, he smuggled drugs over the border,

398
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,160
 that was a big thing that he got in trouble for.

399
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,280
 There was one time when he was driving into the countryside

400
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,360
 while taking pills, drinking whiskey,

401
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,080
 and swirving all over the road.

402
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,640
 And then he decided to set a fire

403
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,080
 and set his car on fire, and then set the forest on fire.

404
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,200
 And when they caught him, and they said,

405
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,840
 "Did you start this fire?"

406
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,720
 He said, "No, no, my truck did, and it's dead,

407
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,200
 "so you can't question it."

408
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
 (laughing)

409
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
 And then they said, "Well, what about these condos?"

410
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,200
 We had 53 endangered condos here,

411
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,760
 and 49 of them have gone away.

412
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,800
 He said, "I don't care about your yellow buzzards."

413
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,960
 (laughing)

414
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,640
 So he killed half that species.

415
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,480
 Yeah.

416
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,040
 The half that there were only about a hundred left at the time,

417
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,880
 and then he killed 49.

418
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,720
 Yeah.

419
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,880
 And the species got down to 27 a few decades later,

420
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,000
 which was principally the fault of Johnny Cash.

421
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,840
 It's crazy.

422
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,680
 (laughing)

423
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,200
 But the numbers have since recovered, so.

424
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,120
 Now Johnny Cash is dead, they have.

425
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,720
 (laughing)

426
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
 He actually had a really bad relationship with birds,

427
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,280
 so he was addicted to painkillers and pills,

428
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,880
 and had serious problems with that,

429
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,680
 and then he quit them, he claimed,

430
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,480
 because he did it for June, his love of his life,

431
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,680
 and then he fell back into his painkiller addiction,

432
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,000
 after being attacked by an ostrich.

433
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
 So it was in the early Aces,

434
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,960
 and he wrote about this in his autobiography, I think,

435
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,320
 and he said that he had this animal park on his land,

436
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,160
 where he had lots of exotic animals.

437
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
 And he had an ostrich, a pair of ostriches

438
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,760
 that he'd always got along very well with,

439
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,480
 and then the female died,

440
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
 and the male got kind of pissed off.

441
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,280
 And so Johnny Cash was walking through the land one day,

442
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,840
 and the male just went for him,

443
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,240
 and he'd Johnny tried to swipe him with a stick,

444
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,720
 and the ostrich jumped in the air,

445
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,080
 and then came down at him with his big claw,

446
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,400
 and slit his stomach right open.

447
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
 So he ended up breaking five ribs,

448
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,360
 and he said that the only thing that saved him

449
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,080
 was he was wearing a really big belt,

450
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,280
 so the huge ostrich claw couldn't get slit his stomach down.

451
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
 He'd be on that belt.

452
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 So then he went to hospital, had to take some painkillers,

453
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,120
 and-- - Back on the drugs.

454
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,840
 - I think there's more to that story than there is.

455
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,040
 I think Johnny Cash killed the female ostrich

456
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,640
 and was going back for the male.

457
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,800
 (laughing)

458
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,560
 And the male took vengeance on him.

459
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
 - His drug taking was, I mean,

460
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
 it was insane the amount that he was doing.

461
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,320
 He always tried to kick it, never fully managed to do it.

462
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,880
 At one point, when he was really into the drugs,

463
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,400
 he released an album called "Bitter Tears."

464
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,760
 And "Bitter Tears" was actually a very serious album.

465
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,720
 It's sort of the AKA of it is "Ballards of the American Indian."

466
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,240
 And they were protest songs about how Native Americans

467
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,760
 were being treated at the time.

468
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,560
 So the sleeve notes say that Johnny Cash sings well

469
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,840
 these tales of the Indians' woe.

470
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,000
 Johnny is justified in the stand he takes

471
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,120
 as he is proud of his Cherokee blood.

472
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,120
 So he's, Johnny has Cherokee and Mohawk blood in his veins.

473
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,320
 He's said, he doesn't.

474
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,600
 He's in no way Native American.

475
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,440
 - Wow.

476
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,560
 - The drugs made him think he was Native American.

477
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,040
 He told Playboy in an interview.

478
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,080
 He said, "The higher I got, the more Indian blood I thought I had in me."

479
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,280
 And so, the whole thing was just a drug trip.

480
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
 - Wow.

481
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
 - Yeah, I wasn't really sure about him

482
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,960
 'cause he's quite, you know, there are some good,

483
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,240
 when you read about it, it's really complicated, isn't it?

484
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
 Like, for instance, he once shot a crow

485
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
 but then spent the next two days looking for a vet

486
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,720
 who could heal it.

487
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
 Okay, so it's kind of bent on both sides,

488
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,000
 but then I read one thing which really pushed me over the edge.

489
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,680
 Apparently, he used to drive down golf courses,

490
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,040
 picking up the players' bowls,

491
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,520
 and throwing them into the trees.

492
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,040
 (laughing)

493
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,600
 And I'm sorry, I could not trust a man who does that.

494
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,640
 - Just speaking of cars, I mean, this gives you another sort of insight

495
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,880
 into his kind of not empathetic side.

496
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,520
 There was a friend of his who was called Farron Young.

497
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
 He was a friend of cashers

498
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,480
 and he was also a musical contemporary.

499
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,200
 But he died in 1996 and his son said,

500
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,280
 "Can I come to your garden and spread his ashes?"

501
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,560
 Because this is a place that he loved to come.

502
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,200
 So Johnny said, "Yes, Johnny was out, I think, for the day."

503
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,360
 Came back and clearly when the ashes were being spread,

504
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
 some of them had caught in the wind.

505
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,800
 So Johnny came back and over his windshield of his car

506
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,120
 were the ashes of his former friend

507
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,040
 and he just turned the windshield wipers off.

508
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,880
 (laughing)

509
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,280
 He wiped him off, he wiped his existence off.

510
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,040
 - It's what he would have wanted.

511
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,880
 - That's true.

512
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,240
 - Who knows what he asked for?

513
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
 - Just on Johnny Cash and Birds

514
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
 'cause we were just talking about all that.

515
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,200
 Just very quickly.

516
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
 - It's all we're talking about.

517
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
 (laughing)

518
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,200
 - He fell out with his record label in the '80s Columbia.

519
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,160
 But they kind of, they had a deal

520
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,120
 so he had to release some records.

521
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,880
 And so he released a deliberately awful song

522
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,000
 called Chicken in Black,

523
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,560
 which was all about his brain being transplanted

524
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,680
 into a chicken.

525
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,640
 (laughing)

526
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
 Sounds amazing.

527
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,520
 - And actually it was quite a success.

528
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,360
 - So really?

529
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

530
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,040
 - It's not terrible.

531
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,880
 - Is he listening to it?

532
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,720
 - I don't know.

533
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,560
 - I think it's nice.

534
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,400
 He's not very good at writing his liberally bad songs.

535
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,440
 - What about this one that I've heard that,

536
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,560
 I don't think he wrote this but he definitely sung it.

537
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,080
 It's called, "I've been flushed from the bathroom

538
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,640
 "of your heart."

539
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,560
 (laughing)

540
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,400
 - Is that good luck?

541
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,880
 - That's great.

542
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,840
 - You know, my, possibly my favorite thing about Johnny Cash

543
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,520
 is his daughter's name, which is Rosanne

544
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,800
 and this is his daughter with his first wife, Vivian.

545
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,160
 And daughter's called Rosanne because his name

546
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,760
 for Vivian's breasts were Rosanne.

547
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,960
 (laughing)

548
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,720
 Is that a nice thing to carry around with you

549
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
 as a daughter?

550
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,280
 Who knows?

551
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,680
 - And we're gonna have to move on soon to our next fact.

552
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,760
 - I can give you a few more country song titles.

553
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
 - Just for the fun of it.

555
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,840
 Dropkick me Jesus through the goal posts of life.

556
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,520
 That's a good one.

557
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
 Here's quite a famous one.

558
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,840
 You're the reason our kids are ugly.

559
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,160
 (laughing)

560
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
 - Wow.

561
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,640
 - He went to sleep and the hog's at him.

562
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,600
 Now, Claude's gone forever.

563
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
 That was by Nathan Nathan.

564
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,760
 And we feed our baby's onions so we can find them in the dark.

565
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
 (laughing)

566
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,960
 Which is more a tip for life, I think, than a song.

567
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,160
 - It's a great tip.

568
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,760
 I like it.

569
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

570
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,040
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

571
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,000
 - My fact is that debirs use a giant vacuum cleaner

572
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,040
 to get diamonds from the bottom of the sea.

573
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,200
 - Wow.

574
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
 - This is so cool.

575
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
 This fact was actually sent to us by someone on Twitter

576
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,800
 @grapese81.

577
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,440
 Thank you very much.

578
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,560
 So this is an amazing thing.

579
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,000
 Diamonds on land are running out.

580
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,560
 Most diamond mines are gonna run out in about 2050, we think.

581
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,040
 So now there are these floating mines

582
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,120
 which bob around off the coast of Namibia, a lot of them.

583
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,080
 And one of them is run by debirs, and it dredges up.

584
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,200
 Huge amounts of stuff from the sea floor sifts it

585
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,440
 and then returns the stuff to the sea floor

586
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,880
 but keeps the diamonds.

587
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,360
 And it's hugely profitable.

588
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,800
 - Are the lots of diamonds there?

589
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,640
 - There are.

590
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
 - Wow.

591
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
 - That's why they do it.

592
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,320
 (laughing)

593
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,160
 - Yeah, it makes sense.

594
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
 - Yeah.

595
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 (laughing)

596
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,840
 - So in 2016, mining companies got $600 million

597
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,960
 worth of diamonds from the sea bed, so this is good.

598
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,400
 But it is a bit of a worry as well.

599
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,640
 This method of getting diamonds

600
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
 because it sucks up a lot of the sea bed.

601
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,840
 It might disturb the life living down there.

602
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,120
 And they do know that the vacuum cleaners they use

603
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,560
 are big enough to suck up fish and octopuses

604
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,040
 which go on this massive crazy ride through the system.

605
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,960
 And then they do end up back in the water at the end.

606
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,840
 - And these diamonds are much better

607
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,360
 or it's much more likely that you're gonna get

608
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,680
 a really good diamond, right?

609
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,560
 Because the water is always buffeting these diamonds.

610
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,960
 And so the little rubbish ones kind of get ground away

611
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
 and only the really high quality ones are left.

612
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,800
 (laughing)

613
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,640
 - Hey.

614
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,480
 - That's why they do it.

615
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
 - That's why they're good.

616
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
 - Sounds like a spokesperson for Derby's, yeah?

617
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
 (laughing)

618
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,840
 We are sponsored today, bye.

619
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,320
 (laughing)

620
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,280
 Derby's a pretty extraordinary company.

621
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,040
 They have controlled our view of diamonds

622
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,080
 for like a hundred years, it's mad.

623
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
 So they, until like the late 19th century,

624
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,960
 diamonds were incredibly rare.

625
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,880
 You basically found them

626
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,840
 if you pick them up on a few riverbeds in India,

627
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,080
 you could scavenge maybe a diamond if you were very lucky

628
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,560
 or the jungle of Brazil.

629
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,640
 But then in 1870, suddenly we found these,

630
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
 well, we started mining in South Africa

631
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,680
 and it was full of diamonds.

632
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
 And the market was suddenly deluged

633
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,320
 and Derby's who was the British company

634
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,280
 who was running the market at that time

635
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,760
 thought well, we can't let the market be deluged

636
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,360
 because otherwise we'll devalue the price of diamonds.

637
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,720
 And so they've basically been controlling the price.

638
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,280
 They're not even that rare.

639
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,680
 They're not so, lots more than Emeralds Ruby's

640
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,200
 sapphires, they're all much more rare than diamonds.

641
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,160
 Gold, so if you took all the gold evermind in the world,

642
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
 it would be up an elephant.

643
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,040
 (laughing)

644
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,880
 It would die.

645
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,320
 No, it would be a cube with sides of 20 meters.

646
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
 Whereas diamonds are fine,

647
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,280
 but Derby's has just had this monopoly on them forever.

648
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,840
 And they created that idea as well

649
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,960
 of the thing of how much you need to spend

650
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,080
 on an engagement ring creating the idea

651
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
 of a diamond being a part of an engagement ring.

652
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,320
 So it's something like a month salary, isn't it?

653
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,160
 A month salary.

654
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,440
 I remember someone told me that when I got engaged

655
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,400
 to my, well, as I was about to propose to my wife,

656
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,280
 that that was the case.

657
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,120
 Terrifying things.

658
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,560
 Well, no, what you do is you just resign your job.

659
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,600
 Yeah, propose using an extremely small ring.

660
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,440
 Yeah.

661
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,320
 And then explain the situation to your now furious fiancee.

662
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,440
 (laughing)

663
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,280
 I was--

664
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,120
 And your furious boss, obviously, when you asked your job back.

665
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,800
 The other thing is, if they just decided

666
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,600
 that they could have pitched it as high as they once

667
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
 it really, couldn't they?

668
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,840
 Yeah, but if they said you have to spend 20 years

669
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,360
 of your salary on a ring, it's got to pitch it.

670
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,200
 But you can now make diamonds, obviously, artificial diamonds

671
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
 are much more of a thing.

672
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
 And there is a Dutch designer who makes diamonds out of smog.

673
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,760
 This is so cool.

674
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,080
 He's got a tower, which sucks in 30,000 cubic meters

675
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,720
 of polluted air every hour of the day.

676
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,680
 And it cleans it.

677
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,040
 It releases the cleaner, so it's cleaning the air a bit.

678
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,720
 And then it collects a lot of carbon.

679
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,000
 And that carbon is crushed down into a diamond.

680
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
 It's not very romantic, though, is it?

681
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,480
 No, it's not.

682
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,600
 And these synthetic diamonds is a real problem for debirs,

683
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,680
 really, because if you can start making them in a lab,

684
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,520
 which are pretty much almost identical

685
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,200
 to the ones that you get from the ground,

686
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,720
 eventually it's going to be much cheaper to do it and whatever.

687
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,640
 So they've been really going against this for a long time,

688
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,560
 debirs, but very recently, they've

689
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,240
 started their own brand called Lightbox, which

690
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,360
 are the synthetic diamonds.

691
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,040
 But what they're doing is they're calling it

692
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,720
 affordable, fashion jewellery that may not be forever.

693
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,920
 And there's a suggestion--

694
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,200
 and I'm not saying this because, of course, we are sponsored,

695
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
 but no, we're not sponsored.

696
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,720
 But there's a suggestion that they're making deliberately

697
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,120
 trashy-looking jewellery with these synthetic things in

698
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,160
 so that there's a big difference between those ones

699
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,680
 and the so-called real ones.

700
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,080
 Oh, really?

701
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
 Oh, that's so sneaky.

702
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,800
 But most diamonds are synthetic.

703
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,000
 So I think that only 1.4% of today's diamonds

704
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,040
 are naturally mine.

705
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,280
 But synthetic diamonds have never been good quality enough

706
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,440
 until very recently to be used as jewellery.

707
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,040
 But their diamonds are really useful in industry,

708
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,720
 so for cutting and polishing, because they're so hard.

709
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,720
 And so those ones tend to be generated in the lab.

710
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,160
 So yeah, most diamonds don't come out of the ground.

711
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,760
 Swallowing diamonds?

712
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,600
 What?

713
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,040
 Sure, let's do it.

714
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,840
 In 2013, there was a charity event where everyone present

715
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,720
 got a glass of champagne.

716
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,320
 And all the glasses-- I think this is what happened--

717
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,760
 they had a cubic zirconia in the glass.

718
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,960
 And one glass at the whole event had a diamond in it in the

719
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,120
 glass, which a local jeweler had donated.

720
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,920
 So the idea is, at the end of the evening, everyone checks

721
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,240
 their flute, and someone's got the genuine diamond.

722
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
 And they get to keep that diamond.

723
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,320
 Cool.

724
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,160
 Unfortunately.

725
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,160
 I think you've given away from your headlight and what happens

726
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,200
 in the story.

727
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,400
 Unfortunately, the diamond was swallowed by an 80-year-old lady

728
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,120
 who had failed to notice the actual diamond at the bottom

729
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,240
 of her flute.

730
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,360
 And her doctor then found it during a colonoscopy.

731
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,720
 But the story has a happy ending, which is that she took it

732
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,040
 to a jeweler's shop in a biohazard bag.

733
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,640
 And it got cleaned up, but now she's got the diamonds.

734
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,680
 They're enough, of course.

735
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,560
 So you've got to keep it.

736
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,120
 If it's been dragged out of your rectum, then I think you

737
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,200
 deserve that diamond.

738
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,540
 I've got a really good diamond story that I like is that

739
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,560
 Donald Trump once gave Charlie Sheen a diamond.

740
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,720
 This is very rid of our back.

741
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,560
 So he actually gave him cufflinks that he said were made

742
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,120
 of platinum and diamond.

743
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,000
 And then so Charlie Sheen took these very grateful blah, blah,

744
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,600
 blah, blah.

745
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,480
 Had them valued up curiosity six months later.

746
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,880
 And he said that the value of literally recoiled from the item.

747
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,440
 And I was like, no, this is the cheapest thing I've ever seen.

748
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,920
 This is made of cheap pewter.

749
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,480
 This is expensive ones.

750
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,920
 Which rectum did you get this from?

751
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,600
 And then he said this.

752
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,080
 And it turns out that two or three other people, I think,

753
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,880
 have had exactly the same thing with Trump.

754
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,120
 Oh my god.

755
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,040
 That's amazing.

756
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,520
 In the course of researching this, my favorite diamond

757
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,400
 story that I read was an attempt to bribe Nestle for $25 million

758
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,680
 I think it was of worth of diamonds.

759
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,080
 So the idea was this guy was going to poison or threaten

760
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,480
 to poison Nestle's stuff.

761
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,440
 And he said, I won't do it if you give me all these diamonds.

762
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,880
 So Nestle had to work out how do we get out of this.

763
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,080
 And the police were brought in.

764
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,560
 And he said the way he wanted the diamonds delivered to him

765
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,120
 was he had homing pigeons.

766
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,560
 They were to be attached to that.

767
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,400
 And then there was to be inserted into the homing pigeons.

768
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,200
 Who is this guy?

769
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,240
 He was from Frankfurt.

770
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,440
 So it was DM $25 million, not dollars.

771
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,160
 Deutsch marks.

772
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,200
 Yeah, Deutsch marks.

773
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,520
 But yeah.

774
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,360
 So he got caught.

775
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,680
 And the reason he got caught is because obviously the homing

776
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,800
 pigeons were flying to exactly where he was.

777
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,040
 So they just followed the birds, and there he was waiting.

778
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,200
 It's the opposite of the perfect crime.

779
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,040
 I looked into some vacuum cleaners.

780
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,560
 Oh yeah.

781
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,080
 OK.

782
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
 A little bit of vacuum cleaner stuff.

783
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,200
 So I found a vacuum cleaner museum in the UK.

784
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,120
 And it sounds great.

785
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,000
 I really want to go.

786
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,560
 It's run by a guy called James Brown.

787
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,480
 But I think a different James Brown.

788
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,800
 And he's amazing.

789
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,960
 He's just really passionate about vacuum cleaners.

790
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,320
 So the museum is a notting him.

791
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 If you're ever in the UK and want to go, he said the age eight.

792
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,640
 He was already a vacuum cleaner fanatic in his mum had one.

793
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,320
 And he really wanted one.

794
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,360
 And he spotted a red goblin 800 lying on a rubbish dump.

795
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,400
 I don't know what that is, but maybe they were famous back then.

796
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,240
 A rubbish dump is a kind of pace where people leave.

797
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,880
 It doesn't matter, go on.

798
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,960
 So he found this red goblin.

799
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,320
 He took it home, wiped the mark off, plugged it in.

800
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,040
 And he says, that was one of the most fantastic moments of my life.

801
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,000
 And his mum apparently was hoping he'd get out of the vacuum cleaner

802
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,200
 phase, and he didn't.

803
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,960
 And by his teens, he had about 30 vacuum cleaners.

804
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,440
 And he said, you could say vacuum cleaners took over my life.

805
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,600
 One of his-- and so he's still at this museum.

806
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,760
 One of his party tricks, which I would love to enjoy.

807
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,720
 And I don't think we need to hear about this.

808
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,400
 It's not that.

809
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,360
 He just puts on a blindfold, and he waits.

810
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,560
 He puts on a blindfold.

811
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,440
 And you turn on your vacuum cleaner if he's in your house,

812
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,680
 and he can identify the exact make and model of the vacuum cleaner.

813
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,200
 Oh, cool.

814
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,120
 By the sound alone.

815
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,520
 Yeah, just by the sound.

816
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,160
 Wow, awesome.

817
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,880
 I actually read about him in the telegraph.

818
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,200
 And this was such a weird sentence from the telegraph thing about him.

819
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,280
 It just said James, who was not married,

820
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,640
 sees the real value of his collection as--

821
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,080
 and then it's completely unrelated to the fact that he's not married.

822
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,040
 So I feel like that needs emphasizing.

823
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

824
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,960
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

825
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,240
 And that is Chuzinski.

826
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,680
 My fact this week is that if you want to buy a phone app

827
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,720
 in North Korea, you have to go to a physical app store.

828
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,120
 How on earth does it work?

829
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,560
 Well, it's quite complex, actually.

830
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,800
 So basically, you can get kind of the specific phones

831
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,120
 that you're allowed to get, that the state allows you to get in North Korea.

832
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,840
 And they come with just like a card game and a photo app.

833
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,760
 And that's it.

834
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,880
 And if you want anything else, you go to these shops or these kiosks.

835
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,680
 And they're often like sort of appended

836
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,160
 to a supermarket or something, and you go in.

837
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
 And they're covered.

838
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,000
 The walls are covered with posters of different apps

839
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,120
 that you can ask for.

840
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,080
 So you browse the posters, and you see what you like to look of.

841
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
 And then you go up to the counter.

842
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,040
 And you say, I want that, or if they don't have a poster,

843
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,640
 you describe it to the assistant.

844
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,320
 And they say, oh, it sounds like Google Maps might work for you.

845
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,800
 Yeah.

846
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,960
 No, they don't allow that, certainly.

847
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,080
 But it's this ridiculously long process.

848
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,120
 So you say the app you want.

849
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,280
 You put the app name on this little slip.

850
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,600
 And then it sent to the cashier.

851
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,560
 And then you have to go to the cashier and pay.

852
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,880
 And then it sent back to the app selector

853
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,840
 who then has to plug their computer

854
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,040
 into a big internet system that only they have access to.

855
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,440
 And it's via Bluetooth connection,

856
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,880
 because it's not via proper internet connection.

857
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,520
 And then they have to download your app.

858
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,000
 It takes about 10 minutes per app.

859
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,680
 So to buy an app, you have to walk to the app

860
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,480
 or spend 10 minutes in there on this convoluted process.

861
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,240
 Go away.

862
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,160
 And then you've got snake.

863
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,880
 But there's even one further complication.

864
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,320
 They download it onto your phone.

865
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,160
 But then you need to buy an access code to set the thing off.

866
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,840
 So then that takes a further 10 minutes.

867
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,400
 So to get a single app, sometimes can take an hour,

868
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,240
 because you have to wait for the access codes

869
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,440
 to come through and so on.

870
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,480
 And yeah, it's incredible.

871
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,280
 Big system.

872
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,360
 But it was quite positive the article I read,

873
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,760
 although it was by a guy who works for a tourist agency

874
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,320
 in North Korea.

875
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,880
 But he was like, we've got access to all sorts of apps.

876
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
 They do.

877
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
 They've got an interesting internet system.

878
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,600
 Their intranet is called a Kwang Myeong.

879
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,280
 And that means light, apparently,

880
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,800
 or that sort of a loose translation.

881
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,440
 And it's actually fewer than 200 websites

882
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,560
 that are run by the government.

883
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,880
 But even so, if something.

884
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,520
 Some apps, some stuff on apps.

885
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,320
 I read an article about the worst apps in history.

886
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,120
 And I think I can't probably agree with you.

887
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,360
 So there's one called Hang Time.

888
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
 And it's a game.

889
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,800
 And what you do, you throw your iPhone in the air.

890
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,080
 And then you catch it.

891
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,560
 And the longer it's in the air, the more points you get.

892
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,520
 So it's encouraging you to throw it higher and higher and higher.

893
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,960
 So that's $0.99 for that game.

894
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,440
 And then another $1,000 for the next phone.

895
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,160
 There's another one called Pocket Heat, which is $1.99.

896
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,640
 And what this does is it uses up all of the iPhone's battery.

897
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,920
 It just puts it into overdrive, just making it

898
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,160
 do loads and loads of work, and makes it go red hot.

899
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,160
 And what they say, it's great, is if you're stuck in the wilderness

900
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,000
 and it's really cold, then you can use it to warm yourself up.

901
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,280
 But then, of course, how are you going to get in touch with anyone afterwards?

902
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,600
 Because you've got no battery left.

903
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,880
 Well, if you've got no battery, there's actually a really great app called Die With Me,

904
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,720
 which is you're only allowed to enter the app.

905
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,840
 So it's locked out.

906
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,080
 You're locked out of it until your battery goes to 5% or below.

907
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,440
 And then suddenly you're into this chat room where everyone's phones are dying.

908
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,480
 And you can come visit it together.

909
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,040
 Oh my god, it's like being a palliative care ward.

910
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,480
 Oh, that's morbid.

911
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,520
 Speaking of that, actually, do you remember the old Nokia 3310s?

912
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,760
 Yeah, they're very, very popular.

913
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,600
 There's still a few in this audience who got them.

914
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,320
 There was a woman in Nigeria.

915
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
 Apparently, this happened.

916
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,520
 It was on social media.

917
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,640
 And they claimed it happened.

918
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,600
 She lost her phone in 2006.

919
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,840
 And then last year, they found it again.

920
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,520
 And it still had one bar of battery left.

921
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
 No.

922
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,640
 That's amazing.

923
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
 No.

924
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,920
 Sorry, really, that's true.

925
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,480
 And there was a YouTube channel called Creosan that passed a million volts of electricity

926
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,960
 through a 3310 and it continued to work.

927
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,440
 And they did it to a more modern phone and it just was frazzled immediately.

928
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
 Do you know the best selling phone of all time?

929
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
 Is it that one?

930
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
 3310.

931
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
 It's not the 3310s.

932
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 The 1100, which I think is a previous version.

933
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,680
 So seven of the 10 best selling phones of all time are Nokia phones.

934
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,640
 And yeah, the 11-- yeah, they're great phones.

935
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,600
 And Snake, in fact, was obviously the best game of all time.

936
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,120
 But I realized something about it that I never knew at the time, which is that you could

937
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,000
 play two players, Snake, with your friend.

938
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,280
 So they had an infrared phone connection thing installed, which is kind of like early Bluetooth,

939
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,200
 I suppose, which no one ever used, I don't think.

940
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,480
 But basically, if you pointed your phone really close through the infrared port, you pointed

941
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,120
 that infrared port at your mate's infrared port.

942
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,840
 And they were basically touching each other.

943
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,840
 You could then, if you couldn't talk your body around enough, play Snake against that

944
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
 friend.

945
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
 Yeah.

946
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
 I've done that.

947
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
 I've played that.

948
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
 What?

949
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
 Yeah.

950
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
 No.

951
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
 Do you mean against a friend, rather than just the phone?

952
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
 I didn't hear what you said just before.

953
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,840
 I was just saying about a great game of Snake.

954
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
 Oh.

955
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
 I love Snake.

956
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
 Have you guys heard of the "Yo" app?

957
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
 No.

958
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,840
 "Yo" was an app sensation in 2014.

959
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
 Was it?

960
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
 Yeah, it was.

961
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,320
 The only thing you could do with it was send the word "Yo."

962
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,160
 Yes, I did get that to other users of the app.

963
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
 I used that like for about two hours.

964
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
 Right.

965
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
 You can't say anything else.

966
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,880
 If you get sent a "Yo," all you can reply with is "Yo."

967
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,320
 It raised a million and a half dollars in funding.

968
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,320
 It became the number four app in the US App Store, thanks to people like James.

969
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
 It was pretty cool.

970
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
 It was.

971
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
 It was pretty cool.

972
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,600
 The man who founded it said this is a stupid app.

973
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
 He's so wrong.

974
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
 He's so wrong.

975
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,280
 He just got a message and it just went, "Yo."

976
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
 What could be better than that?

977
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:38,280
 It's like, you know on Facebook how you can poke people.

978
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
 It's like that kind of thing.

979
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,280
 How come I don't remember getting a "Yo" from you?

980
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 Well, 2014.

981
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,280
 I believe that was before you ever had a smartphone.

982
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,280
 For those the early days of the apps, it was the bubble wrap app where you just clicked on bubble wrap.

983
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,280
 When they launched, it was in July 2008.

984
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,280
 In December of that year, there were over 50 different apps purely dedicated to making fart noises.

985
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
 That's how quickly we were interested in just having these things.

986
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,280
 There are now more than 1200 of the iTunes star, yeah.

987
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
 It's pretty depressing, isn't it?

988
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,280
 We've come this far technologically.

989
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
 Look how advanced we are.

990
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
 We've shown Newton what we've done.

991
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
 He's astonished.

992
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
 He asked, "What have you done with it?"

993
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,280
 Well, we've got 1200 for fast apps.

994
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
 Wow.

995
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,280
 I like this one.

996
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,280
 There's the quirky Egg Minder Wink app enabled Smart Egg Tray.

997
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,280
 This is an egg tray for your fridge, but it has an app which goes with it, which tells you how many eggs you have.

998
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
 Cool.

999
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
 That's very useful.

1000
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
 If you're outside the fridge but you don't want to open it.

1001
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:54,280
 There is a French calorie counting app called Food Viser, which is for people who are trying to calculate how many calories there are.

1002
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:03,280
 You basically show the phone what is on your plate and it tells you an estimate of how many calories are in it.

1003
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:12,280
 It's a French app, but when it was released in England, it became repeatedly confused by horrible British food, which had no idea what it was.

1004
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,280
 It got shown a cornered pasty and said, "Is this a baguette? What is it?"

1005
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,280
 It got fish chips and mushy peas. It said, "Oh, you've got some guacamole, I can see there."

1006
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,280
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

1007
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,280
 I think one of my favourite apps is an app called The Last Hit.

1008
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:41,280
 This is something that acknowledges that, as it says, there is something worse than suddenly dying and that is doing it while listening to a really embarrassing song.

1009
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:50,280
 The Last Hit is an app that your phone detects a sudden movement that implies you might have died in an awful accident.

1010
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,280
 It quickly plays the song that you've nominated to be your final song.

1011
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,280
 Oh, God.

1012
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:08,280
 He died listening to Johnny Cash's famous chicken song.

1013
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,280
 That's okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.
