00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 (bells ringing)

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.600
 - Do you know what it, or who don't want to wake us up?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.420
 (bells ringing)

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.020
 - Do you know what it is?

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.600
 (upbeat music)

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.520
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.320
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.360
 This week, coming to you live from Antwerp.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.360
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.080
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.640
 and James Harkin.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.080
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.480
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Pope Leo the 10th

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 had a pet elephant who was killed

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.040
 when doctors gave it a gold enema.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.560
 (audience laughing)

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.400
 So there's quite a lot to unpack.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.440
 - It's the fact that really has everything.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.280
 (audience laughing)

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160
 It has popes, it has elephants,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.440
 it has gold and it has bottoms.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.560
 (laughing)

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 So anyway, so this was in 1514,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240
 there was King Manuel I of Portugal.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.840
 He gave Leo the 10th this white elephant called Hano.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.440
 And the Pope liked absolutely loved this elephant.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.400
 He thought it was the greatest thing in the world.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.840
 It almost made him understand

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.320
 why people worshipped false idols.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.960
 As long as they were white elephants called Hano.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.800
 But unfortunately, Hano didn't really like it living

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.400
 in Rome and he stopped eating and it turned out

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.840
 he had very severe constipation.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.480
 And so Leo called in all the best doctor's in the land

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.840
 and they decided to use the normal thing

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600
 that you would do for a normal human

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.800
 who had constipation, fire some gold up the bum.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.880
 And unfortunately, that doesn't work well with elephants.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 - Gold.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 - Is it in like in bar form?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 - Or powder?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.040
 - Was it coins?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.160
 Was it the way they slotting it in?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 Like a...

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.360
 (laughing)

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.480
 - And then you pull the trunk and hopefully you win.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.880
 (laughing)

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.160
 No, it was, so they would dilute it with water

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.480
 and presumably some other thing.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.440
 - It's quite amazing to have an elephant in Rome

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.240
 at that time because they didn't really have it.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.600
 That was such a great thing.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.080
 I think the Pope was told about elephants

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.360
 and he thought I'd love to get one and it was arranged.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.760
 And those stories about when Hano actually arrived in Rome,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.200
 they had a sort of procession for when he was introduced

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.280
 to the Pope and it says that he was walking through the streets

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.720
 and he had sort of clothing on him

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720
 that made him look very royal.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 He had a little silver tower on his back.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.440
 And when, apparently when he got to the Pope,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.720
 he bent down on one of his knees and bowed his head low

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960
 as if to say, "Hello, sir."

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.400
 You know, to the Pope and in my head, I've seen that scene

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 it's in Aladdin.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.480
 When they're going down the street for...

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.520
 - You're right. - Why, they never show

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.880
 the tragic sequel to that scene in Aladdin, don't they?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.920
 (laughing)

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.080
 - You haven't seen the uncut version.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.920
 - Great.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.160
 - After he did that, Hano lifted his head,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.760
 trumpeted three times and then sucked some nearby water

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.280
 into his trunk and blew it over the adoring crowd.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.720
 - I mean, he didn't do any of this stuff.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.560
 That's face it.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.600
 There was a bald person making up the reports at the time.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 But people were madly excited, weren't they?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400
 Even the general population.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.760
 Another report said that people left the town,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.280
 and they left a wreckage in their wake,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.080
 just trying to get a glimpse of this elephant.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.080
 There was trampling of fields and crops.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.080
 There was crashing through roofs

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.480
 and there was tearing down walls to see the elephant.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.320
 - Well, tearing down walls.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.880
 - Yeah, I don't even know how you do that.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.720
 - Yeah.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.480
 - You can do it with an elephant if you like one.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.320
 - It is.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.160
 - I'm not sure, Hano could do it.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.480
 Hano was quite a small elephant.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.960
 He was at about four feet tall.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.840
 - What did he say? - He was quite a sweet.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.680
 - No way.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.320
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.800
 - And then, so anyway, he was a massive hit,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.920
 and then obviously it was extremely sad that Hano died.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.640
 So King Manuel had to think of a sequel present

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.480
 for the Pope.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.880
 So two years later, he sent a rhino.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.120
 He thought, you think you've seen something.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.360
 You ain't seen nothing yet.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.840
 He sent a rhino tragically drowned on route.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.880
 - Oh. - I know.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.200
 But then, no, don't worry.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.800
 It's got a kind of happy ending because it washed ashore

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.400
 and then the king had its stuffed and mounted

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.360
 and sent to Rome as a sort of,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.440
 is that a happy ending?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.280
 - Yeah.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.400
 - Well, I don't want you as my doctor

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.360
 when you tell me one of my family members had passed.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.200
 - Good news, though.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.160
 I also run a taxi doing me shot down the road.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.600
 (laughing)

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.440
 - That's great.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.960
 So he presumably sent a letter ahead saying,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.720
 "I've got you a lovely live rhino."

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.120
 And then a follow-up saying, correction,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.120
 "I've got you a dead stuffed rhino."

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120
 (laughing)

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.960
 Cool.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.840
 But he got slightly in trouble for this,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.560
 the Pope from some corners, didn't he?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320
 'Cause this 16th century was around the time

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.160
 of the Protestantism and the Reformation

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.560
 and the elephant was really the pinnacle

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.080
 of the Pope's profligate kind of extravagant lifestyle.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.000
 And people thought the church was wasting

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.400
 their money left right and center.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 And the following year, I think,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.560
 after Hano died, was the year that Martin Luther came

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.240
 and nailed his points to a door.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.760
 - But he didn't mention the elephant though, did he?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.960
 - He didn't explicitly mention,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.600
 but I think the elephant ran as a theme

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.360
 through a lot of those Protestant demands.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.760
 And the reason that that happened,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.800
 well, the main problem that Luther had

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.480
 is that they were selling indulgences, right?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.920
 So basically, if you'd committed a crime,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.640
 you could pay for them to let you off.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.400
 And the reason that they started doing that

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.760
 is because Leo the 10th was extremely profligate

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.040
 and was just spending all of his money.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.800
 So within two years of becoming Pope,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.240
 he'd spent all of the treasure

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.800
 amassed by the previous Pope,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 who was the extremely frugal Julius II.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 And he just spent it all.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.000
 He just was like, I'm the Pope now.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.440
 I'm going to do what the fuck I want.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.640
 - That's an actual quote.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.400
 Although, like before he became Pope,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.840
 he was known as Giovanni the Wise.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.680
 - Was he?

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.120
 - Yeah, and he had a brother called Giuliano the Good,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.520
 who became his helper.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.800
 And then there was one other brother

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.480
 called Pierro the Fatuous.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 And he became the ruler of Florence.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.680
 - That's a bit of a burn on Florence, isn't it?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.920
 - He'll send you the fatuous one.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.720
 And one of the things that Leo might have spent the money on,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.880
 I don't know if it was exactly him

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.920
 who spent the money on this, was the Vatican's

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.440
 secret erotic bathroom.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.280
 - What?

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.120
 Have you heard of this?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.360
 - Keep talking.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.560
 The Vatican used to have a secret erotic bathroom.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560
 - How is it, I mean, all bathrooms can be erotic,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.880
 I suppose, if you want them to be,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.440
 but how is this one specifically?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.520
 - How is it secret as well?

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.120
 Was it like you would say to the Pope,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.360
 "Can you tell me where the bathroom is?"

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.720
 And he went, "God, the stairs turn left."

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.560
 - No, right!

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.720
 - Well, it's covered in erotic frescoes.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.040
 They're extremely explicit drawings all over the place.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.920
 And this was commissioned by an official,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.640
 and it was painted by Raphael.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.000
 So this was actually almost exactly,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.840
 this was at the same time,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.360
 because he was contemporary of Leo the 10th.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.400
 And it was rediscovered recently,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.560
 of journalists kept writing to the Vatican saying,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.160
 "I know it's there somewhere, and you know it is too,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.480
 and you're gonna let me come and see it."

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.000
 And eventually the Vatican cave, they said,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.680
 "Yeah, all right, will that you see it?"

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.520
 - So it's still there?

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520
 - It's still there.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.360
 - Wow!

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.200
 - The frescoes are there,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.040
 but it is not open to the public.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.880
 - No.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880
 - That is so weird to think of the Pope

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.160
 just going in there for some quiet time, isn't it?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.280
 (laughing)

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.960
 Which I'm sure he doesn't.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.680
 - Yeah, that's amazing though,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.640
 that there's now artwork by Raphael,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.960
 that we're not gonna get to see,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.640
 because they're a bit weird.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.760
 So Raphael, actually, with Hano, the elephant,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.360
 we're missing a bit of art, which is,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.360
 when Hano died, the Pope was so sad,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.840
 that he wrote a big piece to commemorate him,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.960
 commissioned Raphael to do some paintings of Hano,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.680
 and we lost that in fires and things that have happened

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.800
 over the years, but...

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.840
 - That's amazing.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840
 Unseen Raphael?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.120
 - It sounds like it's doodles rather than art,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.440
 from what I've heard so far.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.280
 - Sounds like it's...

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280
 - There's a lot of doodles.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.120
 (laughing)

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.880
 Just cock some balls all over the wall.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.120
 (laughing)

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.080
 - Just on popes and animals,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.680
 there's a lot of stories that you can find

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.960
 about a Pope meeting an animal.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.040
 My favorite one is Pope Fabian.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.640
 Pope Fabian I've never read about before,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.880
 but he became Pope, and he wasn't a contender,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.640
 but while they were all trying to decide who the next Pope was,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.000
 and they had 13 people that were front runners,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.320
 or several of them, a dove landed on his head,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.600
 at a really odd moment,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.960
 and they went, well, clearly, that's the Holy Spirit,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.080
 telling us that he's...

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.920
 (laughing)

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.360
 And that's how he became the Pope,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.280
 a bird landed on his head.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.360
 Do you think we could do that

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.760
 for the next leader of the United Kingdom?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.840
 - Like, yes.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.160
 - I believe it.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.240
 I mean, how often does a dove land on your head?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.760
 - It depends if you've got bird seeds hidden in your hat.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.000
 (laughing)

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.160
 - It's good to move. - Of course.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.880
 - Pope's have very mixed relationships

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.080
 with the issue of animals and religions,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.640
 so a few years ago, Pope Francis allegedly,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.400
 he was quoted everywhere as saying

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.360
 that all pets will go to heaven.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.200
 - All of them.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.560
 - He did not say this.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.120
 He did not say it, but it was reported everywhere.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.480
 The Vatican had to clarify it.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.520
 No, your pet will not go to heaven.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.360
 - Whoa.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360
 - It's quite a tricky thing to say.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.480
 It's two people, isn't it?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.320
 - Yes.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.480
 - So he didn't say anything like that.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.240
 - So he didn't even say it's not even some pets.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.680
 - No, he didn't even say only good boys go to heaven.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.880
 (laughing)

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.600
 - He was quoting Pope Paul VI, who had died in 1978,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.440
 and he said Pope Paul VI had said that feet idiot,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.280
 (laughing)

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.160
 but they thought that he'd said it himself.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160
 - Oh, okay.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.040
 - We're gonna have to move on to our next factory soon.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.880
 - Oh, okay.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.720
 - Well, just, they are kind of cat lovers,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.120
 historically, Pope's, aren't they?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.320
 So a lot of Pope's have had cats as pets,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.760
 and I don't think he was supposed to have pets

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.040
 in the Vatican, but for instance, Pope Benedict,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.440
 so the Pope for this one, wasn't he?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.840
 Yes, he was.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.800
 He had, he actually had a biography of himself,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.080
 written by a cat.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.880
 - Stop it, cool.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.720
 - Yeah, his pet cat, Chico,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.080
 who stayed in the house that he'd hoped to retire to,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.040
 before becoming Pope, Hassel,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.280
 his pet cat Chico stayed in his house with the house's caretakers,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.320
 and wrote the life of Pope Benedict as told by a cat.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.160
 - Oh.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.600
 - And it was with some help, so there was...

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.760
 (laughing)

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.000
 - That was a ghost writer, was there?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.800
 - Well, look, a ghost writer is a strong word.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.840
 I think a copy editor helped, yeah.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
 (laughing)

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.280
 Leo V12, he gave papal audiences with his cat hidden

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.560
 in his lap underneath all his vestments,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.680
 and occasionally it would give the game away

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.080
 by just having the swishing tail just below

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.080
 this kind of small...

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.920
 - Oh, God.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.240
 - That would be very unsettling to see

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 if you didn't know about the cat.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.160
 - Yeah.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.640
 - If you saw that a bulge come up underneath the actual,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.520
 someone's just been in the sexy bathroom.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.240
 (laughing)

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.960
 - The current Pope, Pope Francis has cows,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.960
 and those cows are used to paint the Belvedere Palace,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.320
 which houses all the precious art

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.480
 from the Vatican Museums.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.720
 - What do you mean they're used to paint?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.600
 - 'Cause they're not good painters' cows usually.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.400
 - No, they're not part of the process.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.600
 They just help with the materials.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.040
 So, the milk of these cows is used to paint

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.760
 the walls of the outside of the museum, hoes.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.840
 They do just grab an utter and sort of angle it

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.640
 to where you need it to be.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.560
 - No, it's a very old recipe that they found

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.120
 where if you added cows milk to it,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.200
 it makes it a better thing to paint with,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.800
 and so they don't do it out in nostalgia.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.160
 They do it out of it's the best way

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.120
 to paint their walls in the way that they have them.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.840
 So yeah, all the walls out there.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.680
 And I wonder the cats like the Vatican so much,

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.760
 it's full of milk.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.940
 (laughing)

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.520
 (upbeat music)

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.760
 Okay, we need to move on to fact number two.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.960
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.800
 My fact this week is that Johnny Cash,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.880
 who released the song "Walk the Line,"

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.200
 had a lesser known musician brother called Tommy Cash,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.120
 who released a song called "I Didn't Walk the Line."

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.120
 (audience laughing)

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.840
 This is, so Tommy Cash, Tommy Cash is still alive,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.480
 he's 79 years old, and his whole career,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.640
 he's been a country music star just like his brother,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.360
 but not quite to the, you haven't heard of him.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.640
 But, and he has other great songs,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.560
 like one is called "My Brother, Johnny Cash,"

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.400
 and another one called "My Mother's Other Son."

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.240
 Oh!

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.720
 So it's because he doesn't really play

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.360
 off the Johnny Cash connection, it sounds like at all.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.040
 No, he's a very, actually I've listened some of his songs,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.720
 it's, they're genuinely really good,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.680
 and he has a lot of songs with,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.080
 I think those ones are done, you know,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.960
 Johnny Cash has a very good sense of humor,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.440
 these were done with a sense of humor as well, I think,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.360
 as far as I can tell.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.000
 Johnny Cash was an amazing guy.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.480
 Yeah, so there's a story about him,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.720
 that he was the first American person

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.960
 to find out that Stalin was dead.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.160
 Yeah, really?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.680
 And it's a, yeah, it's a, it's really repeated error.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.320
 So he worked as a radio operator

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.040
 for the American Air Force between 1950 and 1954,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.680
 yeah, and Stalin died in '53, didn't he?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.560
 Yeah, so, so according to him,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.240
 he claimed he located the signal

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.200
 'cause he was in West Germany at the time, I think,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.000
 when a Soviet bomber was flying from Moscow to small,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.720
 and the news was being transmitted internally in Russia,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.360
 but it hadn't made it outside yet.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360
 Yeah, he didn't.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.520
 But I don't think he did, I think he didn't.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.720
 'Cause another biography pointed out that he didn't speak Russian,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.880
 and it would have been in code,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.680
 and he wouldn't have been able to decipher the code,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.600
 and even if he had been able to decipher it,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.760
 he didn't speak Russian, so.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.640
 He was amazing that Johnny Cash, he had an incredible life.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.760
 He was obviously famous for singing in lots of prisons,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.560
 but he also spent quite a lot of time in prisons himself

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.480
 for doing bad stuff.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.240
 And so one time, there was one time

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.760
 which sounded kind of sweet, where he was jailed,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.600
 and he only ever spent one night in jail.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.000
 It was for stuff like once he broke into some property

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.160
 to pick some flowers, really hardcore stuff like that.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.760
 So he spent one night in a small town jail,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.520
 and the warden who was jailing him said,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.920
 "My wife's a big fan of yours,

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.400
 "and when I went home last night and told her

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.360
 "I had Johnny Cash in my jail, she cried all night."

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.680
 (laughing)

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.880
 Well, he did only spend one night in jail,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.680
 but he did get in a lot of trouble, didn't he?

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.880
 Like, he smuggled drugs over the border,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.160
 that was a big thing that he got in trouble for.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.280
 There was one time when he was driving into the countryside

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.360
 while taking pills, drinking whiskey,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.080
 and swirving all over the road.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.640
 And then he decided to set a fire

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.080
 and set his car on fire, and then set the forest on fire.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.200
 And when they caught him, and they said,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.840
 "Did you start this fire?"

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.720
 He said, "No, no, my truck did, and it's dead,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.200
 "so you can't question it."

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.600
 (laughing)

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.920
 And then they said, "Well, what about these condos?"

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.200
 We had 53 endangered condos here,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.760
 and 49 of them have gone away.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.800
 He said, "I don't care about your yellow buzzards."

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.960
 (laughing)

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.640
 So he killed half that species.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.480
 Yeah.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.040
 The half that there were only about a hundred left at the time,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.880
 and then he killed 49.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.720
 Yeah.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.880
 And the species got down to 27 a few decades later,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.000
 which was principally the fault of Johnny Cash.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.840
 It's crazy.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.680
 (laughing)

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.200
 But the numbers have since recovered, so.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.120
 Now Johnny Cash is dead, they have.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.720
 (laughing)

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.560
 He actually had a really bad relationship with birds,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.280
 so he was addicted to painkillers and pills,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.880
 and had serious problems with that,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.680
 and then he quit them, he claimed,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.480
 because he did it for June, his love of his life,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.680
 and then he fell back into his painkiller addiction,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.000
 after being attacked by an ostrich.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.200
 So it was in the early Aces,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.960
 and he wrote about this in his autobiography, I think,

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.320
 and he said that he had this animal park on his land,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.160
 where he had lots of exotic animals.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
 And he had an ostrich, a pair of ostriches

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.760
 that he'd always got along very well with,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.480
 and then the female died,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.320
 and the male got kind of pissed off.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.280
 And so Johnny Cash was walking through the land one day,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.840
 and the male just went for him,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.240
 and he'd Johnny tried to swipe him with a stick,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.720
 and the ostrich jumped in the air,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.080
 and then came down at him with his big claw,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.400
 and slit his stomach right open.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.400
 So he ended up breaking five ribs,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.360
 and he said that the only thing that saved him

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.080
 was he was wearing a really big belt,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.280
 so the huge ostrich claw couldn't get slit his stomach down.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.720
 He'd be on that belt.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.720
 So then he went to hospital, had to take some painkillers,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.120
 and-- - Back on the drugs.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.840
 - I think there's more to that story than there is.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.040
 I think Johnny Cash killed the female ostrich

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.640
 and was going back for the male.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.800
 (laughing)

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.560
 And the male took vengeance on him.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.120
 - His drug taking was, I mean,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.040
 it was insane the amount that he was doing.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.320
 He always tried to kick it, never fully managed to do it.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.880
 At one point, when he was really into the drugs,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.400
 he released an album called "Bitter Tears."

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.760
 And "Bitter Tears" was actually a very serious album.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.720
 It's sort of the AKA of it is "Ballards of the American Indian."

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.240
 And they were protest songs about how Native Americans

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.760
 were being treated at the time.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.560
 So the sleeve notes say that Johnny Cash sings well

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.840
 these tales of the Indians' woe.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.000
 Johnny is justified in the stand he takes

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.120
 as he is proud of his Cherokee blood.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:15.120
 So he's, Johnny has Cherokee and Mohawk blood in his veins.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.320
 He's said, he doesn't.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.600
 He's in no way Native American.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.440
 - Wow.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.560
 - The drugs made him think he was Native American.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.040
 He told Playboy in an interview.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.080
 He said, "The higher I got, the more Indian blood I thought I had in me."

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.280
 And so, the whole thing was just a drug trip.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.120
 - Wow.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120
 - Yeah, I wasn't really sure about him

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.960
 'cause he's quite, you know, there are some good,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.240
 when you read about it, it's really complicated, isn't it?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.720
 Like, for instance, he once shot a crow

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.040
 but then spent the next two days looking for a vet

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.720
 who could heal it.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.080
 Okay, so it's kind of bent on both sides,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.000
 but then I read one thing which really pushed me over the edge.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.680
 Apparently, he used to drive down golf courses,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.040
 picking up the players' bowls,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.520
 and throwing them into the trees.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.040
 (laughing)

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.600
 And I'm sorry, I could not trust a man who does that.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.640
 - Just speaking of cars, I mean, this gives you another sort of insight

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.880
 into his kind of not empathetic side.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.520
 There was a friend of his who was called Farron Young.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.360
 He was a friend of cashers

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.480
 and he was also a musical contemporary.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.200
 But he died in 1996 and his son said,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.280
 "Can I come to your garden and spread his ashes?"

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.560
 Because this is a place that he loved to come.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.200
 So Johnny said, "Yes, Johnny was out, I think, for the day."

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.360
 Came back and clearly when the ashes were being spread,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.120
 some of them had caught in the wind.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.800
 So Johnny came back and over his windshield of his car

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.120
 were the ashes of his former friend

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.040
 and he just turned the windshield wipers off.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.880
 (laughing)

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.280
 He wiped him off, he wiped his existence off.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.040
 - It's what he would have wanted.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.880
 - That's true.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.240
 - Who knows what he asked for?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.160
 - Just on Johnny Cash and Birds

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.360
 'cause we were just talking about all that.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.200
 Just very quickly.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.400
 - It's all we're talking about.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.520
 (laughing)

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.200
 - He fell out with his record label in the '80s Columbia.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.160
 But they kind of, they had a deal

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.120
 so he had to release some records.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.880
 And so he released a deliberately awful song

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.000
 called Chicken in Black,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.560
 which was all about his brain being transplanted

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.680
 into a chicken.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.640
 (laughing)

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.000
 Sounds amazing.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.520
 - And actually it was quite a success.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.360
 - So really?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.040
 - It's not terrible.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.880
 - Is he listening to it?

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.720
 - I don't know.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.560
 - I think it's nice.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.400
 He's not very good at writing his liberally bad songs.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.440
 - What about this one that I've heard that,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.560
 I don't think he wrote this but he definitely sung it.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.080
 It's called, "I've been flushed from the bathroom

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.640
 "of your heart."

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.560
 (laughing)

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.400
 - Is that good luck?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.880
 - That's great.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.840
 - You know, my, possibly my favorite thing about Johnny Cash

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.520
 is his daughter's name, which is Rosanne

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.800
 and this is his daughter with his first wife, Vivian.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.160
 And daughter's called Rosanne because his name

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.760
 for Vivian's breasts were Rosanne.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.960
 (laughing)

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.720
 Is that a nice thing to carry around with you

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.960
 as a daughter?

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.280
 Who knows?

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.680
 - And we're gonna have to move on soon to our next fact.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.760
 - I can give you a few more country song titles.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.360
 - Just for the fun of it.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.840
 Dropkick me Jesus through the goal posts of life.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.520
 That's a good one.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.720
 Here's quite a famous one.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.840
 You're the reason our kids are ugly.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.160
 (laughing)

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.000
 - Wow.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.640
 - He went to sleep and the hog's at him.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.600
 Now, Claude's gone forever.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.440
 That was by Nathan Nathan.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.760
 And we feed our baby's onions so we can find them in the dark.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.320
 (laughing)

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.960
 Which is more a tip for life, I think, than a song.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.160
 - It's a great tip.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.760
 I like it.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.440
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.040
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.000
 - My fact is that debirs use a giant vacuum cleaner

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.040
 to get diamonds from the bottom of the sea.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.200
 - Wow.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.400
 - This is so cool.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.440
 This fact was actually sent to us by someone on Twitter

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.800
 @grapese81.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.440
 Thank you very much.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.560
 So this is an amazing thing.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.000
 Diamonds on land are running out.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.560
 Most diamond mines are gonna run out in about 2050, we think.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.040
 So now there are these floating mines

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.120
 which bob around off the coast of Namibia, a lot of them.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.080
 And one of them is run by debirs, and it dredges up.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.200
 Huge amounts of stuff from the sea floor sifts it

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.440
 and then returns the stuff to the sea floor

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.880
 but keeps the diamonds.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.360
 And it's hugely profitable.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.800
 - Are the lots of diamonds there?

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.640
 - There are.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.480
 - Wow.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.480
 - That's why they do it.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.320
 (laughing)

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.160
 - Yeah, it makes sense.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.000
 - Yeah.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 (laughing)

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.840
 - So in 2016, mining companies got $600 million

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.960
 worth of diamonds from the sea bed, so this is good.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.400
 But it is a bit of a worry as well.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.640
 This method of getting diamonds

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.880
 because it sucks up a lot of the sea bed.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.840
 It might disturb the life living down there.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.120
 And they do know that the vacuum cleaners they use

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.560
 are big enough to suck up fish and octopuses

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.040
 which go on this massive crazy ride through the system.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.960
 And then they do end up back in the water at the end.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.840
 - And these diamonds are much better

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.360
 or it's much more likely that you're gonna get

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.680
 a really good diamond, right?

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.560
 Because the water is always buffeting these diamonds.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.960
 And so the little rubbish ones kind of get ground away

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.440
 and only the really high quality ones are left.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.800
 (laughing)

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.640
 - Hey.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.480
 - That's why they do it.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.320
 - That's why they're good.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.480
 - Sounds like a spokesperson for Derby's, yeah?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.480
 (laughing)

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.840
 We are sponsored today, bye.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.320
 (laughing)

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.280
 Derby's a pretty extraordinary company.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.040
 They have controlled our view of diamonds

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.080
 for like a hundred years, it's mad.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.320
 So they, until like the late 19th century,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.960
 diamonds were incredibly rare.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.880
 You basically found them

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.840
 if you pick them up on a few riverbeds in India,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.080
 you could scavenge maybe a diamond if you were very lucky

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.560
 or the jungle of Brazil.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.640
 But then in 1870, suddenly we found these,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.960
 well, we started mining in South Africa

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.680
 and it was full of diamonds.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.680
 And the market was suddenly deluged

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.320
 and Derby's who was the British company

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.280
 who was running the market at that time

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.760
 thought well, we can't let the market be deluged

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.360
 because otherwise we'll devalue the price of diamonds.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.720
 And so they've basically been controlling the price.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.280
 They're not even that rare.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.680
 They're not so, lots more than Emeralds Ruby's

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.200
 sapphires, they're all much more rare than diamonds.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.160
 Gold, so if you took all the gold evermind in the world,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.960
 it would be up an elephant.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.040
 (laughing)

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.880
 It would die.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.320
 No, it would be a cube with sides of 20 meters.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320
 Whereas diamonds are fine,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.280
 but Derby's has just had this monopoly on them forever.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.840
 And they created that idea as well

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.960
 of the thing of how much you need to spend

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.080
 on an engagement ring creating the idea

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.840
 of a diamond being a part of an engagement ring.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.320
 So it's something like a month salary, isn't it?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.160
 A month salary.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.440
 I remember someone told me that when I got engaged

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.400
 to my, well, as I was about to propose to my wife,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.280
 that that was the case.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.120
 Terrifying things.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.560
 Well, no, what you do is you just resign your job.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.600
 Yeah, propose using an extremely small ring.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.440
 Yeah.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.320
 And then explain the situation to your now furious fiancee.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.440
 (laughing)

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.280
 I was--

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.120
 And your furious boss, obviously, when you asked your job back.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.800
 The other thing is, if they just decided

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.600
 that they could have pitched it as high as they once

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.960
 it really, couldn't they?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.840
 Yeah, but if they said you have to spend 20 years

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.360
 of your salary on a ring, it's got to pitch it.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.200
 But you can now make diamonds, obviously, artificial diamonds

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.240
 are much more of a thing.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.480
 And there is a Dutch designer who makes diamonds out of smog.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.760
 This is so cool.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.080
 He's got a tower, which sucks in 30,000 cubic meters

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.720
 of polluted air every hour of the day.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.680
 And it cleans it.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.040
 It releases the cleaner, so it's cleaning the air a bit.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.720
 And then it collects a lot of carbon.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.000
 And that carbon is crushed down into a diamond.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.360
 It's not very romantic, though, is it?

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.480
 No, it's not.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.600
 And these synthetic diamonds is a real problem for debirs,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.680
 really, because if you can start making them in a lab,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.520
 which are pretty much almost identical

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.200
 to the ones that you get from the ground,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.720
 eventually it's going to be much cheaper to do it and whatever.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.640
 So they've been really going against this for a long time,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.560
 debirs, but very recently, they've

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.240
 started their own brand called Lightbox, which

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.360
 are the synthetic diamonds.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.040
 But what they're doing is they're calling it

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.720
 affordable, fashion jewellery that may not be forever.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.920
 And there's a suggestion--

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.200
 and I'm not saying this because, of course, we are sponsored,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.480
 but no, we're not sponsored.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.720
 But there's a suggestion that they're making deliberately

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.120
 trashy-looking jewellery with these synthetic things in

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.160
 so that there's a big difference between those ones

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.680
 and the so-called real ones.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.080
 Oh, really?

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.240
 Oh, that's so sneaky.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.800
 But most diamonds are synthetic.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.000
 So I think that only 1.4% of today's diamonds

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.040
 are naturally mine.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.280
 But synthetic diamonds have never been good quality enough

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.440
 until very recently to be used as jewellery.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.040
 But their diamonds are really useful in industry,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.720
 so for cutting and polishing, because they're so hard.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.720
 And so those ones tend to be generated in the lab.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.160
 So yeah, most diamonds don't come out of the ground.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.760
 Swallowing diamonds?

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.600
 What?

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.040
 Sure, let's do it.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.840
 In 2013, there was a charity event where everyone present

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.720
 got a glass of champagne.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.320
 And all the glasses-- I think this is what happened--

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.760
 they had a cubic zirconia in the glass.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.960
 And one glass at the whole event had a diamond in it in the

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.120
 glass, which a local jeweler had donated.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.920
 So the idea is, at the end of the evening, everyone checks

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.240
 their flute, and someone's got the genuine diamond.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.760
 And they get to keep that diamond.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.320
 Cool.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.160
 Unfortunately.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.160
 I think you've given away from your headlight and what happens

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.200
 in the story.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.400
 Unfortunately, the diamond was swallowed by an 80-year-old lady

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.120
 who had failed to notice the actual diamond at the bottom

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.240
 of her flute.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.360
 And her doctor then found it during a colonoscopy.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.720
 But the story has a happy ending, which is that she took it

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.040
 to a jeweler's shop in a biohazard bag.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.640
 And it got cleaned up, but now she's got the diamonds.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.680
 They're enough, of course.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.560
 So you've got to keep it.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.120
 If it's been dragged out of your rectum, then I think you

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.200
 deserve that diamond.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:04.540
 I've got a really good diamond story that I like is that

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.560
 Donald Trump once gave Charlie Sheen a diamond.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.720
 This is very rid of our back.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.560
 So he actually gave him cufflinks that he said were made

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.120
 of platinum and diamond.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.000
 And then so Charlie Sheen took these very grateful blah, blah,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.600
 blah, blah.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.480
 Had them valued up curiosity six months later.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.880
 And he said that the value of literally recoiled from the item.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.440
 And I was like, no, this is the cheapest thing I've ever seen.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.920
 This is made of cheap pewter.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.480
 This is expensive ones.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.920
 Which rectum did you get this from?

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.600
 And then he said this.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.080
 And it turns out that two or three other people, I think,

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.880
 have had exactly the same thing with Trump.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.120
 Oh my god.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.040
 That's amazing.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.520
 In the course of researching this, my favorite diamond

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:49.400
 story that I read was an attempt to bribe Nestle for $25 million

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.680
 I think it was of worth of diamonds.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.080
 So the idea was this guy was going to poison or threaten

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.480
 to poison Nestle's stuff.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.440
 And he said, I won't do it if you give me all these diamonds.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.880
 So Nestle had to work out how do we get out of this.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.080
 And the police were brought in.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.560
 And he said the way he wanted the diamonds delivered to him

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.120
 was he had homing pigeons.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.560
 They were to be attached to that.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.400
 And then there was to be inserted into the homing pigeons.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.200
 Who is this guy?

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.240
 He was from Frankfurt.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.440
 So it was DM $25 million, not dollars.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.160
 Deutsch marks.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.200
 Yeah, Deutsch marks.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.520
 But yeah.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.360
 So he got caught.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.680
 And the reason he got caught is because obviously the homing

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.800
 pigeons were flying to exactly where he was.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.040
 So they just followed the birds, and there he was waiting.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.200
 It's the opposite of the perfect crime.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.040
 I looked into some vacuum cleaners.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.560
 Oh yeah.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.080
 OK.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.600
 A little bit of vacuum cleaner stuff.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.200
 So I found a vacuum cleaner museum in the UK.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.120
 And it sounds great.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.000
 I really want to go.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.560
 It's run by a guy called James Brown.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.480
 But I think a different James Brown.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.800
 And he's amazing.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.960
 He's just really passionate about vacuum cleaners.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.320
 So the museum is a notting him.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.320
 If you're ever in the UK and want to go, he said the age eight.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.640
 He was already a vacuum cleaner fanatic in his mum had one.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.320
 And he really wanted one.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.360
 And he spotted a red goblin 800 lying on a rubbish dump.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.400
 I don't know what that is, but maybe they were famous back then.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.240
 A rubbish dump is a kind of pace where people leave.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.880
 It doesn't matter, go on.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.960
 So he found this red goblin.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.320
 He took it home, wiped the mark off, plugged it in.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.040
 And he says, that was one of the most fantastic moments of my life.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.000
 And his mum apparently was hoping he'd get out of the vacuum cleaner

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.200
 phase, and he didn't.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.960
 And by his teens, he had about 30 vacuum cleaners.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.440
 And he said, you could say vacuum cleaners took over my life.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.600
 One of his-- and so he's still at this museum.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.760
 One of his party tricks, which I would love to enjoy.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.720
 And I don't think we need to hear about this.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.400
 It's not that.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.360
 He just puts on a blindfold, and he waits.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.560
 He puts on a blindfold.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.440
 And you turn on your vacuum cleaner if he's in your house,

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.680
 and he can identify the exact make and model of the vacuum cleaner.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.200
 Oh, cool.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.120
 By the sound alone.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.520
 Yeah, just by the sound.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.160
 Wow, awesome.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.880
 I actually read about him in the telegraph.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.200
 And this was such a weird sentence from the telegraph thing about him.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.280
 It just said James, who was not married,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.640
 sees the real value of his collection as--

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.080
 and then it's completely unrelated to the fact that he's not married.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.040
 So I feel like that needs emphasizing.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.960
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.240
 And that is Chuzinski.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.680
 My fact this week is that if you want to buy a phone app

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.720
 in North Korea, you have to go to a physical app store.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.120
 How on earth does it work?

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.560
 Well, it's quite complex, actually.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.800
 So basically, you can get kind of the specific phones

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.120
 that you're allowed to get, that the state allows you to get in North Korea.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.840
 And they come with just like a card game and a photo app.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.760
 And that's it.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.880
 And if you want anything else, you go to these shops or these kiosks.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.680
 And they're often like sort of appended

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.160
 to a supermarket or something, and you go in.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.040
 And they're covered.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.000
 The walls are covered with posters of different apps

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.120
 that you can ask for.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.080
 So you browse the posters, and you see what you like to look of.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.840
 And then you go up to the counter.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.040
 And you say, I want that, or if they don't have a poster,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.640
 you describe it to the assistant.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.320
 And they say, oh, it sounds like Google Maps might work for you.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:21.800
 Yeah.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.960
 No, they don't allow that, certainly.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.080
 But it's this ridiculously long process.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.120
 So you say the app you want.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.280
 You put the app name on this little slip.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.600
 And then it sent to the cashier.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.560
 And then you have to go to the cashier and pay.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.880
 And then it sent back to the app selector

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.840
 who then has to plug their computer

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.040
 into a big internet system that only they have access to.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.440
 And it's via Bluetooth connection,

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.880
 because it's not via proper internet connection.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.520
 And then they have to download your app.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.000
 It takes about 10 minutes per app.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.680
 So to buy an app, you have to walk to the app

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.480
 or spend 10 minutes in there on this convoluted process.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.240
 Go away.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.160
 And then you've got snake.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.880
 But there's even one further complication.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.320
 They download it onto your phone.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.160
 But then you need to buy an access code to set the thing off.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.840
 So then that takes a further 10 minutes.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.400
 So to get a single app, sometimes can take an hour,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.240
 because you have to wait for the access codes

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.440
 to come through and so on.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.480
 And yeah, it's incredible.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.280
 Big system.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.360
 But it was quite positive the article I read,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.760
 although it was by a guy who works for a tourist agency

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.320
 in North Korea.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.880
 But he was like, we've got access to all sorts of apps.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.720
 They do.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.880
 They've got an interesting internet system.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.600
 Their intranet is called a Kwang Myeong.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.280
 And that means light, apparently,

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.800
 or that sort of a loose translation.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.440
 And it's actually fewer than 200 websites

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.560
 that are run by the government.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.880
 But even so, if something.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.520
 Some apps, some stuff on apps.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.320
 I read an article about the worst apps in history.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.120
 And I think I can't probably agree with you.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.360
 So there's one called Hang Time.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.480
 And it's a game.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.800
 And what you do, you throw your iPhone in the air.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.080
 And then you catch it.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.560
 And the longer it's in the air, the more points you get.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.520
 So it's encouraging you to throw it higher and higher and higher.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.960
 So that's $0.99 for that game.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.440
 And then another $1,000 for the next phone.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.160
 There's another one called Pocket Heat, which is $1.99.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.640
 And what this does is it uses up all of the iPhone's battery.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.920
 It just puts it into overdrive, just making it

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.160
 do loads and loads of work, and makes it go red hot.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.160
 And what they say, it's great, is if you're stuck in the wilderness

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.000
 and it's really cold, then you can use it to warm yourself up.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.280
 But then, of course, how are you going to get in touch with anyone afterwards?

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.600
 Because you've got no battery left.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.880
 Well, if you've got no battery, there's actually a really great app called Die With Me,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.720
 which is you're only allowed to enter the app.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.840
 So it's locked out.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.080
 You're locked out of it until your battery goes to 5% or below.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.440
 And then suddenly you're into this chat room where everyone's phones are dying.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.480
 And you can come visit it together.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.040
 Oh my god, it's like being a palliative care ward.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.480
 Oh, that's morbid.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.520
 Speaking of that, actually, do you remember the old Nokia 3310s?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.760
 Yeah, they're very, very popular.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.600
 There's still a few in this audience who got them.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.320
 There was a woman in Nigeria.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320
 Apparently, this happened.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.520
 It was on social media.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.640
 And they claimed it happened.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.600
 She lost her phone in 2006.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.840
 And then last year, they found it again.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.520
 And it still had one bar of battery left.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.320
 No.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.640
 That's amazing.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.640
 No.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.920
 Sorry, really, that's true.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.480
 And there was a YouTube channel called Creosan that passed a million volts of electricity

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.960
 through a 3310 and it continued to work.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.440
 And they did it to a more modern phone and it just was frazzled immediately.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.400
 Do you know the best selling phone of all time?

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.400
 Is it that one?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.400
 3310.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.400
 It's not the 3310s.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.400
 The 1100, which I think is a previous version.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.680
 So seven of the 10 best selling phones of all time are Nokia phones.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.640
 And yeah, the 11-- yeah, they're great phones.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.600
 And Snake, in fact, was obviously the best game of all time.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.120
 But I realized something about it that I never knew at the time, which is that you could

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.000
 play two players, Snake, with your friend.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.280
 So they had an infrared phone connection thing installed, which is kind of like early Bluetooth,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.200
 I suppose, which no one ever used, I don't think.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.480
 But basically, if you pointed your phone really close through the infrared port, you pointed

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.120
 that infrared port at your mate's infrared port.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.840
 And they were basically touching each other.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.840
 You could then, if you couldn't talk your body around enough, play Snake against that

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840
 friend.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.840
 Yeah.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840
 I've done that.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.840
 I've played that.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840
 What?

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840
 Yeah.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840
 No.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840
 Do you mean against a friend, rather than just the phone?

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.840
 I didn't hear what you said just before.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.840
 I was just saying about a great game of Snake.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840
 Oh.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840
 I love Snake.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.840
 Have you guys heard of the "Yo" app?

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.840
 No.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.840
 "Yo" was an app sensation in 2014.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840
 Was it?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840
 Yeah, it was.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.320
 The only thing you could do with it was send the word "Yo."

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.160
 Yes, I did get that to other users of the app.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.160
 I used that like for about two hours.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160
 Right.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.160
 You can't say anything else.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.880
 If you get sent a "Yo," all you can reply with is "Yo."

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.320
 It raised a million and a half dollars in funding.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.320
 It became the number four app in the US App Store, thanks to people like James.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320
 It was pretty cool.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.320
 It was.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320
 It was pretty cool.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.600
 The man who founded it said this is a stupid app.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.600
 He's so wrong.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600
 He's so wrong.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.280
 He just got a message and it just went, "Yo."

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.280
 What could be better than that?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:38.280
 It's like, you know on Facebook how you can poke people.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.280
 It's like that kind of thing.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.280
 How come I don't remember getting a "Yo" from you?

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.280
 Well, 2014.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.280
 I believe that was before you ever had a smartphone.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:54.280
 For those the early days of the apps, it was the bubble wrap app where you just clicked on bubble wrap.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.280
 When they launched, it was in July 2008.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.280
 In December of that year, there were over 50 different apps purely dedicated to making fart noises.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.280
 That's how quickly we were interested in just having these things.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.280
 There are now more than 1200 of the iTunes star, yeah.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280
 It's pretty depressing, isn't it?

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.280
 We've come this far technologically.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.280
 Look how advanced we are.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.280
 We've shown Newton what we've done.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280
 He's astonished.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.280
 He asked, "What have you done with it?"

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.280
 Well, we've got 1200 for fast apps.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.280
 Wow.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.280
 I like this one.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.280
 There's the quirky Egg Minder Wink app enabled Smart Egg Tray.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:39.280
 This is an egg tray for your fridge, but it has an app which goes with it, which tells you how many eggs you have.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.280
 Cool.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.280
 That's very useful.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.280
 If you're outside the fridge but you don't want to open it.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:54.280
 There is a French calorie counting app called Food Viser, which is for people who are trying to calculate how many calories there are.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:03.280
 You basically show the phone what is on your plate and it tells you an estimate of how many calories are in it.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:12.280
 It's a French app, but when it was released in England, it became repeatedly confused by horrible British food, which had no idea what it was.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:18.280
 It got shown a cornered pasty and said, "Is this a baguette? What is it?"

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:24.280

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.280
 Oh, God.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:08.280
