 Hello and welcome to Little Fish.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.480
 This is the weekly bonus episode where we, James and Ian Dan, step away from the facts

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.720
 that we've been discovering over the last seven days and instead read out your facts.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.880
 That you've been sending into us via podcast@QI.com. We've had so many awesome ones this week,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.680
 so let's get straight into it. Who wants to begin?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.880
 Well, I'll start with one. Let's do it. All right.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.240
 Um...

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.200
 Rosie Watson writes,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.400
 "Found out yesterday that Jeff Bezos' biological dad is one of the two notable unicycle hockey players

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 according to Wikipedia."

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.760
 [laughing]

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 "Unicycle hockey, it's amazing."

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080
 It's a sport? It's an amazing sport.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.080
 Wow.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.760
 "But everyone on the unicycle."

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 "Let me not slip around on my ice."

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.440
 "Day, this is not ice hockey."

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 "All right, because when you said picture a hockey game."

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 "Sorry, okay, picture hockey game."

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 "Yeah."

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
 "Melt all the ice."

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.720
 [laughing]

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.240
 "I've been in a car park or whatever."

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 "Cool."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 "Street hockey."

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 "Field hockey."

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.280
 "Wow, I don't know. It's not grassy, though. It's on tarmac, I suppose."

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.480
 "God, sorry. Anyway, that was this guy called Theodore John Jorgensen."

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.880
 "Is he the other notable one?"

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.760
 "No, this is Jeff Bezos' biological father."

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.720
 So he and Bezos' mom, they split up when Jeff Bezos was a very young baby

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.120
 and he didn't really stay in contact.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.960
 And so Bezos considers this dad to be the, you know, his sort of new father,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 his mom's new partner.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.200
 "But they were in your relationship."

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 "They were."

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 "The wheels fell off."

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 "Oh dear."

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 "They were the wheel."

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 [laughing]

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 "Just one."

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 "But he was the president of the Albuquerque Unicycle Hockey Club."

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 "Wow."

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 "Wow."

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 "Well, it's his first such club."

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 "And..."

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 [laughing]

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 "How many members?"

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 "You just."

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 "There were loads."

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 "Okay."

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 "There were loads."

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 "And it turns out that Unicycle Hockey is a big thing in various countries."

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 "So Germany, at the latest count, has 89 teams, which is genuinely about 85 more than I thought there would be."

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 "Yeah."

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 "And that's quite big."

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 "The real skill is the goalie."

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 "There's only 92 or 93 teams in the English football league."

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 "Exactly."

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 "Yeah."

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 "Why isn't this should be the as big as English football league?"

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 "It should be the English football league."

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 "The goalie just has to go back and forth, the back and forth, the front and the goal."

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 "Oh, that feels cheating to me.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 I feel like, you know, when a bicycle stops at a traffic light and they just have to shimmy."

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 "But the goalie is doing that."

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 "The goalie is doing a little bit of that."

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 "Oh, right."

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 "You know."

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 "And they're still having to defend the goal with a hockey stick."

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 "I mean, it's crazy."

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 "I love it when someone comes up to a traffic light and does that."

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 "And they can't keep it up for long enough and they have to put their foot down."

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 "Yeah."

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 "Because I feel like it's such a failure on their part."

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 "Oh, it's hard."

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 "Yeah, we should do it."

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600
 "I don't do it."

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600
 "Put your feet down like a noble person."

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 "I fully dismount."

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 "Really?"

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 "Yeah."

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 "I fully dismount."

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 "And I just wait patiently."

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 "Just sit on my cards, bonnet, having a ciggy."

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 "Anyway, it's like anyone over the age of 12 cycling with no hands.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 It just really makes me laugh whenever I see it.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 I just imagine them in their head, they're thinking, "Ooh, look at me, I'm doing it with no hands."

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 "Like you did when you were 12, like."

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 "I'm still impressed by no hands.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 I've got to say, I sort of kid in Edinburgh this year who was riding a bicycle on the road.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 And everyone was looking at him.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 And as he passed me, I was on the pedestrian side of the main Princess Street."

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.600
 "Oh, he grabbed your phone."

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 "No, I'm sorry, mate.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 It's happened to the best of us."

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 "It's even better."

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 "As he went by, he went, "Welcome to Scotland!"

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 "Really loud, disappeared.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 And then behind him on the road, wearing a giant Deliveroo box backpack,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 was the guy who's biky just all in, who was a Deliveroo rider."

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 "Oh, no."

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
 "Chasing off him down the road, it was so hollywood, it was incredible."

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 "It was so hollyrood."

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 "Holyrood."

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 "Yeah."

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 "I saw it, no, I fluffed that joke."

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 "It was such a solid one."

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600
 "You went to the edit."

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 "So I do one?"

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 "Yeah."

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 "This is from paleontologist Thomas Halliday, who I briefly met at a party."

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 "Oh, sorry, that was my briefing notes."

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600
 "You didn't meet him at a party day."

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 "I thought I did recognize the name."

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 "But hang on, we've had a letter from Thomas Halliday in one of our jewels,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 one of our drop us a line episodes, yes."

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 "But he included such good stuff."

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.600
 "Are you just getting your mates to write in, Andy?"

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.600
 "I say this in the nicest possible way, he's not my mate."

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 "But we met once, and he was a really nice guy, and he sent a great email."

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600
 "Great author."

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
 "Yeah."

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 "Other lands he wrote, it was like a waterstone's book of the year, it was yours."

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600
 "Yeah, so he's down there."

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 "I'm never bad in my, I love his stuff."

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.600
 "Okay, well, Tommy H says, you are genetically descended from only about half of your ancestors

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.600
 that were alive 250 years ago."

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 "Oh, piss off Thomas!"

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
 "What a twat!"

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 "Whoa!"

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 "Oh, joking, I was playing against the whole liking him as a buddy."

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 "That's funny, because I get to cut out all the first bits."

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 "This is going to sound like..."

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 "That's very cool."

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 "What does he mean?"

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600
 "What does Thomas mean?"

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 "Actually, we've come across this on QI, James Ross and our good friend and colleague found this

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.600
 as well, and I've literally just written it up for the X series of QI, which will be on your

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 TV's in about 18 months."

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.600
 "So, send your calendars."

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 "Yeah, but basically what it is is your 50% DNA from each parent."

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 "Yeah, right."

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.100
 "But the DNA comes in chunks, so if you get 50% from your mum, what if all of that 50% was

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.100
 what she got from her mum?"

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.100
 "In that case, you got nothing from her dad."

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.100
 "Okay."

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.100
 "And that's possible."

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.100
 "Wow."

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.100
 "So the way I like to look at it is imagine like playing cards, right?"

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.100
 "So your mum might have hearts and diamonds, and your dad might have spades and clubs."

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.100
 "Yeah."

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.100
 "But you might get all of the hearts from your mum and all of the clubs from your dad, in which

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.100
 case the parent who gave them the spades and the diamonds wouldn't give you anything."

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.600
 "And what you're saying is, that's obviously possible, but unlikely, that's two generations

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600
 up."

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.100
 "That is absolutely completely impossible, really, like it wouldn't happen because of the statistics."

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.100
 "But when you go far enough back, actually, it's not just possible, it's certain."

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.100
 "I would say."

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.100
 "Frazy."

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:25.100
 "And according to Thomas, he reckons that the tipping point of 50% is 10 generations."

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:33.300
 "Now for QI, I did the maths for this as well, and I reckon after 15 generations, you're extremely

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.100
 likely to have at least one ancestor who's completely genetically distinct from you."

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.660
 "So Thomas is doing like the 50% chance, I'm saying after 15 generations, one of your ancestors

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.100
 will not be related to you genetically."

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.100
 "Doesn't that mean problems with genealogy and tests?"

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.300
 "I don't think, when it's that far back, someone's going to be hearing the words, I'm sorry,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.100
 but you're not the great, great, great, great grandfather."

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.100
 "It's Jeremy Kyle meets who do you think you are, who do you think you aren't?"

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.100
 "She's not your aunt."

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.100
 "Oh, superb, what a fact."

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.620
 "Yeah, it's brilliant, it's really interesting, and it really blows your mind when you start

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.100
 trying to do the maths and stuff, but yeah, it's a great, great fact, I think."

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.100
 "Should I jump in with one?"

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.100
 "This is from Felicia Vinterhoek, and it's sort of similar to a fact that we got sent in

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.460
 from the last episode about relocating an entire thing.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.100
 We were talking about how a full village was middle way."

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.100
 "A village in Oxygen, yeah."

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:40.860
 "So same thing happened this year in north of Sweden in a town called Caruna, where they

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:49.540
 took literally the entire church, the Caruna Church, and they rolled it to a new destination,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:55.500
 three kilometres to the east, and they've done that because Caruna is like a mining town,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.500
 and so the stabilization underneath them, because they've taken up so much from underneath

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.540
 the ground was getting a bit unsettling for us."

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.540
 "It's like subsidence and stuff."

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.540
 "Thanks, so yeah, and so they decided, okay, that they're going to move it."

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:17.540
 "I wonder if that's Horusum sort of went off a cliff when Caruna virus came out in 2020."

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.540
 "You know what, Andy, when you put your head in your hands like that, it really discourages

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.540
 me from doing this."

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.540
 "Well that's why I'm doing a check."

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.540
 "Hey, I've got one."

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.540
 "Yeah, I got for it."

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.540
 "From Louise Drake.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.540
 Pleasingly, Louise Drake from Lewis."

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.700
 "Actually, this is about a place I've been to very excitingly, a place called Baselden Park,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.700
 which is a national trust place, and it's a lovely old house, gorgeous grounds and all

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:49.700
 that, and it was where the 2005 Pride and Prejudice, which is the one with Kira Knightly in,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.700
 was filmed in part, right?"

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.700
 "Lovely."

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700
 "So when they were filming it, they filmed a ball scene there.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.060
 I just didn't find it so funny.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.700
 The scale of the ball scene was so large that they put some of the national trust."

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.700
 "Are you laughing at the same ball scene?"

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.700
 "I don't like it."

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.780
 "In my head, because I don't live in that Jane Austen world like you do, and like to

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.700
 me, ball scene, I was thinking like a ball pool, like kids."

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.700
 "No, that's it.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.700
 It's a very modern adaptation of the story, but it's all, yeah, yeah."

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.700
 "Oh, no, Mr. Darcy's weed and macarna."

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.700
 "He dives into the ball pit, and then he comes out with that as shirt on, it's very sexy."

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.700
 "It's incredible.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.700
 I didn't know I did."

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.700
 "So all Jane Austen is set in soft play."

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.700
 "Wow."

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.180
 "No, so they filmed this ball-room scene.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.260
 The scale of the ball scene was so large," right, Louise, that they put some of the

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.740
 national trust conservation staff in costume as supporting artists so they could keep

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.660
 a closer eye on things without looking out of place on camera.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.420
 "Oh, I presume that's just so they don't break any of the price to start effects around

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.420
 the edge of the room."

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420
 "I just find that so funny."

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.420
 "Yeah."

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.740
 "So if you watch that scene, there'll be some people there who are just national trust

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.740
 artists that, like, please look after this vase."

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.740
 "Don't touch that!"

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.740
 "Yeah."

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.740
 "That's really funny."

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.700
 "And then I looked into this place, Basil and Park, right?"

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.700
 "Mids, 18th century."

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.700
 "Yeah."

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.700
 "It's, they do a fair bit of film in there."

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.700
 "Yes, they film lots of stuff there."

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.700
 "Yeah, I think I know the one, yeah."

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.700
 "And basically, this is a bit of gossip from the 18th and 19th centuries."

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.660
 "Which is pretty heart gossip for us, man."

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.660
 "Yeah."

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.660
 "It was bought by this guy called Francis Sykes, right?"

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.100
 "And I looked him up and he sounds like an absolute rosser."

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.540
 "Astonishingly, someone who built a really, really big house then had not made all of their

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.420
 money entirely pleasantly."

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.420
 "Yeah."

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.580
 "He was an East India company guy and lots of bribes and insider trading and private

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.580
 investment.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.860
 I mean, just all sorts of, all sorts of dreadful practice went on basically and he made a huge

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.660
 amount of money he spent on this house."

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:47.060
 "But the really spicy gossip is about the third baronette site, so I imagine his grandson

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.420
 who inherited the estate age five, right?

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.580
 So, you know, he's grown into a giant bobhead."

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.020
 "And he married this woman called Henrietta Vilbois, who was very wealthy, he was marrying

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.900
 for wealthy, you know, sort of like, dynastic marriage, whatever.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.420
 They both had lots of affairs.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.620
 She hadn't affair with Benjamin Disraeli."

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.620
 "Oh wow."

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.620
 "I know."

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.620
 "What a cameo."

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.620
 "What a cameo."

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.620
 "Who then?"

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.880
 He wrote a book called Henrietta Temple, which was all about having a secret affair with

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.860
 the married woman, which I would say is not a very good way of, if you're putting her

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.060
 first name in the title of the book, okay fine, whatever.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.380
 But she had this other affair with a painter called Daniel McLeese, McLeese, who was friends

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.460
 with Charles Dickens.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.340
 And when the husband, Sykes, the rotter, found out about this, he put a notice in the

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:35.500
 newspaper, saying, "Whereas Henrietta Sykes, the wife of me, Sir Francis Sykes, Baronette,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.940
 have committed adultery with Daniel McLeese."

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.540
 This is in the newspapers, putting this down here, with whom she was found in bed at my house.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.020
 And then he gives us a dress.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.060
 On the 4th of July 1837, this is to give notice that hereafter I shall not be answerable

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.540
 for any debts she may contract or any goods which may be supplied to her.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.260
 "What a scoundrel.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.740
 This is like the 19th century.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.740
 It was Rebecca Vardi."

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.940
 Exactly that.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.140
 And you remember who I said McLeese was friends with?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.140
 Charles Dickens.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.380
 What's the surname of this Baronette?

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.500
 Sykes, Bill Sykes, Sykes, but also Bill Sykes, Bill Sykes, Bill Sykes is from Francis

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.500
 Sykes.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.500
 Yeah.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.500
 It's a direct takeoff.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.380
 And it's so everyone knows, this guy Francis Sykes is a worm.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.380
 Yeah.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.420
 That's amazing.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:28.540
 Kate Moore writes, "Mountain beavers are the most primitive rodents and also host to the

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.020
 world's largest flea.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.140
 They also neither live in the mountains nor are they a beaver."

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.140
 Mountain beavers.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.140
 Mountain beavers.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.060
 They're a type of rodent.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.660
 All the world's most primitive rodent I hear.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.660
 Oh yes.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.660
 Yeah, they are.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.660
 Wow.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.660
 That is real.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660
 Because like rodent is not a moment good association.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.980
 But to be the world's most primitive rodent, that's a double whammy.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.420
 That's bad.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.220
 The flea can get around 10mm, so about a centimeter.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.300
 It's a farthest, yeah.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.900
 But beavers have smaller faces than you, like mountain beavers, especially.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.140
 They have quite thin faces.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:12.780
 And so if you had a flea that was comparatively the same size, it would cover your whole eye.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.780
 Oh yeah.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.700
 One flea covering your own eye.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.700
 Two fleas.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.700
 Both eyes.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.700
 Both eyes.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700
 Yeah.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.700
 Poor benign mountain beaver.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.700
 Yeah.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.700
 Yeah.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.700
 Actually, it's only the females who get that big.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.220
 The males are about half that size.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.420
 And actually you get much smaller ones.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.220
 This is like a big hefty flea.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.220
 Yeah.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.220
 I wouldn't like that at all.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.220
 I wouldn't like a tall to have a flea covering my whole eye.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.220
 No.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.220
 That's crazy out there, thought.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.220
 Yeah.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.220
 Can I do one?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.220
 Yeah.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.220
 Please.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.260
 Jesse Quick writes, "It seems almost too ordinary to be true because we've all tried

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.260
 this once.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.820
 You know, the world record for most melons chopped in half on somebody's stomach with a samurai

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:54.860
 sword while they lay on a bed of nails was set by a man named Johnny Strange.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860
 Oh.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.860
 He's famous, isn't he?

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.860
 Johnny Strange.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.860
 He is.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.860
 He's got multiple Guinness.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.860
 Well, that's quite the man.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.860
 Is this real name?

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.860
 Dracan.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.860
 No, he's actually called Luke.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.860
 Strange.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.460
 Well, Strange is a surname, right?

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.260
 I've heard people with that surname, but then also, conceivably, you would make it up.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.260
 Yeah.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.700
 Like Johnny Strange sideshow.co.uk, I think it's a might, I might be a stage name.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.100
 It's an incredible website.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.500
 So he sliced 10 watermelons in 30 seconds on his glamorous partner's tummy and she's on

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.940
 a bed of nails and watermelons to bask in.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.940
 There's no board.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.940
 There's no board.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.940
 Yeah.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.940
 There's no board.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.940
 She's the board.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.980
 And then this watermelon record is big.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.380
 I think she deserves the credit for that.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.500
 Well, I know what you mean because he's broken a lot of records and she's involved in

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.500
 some of them.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.820
 So he's broken record for most apples held in one's own mouth and chainsawed out of it in

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.820
 one minute.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.620
 That sounds like you've got a load of apples in your mouth.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.540
 And like, let's say you have somehow got five apples in your mouth and the only way to

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.940
 get them out is to chainsaw your face so that they fall out.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.940
 Sorry.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.700
 He's biting an apple, which is mostly sticking out of his mouth and he's getting rid of

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.900
 it by chainsawing across it.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.100
 He chainsaws across the apple.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.100
 Okay.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.340
 So you need someone with a small nose.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.340
 You do.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340
 That's a really good point.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.260
 He did eight apples out of his own mouth, but when his glamorous partner was holding the

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.060
 apples in her mouth, he did 12 in 60 seconds.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.580
 That's a hardly surprising that it's easier to do it out of someone else's mouth than

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.580
 your own mouth.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.580
 Yeah.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.580
 You reckon?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.580
 Yeah.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.580
 Okay.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.580
 Fair enough.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.580
 All right.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.580
 He's done heaviest weight pulled by pierced ears.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.580
 Uh-huh.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.580
 It's pulled a small plane.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.580
 Was it his ears or his partner's ears?

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
 Was it his ears?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.940
 Um, and I love this.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.680
 He's done sword swallowing inside the globe of death.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.160
 You know that cage where they ride a motorbike round the inside.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.160
 Oh, I saw him.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160
 That was quite recently.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160
 I saw him.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160
 I went to zippo circus later.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 Strangely.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160
 Did you?

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160
 Yeah.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160
 Oh, you were, you were the guy with the trousers falling down.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.160
 I'm glad I wasn't you.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160
 You were the glamorous assistant.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 But it's so exciting when they bring out that globe of death and they cycle motorbike

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160
 round the inside of it.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.760
 He was standing in the middle of it, swallowing the sword while someone was riding a motorbike

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.760
 around his head.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.760
 Right.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.760
 Really cool.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.760
 Yeah.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760
 I mean, very dangerous.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.400
 I don't know if we can jump into another here from Shona Mack, which is also Guinness World

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.360
 Record, which is the world's oldest continuously operating post office is in the small town of

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.160
 Sankar in southwest Scotland.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.920
 The post office has been operating on that site since it was established as a staging post

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.920
 in 1712.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.920
 Pretty good going.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920
 Really good.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.920
 That's cool.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.920
 That's very good.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920
 I would have had the post office start in a bit later than that.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920
 What was Roland Hill?

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.920
 I thought he was like.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.040
 And it's actually the penny post, yeah, but maybe they just were very quite a hundred years

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.640
 before this is a long queue.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.960
 Here is one from Richard Galt.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.520
 When board work last week, I came across a pamphlet from about 1970 preparing the company

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.720
 for metrication.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.520
 So when we're going to go to the metric, the pounds and the vents and all that kind of

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.520
 stuff.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.480
 Anyway, it contained a fact.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.160
 And that is that the SI units that we used today are based on the kilogram, the meter and

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160
 the second.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.640
 And that's a bit messy because kilogram is already a thousand of something.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.160
 So kilometer, you've got the basic thing which is the meter and then you add the kilo on.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.520
 But the kilogram is already a kilo.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.560
 Really it should be the gram or we should change the name of the kilogram.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:33.520
 And indeed in 1970, the standardization committee, the ISO, was planning to change a kilogram and

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.920
 give it a different name.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.440
 And one option was to rename it the Einstein.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.120
 And if they'd have ended up doing that, it would have meant that Einstein himself weighed

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:49.760
 about 79 Einstein's, which is a good fact, apart from the fact that Richard I think means

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.920
 mass, not weight because masses and kilograms, or would have been Einstein's, whereas we measure

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.280
 weight in newtons.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.880
 And newtons is kilograms multiplied by the gravitational pull of the earth.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:12.440
 And Isaac Newton's weight would have been according to my calculation, around 686 newtons.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440
 Lovely.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.080
 And that the, your basic metabolic rate, so the amount that you create energy means that

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.600
 James Watts created about 100 watts of power.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.480
 Humans have no charge, but we do have a lot of electrons.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.640
 And the electrons in the body of Charles Augustine de Coulomb would have been minus 9 billion

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.440
 Coulomb's.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.320
 And if he was wearing high heels, Blaze Pascal would have asserted 5 million Pascal's

00:18:39.320 --> 00:19:09.000
 pressure on the floor.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.080
 But Harry knows how to sell a fact, I mean, that's really good.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:21.960
 So until 2020, only the, I'm sorry for my pronunciation here, the arm helmet was known.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:29.600
 The arm helmet was found in the 1950s, admittedly, but it wasn't authenticated until 2020.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.720
 So there you go.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.840
 That is the doubling of the Viking helmets.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.680
 And Harry adds an additional three fragments are known, largely eyebrow pieces, but none of them

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.920
 has horns.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.920
 Okay.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920
 So, yeah.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.920
 Very cool.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.400
 Yeah, you do get horned helmets, but they're pre-viking.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.800
 So yeah, you get like from Scandinavia, you definitely get horned helmets, but by the time

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.000
 the Vikings came in, they didn't have horns anymore.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.760
 And our thought of the horned helmets comes from Wagner basically.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.760
 I had no idea.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.240
 I thought there were never any horned helmets.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.080
 No, they do exist for sure.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.760
 Oh, I think one day we'll find some Viking ones I genuinely do, but what year will that

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760
 be?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.400
 On current evidence, behave as a way.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.800
 Well, no, if it doubled this year, then next year they'll be four, the year after they'll

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.800
 be eight.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800
 Okay.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.600
 Well, that's it for all of your facts.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.840
 Before we wrap up though, we have something very important to do, which is to announce the

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.200
 latest custodians from the fish archive, each person who joins the friend of the podcast

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:37.160
 here in club fish gets to become the champion, the effective owner of a fact from our 600 episodes.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.560
 And so today we are going to be handing some out and he won't we begin with you?

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.560
 Yeah.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.560
 All right.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.320
 Here's a fact that is now under the stewardship of Hollis.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.560
 It's this.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.200
 Some rats were once the size of hippos and weighed two tons.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.040
 Well, I would say a vintage, a vintage fish fact.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040
 It is.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.000
 It's about animals being an amusing size.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Yeah.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.080
 I remember we talked about whether they made a weird noise as they got bigger and smaller

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.080
 going.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080
 Do you remember that?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.400
 Which is the same as the weird noise that a hippo makes when it retracts its testicles

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 into its body.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 Yeah.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400
 Yeah.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400
 It's all flooding back.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 It's all flooding back.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400
 Yeah.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400
 That's very good.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400
 That's great.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400
 That's great fact.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 Yep.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.040
 This is a fact and then that goes to Matt.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:27.280
 This was one of my facts, which was during his 27 year rule, Pope John Paul II took over

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.200
 a hundred skiing and mountain climbing holidays.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.200
 A funny image.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200
 Yeah.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.840
 Seeing the Pope my meal on those slopes?

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840
 Well, yeah.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840
 Yeah.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840
 Not quite.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840
 But yeah.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.080
 What he used to do, though, was sneak out of the Vatican.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.520
 I seem to remember we spoke about it in a sort of like almost the beginning of like a Beatles

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.320
 movie where they have to wear false moustaches and hide behind newspapers would cut out holes

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.840
 for their eyes to look through.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.240
 Like he was smuggled out of the Vatican so that he could get privacy and that he could

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240
 go on the skiing holiday.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.880
 Surely it's incredibly easy if you're the Pope to be spotted out of the Vatican.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.080
 You just take off the papal regalia, which is what most people are looking at.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.840
 Did we say this at the time, like just go out as an old Italian man?

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.840
 Yes.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.840
 Is the like no one more better than Ireland?

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840
 Absolutely true.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.520
 Do you know Reckon, if there were 10 elderly Italian men in this room, does he Italian the

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.520
 new one?

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520
 I think the new one's American.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:23.160
 So 10 elderly Italian American men in this room standing in a line, do you reckon you'd

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.400
 be able to pick out the Pope?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400
 No, shoot me now.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400
 I just couldn't do it.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.240
 Do you not think he has some kind of blow, like a halo?

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240
 Oh.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240
 I forgot the glow.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.000
 Do you not think he emanates holiness?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Yes, you're right.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Yeah.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So you'd have to have a heavy, heavy coat to cover his papal aura.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Yeah.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.120
 No, I just, I honestly, I would not recognise the Pope in a non-papal setting.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120
 Very interesting.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120
 Yeah.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.120
 I could be standing next to one of the urinal and just not know that it was the Pope.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.640
 But do you not think his penis has like an ethereal blow?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.400
 I think James, you've been excommunicated ones. What are you doing?

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.400
 OK.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.640
 This is an ex-fact.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:07.520
 This one will be forever loved, petted and fed by Rebecca Lovett.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.960
 And her fact is that in 1900, a quarter of the residents of New York City would move house

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.920
 every May the 1st at 9am.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.320
 Brilliant fact.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.440
 Another vintage one, I'd say.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440
 That was one of yours, James.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.480
 It was one of mine, yeah.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.960
 I remember the details.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.960
 What was the reasoning for it?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.400
 I mean, it's a long fact that all the details are in the facts, but why?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400
 They are.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.400
 It was just that everyone's rent would run out on that date, and that's just, to be honest,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.560
 the answer was really that it was just so, that was the way they did it, and they didn't

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.040
 really know any different.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.280
 It was Mayhem, wasn't it?

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.720
 You couldn't get a moving removal firm for Love or Money because they were all booked.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720
 It's really low, though.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.560
 It must have been tough to be a removal firm, because the rest of the year you just twiddling

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.560
 your thumbs up.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.560
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.040
 That's where you make all your money, and then you just hang out for the rest of the year.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040
 Oh, that's nice.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040
 Like Santa.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040
 Yeah.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040
 Exactly just like Santa.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.280
 It's all that money, one back in the year.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.280
 Andy, let's go on from here.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280
 OK.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.800
 This fact is now going to be stuffed mounted and put on the wall of Steffen Low Camp.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.800
 There's one of my facts, actually, is that nobody knows why we kiss.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800
 Is that still true?

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.120
 11 years later?

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.880
 I think people do it because it's nice.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.360
 Well, I think no one knows that for sure scientifically, I may as well.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.000
 I can say because the X series of QI will be filmed in the spring and will go out in about

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.160
 18 months, but I'm writing it right now.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:37.040
 And we have a question on kisses because of XOXO kind of thing.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.840
 And according to my research, we still don't definitively know where kissing came from.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.840
 Yeah.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840
 As a cultural practice.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.840
 Yeah.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.880
 Is it from sort of mothers chewing up food in their mouth and feeding it to their babies?

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.800
 Which is one main theory, isn't it?

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.000
 And so you evolve to feel that smashing your lips against someone else's lips is nice.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Yeah.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 No one likes thinking about that as the origin of kissing because it's a bit weird.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Yeah.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 I think that that's what causes this very--

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.440
 The first human who ever kissed another human was kissing their own mum on the lips.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440
 Yeah.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.440
 So we don't like that theory.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440
 No.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440
 Yeah.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440
 But I think it's true.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.440
 Yeah.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:23.880
 I mean, Dan, your mum's sexy.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.400
 Not a great kisser though, weirdly.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400
 Oh no.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.400
 I'm just fine, isn't it?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.400
 But like, come on.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400
 Why the only one with a tongue?

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400
 Like what's going on?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.400
 James.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:43.600
 Honestly, I thought I'd gone too far with the hope of the urinal, but--

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.240
 OK, here's a fact.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.280
 Some years ago, a Belgian man had surgery to make himself look more like Michael Jackson.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.280
 OK.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.280
 Wow.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.280
 OK, interesting.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.640
 I wonder what Michael Jackson's status was when we did that fact.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640
 20.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.440
 I think it's still pretty bad.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440
 Yeah.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.120
 Well, that was his life to sell them.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:15.200
 That fact is now under the custodian ship of Nick with no C N I K. Nick.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.560
 You will have to look after that fact as if it was a member of your own family.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.160
 That was from Mark Abrams, by the way.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.800
 The founder of the Ig Nobel Prize.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.480
 You and I saw very recently.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.000
 We did indeed.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.800
 He came into this very room.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.560
 Yeah.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.600
 He was in town.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.920
 And this is interesting, because this is an episode where, once again, there were only two

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.760
 members of fish on it, which is something we really rarely do.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.120
 But in the early days we did, I was away.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120
 And so was Anna.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.000
 So in our place was Mark Abrams.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.440
 And then, also in our place, was Molly Oldfield, one of the original QILs.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.600
 And her fact was the longest Viking longship ever found was discovered during renovations

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.240
 of Longship Museum.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.760
 So that basically found the Viking ship underneath the Viking ship museum, as they were

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.480
 just getting ready to expand it.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.480
 That's brilliant.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.120
 That fact is going to now belong to Simon Mattelján.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120
 Congratulations.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.120
 Yeah.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120
 Be proud.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120
 It's a great fact.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.120
 Where do you put that, though?

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120
 You've got to build another museum now.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
 Nightmare.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120
 Yeah.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120
 Exactly.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120
 And then you just keep discovering more and more.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120
 Theological treasures.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120
 Where do you stop?

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.120
 Do you know?

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120
 All right.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.120
 When we get another fact, all right.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.120
 Let's go to you, Andy.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.120
 All right.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.560
 This fact is for Michael Boulter.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.960
 And it's that the tobacco horn worm uses very bad halitosis to stop predators eating it.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.760
 Well, so you just got really dreadful breath.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760
 And predators smell that.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760
 No, no, no, no.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760
 That's interesting.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.760
 So previous episode of Little Fish at the End, your fact that you gave out was to do also

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.800
 with a small insect that was being eaten.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.800
 The spiders, the grass spiders.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800
 Yeah.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800
 I think amusing animals.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.400
 That was your thing in the early days.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400
 Stock and trade.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400
 Yeah.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.000
 We used to say it wasn't a proper episode of fish without an animal fact.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Yeah.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 And what's that?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.360
 I think we've outgrown it.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.880
 And we did all the animals.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.440
 We've done 400 animals.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.440
 We've done 600 episodes.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.440
 Do the maths.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.560
 We've got 400 animals at the back.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.440
 But honestly, with a gun to your head, how many could you name?

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440
 400 is topi.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440
 You know that.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440
 That's very ambitious.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440
 No, you're right.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.720
 Attenborough's really stretched that career out, hasn't he?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.760
 Once you'd, oh, giraffe's again.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.960
 But once you do the big mammals, and then the small mammals, and then, I mean, how many insects

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960
 can we name?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.600
 Cricket, locust, grass, opera, ant.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.440
 Crickets and locusts are the same animal.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440
 What?

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.000
 I mean, I'm nine.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.800
 OK.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.720
 Let's do one more before we wrap up.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.920
 So this fact is, you could have fallen asleep up to five times during this podcast and not

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.440
 known it.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.760
 This was about the fact that everyone does little micro sleeps during the day.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.160
 And that fact now belongs to Matthew Renner.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.480
 So Matthew, I really hope you enjoy that fact being part of your life.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.000
 Yeah, sweet dreams.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.920
 And we've ascertained, like, since 11 years ago now,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.000
 I think it turns out almost half our audience are using us as a sleep aide.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.240
 Imagine if Matthew accidentally took his micro nap as you read out his facts and his name.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.640
 And he's going to be listening for all these episodes, going, oh, surely, I'll be on

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640
 this week's episode.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640
 Come on.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640
 Yeah.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640
 Where's my fact?

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640
 Oh, well.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640
 Hey, listen, we do need to wrap up.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.280
 If you want to be a custodian of one of our facts from the archive, all you need to do is

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.160
 join Club Fish at our top tier level, which is friend of the podcast.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.240
 We're going to be reading out more and more of these as the weeks go on with this new

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240
 little fish show.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240
 We hope you're enjoying it.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.560
 Come back again next week.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.520
 Stay tuned for our Friday episode.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.440
 And of course, if you are a Club Fish member, you're going to get dual droppers of line.

 We're going to be reading out more and more emails, so send some in there, podcast@qy.com.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600
 We'll see you next week.
