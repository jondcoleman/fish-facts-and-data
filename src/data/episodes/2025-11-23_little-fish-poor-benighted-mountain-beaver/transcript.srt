 Hello and welcome to Little Fish.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,480
 This is the weekly bonus episode where we, James and Ian Dan, step away from the facts

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,720
 that we've been discovering over the last seven days and instead read out your facts.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,880
 That you've been sending into us via podcast@QI.com. We've had so many awesome ones this week,

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
 so let's get straight into it. Who wants to begin?

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,880
 Well, I'll start with one. Let's do it. All right.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,240
 Um...

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,200
 Rosie Watson writes,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,400
 "Found out yesterday that Jeff Bezos' biological dad is one of the two notable unicycle hockey players

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
 according to Wikipedia."

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,760
 [laughing]

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,320
 "Unicycle hockey, it's amazing."

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,080
 It's a sport? It's an amazing sport.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
 Wow.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,760
 "But everyone on the unicycle."

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,760
 "Let me not slip around on my ice."

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,440
 "Day, this is not ice hockey."

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,440
 "All right, because when you said picture a hockey game."

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
 "Sorry, okay, picture hockey game."

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
 "Yeah."

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
 "Melt all the ice."

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,720
 [laughing]

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,240
 "I've been in a car park or whatever."

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 "Cool."

28
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
 "Street hockey."

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 "Field hockey."

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,280
 "Wow, I don't know. It's not grassy, though. It's on tarmac, I suppose."

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,480
 "God, sorry. Anyway, that was this guy called Theodore John Jorgensen."

32
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,880
 "Is he the other notable one?"

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,760
 "No, this is Jeff Bezos' biological father."

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,720
 So he and Bezos' mom, they split up when Jeff Bezos was a very young baby

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,120
 and he didn't really stay in contact.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,960
 And so Bezos considers this dad to be the, you know, his sort of new father,

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
 his mom's new partner.

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,200
 "But they were in your relationship."

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
 "They were."

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 "The wheels fell off."

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
 "Oh dear."

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 "They were the wheel."

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 [laughing]

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
 "Just one."

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,600
 "But he was the president of the Albuquerque Unicycle Hockey Club."

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 "Wow."

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
 "Wow."

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
 "Well, it's his first such club."

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 "And..."

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
 [laughing]

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 "How many members?"

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
 "You just."

53
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 "There were loads."

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 "Okay."

55
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
 "There were loads."

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 "And it turns out that Unicycle Hockey is a big thing in various countries."

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 "So Germany, at the latest count, has 89 teams, which is genuinely about 85 more than I thought there would be."

58
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 "Yeah."

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
 "And that's quite big."

60
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 "The real skill is the goalie."

61
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 "There's only 92 or 93 teams in the English football league."

62
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 "Exactly."

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 "Yeah."

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 "Why isn't this should be the as big as English football league?"

65
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 "It should be the English football league."

66
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
 "The goalie just has to go back and forth, the back and forth, the front and the goal."

67
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 "Oh, that feels cheating to me.

68
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 I feel like, you know, when a bicycle stops at a traffic light and they just have to shimmy."

69
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 "But the goalie is doing that."

70
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 "The goalie is doing a little bit of that."

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 "Oh, right."

72
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
 "You know."

73
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
 "And they're still having to defend the goal with a hockey stick."

74
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
 "I mean, it's crazy."

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
 "I love it when someone comes up to a traffic light and does that."

76
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 "And they can't keep it up for long enough and they have to put their foot down."

77
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
 "Yeah."

78
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 "Because I feel like it's such a failure on their part."

79
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 "Oh, it's hard."

80
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
 "Yeah, we should do it."

81
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
 "I don't do it."

82
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
 "Put your feet down like a noble person."

83
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 "I fully dismount."

84
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 "Really?"

85
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 "Yeah."

86
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 "I fully dismount."

87
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 "And I just wait patiently."

88
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 "Just sit on my cards, bonnet, having a ciggy."

89
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:08,600
 "Anyway, it's like anyone over the age of 12 cycling with no hands.

90
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 It just really makes me laugh whenever I see it.

91
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,600
 I just imagine them in their head, they're thinking, "Ooh, look at me, I'm doing it with no hands."

92
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 "Like you did when you were 12, like."

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 "I'm still impressed by no hands.

94
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 I've got to say, I sort of kid in Edinburgh this year who was riding a bicycle on the road.

95
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 And everyone was looking at him.

96
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 And as he passed me, I was on the pedestrian side of the main Princess Street."

97
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 "Oh, he grabbed your phone."

98
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 "No, I'm sorry, mate.

99
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 It's happened to the best of us."

100
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 "It's even better."

101
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 "As he went by, he went, "Welcome to Scotland!"

102
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 "Really loud, disappeared.

103
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
 And then behind him on the road, wearing a giant Deliveroo box backpack,

104
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 was the guy who's biky just all in, who was a Deliveroo rider."

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 "Oh, no."

106
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 "Chasing off him down the road, it was so hollywood, it was incredible."

107
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
 "It was so hollyrood."

108
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 "Holyrood."

109
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 "Yeah."

110
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 "I saw it, no, I fluffed that joke."

111
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
 "It was such a solid one."

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 "You went to the edit."

113
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 "So I do one?"

114
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 "Yeah."

115
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,600
 "This is from paleontologist Thomas Halliday, who I briefly met at a party."

116
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 "Oh, sorry, that was my briefing notes."

117
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
 "You didn't meet him at a party day."

118
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 "I thought I did recognize the name."

119
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,600
 "But hang on, we've had a letter from Thomas Halliday in one of our jewels,

120
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 one of our drop us a line episodes, yes."

121
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
 "But he included such good stuff."

122
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
 "Are you just getting your mates to write in, Andy?"

123
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
 "I say this in the nicest possible way, he's not my mate."

124
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
 "But we met once, and he was a really nice guy, and he sent a great email."

125
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 "Great author."

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
 "Yeah."

127
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
 "Other lands he wrote, it was like a waterstone's book of the year, it was yours."

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
 "Yeah, so he's down there."

129
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 "I'm never bad in my, I love his stuff."

130
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 "Okay, well, Tommy H says, you are genetically descended from only about half of your ancestors

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
 that were alive 250 years ago."

132
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
 "Oh, piss off Thomas!"

133
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
 "What a twat!"

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 "Whoa!"

135
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 "Oh, joking, I was playing against the whole liking him as a buddy."

136
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 "That's funny, because I get to cut out all the first bits."

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 "This is going to sound like..."

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 "That's very cool."

139
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 "What does he mean?"

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 "What does Thomas mean?"

141
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
 "Actually, we've come across this on QI, James Ross and our good friend and colleague found this

142
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,600
 as well, and I've literally just written it up for the X series of QI, which will be on your

143
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
 TV's in about 18 months."

144
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
 "So, send your calendars."

145
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,600
 "Yeah, but basically what it is is your 50% DNA from each parent."

146
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
 "Yeah, right."

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,100
 "But the DNA comes in chunks, so if you get 50% from your mum, what if all of that 50% was

148
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
 what she got from her mum?"

149
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
 "In that case, you got nothing from her dad."

150
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
 "Okay."

151
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
 "And that's possible."

152
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
 "Wow."

153
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,100
 "So the way I like to look at it is imagine like playing cards, right?"

154
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:51,100
 "So your mum might have hearts and diamonds, and your dad might have spades and clubs."

155
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
 "Yeah."

156
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,100
 "But you might get all of the hearts from your mum and all of the clubs from your dad, in which

157
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,100
 case the parent who gave them the spades and the diamonds wouldn't give you anything."

158
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,600
 "And what you're saying is, that's obviously possible, but unlikely, that's two generations

159
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 up."

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,100
 "That is absolutely completely impossible, really, like it wouldn't happen because of the statistics."

161
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,100
 "But when you go far enough back, actually, it's not just possible, it's certain."

162
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
 "I would say."

163
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
 "Frazy."

164
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,100
 "And according to Thomas, he reckons that the tipping point of 50% is 10 generations."

165
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:33,300
 "Now for QI, I did the maths for this as well, and I reckon after 15 generations, you're extremely

166
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,100
 likely to have at least one ancestor who's completely genetically distinct from you."

167
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,660
 "So Thomas is doing like the 50% chance, I'm saying after 15 generations, one of your ancestors

168
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,100
 will not be related to you genetically."

169
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,100
 "Doesn't that mean problems with genealogy and tests?"

170
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,300
 "I don't think, when it's that far back, someone's going to be hearing the words, I'm sorry,

171
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,100
 but you're not the great, great, great, great grandfather."

172
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,100
 "It's Jeremy Kyle meets who do you think you are, who do you think you aren't?"

173
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
 "She's not your aunt."

174
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,100
 "Oh, superb, what a fact."

175
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,620
 "Yeah, it's brilliant, it's really interesting, and it really blows your mind when you start

176
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,100
 trying to do the maths and stuff, but yeah, it's a great, great fact, I think."

177
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
 "Should I jump in with one?"

178
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,100
 "This is from Felicia Vinterhoek, and it's sort of similar to a fact that we got sent in

179
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,460
 from the last episode about relocating an entire thing.

180
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,100
 We were talking about how a full village was middle way."

181
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
 "A village in Oxygen, yeah."

182
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:40,860
 "So same thing happened this year in north of Sweden in a town called Caruna, where they

183
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:49,540
 took literally the entire church, the Caruna Church, and they rolled it to a new destination,

184
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,500
 three kilometres to the east, and they've done that because Caruna is like a mining town,

185
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 and so the stabilization underneath them, because they've taken up so much from underneath

186
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,540
 the ground was getting a bit unsettling for us."

187
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
 "It's like subsidence and stuff."

188
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,540
 "Thanks, so yeah, and so they decided, okay, that they're going to move it."

189
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:17,540
 "I wonder if that's Horusum sort of went off a cliff when Caruna virus came out in 2020."

190
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,540
 "You know what, Andy, when you put your head in your hands like that, it really discourages

191
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
 me from doing this."

192
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
 "Well that's why I'm doing a check."

193
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,540
 "Hey, I've got one."

194
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
 "Yeah, I got for it."

195
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
 "From Louise Drake.

196
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,540
 Pleasingly, Louise Drake from Lewis."

197
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,700
 "Actually, this is about a place I've been to very excitingly, a place called Baselden Park,

198
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,700
 which is a national trust place, and it's a lovely old house, gorgeous grounds and all

199
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,700
 that, and it was where the 2005 Pride and Prejudice, which is the one with Kira Knightly in,

200
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
 was filmed in part, right?"

201
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 "Lovely."

202
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
 "So when they were filming it, they filmed a ball scene there.

203
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,060
 I just didn't find it so funny.

204
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,700
 The scale of the ball scene was so large that they put some of the national trust."

205
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
 "Are you laughing at the same ball scene?"

206
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
 "I don't like it."

207
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,780
 "In my head, because I don't live in that Jane Austen world like you do, and like to

208
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,700
 me, ball scene, I was thinking like a ball pool, like kids."

209
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
 "No, that's it.

210
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,700
 It's a very modern adaptation of the story, but it's all, yeah, yeah."

211
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,700
 "Oh, no, Mr. Darcy's weed and macarna."

212
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,700
 "He dives into the ball pit, and then he comes out with that as shirt on, it's very sexy."

213
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
 "It's incredible.

214
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
 I didn't know I did."

215
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
 "So all Jane Austen is set in soft play."

216
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
 "Wow."

217
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,180
 "No, so they filmed this ball-room scene.

218
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,260
 The scale of the ball scene was so large," right, Louise, that they put some of the

219
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,740
 national trust conservation staff in costume as supporting artists so they could keep

220
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,660
 a closer eye on things without looking out of place on camera.

221
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,420
 "Oh, I presume that's just so they don't break any of the price to start effects around

222
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
 the edge of the room."

223
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
 "I just find that so funny."

224
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
 "Yeah."

225
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,740
 "So if you watch that scene, there'll be some people there who are just national trust

226
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
 artists that, like, please look after this vase."

227
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
 "Don't touch that!"

228
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
 "Yeah."

229
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
 "That's really funny."

230
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,700
 "And then I looked into this place, Basil and Park, right?"

231
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
 "Mids, 18th century."

232
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
 "Yeah."

233
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
 "It's, they do a fair bit of film in there."

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
 "Yes, they film lots of stuff there."

235
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
 "Yeah, I think I know the one, yeah."

236
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,700
 "And basically, this is a bit of gossip from the 18th and 19th centuries."

237
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,660
 "Which is pretty heart gossip for us, man."

238
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
 "Yeah."

239
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
 "It was bought by this guy called Francis Sykes, right?"

240
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,100
 "And I looked him up and he sounds like an absolute rosser."

241
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,540
 "Astonishingly, someone who built a really, really big house then had not made all of their

242
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,420
 money entirely pleasantly."

243
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
 "Yeah."

244
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,580
 "He was an East India company guy and lots of bribes and insider trading and private

245
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
 investment.

246
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,860
 I mean, just all sorts of, all sorts of dreadful practice went on basically and he made a huge

247
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,660
 amount of money he spent on this house."

248
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:47,060
 "But the really spicy gossip is about the third baronette site, so I imagine his grandson

249
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,420
 who inherited the estate age five, right?

250
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,580
 So, you know, he's grown into a giant bobhead."

251
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,020
 "And he married this woman called Henrietta Vilbois, who was very wealthy, he was marrying

252
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,900
 for wealthy, you know, sort of like, dynastic marriage, whatever.

253
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,420
 They both had lots of affairs.

254
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,620
 She hadn't affair with Benjamin Disraeli."

255
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
 "Oh wow."

256
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,620
 "I know."

257
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
 "What a cameo."

258
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
 "What a cameo."

259
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
 "Who then?"

260
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,880
 He wrote a book called Henrietta Temple, which was all about having a secret affair with

261
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,860
 the married woman, which I would say is not a very good way of, if you're putting her

262
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,060
 first name in the title of the book, okay fine, whatever.

263
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,380
 But she had this other affair with a painter called Daniel McLeese, McLeese, who was friends

264
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,460
 with Charles Dickens.

265
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,340
 And when the husband, Sykes, the rotter, found out about this, he put a notice in the

266
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,500
 newspaper, saying, "Whereas Henrietta Sykes, the wife of me, Sir Francis Sykes, Baronette,

267
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,940
 have committed adultery with Daniel McLeese."

268
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,540
 This is in the newspapers, putting this down here, with whom she was found in bed at my house.

269
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,020
 And then he gives us a dress.

270
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,060
 On the 4th of July 1837, this is to give notice that hereafter I shall not be answerable

271
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,540
 for any debts she may contract or any goods which may be supplied to her.

272
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,260
 "What a scoundrel.

273
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,740
 This is like the 19th century.

274
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
 It was Rebecca Vardi."

275
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,940
 Exactly that.

276
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,140
 And you remember who I said McLeese was friends with?

277
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
 Charles Dickens.

278
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,380
 What's the surname of this Baronette?

279
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,500
 Sykes, Bill Sykes, Sykes, but also Bill Sykes, Bill Sykes, Bill Sykes is from Francis

280
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 Sykes.

281
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 Yeah.

282
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 It's a direct takeoff.

283
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,380
 And it's so everyone knows, this guy Francis Sykes is a worm.

284
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
 Yeah.

285
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,420
 That's amazing.

286
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,540
 Kate Moore writes, "Mountain beavers are the most primitive rodents and also host to the

287
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,020
 world's largest flea.

288
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,140
 They also neither live in the mountains nor are they a beaver."

289
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
 Mountain beavers.

290
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
 Mountain beavers.

291
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,060
 They're a type of rodent.

292
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,660
 All the world's most primitive rodent I hear.

293
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
 Oh yes.

294
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,660
 Yeah, they are.

295
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
 Wow.

296
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,660
 That is real.

297
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
 Because like rodent is not a moment good association.

298
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,980
 But to be the world's most primitive rodent, that's a double whammy.

299
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,420
 That's bad.

300
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,220
 The flea can get around 10mm, so about a centimeter.

301
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,300
 It's a farthest, yeah.

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,900
 But beavers have smaller faces than you, like mountain beavers, especially.

303
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,140
 They have quite thin faces.

304
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:12,780
 And so if you had a flea that was comparatively the same size, it would cover your whole eye.

305
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
 Oh yeah.

306
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,700
 One flea covering your own eye.

307
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
 Two fleas.

308
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
 Both eyes.

309
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
 Both eyes.

310
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
 Yeah.

311
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
 Poor benign mountain beaver.

312
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
 Yeah.

313
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
 Yeah.

314
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
 Actually, it's only the females who get that big.

315
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,220
 The males are about half that size.

316
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,420
 And actually you get much smaller ones.

317
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,220
 This is like a big hefty flea.

318
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
 Yeah.

319
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
 I wouldn't like that at all.

320
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
 I wouldn't like a tall to have a flea covering my whole eye.

321
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
 No.

322
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
 That's crazy out there, thought.

323
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
 Yeah.

324
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,220
 Can I do one?

325
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
 Yeah.

326
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
 Please.

327
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,260
 Jesse Quick writes, "It seems almost too ordinary to be true because we've all tried

328
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
 this once.

329
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,820
 You know, the world record for most melons chopped in half on somebody's stomach with a samurai

 sword while they lay on a bed of nails was set by a man named Johnny Strange.

331

 Oh.

332
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
 He's famous, isn't he?

333
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
 Johnny Strange.

334
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
 He is.

335
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
 He's got multiple Guinness.

336
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
 Well, that's quite the man.

337
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,860
 Is this real name?

338
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
 Dracan.

339
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
 No, he's actually called Luke.

340
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
 Strange.

341
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,460
 Well, Strange is a surname, right?

342
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
 Yeah, yeah.

343
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,260
 I've heard people with that surname, but then also, conceivably, you would make it up.

344
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
 Yeah.

345
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,700
 Like Johnny Strange sideshow.co.uk, I think it's a might, I might be a stage name.

346
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
 It's an incredible website.

347
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,500
 So he sliced 10 watermelons in 30 seconds on his glamorous partner's tummy and she's on

348
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,940
 a bed of nails and watermelons to bask in.

349
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
 There's no board.

350
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
 There's no board.

351
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
 Yeah.

352
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
 There's no board.

353
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
 She's the board.

354
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,980
 And then this watermelon record is big.

355
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,380
 I think she deserves the credit for that.

356
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,500
 Well, I know what you mean because he's broken a lot of records and she's involved in

357
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 some of them.

358
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,820
 So he's broken record for most apples held in one's own mouth and chainsawed out of it in

359
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
 one minute.

360
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,620
 That sounds like you've got a load of apples in your mouth.

361
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,540
 And like, let's say you have somehow got five apples in your mouth and the only way to

362
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,940
 get them out is to chainsaw your face so that they fall out.

363
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
 Sorry.

364
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,700
 He's biting an apple, which is mostly sticking out of his mouth and he's getting rid of

365
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,900
 it by chainsawing across it.

366
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,100
 He chainsaws across the apple.

367
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
 Okay.

368
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,340
 So you need someone with a small nose.

369
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
 You do.

370
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
 That's a really good point.

371
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,500
 Oh, yeah.

372
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,260
 He did eight apples out of his own mouth, but when his glamorous partner was holding the

373
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,060
 apples in her mouth, he did 12 in 60 seconds.

374
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,580
 That's a hardly surprising that it's easier to do it out of someone else's mouth than

375
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
 your own mouth.

376
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
 Yeah.

377
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,580
 You reckon?

378
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
 Yeah.

379
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
 Okay.

380
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
 Fair enough.

381
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
 All right.

382
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
 He's done heaviest weight pulled by pierced ears.

383
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
 Uh-huh.

384
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
 It's pulled a small plane.

385
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
 Was it his ears or his partner's ears?

386
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
 Was it his ears?

387
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,940
 Um, and I love this.

388
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,680
 He's done sword swallowing inside the globe of death.

389
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,160
 You know that cage where they ride a motorbike round the inside.

390
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
 Oh, I saw him.

391
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
 That was quite recently.

392
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
 I saw him.

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
 I went to zippo circus later.

394
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 Strangely.

395
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
 Did you?

396
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
 Yeah.

397
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
 Oh, you were, you were the guy with the trousers falling down.

398
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
 I'm glad I wasn't you.

399
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 Yeah, yeah.

400
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
 You were the glamorous assistant.

401
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,160
 But it's so exciting when they bring out that globe of death and they cycle motorbike

402
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
 round the inside of it.

403
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,760
 He was standing in the middle of it, swallowing the sword while someone was riding a motorbike

404
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 around his head.

405
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
 Right.

406
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 Really cool.

407
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 Yeah.

408
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
 I mean, very dangerous.

409
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,400
 I don't know if we can jump into another here from Shona Mack, which is also Guinness World

410
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,360
 Record, which is the world's oldest continuously operating post office is in the small town of

411
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
 Sankar in southwest Scotland.

412
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,920
 The post office has been operating on that site since it was established as a staging post

413
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
 in 1712.

414
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
 Pretty good going.

415
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
 Really good.

416
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
 That's cool.

417
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
 That's very good.

418
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
 I would have had the post office start in a bit later than that.

419
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
 What was Roland Hill?

420
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
 I thought he was like.

421
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,040
 And it's actually the penny post, yeah, but maybe they just were very quite a hundred years

422
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,640
 before this is a long queue.

423
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,960
 Here is one from Richard Galt.

424
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,520
 When board work last week, I came across a pamphlet from about 1970 preparing the company

425
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,720
 for metrication.

426
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,520
 So when we're going to go to the metric, the pounds and the vents and all that kind of

427
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
 stuff.

428
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,480
 Anyway, it contained a fact.

429
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,160
 And that is that the SI units that we used today are based on the kilogram, the meter and

430
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
 the second.

431
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,640
 And that's a bit messy because kilogram is already a thousand of something.

432
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,160
 So kilometer, you've got the basic thing which is the meter and then you add the kilo on.

433
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,520
 But the kilogram is already a kilo.

434
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,560
 Really it should be the gram or we should change the name of the kilogram.

435
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,520
 And indeed in 1970, the standardization committee, the ISO, was planning to change a kilogram and

436
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
 give it a different name.

437
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,440
 And one option was to rename it the Einstein.

438
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,120
 And if they'd have ended up doing that, it would have meant that Einstein himself weighed

439
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,760
 about 79 Einstein's, which is a good fact, apart from the fact that Richard I think means

440
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,920
 mass, not weight because masses and kilograms, or would have been Einstein's, whereas we measure

441
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,280
 weight in newtons.

442
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,880
 And newtons is kilograms multiplied by the gravitational pull of the earth.

443
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,440
 And Isaac Newton's weight would have been according to my calculation, around 686 newtons.

444
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
 Lovely.

445
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,080
 And that the, your basic metabolic rate, so the amount that you create energy means that

446
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,600
 James Watts created about 100 watts of power.

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
 Humans have no charge, but we do have a lot of electrons.

448
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,640
 And the electrons in the body of Charles Augustine de Coulomb would have been minus 9 billion

449
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,440
 Coulomb's.

450
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,320
 And if he was wearing high heels, Blaze Pascal would have asserted 5 million Pascal's

451
00:18:39,320 --> 00:19:09,000
 pressure on the floor.

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,080
 But Harry knows how to sell a fact, I mean, that's really good.

453
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,960
 So until 2020, only the, I'm sorry for my pronunciation here, the arm helmet was known.

454
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,600
 The arm helmet was found in the 1950s, admittedly, but it wasn't authenticated until 2020.

455
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,720
 So there you go.

456
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,840
 That is the doubling of the Viking helmets.

457
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,680
 And Harry adds an additional three fragments are known, largely eyebrow pieces, but none of them

458
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,920
 has horns.

459
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
 Okay.

460
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
 So, yeah.

461
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 Very cool.

462
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,400
 Yeah, you do get horned helmets, but they're pre-viking.

463
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,800
 So yeah, you get like from Scandinavia, you definitely get horned helmets, but by the time

464
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,000
 the Vikings came in, they didn't have horns anymore.

465
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
 And our thought of the horned helmets comes from Wagner basically.

466
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
 I had no idea.

467
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,240
 I thought there were never any horned helmets.

468
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,080
 No, they do exist for sure.

469
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,760
 Oh, I think one day we'll find some Viking ones I genuinely do, but what year will that

470
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 be?

471
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,400
 On current evidence, behave as a way.

472
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,800
 Well, no, if it doubled this year, then next year they'll be four, the year after they'll

473
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 be eight.

474
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 Okay.

475
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,600
 Well, that's it for all of your facts.

476
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,840
 Before we wrap up though, we have something very important to do, which is to announce the

477
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,200
 latest custodians from the fish archive, each person who joins the friend of the podcast

478
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:37,160
 here in club fish gets to become the champion, the effective owner of a fact from our 600 episodes.

479
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,560
 And so today we are going to be handing some out and he won't we begin with you?

480
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
 Yeah.

481
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
 All right.

482
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,320
 Here's a fact that is now under the stewardship of Hollis.

483
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,560
 It's this.

484
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,200
 Some rats were once the size of hippos and weighed two tons.

485
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,040
 Well, I would say a vintage, a vintage fish fact.

486
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
 It is.

487
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,000
 It's about animals being an amusing size.

488
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Yeah.

489
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,080
 I remember we talked about whether they made a weird noise as they got bigger and smaller

490
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
 going.

491
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 Oh, yeah.

492
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
 Do you remember that?

493
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,400
 Which is the same as the weird noise that a hippo makes when it retracts its testicles

494
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 into its body.

495
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 Yeah.

496
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 Yeah.

497
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 It's all flooding back.

498
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 It's all flooding back.

499
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
 Yeah.

500
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
 That's very good.

501
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 That's great.

502
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 That's great fact.

503
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 Yep.

504
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,040
 This is a fact and then that goes to Matt.

505
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:27,280
 This was one of my facts, which was during his 27 year rule, Pope John Paul II took over

506
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,200
 a hundred skiing and mountain climbing holidays.

507
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
 A funny image.

508
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
 Yeah.

509
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,840
 Seeing the Pope my meal on those slopes?

510
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
 Well, yeah.

511
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
 Yeah.

512
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
 Not quite.

513
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 But yeah.

514
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,080
 What he used to do, though, was sneak out of the Vatican.

515
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,520
 I seem to remember we spoke about it in a sort of like almost the beginning of like a Beatles

516
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,320
 movie where they have to wear false moustaches and hide behind newspapers would cut out holes

517
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,840
 for their eyes to look through.

518
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,240
 Like he was smuggled out of the Vatican so that he could get privacy and that he could

519
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
 go on the skiing holiday.

520
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,880
 Surely it's incredibly easy if you're the Pope to be spotted out of the Vatican.

521
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,080
 You just take off the papal regalia, which is what most people are looking at.

522
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,840
 Did we say this at the time, like just go out as an old Italian man?

523
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
 Yes.

524
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 Is the like no one more better than Ireland?

525
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
 Absolutely true.

526
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,520
 Do you know Reckon, if there were 10 elderly Italian men in this room, does he Italian the

527
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
 new one?

528
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 I think the new one's American.

529
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:23,160
 So 10 elderly Italian American men in this room standing in a line, do you reckon you'd

530
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
 be able to pick out the Pope?

531
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
 No, shoot me now.

532
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
 I just couldn't do it.

533
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,240
 Do you not think he has some kind of blow, like a halo?

534
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
 Oh.

535
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
 I forgot the glow.

536
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,000
 Do you not think he emanates holiness?

537
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Yes, you're right.

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Yeah.

539
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So you'd have to have a heavy, heavy coat to cover his papal aura.

540
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Yeah.

541
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,120
 No, I just, I honestly, I would not recognise the Pope in a non-papal setting.

542
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
 Very interesting.

543
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
 Yeah.

544
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,120
 I could be standing next to one of the urinal and just not know that it was the Pope.

545
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,640
 But do you not think his penis has like an ethereal blow?

546
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,400
 I think James, you've been excommunicated ones. What are you doing?

547
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
 OK.

548
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,640
 This is an ex-fact.

549
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,520
 This one will be forever loved, petted and fed by Rebecca Lovett.

550
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,960
 And her fact is that in 1900, a quarter of the residents of New York City would move house

551
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,920
 every May the 1st at 9am.

552
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,320
 Brilliant fact.

553
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,440
 Another vintage one, I'd say.

554
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
 That was one of yours, James.

555
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,480
 It was one of mine, yeah.

556
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,960
 I remember the details.

557
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
 What was the reasoning for it?

558
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,400
 I mean, it's a long fact that all the details are in the facts, but why?

559
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 They are.

560
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,400
 It was just that everyone's rent would run out on that date, and that's just, to be honest,

561
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,560
 the answer was really that it was just so, that was the way they did it, and they didn't

562
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,040
 really know any different.

563
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,280
 It was Mayhem, wasn't it?

564
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,720
 You couldn't get a moving removal firm for Love or Money because they were all booked.

565
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
 It's really low, though.

566
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,560
 It must have been tough to be a removal firm, because the rest of the year you just twiddling

567
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
 your thumbs up.

568
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 Yeah, absolutely.

569
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,040
 That's where you make all your money, and then you just hang out for the rest of the year.

570
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
 Oh, that's nice.

571
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
 Like Santa.

572
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
 Yeah.

573
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
 Exactly just like Santa.

574
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,280
 It's all that money, one back in the year.

575
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
 Andy, let's go on from here.

576
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
 OK.

577
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,800
 This fact is now going to be stuffed mounted and put on the wall of Steffen Low Camp.

578
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 There's one of my facts, actually, is that nobody knows why we kiss.

579
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
 Is that still true?

580
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,120
 11 years later?

581
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,880
 I think people do it because it's nice.

582
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,360
 Well, I think no one knows that for sure scientifically, I may as well.

583
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,000
 I can say because the X series of QI will be filmed in the spring and will go out in about

584
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,160
 18 months, but I'm writing it right now.

585
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,040
 And we have a question on kisses because of XOXO kind of thing.

586
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,840
 And according to my research, we still don't definitively know where kissing came from.

587
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
 Yeah.

588
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
 As a cultural practice.

589
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
 Yeah.

590
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,880
 Is it from sort of mothers chewing up food in their mouth and feeding it to their babies?

591
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,800
 Which is one main theory, isn't it?

592
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,000
 And so you evolve to feel that smashing your lips against someone else's lips is nice.

593
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Yeah.

594
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 No one likes thinking about that as the origin of kissing because it's a bit weird.

595
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Yeah.

596
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I think that that's what causes this very--

597
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,440
 The first human who ever kissed another human was kissing their own mum on the lips.

598
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
 Yeah, absolutely.

599
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
 Yeah.

600
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
 So we don't like that theory.

601
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
 No.

602
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
 Yeah.

603
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
 But I think it's true.

604
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
 Yeah.

605
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,880
 I mean, Dan, your mum's sexy.

606
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,400
 Not a great kisser though, weirdly.

607
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 Oh no.

608
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
 I'm just fine, isn't it?

609
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
 But like, come on.

610
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 Why the only one with a tongue?

611
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 Like what's going on?

612
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 James.

613
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:43,600
 Honestly, I thought I'd gone too far with the hope of the urinal, but--

614
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,240
 OK, here's a fact.

615
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,280
 Some years ago, a Belgian man had surgery to make himself look more like Michael Jackson.

616
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
 OK.

617
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
 Wow.

618
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
 OK, interesting.

619
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,640
 I wonder what Michael Jackson's status was when we did that fact.

620
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
 20.

621
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,440
 I think it's still pretty bad.

622
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
 Yeah.

623
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,120
 Well, that was his life to sell them.

624
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,200
 That fact is now under the custodian ship of Nick with no C N I K. Nick.

625
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,560
 You will have to look after that fact as if it was a member of your own family.

626
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,160
 That was from Mark Abrams, by the way.

627
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
 Oh, yeah.

628
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,800
 The founder of the Ig Nobel Prize.

629
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,480
 You and I saw very recently.

630
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,000
 We did indeed.

631
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
 He came into this very room.

632
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,560
 Yeah.

633
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,600
 He was in town.

634
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,920
 And this is interesting, because this is an episode where, once again, there were only two

635
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,760
 members of fish on it, which is something we really rarely do.

636
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,120
 But in the early days we did, I was away.

637
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
 And so was Anna.

638
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,000
 So in our place was Mark Abrams.

639
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,440
 And then, also in our place, was Molly Oldfield, one of the original QILs.

640
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,600
 And her fact was the longest Viking longship ever found was discovered during renovations

641
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,240
 of Longship Museum.

642
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,760
 So that basically found the Viking ship underneath the Viking ship museum, as they were

643
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,480
 just getting ready to expand it.

644
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
 That's brilliant.

645
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,120
 That fact is going to now belong to Simon Mattelján.

646
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
 Congratulations.

647
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
 Yeah.

648
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
 Be proud.

649
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
 It's a great fact.

650
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
 Where do you put that, though?

651
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
 You've got to build another museum now.

652
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
 Nightmare.

653
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
 Yeah.

654
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
 Exactly.

655
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
 And then you just keep discovering more and more.

656
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
 Theological treasures.

657
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
 Where do you stop?

658
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
 Do you know?

659
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
 All right.

660
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
 When we get another fact, all right.

661
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
 Let's go to you, Andy.

662
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
 All right.

663
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,560
 This fact is for Michael Boulter.

664
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,960
 And it's that the tobacco horn worm uses very bad halitosis to stop predators eating it.

665
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,760
 Well, so you just got really dreadful breath.

666
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
 And predators smell that.

667
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
 No, no, no, no.

668
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 That's interesting.

669
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,760
 So previous episode of Little Fish at the End, your fact that you gave out was to do also

670
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,800
 with a small insect that was being eaten.

671
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
 The spiders, the grass spiders.

672
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 Yeah.

673
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 I think amusing animals.

674
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
 That was your thing in the early days.

675
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
 Stock and trade.

676
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
 Yeah.

677
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,000
 We used to say it wasn't a proper episode of fish without an animal fact.

678
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Yeah.

679
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And what's that?

680
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,360
 I think we've outgrown it.

681
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,880
 And we did all the animals.

682
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,440
 We've done 400 animals.

683
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
 We've done 600 episodes.

684
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
 Do the maths.

685
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,560
 We've got 400 animals at the back.

686
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,440
 But honestly, with a gun to your head, how many could you name?

687
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
 400 is topi.

688
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
 You know that.

689
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
 That's very ambitious.

690
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
 No, you're right.

691
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,720
 Attenborough's really stretched that career out, hasn't he?

692
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,760
 Once you'd, oh, giraffe's again.

693
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,960
 But once you do the big mammals, and then the small mammals, and then, I mean, how many insects

694
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
 can we name?

695
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,600
 Cricket, locust, grass, opera, ant.

696
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,440
 Crickets and locusts are the same animal.

697
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
 What?

698
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,000
 I mean, I'm nine.

699
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,800
 OK.

700
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,720
 Let's do one more before we wrap up.

701
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,920
 So this fact is, you could have fallen asleep up to five times during this podcast and not

702
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,440
 known it.

703
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,760
 This was about the fact that everyone does little micro sleeps during the day.

704
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,160
 And that fact now belongs to Matthew Renner.

705
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,480
 So Matthew, I really hope you enjoy that fact being part of your life.

706
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,000
 Yeah, sweet dreams.

707
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,920
 And we've ascertained, like, since 11 years ago now,

708
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,000
 I think it turns out almost half our audience are using us as a sleep aide.

709
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,240
 Imagine if Matthew accidentally took his micro nap as you read out his facts and his name.

710
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,640
 And he's going to be listening for all these episodes, going, oh, surely, I'll be on

711
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
 this week's episode.

712
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
 Come on.

713
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 Yeah.

714
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
 Where's my fact?

715
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
 Oh, well.

716
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
 Hey, listen, we do need to wrap up.

717
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,280
 If you want to be a custodian of one of our facts from the archive, all you need to do is

718
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,160
 join Club Fish at our top tier level, which is friend of the podcast.

719
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,240
 We're going to be reading out more and more of these as the weeks go on with this new

720
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
 little fish show.

721
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
 We hope you're enjoying it.

722
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,560
 Come back again next week.

723
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,520
 Stay tuned for our Friday episode.

724

 Goodbye.
