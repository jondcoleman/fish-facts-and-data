00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
 Hi everybody, Andy here.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,020
 Just before we start this week's episode, wanted to introduce you to our special guest.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,480
 This week's guest is the brilliant Stevie Martin.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,800
 If you haven't heard of Stevie, you are in for a treat.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,760
 She is a fantastic comedian.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
 Everything she makes is good.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,320
 She makes wonderful sketches.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,440
 She's in shows.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,880
 She's on stuff.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
 And if you want to hear more of her after this episode, which you will, check out her

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,320
 podcast which is called "Nobody Panic".

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
 It's a great show.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
 It contains advice about absolutely everything in the world.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,880
 How to do your taxes.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,860
 How to brush your hair.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,380
 Some even funnier things than that, can you believe it?

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,760
 And it's a great show.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
 I think I did an episode recently which is coming up for release, but just start listening

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
 to that now.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,920
 Once again, it's called "Nobody Panic".

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,480
 Hope you enjoy this show.

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,440
 On with the podcast.

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:01:11,200
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,800
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Honto Murray, Anna Toshinsky, and Stevie Martin.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,640
 from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Stevie.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,960
 My fact is that Australia is wider than the moon, except technically it's not.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
 What?

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 Hello.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
 You can't row back row back.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
 I did some verification.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
 I think you're absolutely right.

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
 Come on.

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,320
 Back myself more says my mom, but so it is, if I was looking at it, it would be, but

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,200
 if I was like taking into account surface area, perhaps, and the fact that it's a sphere,

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
 that's all right.

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
 That's not what you said.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 Yeah, man.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
 Why does?

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
 Why does?

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
 We moved Australia, so it's in the place of the moon.

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 Yeah.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,960
 It would be, it would cover it from left to right and then some.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
 Like an eclipse.

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,880
 Like it could, you could move the moon and it would block the sun, possibly.

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 Would it?

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
 Australia, yeah.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
 It may not be tall enough.

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 I don't know.

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 Is Australia quite flat?

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,680
 Is it a flat boy from the top to the bottom?

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
 It's white.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,240
 I think that you would get bits of moon poking out.

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,880
 I don't think there's any Australia arrangement that totally covers the moon, but it's definitely

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
 wider left to right.

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 There's no doubt.

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,600
 You might be able to cut bits off or move Tasmania, for instance, to one of the poking

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 out bits.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 They'd love that.

63
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 They'd love that.

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Politically controversial plan already.

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,240
 Feels like they probably had to put up with a lot.

66
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 I don't know.

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,360
 I don't know anything about it.

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,600
 So the moon is about three and a half thousand kilometres across and Australia's about, when

69
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
 we look at it in the sky, Australia's about 4,000 kilometres.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
 Yeah, it's about 4,000, yeah.

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,040
 Did you know that the smallest moon of Jupiter, which is so small, it's called, just called

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 Jupiter, L-I-I, it doesn't have a name, is the same size as Vatican City?

73
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
 Is it?

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
 Yeah.

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,520
 It's almost not worth it.

76
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
 It's not worth it.

77
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,720
 Do we know it's a moon?

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,160
 Does anyone know what the smallest amount has to be for it to be a moon?

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
 Oh, there are all sorts of...

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
 Is it the Vatican City?

81
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 Is that it?

82
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 That's it, yeah.

83
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
 Yeah.

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
 If it can have a pope, it's a moon.

85
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 It's a moon?

86
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 That's it.

87
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
 It's hugely contentious.

88
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
 That question's hugely contentious in that world.

89
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,920
 Okay, we'll get emails, just dozens, hundreds of emails now that you've asked it.

90
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
 Wait, yeah.

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
 Doesn't the moon have a bishop?

92
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,680
 I'm sure we've vaguely said this in the past, that there is a guy whose role is a bishop

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
 of the moon.

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
 Oh, yes, yeah.

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,520
 When they tried to claim it as theirs, yeah, and they got given its own bishop.

96
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
 I mean, I think self-proclaimed.

97
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,400
 Is that like when I was 14, my mom bought me a little plot of land on the moon, and

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 you get a little deed.

99
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
 So I got a deed.

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
 Oh, no.

101
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
 You did that.

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,040
 So there's any mineral rights in maybe a centimetre square somewhere on the moon.

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
 You'll get none of it.

104
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,480
 I will get none of it, because it's not legally binding, because I'm sure she bought it like

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 a paper chase.

106
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,160
 But the bishop thing, I think, checks out.

107
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,040
 Imagine if there was a bishop in my bit.

108
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 That's it.

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,720
 Well, that's why the Pope Mobile has that dome over the top, the bubbles.

110
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
 Because people own it.

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,600
 It's so that if he needs to, he can operate in a lunar environment.

112
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
 Yes.

113
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,240
 I also own a small square of the Pope as well, so I got my 15th birthday.

114
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,600
 Wouldn't it be crazy for the UN or whoever it is to say, right, we are going to divide

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,920
 up the moon, but we've decided that paper chase are the people who are going to administer

116
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,800
 this system.

117
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
 You do need people to do admin.

118
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
 You do.

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 You do.

120
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
 They might have put in the best bid.

121
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
 You're absolutely right.

122
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,760
 I don't think that's too far a crazy idea.

123
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,240
 They've got the paper to make the certificates.

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,960
 I think it's a really...

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 It was high GS ads.

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
 It was.

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,160
 Here's an interesting thing.

129
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,800
 So the space between the moon and the earth, right?

130
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 Yeah.

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,120
 So that is roughly, because it changes all the time, but like it's furthest.

132
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,200
 It's big enough that you could take all of our planets in the solar system and you could

133
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,600
 put them next to each other in one big row and they would all fit between the space,

134
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 between the earth and the moon.

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 No.

136
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 Yeah, that is weird.

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 How?

138
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 It's not extraordinary.

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 Sorry.

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 I forgot to mention, I'm not true to it.

141
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,440
 I always think we don't make a massive enough deal about the coincidence of the moon and

142
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,320
 the sun and the fact that we can have a full eclipse, right?

143
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,520
 Because the only reason we can have a full solar eclipse is the fact that the moon and

144
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,040
 the sun look exactly the same size to us on earth.

145
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,440
 And that's just a total coincidence.

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,280
 It's just proportionally the size of the moon and the distance of the moon from us

147
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
 makes it the same size to us.

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,560
 And then in a million years, when the, because the moon's moving away like a few centimetres

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,040
 a year, we won't have full eclipses anymore because it'll be too far away to cover the

150
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
 entirety of the sun.

151
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
 Yeah.

152
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
 Yeah.

153
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,160
 And the chances were just infinitismally tiny.

154
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,040
 And I think that is evidence for a higher power.

155
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,720
 If ever there was it, the fact that they're basically the same size to us.

156
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,920
 I like the idea that in the future, when it's, when the moon is smaller and it goes across,

157
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
 it'll make the sun look like a bagel.

158
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
 Oh, yeah.

159
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
 A really stingy bagel, though.

160
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 Why don't you get your bagel that thin with a huge hole?

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 Yeah.

162
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 I like that.

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 Can I tell you about the first Australian person to go to space?

164
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 Oh, yeah.

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
 Paul Desmond Scully Power.

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
 Cool.

167
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,120
 It's the first ever astronaut.

168
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
 I'm calling him.

169
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
 Nice.

170
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
 I did try and find online if anyone's used that.

171
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,200
 I don't think anyone's says astronaut.

172
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 Maybe because...

173
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
 Trade market now.

174
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
 It happened to one guy.

175
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,680
 Also, it could be like Austrian as well, so it's kind of confusing.

176
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
 Oh, yeah.

177
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
 That'll lead to heaps of confusion.

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
 Yeah, sorry.

179
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
 I was confused.

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
 Duns and duns.

181
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,960
 But he was also the first astronaut with a beard.

182
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
 Wow.

183
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 Yeah.

184
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,600
 In the grapity, his beard would be flip more of the place like he was a wizard.

185
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
 Exactly.

186
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,520
 Was it like my beard or we talking Gandalf?

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 It's in between...

188
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,320
 He didn't have a Gandalf beard, very sadly.

189
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,320
 I think even NASA did try and make him shave and he said, "No, it's fine."

190
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,440
 So they tried to make a joke, they said it won't form an airtight seal and presumably

191
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
 Eula's Fixie-8.

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,920
 And he said obviously it'll be all right and it won't make a risk.

193
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,400
 She'll be right.

194
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
 He is so Aussie, it's brilliant.

195
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,120
 He said going to space was just one of those things that happened because he started off

196
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,560
 as an oceanographer and then he liked surfing and was studying maths and then he got into

197
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,960
 the Aussie Navy and then he exchanged over to the US Navy and they said, "We need someone

198
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,720
 to do a naval study, an ocean study rather from space."

199
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
 So do you want to get on board?

200
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
 And he did.

201
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,440
 He's founded a drone company called The Ripper Group.

202
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,960
 He's created Shark Finding AI.

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 Oh my God.

204
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
 He's just like...

205
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
 It's in his contract conforming to stereotype.

206
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Really?

207
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,240
 We'll only let you up there if...

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
 I know.

209
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,080
 As the shuttle was about to take off, you know, you're sitting like, I guess you're facing

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,160
 the sky so you're sort of lying on your back beneath the chair, right?

211
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
 What did he do?

212
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
 He fell asleep.

213
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 No!

214
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
 Okay.

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
 And he was like, "He like barbecued something."

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 Exactly.

217
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,040
 He stood in a surf position as he went up.

218
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,680
 And his beard was sort of parted as they went...

219
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,240
 That's all you could see is the rocket left the atmosphere, two strands of beard.

220
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,520
 Anyway, what a guy.

221
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
 What's he named?

222
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 What's he called?

223
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,640
 He's called Paul Desmond Scully Power.

224
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,880
 What a great name.

225
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
 Yeah.

226
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
 Paul Power.

227
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
 Paul Power.

228
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
 That's brilliant.

229
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,200
 There's just, speaking of the moon and Australia, I found a really cool thing online and it's

230
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,960
 an interactive page and it's created, is this website that's created by the people who wrote

231
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,480
 a book called Cosmos, the Infographic Book of Space, which I think has loads of really

232
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,720
 cool infographics about space in it, as you'd expect.

233
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 Whoa!

234
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,080
 So, Shane, they couldn't nail that onto the camera somehow.

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
 They needed me writing their subtitles.

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,440
 Your Amazon reviews of books are so shit right now, they're so bad.

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,800
 Anyway, they've also got a website and they have this whole interactive section and one

238
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,640
 of the interactive sections, which I strongly amend that you Google, is you can see how

239
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,320
 high a human or a kangaroo could jump on various celestial bodies.

240
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
 So they'll drop down, you can select human or kangaroo, no other things.

241
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,760
 Because they're the two main ones that would go into space and then, yeah, you can see

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 how high they jump.

243
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,440
 So, on the moon, we could jump three metres, pretty good, kangaroo, eleven metres, better.

244
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
 It's always better than kangaroo.

245
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
 That's good to say.

246
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,120
 It's relative, isn't it?

247
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 It's really fun.

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
 Quite a lot.

249
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,160
 It really tricks you and I've wasted a lot of time because it has things like some of

250
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,760
 the tiniest moons in the solar system and it'll do see how high you could jump on this

251
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,740
 and you click jump and then you sit there as it goes up and up and it doesn't really tell

252
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,080
 you if it's going to go on forever or if it's going to stop at some point.

253
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,240
 So I did sit there for about eight minutes watching it go up and up thinking, I wonder

254
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,760
 if I'm coming back down and sometimes you don't.

255
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
 Really?

256
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,520
 Yeah, well, it's a bit sad, don't jump from asteroids and stuff.

257
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,360
 You know how the moon looks too big, it looks bigger than it is when we look at it.

258
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
 Too big.

259
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,760
 When you look at the moon and the nice guy, what a beautiful moon, then you take a photo

260
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
 and there's a dot.

261
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 Yes.

262
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
 Oh.

263
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 I did that this morning.

264
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
 Right.

265
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 Yes.

266
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
 And it's really weird, it's a weird effect.

267
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
 Yeah, why is that, though?

268
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,040
 Well, we sort of prioritise it more with our eyes, but there are various reasons why, sometimes

269
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,480
 the moon looks very big near the horizon because it's closer to things that we recognise like

270
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,680
 houses or trees or whatever, you sort of see it in reference to those and you think it's

271
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
 bigger than it is.

272
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,600
 But wait, are you saying that it takes you so long to grapple to get your camera that

273
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,080
 by the time you've taken the photo it's actually moved up into the sky?

274
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,840
 No, because even when you look at it in the night sky it looks bigger to our eyes than

275
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 it does on a camera.

276
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
 Okay.

277
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
 Cameras are telling the truth.

278
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,040
 But there is a way of negating the effect of the moon, this effect of it looking too

279
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,840
 big, which is look at it upside down.

280
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
 Oh.

281
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
 Yeah.

282
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
 How do I turn my head up?

283
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 I do a headstand.

284
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
 You go to Australia.

285
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
 You go to Australia.

286
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,840
 You put your head between your legs as you're standing there and it looks the right size

287
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 again.

288
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
 Really?

289
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 Yeah, this was studied by two Japanese scientists.

290
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
 They wanted an ignoble prize for their paper.

291
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,520
 That's for telling people to put their head between their legs, look at me.

292
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,160
 Perceived size and perceived distance of targets for you from between the legs.

293
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,080
 I almost want to disagree with them, but it's a fact.

294
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 You haven't tried it.

295
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
 True.

296
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,680
 But next time you're out on a romantic night time stroll and the person you're with says,

297
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,960
 "Look at the lovely moon."

298
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,320
 You can say to them, "No, look at it between your legs and we'll see it."

299
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 That works.

300
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,400
 You know, like sometimes, I think it was the last year, you could see Jupiter really well

301
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,280
 next to the moon and yeah, I looked at some planes, but then I also did see Jupiter.

302
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
 So if I looked between my legs, it would look like Jupiter.

303
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
 Yes.

304
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
 It brings it closer.

305
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 Oh wait, no, it's a make it smaller.

306
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
 It looks smaller.

307
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
 It looks smaller between your legs.

308
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
 Oh, for God's sake.

309
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
 So I want to be opposite.

310
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
 Okay, fine, Ryan.

311
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
 Could we have a leg stream ahead?

312
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
 It'll bring it for Ryan.

313
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
 Okay.

314
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 Good, thank you.

315
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
 Check this out.

316
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,740
 I don't fully understand the science of this, but I find it amazing because it's true.

317
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,640
 And that is that on a rainy day, if the moon is overhead, it's going to rain less.

318
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
 I know.

319
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
 Yeah.

320
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
 That frightens me on a very deep level.

321
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
 On a rainy day.

322
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
 Yeah.

323
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
 If the moon is overhead, it's going to rain less.

324
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,980
 So if the moon, rather than like sometimes you see the moon, which is like closer to

325
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
 horizontal.

326
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
 On the horizon.

327
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,980
 Yeah, exactly.

328
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
 And then you get high in the sky, right?

329
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
 The moon.

330
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
 Yeah.

331
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
 Yeah.

332
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
 Different spots.

333
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,340
 When it's there, let's say it's a cloudy day and it's raining, it's going to rain less.

334
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
 But it's already.

335
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
 Is it the gravitational pull?

336
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
 Is it sucking?

337
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
 Yeah.

338
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
 Sucking in the rain?

339
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
 Yeah.

340
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
 So the rain goes off in the air towards the moon?

341
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
 What are you saying?

342
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
 Space rain is what happens.

343
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
 Upside down, space rain.

344
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
 Okay.

345
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,600
 Well, it just doesn't, it just, it stays within the atmosphere.

346
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 Yeah.

347
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
 Exactly.

348
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 Close.

349
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,240
 So the gravitational pull with the moon, it's all to do with the kind of pressure that

350
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,960
 it's creating around in the air as well.

351
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,320
 So the pressure can suck up the moisture that's in there.

352
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,840
 So it's just kind of, it's not, it's not weighted so that it falls down.

353
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,040
 But so it will still rain, but by less.

354
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
 It does.

355
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 It does make sense.

356
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,640
 It would be freaking bizarre if it just didn't rain in a Truman show way.

357
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
 Yeah.

358
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
 Yeah.

359
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
 But it's less by 1%.

360
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
 That's a lot.

361
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
 Oh.

362
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
 It's not a lot.

363
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
 Contrary.

364
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
 It's not a lot.

365
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
 Sorry.

366
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
 That's a really relevant.

367
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
 There's a lot of rain.

368
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 I was about to leave my umbrella at home before Dan said it's 1%.

369
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
 I think I'll take it anyway.

370
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
 Yeah.

371
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,840
 But you can drill a hole in your umbrella that's 1% the size of it.

372
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,640
 And then as long as that's in the right position, then it won't matter.

373
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
 Are you fine?

374
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
 Yeah.

375
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
 It's a thought.

376
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
 They did this.

377
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
 Science.

378
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
 They studied it for ages.

379
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
 They were looking at reports.

380
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 And then they looked at meteorological reports.

381
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
 They go all the way back to the 1800s.

382
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,640
 And they found that on the days where the moon was in those positions.

383
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
 1% less rainy.

384
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
 1% less rainy.

385
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
 I just love that fact so much.

386
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
 Australia's got its first ever moon rover.

387
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
 It was getting its first ever moon rover.

388
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
 Okay.

389
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 This is quite cool.

390
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
 Yeah.

391
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
 It's going to go on.

392
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
 Why?

393
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
 Why are they doing that?

394
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 It's just being included on a future mission.

395
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
 I think Australia has a space program.

396
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
 Ask Paul Power.

397
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
 And it's going to be included.

398
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,640
 But I'd just like to see, can you guess the name?

399
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
 There were 8,000 suggestions.

400
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
 Oh, okay.

401
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
 Of the name.

402
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
 And one winner.

403
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
 And it's gettable.

404
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
 And it's gettable.

405
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
 And it's an Aussie.

406
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
 Is it Mooney McMoon face?

407
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
 It's not Mooney McMoon face.

408
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
 It is something actually Australian.

409
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
 And you're going to kick yourselves right up the arse.

410
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
 Big old moon spider.

411
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
 That's good.

412
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
 It's a rover.

413
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
 It's a car.

414
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,640
 It's a rune rover.

415
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
 You're so close.

416
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,640
 This is agony.

417
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 What did you say?

418
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 I'm going to give it to you.

419
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 Roover is what its name is.

420
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
 What?

421
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 I was way closer.

422
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 What did you say?

423
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
 Rune rover.

424
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
 Rune rover.

425
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 Yeah.

426
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
 Absolutely not.

427
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
 That was a shock.

428
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
 Wait, say it again.

429
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
 What is it?

430
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 Roover.

431
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
 Come on.

432
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
 You should put kangaroo in front.

433
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
 She said kangaroo.

434
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
 Kangarova.

435
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
 It was closer than rune rover.

436
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 I had to say it.

437
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 Not saying anything.

438
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
 Just being like, mm-hmm.

439
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 Yeah.

440
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
 Anyway, it's going to be called Roover.

441
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,640
 And it will weigh about the same as a western grey kangaroo.

442
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 Cool.

443
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
 Or four wallabies.

444
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 Is that deliberate?

445
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
 That's deliberate.

446
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
 That's integral to the design.

447
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
 Four wallabies by wallabies.

448
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:14,640
 OK.

449
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
 It is time for fact number two.

450
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
 And that's my fact.

451
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
 My fact this week is that as a child,

452
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 Roald Dahl was used as a guinea pig

453
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
 for a chocolate factory.

454
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
 Cool.

455
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
 That's very on the nose.

456
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
 Yeah.

457
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
 Makes me wonder about all the other books as well.

458
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,640
 Like, did he have a big peach one day?

459
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
 Was he a twit?

460
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 Yeah, no.

461
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
 So he went to the school called Repton.

462
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
 And at Repton, there was a local Cadbury's.

463
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
 It was either a factory or it was just a base

464
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
 where they were sending chocolate out for it

465
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
 to be tested around the country.

466
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 Either way, what they used to do was they used to

467
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,640
 ask for kids from the school to apply to be guinea pigs

468
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
 in order to test out these chocolates

469
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
 and see whether they were fit for the market.

470
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
 And Dahl happened to be there at the time.

471
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
 So he would have been like 13, 14 years old at the time.

472
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
 Yeah, he spent four years at this place.

473
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
 And it had a huge impact on him.

474
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
 He did think off the back of it,

475
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
 what's going on inside these chocolate factories?

476
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
 I bet it's a marvellous incredible place.

477
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
 And it was the seed for what then became Charlie

478
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 and the Chocolate Factory.

479
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
 The pod.

480
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
 It was a lot of injuries.

481
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 But Charlie was there.

482
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
 My chocolate had a finger in it this week.

483
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
 Marvel.

484
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
 Wow.

485
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 Do we know if any of the kids in that classroom,

486
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
 when the teacher said,

487
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
 "Have we got any volunteers to test out chocolate

488
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
 in a chocolate factory?"

489
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
 Was there a single child who didn't put their hand up?

490
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
 Yeah.

491
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
 It's like a dream for a child.

492
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
 Oh my God.

493
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 Yeah, it's a dream gig.

494
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,640
 Professional chocolate testers are a thing.

495
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
 But not again, not many of them.

496
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
 And it's not as good a gig as maybe Dahl made it sound.

497
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
 You get quite sick, wouldn't you?

498
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
 You also develop an incredibly advanced palate.

499
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
 Oh, so nothing satisfies you.

500
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 You're ruined.

501
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,640
 Basically, you get chocolate that's a few hours old.

502
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
 It's ultra-fresh.

503
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
 And it's delicious.

504
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
 And you're always thinking whenever you eat anything else,

505
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
 you're ruined for your keys, basically.

506
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
 You can't just taste like trash to you.

507
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
 But one thing they do is,

508
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
 real chocolate experts and testers,

509
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
 they listen to the chocolate.

510
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
 Okay.

511
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
 What's this thing?

512
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
 What's going on there?

513
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,640
 It's like a phrase.

514
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 Like wine has a nose or whatever.

515
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
 It literally is.

516
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
 They listen to it.

517
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
 They listen to the snap sound it makes.

518
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
 When you break a piece of the chocolate,

519
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
 they'll give it a listen to make sure.

520
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
 Is there a thing like with cheese where once I went to a party

521
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
 and someone was like,

522
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
 "Oh, we've fridgeed the brie for too long."

523
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
 And they were like panicking.

524
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
 Did you like fridge chocolate or not?

525
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
 You know, because if you put it in the fridge and then you snap it,

526
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
 it goes...

527
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
 Lovely snap.

528
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
 But would they hate that?

529
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
 Probably.

530
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
 I'm sure they would hate all sorts of things.

531
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
 I'm sure the refrigerator chocolate is probably a deep no-no.

532
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
 It probably is.

533
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
 You'd be sacked immediately.

534
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
 If you knew anyone who'd ever done it, probably.

535
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
 Yeah, that's true.

536
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
 But they do.

537
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 Actually, someone I know went on a chocolate expert in for the day.

538
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
 Great.

539
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 As a team building exercise,

540
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
 I think they did a chocolate tasting.

541
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
 Oh, okay.

542
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
 Just to the house.

543
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
 Yeah, good things.

544
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,640
 And the chocolate expertier came around too.

545
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
 I want a chocolate expertier.

546
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
 This is going great.

547
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
 Right?

548
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,640
 You know, all these quite serious business people who work in finance.

549
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 And they all had to...

550
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
 They were all sitting there listening to their chocolate.

551
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 Oh, really?

552
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 Yeah.

553
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
 Like a tuning fork.

554
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
 Wow.

555
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
 Yeah, they do.

556
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 Jobs don't come up much sort of publicly for chocolate factories.

557
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
 But occasionally, Cadbury will sort of say,

558
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
 "We're looking for new taste testers."

559
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 And they did that at one point where they put a sort of open audition out.

560
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 And there's so many, 4,000 applicants.

561
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 Everyone went.

562
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 And they made the point of saying,

563
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 "This isn't going to be easy.

564
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
 This isn't just you sitting and eating chocolate saying,

565
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
 "Wow, how yummy."

566
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 Like, it's really intense.

567
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 They had to go spend two and a half hours a day having their taste buds

568
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 put to different chocolate tasting tests.

569
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
 They had to sit in a soundproof booth.

570
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 They had red lasers going around so that they could see the type of...

571
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
 Why they had a soundproof booth?

572
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
 To hear the chocolate.

573
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,640
 I guess it was a sensory booth rather than soundproof.

574
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
 But it's a similar thing.

575
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
 Sorry, you said that they said,

576
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
 "Oh, it's not just about eating loads of chocolate all day."

577
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,640
 But the first thing you said was they had to sit

578
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,640
 and have their taste subjected to loads of chocolate for ages.

579
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
 I mean, that was just eating loads of chocolate.

580
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
 No, no, but I think, yeah.

581
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
 Intensely, though.

582
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
 But it's intensely.

583
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,640
 I think they're slightly trying to SAS what is quite a nice job.

584
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
 You obviously have to write down quite a little detail, I guess,

585
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 about what you're tasting.

586
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
 Because they don't like work.

587
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
 They don't like if you say,

588
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 "Mmm, caramelly."

589
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 They're like, "No, no, no.

590
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
 We want the components.

591
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
 We want the makeup of this.

592
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 We don't need to say anything."

593
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
 They should know what to do already.

594
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,640
 They shouldn't be required to retro-engineer their chocolates for them.

595
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
 No, no, no.

596
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
 I should be saying if I like it or not.

597
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
 No, because you want to be able to say,

598
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,640
 "Oh, that hint of nutmeg is really speaking to me."

599
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 You know, they want to...

600
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 They don't like it.

601
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 The extra bits.

602
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
 You see what you mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.

603
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 You don't want to just go, "Wow, that's caramelly."

604
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
 That's...

605
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,640
 My one was shaped like a tiny seahorse, and I love that.

606
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
 A keyard.

607
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
 I once did a...

608
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
 I once did a...

609
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
 for Aussie shampoo.

610
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,640
 I went in and tested their new scent.

611
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
 Oh!

612
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,640
 I just remember smelling one and being like immediately,

613
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,640
 they were like, "So what are the components can you smell?"

614
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,640
 And all I could think of was like, "It smells like a man one."

615
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 "It smells like a musky, like a musk man one."

616
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
 And they were like, "Yes, because of why?"

617
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
 And it was like, "Because it's like other men's shampoo."

618
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
 And then I didn't lose anything for the rest of the hour,

619
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
 because I was like, "I actually can't smell."

620
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
 That's what I discovered.

621
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
 Unless it's like, "Yeah, a man one."

622
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 Sounds like they pay you in advance for that job.

623
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
 They do pay you in advance for that job.

624
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
 Yes, thank God, otherwise it would have, yeah.

625
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,640
 Well, I think it is nice enough that employees at the Cadbury's Factory,

626
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,640
 and this was established about 10 years ago, so it may not be a true now,

627
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,640
 but they can still eat as much of the product as they like,

628
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,640
 and they do tend to put on half a stone in the first 10 days of their employment.

629
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
 10 days?

630
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Yeah.

631
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 And then I imagine you pair back.

632
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 I don't think you keep on gaining half a stone for every 10 days.

633
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 I would have thought they'd have a bucket.

634
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 You know, you spit your chocolate into the bucket.

635
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,640
 Like tobacco, like a cowboy, or a bit joyless, yeah.

636
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 Maybe they do, but then you can eat whatever you like from that bucket at the end of the day.

637
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
 Like a fondue.

638
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,640
 Yeah, because I assume they all just have no teeth, right?

639
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 Yeah.

640
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
 But then you guys come in again, and they're like,

641
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,640
 "We want to be careful about the first 10 days."

642
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,640
 You do put on weight, but you save weight because your teeth aren't quite a lot.

643
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 It feels like a great job.

644
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 So, hey, Cadbury.

645
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
 That was the biggie.

646
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
 That was the thing that started chocolate off, basically,

647
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,640
 in terms of this big global Willy Wonka-esque world.

648
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,640
 Well, for me, that's Cadbury's always been the global brand.

649
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
 And so it started by a guy called John Cadbury.

650
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
 I was looking into him.

651
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
 He was born in Birmingham.

652
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
 He's the son of Richard Cadbury and his wife, Elizabeth Head.

653
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
 Very sad that they didn't take on the double barrel surname,

654
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
 because you would have had Dickhead Cadbury.

655
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
 That would have been a lovely name.

656
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
 And then, check this out, his second wife.

657
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
 Actually, his middle name was Tapper, so that's good anyway.

658
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
 Dick Tapper.

659
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
 Would you like a nice fruit and nut Dick Tapper?

660
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,640
 What is his wife called, Ballant?

661
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
 So his second wife was called Candia.

662
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
 He married a Candy.

663
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
 Oh, wow.

664
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
 Yeah.

665
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
 So he was an amazing guy, John Cadbury.

666
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
 He was very into animal rights.

667
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
 He set up the Animals Friends Society,

668
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,640
 which basically is what led into the RSPCA eventually coming about.

669
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,640
 It was sort of the forerunner and sort of molded into that.

670
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 And then he passed his company on to his sons,

671
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
 and they set up this incredible place, because they were Quakers.

672
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,640
 And so they've got this little place called Bourneville,

673
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,640
 which was given its name because it sounded French,

674
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
 and therefore would sound really kind of upper class.

675
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
 Oh, really?

676
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
 Yeah.

677
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 So they just gave it--

678
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,640
 They didn't fly for some reason.

679
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,640
 Welcome out in the mayoral dickhead town.

680
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,640
 And it's a model village.

681
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,640
 It's a model village, and it's still going to stay.

682
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
 I find the terminology model village quite confusing,

683
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
 because it means two quite different things.

684
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
 You're right.

685
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
 He didn't set up a village of tiny houses that you can--

686
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
 That's what I thought it was.

687
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
 Wow, what a great hobby.

688
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
 For all the oompa-loompas.

689
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
 Yeah.

690
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,640
 So he set up just like a nice small village?

691
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
 What's a model village?

692
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
 It was for the work-- it was for Cambry's workers,

693
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,640
 and it was basically--

694
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
 it was a village of houses that were built

695
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,640
 along new architectural lines.

696
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
 They were designed to be, you know,

697
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
 a development from the horrible slums that you've got--

698
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
 Oh, I see, right.

699
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
 --in one of the urban centers.

700
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,640
 Every house had a garden, and every house had a fruit tree,

701
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
 and things like this.

702
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
 And, you know, people were encouraged to live

703
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
 basically clean, healthy lives.

704
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
 These were all quite teetotal places as well.

705
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 That's the downside, yeah.

706
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
 It's boring.

707
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
 Unless it's changed recently,

708
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
 and there's been quite a few people that have been trying

709
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 to buckle it, it's a dry town, which is nuts.

710
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
 It's because the Quakers were--

711
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 Quakers were behind all three big chocolate companies,

712
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
 which were Cambry's, Fry's, and Roundtree.

713
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
 Yes, it was.

714
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
 And they weren't-- at the time,

715
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
 Quakers weren't allowed in the professions.

716
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
 There could be a doctor or anything like that.

717
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
 And they weren't allowed in public office.

718
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
 So they were in--

719
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
 If you can't do those two,

720
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
 you've got to go into sweets and confectionery.

721
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
 Also, I suppose if they're not drinking,

722
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
 they've not got a lot of good stuff going on.

723
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 So, like, there's absolutely canitch on the chocolate.

724
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
 Yeah.

725
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 That's the vice.

726
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,640
 You're actually missing a fourth Quaker chocolate,

727
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 and I've got a product of theirs here.

728
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 This is by a different company now,

729
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
 but I'm holding it in my hand.

730
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
 It's a Wonka Bar.

731
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,640
 And the Wonka Bar was created by Quaker Oats.

732
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
 You know Quaker Oats?

733
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
 Yeah, they funded the movie.

734
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
 They put $3 million into the funding of the movie,

735
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
 and they had a deal that they would have the chocolate

736
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 merchandise that would come off the back of it.

737
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
 And that's where we started getting Wonka Bars.

738
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 But they had a huge problem,

739
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
 because the movie didn't take off to begin with.

740
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
 It was doing fine, but it didn't go massive.

741
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
 Really, this is the one with Johnny--

742
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
 Not with Johnny Depp, sorry, with Gene Wilder.

743
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
 And the chocolate itself,

744
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
 they produced at the wrong temperature,

745
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
 as in the melting point of the chocolate,

746
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
 was so inaccurate that when it was being transferred,

747
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
 it would melt in the trucks and so on.

748
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
 So they had a few problems,

749
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
 and they sold it and sold it to different companies.

750
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 But it was set up by Quaker Oats.

751
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
 So we've got a fourth Quaker company.

752
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 Wow.

753
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
 Did you know that Cabry's once

754
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 reverse shop lifted a bunch of their cream eggs?

755
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
 So they sort of snuck them into shops?

756
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 They snuck them in, yeah.

757
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 I couldn't quite work out why they went to these lengths.

758
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
 This was in 2018.

759
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,640
 You might remember, they did a kind of Willy Wonka promo thing

760
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
 where they hid a thousand,

761
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
 about a thousand white chocolate eggs in cream egg wrapping.

762
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
 Oh, yeah.

763
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
 And I think if you opened a cream egg,

764
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
 there'd be a golden ticket in there,

765
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
 and it'd be a white chocolate egg,

766
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
 and it was really exciting.

767
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
 And then you could win 10,000 pounds.

768
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
 But the way they did it was,

769
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
 when they made the eggs,

770
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
 they didn't tell anyone in the factory in Bourneville

771
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
 that they were making the eggs,

772
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
 and they didn't tell any of the people in the shops

773
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
 where they were planting the eggs.

774
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,640
 They just got this crack team of spies

775
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
 to break into the factory overnight

776
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
 under cover of darkness, go in,

777
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
 make these eggs, smuggle them out,

778
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
 and then kind of in disguise,

779
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,640
 sneak into shops and slip them onto shelves.

780
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
 How many, do we know how many they made?

781
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
 They said they made about a thousand.

782
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
 You can do that in the course of a night.

783
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
 That's insane.

784
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
 I think it might have been multiple nights,

785
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
 but also, I think a chocolate factory

786
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
 can churn out, yes, even a thousand eggs.

787
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
 They make hundreds of thousands of cream eggs a year,

788
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
 just for a tiny season.

789
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
 I know, you're breaking in,

790
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 you've got to turn on the lights.

791
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,640
 I'm sure they created a pretext of an away day.

792
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
 We're all going on a chocolate listening course,

793
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,640
 and so no one needs to come to work tomorrow, you know.

794
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,640
 And if you notice any white smears around the machinery,

795
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
 just disregard it, get on with your work.

796
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
 So who were the people who were sneaking them

797
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
 bit onto the shelves?

798
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
 That's such a cool job.

799
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
 I suppose you have to be very high up in Cadbury

800
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
 to get that gig.

801
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
 But also inconspicuous looking.

802
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
 Very inconspicuous.

803
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
 Like you've got someone who looks

804
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 just like a normal person, I guess.

805
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
 I would invent a sleeve that allowed me

806
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
 to drop off an egg.

807
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
 Lay an egg with your arm.

808
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
 Exactly, exactly that.

809
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
 So I would pick up an egg,

810
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
 so no one would notice,

811
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 and I would go and buy an egg, you know.

812
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
 But no one's noticed the one I've secretly

813
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
 glayed in the egg tray behind me.

814
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,640
 Can I tell you like a real life, Willy Wonka?

815
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
 Yeah.

816
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
 This is a guy, have you heard of Forest Mars?

817
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
 No.

818
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
 Was he responsible for Mars Mars?

819
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
 He was.

820
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
 Wow.

821
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
 Forest Mars.

822
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
 Forest Mars.

823
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
 Also Maltesers invented those.

824
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
 Okay.

825
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
 Also Pedigree Chum and Uncle Ben's Rice.

826
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
 But those were like huge though.

827
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
 Wow.

828
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
 Like solo albums of his main career

829
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
 was in the confectionary world.

830
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
 Did he hands-on invented all of those?

831
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
 I don't know how.

832
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
 Invented Rice?

833
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
 There was a technique with Uncle Ben's Rice.

834
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
 In a pouch.

835
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,640
 I don't know how on his hands were on Pedigree Chum.

836
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
 But it's a big deal.

837
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
 Yeah.

838
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 Huge deal.

839
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
 And he did, I think he did with Maltesers.

840
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
 He took this tiny pellet of dough,

841
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 this pea-sized pellet of dough,

842
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
 and then put it in a vacuum oven.

843
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
 You know, exploded it in a vacuum,

844
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
 and then you cover that in chocolate,

845
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
 which is how they made today.

846
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
 They made the vacuum.

847
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
 Anyway, very cool.

848
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,640
 But Forest Mars was very eccentric.

849
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 As in, he was a bit of a tyrant.

850
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
 He would get his executives on their knees

851
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
 praying in meetings.

852
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
 He would lead them in prayers,

853
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
 saying, "I pray for Milky Way.

854
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
 I pray for Snickers."

855
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
 What?

856
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
 For the success of it,

857
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
 or like literally for a bar of...

858
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 [laughter]

859
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
 For the success of it.

860
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 So what about...

861
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
 He was a tyrant, I think, domestically as well.

862
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
 His adult son, John,

863
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 once asked to miss a sales meeting.

864
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 So Forest Senior said he had to spend the entire meeting

865
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
 on his knees in prayer.

866
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
 So I think...

867
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
 It's very interesting to make people just get on their knees

868
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
 and pray or something.

869
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
 A lot of praying is a theme.

870
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
 A lot of praying going on.

871
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 He was so secretive about his life

872
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
 that when he died in 1999,

873
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
 Mars wouldn't even confirm that he died.

874
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
 Gosh.

875
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
 I know.

876
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
 So there is a bit of a...

877
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
 It's quite an odd biography.

878
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
 Someone once saw him in an airport

879
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
 and shouted out,

880
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 "Forest, Forest Mars!"

881
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
 And he marched over and he...

882
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
 He made them get on their knees and pray.

883
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
 [laughter]

884
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
 That's right.

885
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
 It was more conspicuous, actually.

886
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
 He marched over and he said,

887
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
 "Don't ever call my name out in public."

888
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
 She was so concerned about being recognised

889
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
 or spotted or any of that.

890
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 Yeah.

891
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
 I mean, really an unusual guy.

892
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
 Why have you called your biggest product

893
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
 after yourself?

894
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
 [laughter]

895
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 Uncle Ben!

896
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,640
 [laughter]

897
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 [music]

898
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
 Okay, it's time for fact number three

899
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
 and that is Anna.

900
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
 My fact this week is that the thumbs up emoji

901
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 is contractually binding in Canada.

902
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
 [laughter]

903
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
 Be careful, Canadians.

904
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 And this was as of this year.

905
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,640
 No, as of last year, 2023.

906
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
 We're now in 2024.

907
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
 But this is because of a legal case

908
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 in Canada, in Saskatchewan.

909
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
 And they have the system there

910
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
 where a legal case will set legal precedent.

911
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
 That will be the one that they refer back to.

912
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 And there was a legal case where a guy

913
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
 called Kent Mickelbrough,

914
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
 a grain buyer,

915
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
 who wanted to buy some grain.

916
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
 So he texted a bunch of farmers

917
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
 and said, "Anyone got any

918
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
 flax to sell me?"

919
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,640
 "86 tonnes of flax I want at..."

920
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
 86, why 86?

921
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
 Kent, is it called Kent Mickelbrough?

922
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
 Kent Mickelbrough, that's right.

923
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
 It's a pretty cool name.

924
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
 Frankly, he wasted on a flax buyer.

925
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,640
 [laughter]

926
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
 Careful, buddy.

927
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
 This guy's litigious.

928
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
 [laughter]

929
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
 Flax buying is the coolest career.

930
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 Sorry, yeah, yeah.

931
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
 He needs the 86th ton for whatever reason.

932
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
 He wants 86 tonnes, exactly.

933
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,640
 Precisely 17 Canadian dollars a bushel.

934
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 And one farmer responded, Chris Achter.

935
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
 That's A-C-H-T-E-R.

936
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
 Chris Achter responded.

937
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
 They chatted on the phone.

938
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
 And Kent was like, "Cool, I'll text your contract."

939
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,640
 Kent texts him the contract saying,

940
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
 "Please confirm this is the grain you want to buy.

941
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
 You want to sell at this price."

942
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
 And the farmer responded

943
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
 with a thumbs up emoji.

944
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
 Fast forward a few months.

945
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
 Grain doesn't arrive.

946
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
 Kent's like, "Where the hell's my grain, mate?

947
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
 You agree to this contract?"

948
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
 Farmer says, "No."

949
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
 I was just saying, "I've received the message."

950
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
 I wasn't agreeing to the contract.

951
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
 Confirming that he's thumbs-uping that this is the contract.

952
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
 That I am that man.

953
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
 Yes, that's me.

954
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
 But he's not signing.

955
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
 No.

956
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
 I understand that.

957
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
 Like, I get that position.

958
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
 Like, I've received this contract.

959
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
 Thank you, but I never signed it.

960
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,640
 Well, so these were the two positions that went to court.

961
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
 I think I'm on Chris Achter's side.

962
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 Well, let's argue it out

963
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
 as they did in the Canadian courts.

964
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
 You also had lost, I'm afraid.

965
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,640
 And he had to pay $82,000 Canadian dollars in damages.

966
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
 Because it was determined that thumbs-up,

967
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
 because the guy said in his text message,

968
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
 you said, "Please confirm this is okay."

969
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
 And then with a picture of the contract.

970
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
 And I'm with you.

971
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
 A thumbs-up can just be like, I'm really lit.

972
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 I can't be honest to respond now,

973
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
 but I'll do something to put them off.

974
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
 I think it's an incredibly...

975
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
 I don't want to weigh in with an opinion here,

976
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
 but I think it is quite a passive-aggressive thing

977
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
 to do a thumbs-up emoji.

978
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
 I tried.

979
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
 I sent you one earlier this week, Dan,

980
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
 as an experiment to see how it felt.

981
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
 Oh, yeah?

982
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
 I didn't feel great after sending it.

983
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
 Oh.

984
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
 You know.

985
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 Really?

986
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
 You felt like it's a bit of a thumbs-down?

987
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
 I feel like it's a bit of a...

988
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

989
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
 Whatever, mate.

990
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
 Jog on.

991
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
 You know, it's sort of a...

992
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
 What was a weird response to me

993
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
 telling you my dog died?

994
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,640
 Jog on, mate.

995
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
 I like, instead of a thumbs-up,

996
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
 I've started doing a top hat.

997
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
 Oh, that's nice.

998
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
 A jaunty, just like a...

999
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
 Yeah, cool.

1000
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
 I've got my glad rags on.

1001
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
 I think is what I'm saying there.

1002
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
 No, I like that.

1003
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
 I would feel a bit special receiving a top hat

1004
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
 from Stevie, you know?

1005
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
 Yes, that's what I like to do.

1006
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
 But also, as a...

1007
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
 When my driving instructor,

1008
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
 I have to formally confirm,

1009
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
 contractually over text,

1010
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
 and he'll say, like,

1011
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
 "This time in this place,

1012
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
 confirm," and I just put a "why,"

1013
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
 and that means that is, like,

1014
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
 if I...

1015
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
 Wait, why?

1016
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
 Like, why?

1017
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
 And a top hat.

1018
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
 And he doesn't seem to think that.

1019
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
 No, why for yes.

1020
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
 Right, okay.

1021
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
 And when I do that,

1022
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,640
 I am in this obligation

1023
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
 to not cancel within seven days,

1024
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
 and I did have to because I got COVID,

1025
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
 and I was liable for, like, 250 quid.

1026
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
 And, like, so it...

1027
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
 But also, isn't it because, like,

1028
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
 if you...

1029
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
 What's the word?

1030
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
 This has turned into more of a personal complaint

1031
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 about your driving instructor's cancellation practice.

1032
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
 Because I read about a while back,

1033
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
 a long time ago,

1034
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
 but maybe in 2019,

1035
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,640
 about how, like, emojis are used in court

1036
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,640
 for, like, someone sent their partner

1037
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,640
 or ex-partner a gun emoji

1038
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
 and actually got sentenced for threatening,

1039
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,640
 because people do use them in terms of words.

1040
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
 So if you're gonna,

1041
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
 you've got to, I suppose,

1042
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
 come down on one side of it.

1043
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
 You can't just go,

1044
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
 "Well, if it's a threat, yes,

1045
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
 but if it's a thumbs up because of flax, no."

1046
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
 Like, I suppose it's quite tricky.

1047
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
 You can see, I'm just excited that

1048
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
 you have firsthand recent experience

1049
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
 of this actual fact.

1050
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
 Yeah.

1051
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
 You said legal precedent.

1052
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
 You and your driving instructor.

1053
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
 Top hat means yes.

1054
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
 Do you want to give it a quick, please?

1055
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
 Oh, God, yeah.

1056
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
 It is an interesting point, though,

1057
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
 like, what if he had sent a heart,

1058
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
 for example, in response, you know,

1059
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
 what would be, where's the boundary

1060
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
 of the early flax?

1061
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
 I love flax.

1062
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 And you.

1063
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,640
 Yes, you're right.

1064
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
 I think his thumbs up has that meaning.

1065
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
 Yeah.

1066
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
 I can sort of understand why it went that way as well.

1067
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
 You know, like, it's a sort of...

1068
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
 It's a yes.

1069
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
 It sounds good.

1070
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
 And actually, in fact, that was a thing

1072
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
 that was brought home in court,

1073
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 because the defence raised concerns that

1074
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
 what if you send a fist bump?

1075
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
 Is that a contract?

1076
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,640
 Or is that I'm going to punch you,

1077
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
 and that's a threat, and then you go

1078
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
 to prison?

1079
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
 Exactly.

1080
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
 Or that Lady Tango dancer in the red dress.

1082
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
 Yeah.

1083
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
 I would take that as an absolute yes.

1084
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
 Like, we are, we're on, we're going.

1085
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 You're sending twice as much flax as they've asked for.

1086
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
 We're dating now.

1087
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
 That's a...

1088
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
 Dating the flax.

1089
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
 Yeah.

1090
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,640
 No.

1091
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
 But I think the judge says,

1092
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
 "Don't be silly.

1093
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
 This is about a thumbs up."

1094
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
 And that's, that's all it is, you know.

1095
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
 Well, they, just to Andy's point

1096
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 about the thumbs up, actually, in China,

1097
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 you'd be right.

1098
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
 Apparently, the thumbs up emoji in China is bad.

1099
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,640
 Oh.

1100
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
 Amongst the youth, because it is...

1101
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
 But they asked some Chinese people.

1102
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 More like passive-aggressive?

1103
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
 Yeah, I think.

1104
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 Basically, Jen Zeds in China said

1105
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
 that if someone said them a thumbs up,

1106
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
 it means, "I don't like talking to you.

1107
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
 I want you to go away."

1108
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
 It reads like, like, okay,

1109
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
 and no punctuation.

1110
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
 That's what it reads like.

1111
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
 Okay.

1112
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 You're like, you're angry.

1113
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
 If I ever said, "Okay, I'm a full stop."

1114
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
 That's as angry as I can possibly express myself.

1115
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,640
 Like, that's absolutely a white-hot with fury, you know.

1116
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
 Yeah.

1117
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
 You know the Gagas cave paintings and the Pyrenees?

1118
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
 The ancient...

1119
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
 Intimately.

1120
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1121
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,640
 No, can you explain?

1122
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
 No, no.

1123
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
 Sorry, yeah.

1124
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
 But there are these cave paintings and the Pyrenees

1125
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
 in the Gagas caves.

1126
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
 Yeah.

1127
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
 And they're very, very, very old.

1128
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
 They're between 20 and 40,000 years old.

1129
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,640
 They're quite hard to date, but like, they're old.

1130
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,640
 And they're all stencils of hands, right?

1131
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
 Okay, yes.

1132
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
 And there are...

1133
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
 There are amazing images of them.

1134
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
 They're beautiful.

1135
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
 There are sort of dozens of hands overlaid on each other.

1136
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
 I have seen this, yeah.

1137
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,640
 I think they made them by putting the hand on the cave wall

1138
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
 and then spitting ochre paint.

1139
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
 Really?

1140
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
 Yeah, it says, yeah.

1141
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
 But the weird thing is, about half the hands

1142
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,640
 would be injured or mutilated.

1143
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
 You know, they're short a finger or two,

1144
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
 or some of them are short all four fingers.

1145
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
 And there's a theory that...

1146
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
 It's a language about hunting,

1147
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
 or it's an indication of something or another.

1148
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
 But there is a theory that that could be the first thumbs up.

1149
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
 It's either someone who's been tragically ritually mutilated

1150
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
 with the loss of all four of their fingers,

1151
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
 or it's the first ever thumbs up.

1152
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
 Or it's an emoji.

1153
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
 It's an emoji.

1154
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
 Yeah.

1155
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
 That's fun.

1156
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
 So that's...

1157
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
 It's hard to know.

1158
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
 A Egyptian hieroglyphs like emojis.

1159
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
 They are, because they're open to interpretation.

1160
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
 Yeah.

1161
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
 And they're pictures.

1162
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
 Great.

1163
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
 Thank you.

1164
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,640
 (ALL LAUGH)

1165
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
 Do you think they actually had a writing system,

1166
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,640
 but it just got so popular with the emoji side of things?

1167
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
 (ALL LAUGH)

1168
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
 Because that's where we're heading, anyway.

1169
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
 They were really frowned upon at first, the hieroglyphs.

1170
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
 Among the older generations.

1171
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
 Hieroglyphs are past ag.

1172
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
 Dumb it down.

1173
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
 (ALL LAUGH)

1174
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
 Right, where does the word emoji come from?

1175
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
 What does it mean?

1176
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
 Oh.

1177
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
 Emotion and something Japanese.

1178
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
 Exactly.

1179
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
 Bang, you fell right into my trap.

1180
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
 It's nothing to do with emotion.

1181
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
 Oh, and it's so weird.

1182
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,640
 So it's from the Japanese words for picture and character.

1183
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
 Oh.

1184
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
 So air is picture, moji is character, right?

1185
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
 That's weird.

1186
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
 It has nothing to do with emotion.

1187
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
 But weirdly, do you remember the emoticon?

1188
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
 Yes.

1189
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
 Like a colon and then a closed bracket is a smiley face.

1190
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
 Yeah.

1191
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
 That is an emotion icon.

1192
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
 And that came first.

1193
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
 That's so weird.

1194
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
 But then emoji came second and it has nothing to do with emotion.

1195
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
 This is like the sun and the moon being the same size coincidence.

1196
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
 This is all falling into place.

1197
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,640
 It's like a lot of emojis that have got nothing to do with emotion.

1198
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,640
 Like a suitcase or like Easter Island hat.

1199
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
 Exactly, yeah.

1200
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
 So that does now kind of check out, doesn't it?

1201
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
 Yeah.

1202
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
 I like what they decide to add each year.

1203
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
 So like there was a big uproar because there was no avocado for ages.

1204
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 Right.

1205
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
 And I think there wasn't a seal for a long time and that really got me down.

1206
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
 And I think it got me down.

1207
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
 A seal like when you seal an envelope.

1208
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
 No, unless a sea line.

1209
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
 I'm right.

1210
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,640
 Again, Anna, we're getting more of a glimpse into your communication style.

1211
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
 And mine.

1212
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
 Well, wax seal.

1213
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
 There was no wax seal.

1214
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
 Let's send it by seal.

1215
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,640
 That's what I do.

1216
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,640
 Do you know what the least popular emojis are?

1217
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,640
 Because I really look this up because when, you know, when you go to send one and you

1218
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,640
 see this vast selection and you think, God, none of these must ever get a look in ever.

1219
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,640
 And there's actually a Twitter account called at least used emoji,

1220
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
 which kind of sandy for it doesn't seem to have tweeted since 2020.

1221
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,640
 But in 2020, the same one had been top of its list for 264 days,

1222
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,640
 which I guess is when it gave up and thought this is the ultimate loser.

1223
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
 And he guesses.

1224
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,640
 What am I doing with my life?

1225
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,640
 Even bots get depressed.

1226
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
 Okay.

1227
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
 Is this gettable?

1228
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
 I don't know.

1229
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
 I mean, I guess it's one that you won't have seen very often.

1230
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
 Is it an object?

1231
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
 No, it's a flag.

1232
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
 You'll never get it.

1233
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,640
 I've just realized the least used one is the symbol that is an ampersand,

1234
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,640
 an equal sign, a musical note and a percentage sign.

1235
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
 What is it?

1236
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
 They come as one.

1237
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
 What is it?

1238
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
 What does it mean?

1239
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
 Well, I suppose no one's ever known.

1240
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
 Which is why.

1241
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
 Because you don't really get package emojis.

1242
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,640
 Like that's like four really unpopular ones that have got together in a supergroup

1243
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
 to try and bump themselves up.

1244
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
 Yeah.

1245
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
 It's the opposite of a supergroup, isn't it?

1246
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,640
 They thought they would be the traveling wheel breeze and they, yeah.

1247
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
 Also the tramway symbol.

1248
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640
 I really thought, Andy, that you can't have been on Line March in 2020,

1249
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
 given that that was the joint lease popular.

1250
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
 Yeah.

1251
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
 An aerial tramway symbol.

1252
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
 Oh, I, I've already talked about that.

1253
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,640
 And it was a, it's a sort of hanging railway.

1254
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 It's a suspended railway.

1255
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
 Yeah.

1256
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
 And I saw someone claiming that there's only one suspended railway

1257
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
 and widespread use of the world nets in China,

1258
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
 which is why the emoji is not used.

1259
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,640
 Actually, there is one in Germany, the Wuppertalsch Weberbahn,

1260
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,640
 which is a very popular suspended railway.

1261
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
 Great.

1262
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
 I just can't believe you won.

1263
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
 And that's, I'm stupid now.

1264
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
 That's where the train's like underneath the track.

1265
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
 Yeah.

1266
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
 Right.

1267
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,640
 So I think it's that an emoji before and been like, why, what's that?

1268
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
 But that is actually real.

1269
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
 I didn't, I didn't know.

1270
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
 Go to Wuppertal.

1271
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
 And you'll have a whale of a time.

1272
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,640
 It's, it's a really good, I think they put an elephant in it once.

1273
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
 I've just had a memory that.

1274
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
 Oh, it feels.

1275
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
 Wow.

1276
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
 Unnecessary, doesn't it?

1277
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
 I can't.

1278
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
 Can they?

1279
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
 Oh, to prove that it clings to the top.

1280
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
 Like you can even put an elephant in it.

1281
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
 I think.

1282
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
 You know, really, I know.

1283
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
 Really.

1284
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
 I'm really doubting myself.

1285
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
 I've got to find out.

1286
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
 I've got to find out.

1287
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
 I'm not sure what you do.

1288
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,640
 You go quiet for a bit and then go, oh, did you put an elephant in it?

1289
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
 Supposedly they put an elephant, they did put an elephant in it.

1290
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,640
 They put an elephant in the Wuppertal Schraberbahn in 1950 as a stunt either to promote the monorail

1291
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
 or the circus.

1292
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
 Both.

1293
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
 Why not?

1294
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
 And it fell in.

1295
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,640
 The panic had broken out in the carriage, which apparently also had passengers in it.

1296
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
 Oh my God.

1297
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
 Oh my God.

1298
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
 This is bizarre.

1299
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
 This is insane.

1300
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
 I'm just on the Wikipedia for it now.

1301
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,640
 It was called Tuffy Was Fine and survived another 39 years.

1302
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
 I thought you meant he was fine.

1303
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,640
 I was going to be like, this is not his fault.

1304
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
 I haven't paid for a ticket, mate.

1305
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
 Right.

1306
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
 I'm glad he was okay.

1307
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
 I'm famous in 1950.

1308
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
 Oh, it was she.

1309
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,640
 She actually accidentally, obviously, fell from the Wuppertal Schraberbahn into the River

1310
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
 Wuppa.

1311
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
 Oh, no.

1312
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
 But she survived.

1313
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
 Yep.

1314
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
 For 39 years.

1315
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
 Yeah.

1316
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
 I'm going to keep that in mind.

1317
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
 How did she thought did they not shut the doors?

1318
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,640
 Well, what it says here is that she was put on the monorail as a publicity stunt, tick.

1319
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,400
 Elephant trumpeted wildly and ran through the carriage, broke through a window and fell

1320
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,640
 12 meters down into the river, suffering only minor injuries.

1321
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,640
 A panic had broken out in the carriage, naturally, and some passengers were injured.

1322
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
 That's right.

1323
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
 Big-ass window.

1324
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
 Yeah.

1325
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
 It's a big window.

1326
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
 Yeah.

1327
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
 Or small elephant.

1328
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
 Small elephant.

1329
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
 Not African elephant.

1330
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
 It depends how you're looking at it.

1331
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:57,640
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

1332
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,640
 My fact is that there is a fish that spends its entire life upside down.

1333
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,640
 Is it trying to make the moon look smaller?

1334
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,640
 That's right.

1335
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
 This is a fact.

1336
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
 It was sent in, actually, by Kate Glyzinski.

1337
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
 So, thank you, Kate.

1338
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,640
 It's about a kind of anglerfish.

1339
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
 Sorry, that does sound like a pseudonym for Anna.

1340
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
 Kate Glyzinski.

1341
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
 Yeah.

1342
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
 Absolutely right.

1343
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,640
 This was sent in by Anna.

1344
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,640
 So, anglerfish are the ones which they have a tentacle and they have like a fishing rod

1345
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,640
 sticking out of their head, and then they use the end of the rod.

1346
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,640
 There's got a little glowing ball of light on it, and they use that to attract prey to them.

1347
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
 It's pretty incredible.

1348
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
 We say it casually.

1349
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
 It's amazing.

1350
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
 But you've got a light bulb hanging off your face.

1351
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
 Absolutely amazing.

1352
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
 Well, and it's bacteria that is lighting it up as well.

1353
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
 It's not like an actual light bulb.

1354
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
 It is an actual...

1355
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
 Hang on.

1356
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,640
 You've got to feed the rod for them to...

1357
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
 It's so weird.

1358
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
 Yeah.

1359
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
 It's genuinely amazing.

1360
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,640
 And sometimes they accidentally chew their own tentacle sort of thing.

1361
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,640
 Because they close their mouth and they go, you know, and then they obviously sometimes

1362
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
 they trap themselves.

1363
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
 Ow!

1364
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
 Anyway.

1365
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
 Like biting your tongue, basically.

1366
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
 They're light.

1367
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,640
 So this is the whip nose anglerfish.

1368
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,640
 And for years it was just assumed that it went the right way up.

1369
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
 It just went around the right way up.

1370
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
 Yeah.

1371
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
 People assumed that.

1372
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,640
 Because we've only seen dead ones, presumably, with anglerfish, right?

1373
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
 You don't obviously see them in the wild.

1374
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
 Yeah, because they live very, very deep in the deep ocean.

1375
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
 And it was assumed to be upright.

1376
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
 An upright fish.

1377
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
 Like all fish.

1378
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,640
 But they got some camera footage in 1999 of one of these swimming around the ocean,

1379
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,640
 upside down with the fishing rod dangling down beneath it.

1380
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
 Very weird.

1381
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
 They thought, what a weird...

1382
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,640
 What a weird one or fish.

1383
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,640
 But they keep finding these, like deep sea drones, keep filming these anglerfish swimming

1384
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
 around upside down.

1385
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,640
 And it appears they spend their whole life swimming upside down to attract prey.

1386
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
 But apparently it is better for it so that it doesn't bite itself.

1387
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
 That's in part of the description of the whip nose.

1388
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
 Yeah, it's just helpful.

1389
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,640
 It just gives it a tiny bit more of an advantage.

1390
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
 It's quite cute.

1391
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
 They're very cool, anyway.

1392
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
 They are weird anglerfish.

1393
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,640
 Anglerfish are insane.

1394
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,640
 They do this thing, and I know I always get too surprised by this, but evolution.

1395
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,640
 What a great idea.

1396
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,640
 So one of the things is that it's bioluminescent in that rod.

1397
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,640
 But also it will eat a lot of fish that are bioluminescent.

1398
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,640
 And an anglerfish has a really elastic kind of tummy, very rubbery.

1399
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,640
 So it can eat things that are almost twice its size.

1400
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,640
 And so it goes quite transparent, except it doesn't, because there's black lining on the inside.

1401
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,640
 So you can't see the bioluminescence inside it.

1402
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,640
 So it can't attract predators if there's something inside swimming around that's still not dead.

1403
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,640
 Kind of like a car that has tinted windows.

1404
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,640
 You don't know what's inside the car, but you can...

1405
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
 It is on purpose so that it's not gone transparent.

1406
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,640
 Like I went to the gym once and my leggings had gone see-through and everyone could see my knickers and butt.

1407
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
 That's the opposite.

1408
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,640
 If I was an anglerfish, I could have just made my leggings more opaque, for example.

1409
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,640
 One of the many reasons to want to be one.

1410
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
 That really puts it in context.

1411
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,640
 It really brings it down to earth, or up to earth.

1412
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,640
 This one that you mentioned, Andy, the whipnose is a classic anglerfish in that it's just the females you're talking about.

1413
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,640
 It's pretty much whenever anyone talks about cool stuff with anglerfish, it's just the ladies.

1414
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,640
 Because they are way bigger than the males.

1415
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,640
 So in the whipnose ones, then the females are like half a metre and the males are two centimetres.

1416
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,640
 And I think there's another kind of anglerfish which has the Guinness record for the biggest dimorphism between males and females.

1417
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:43,640
 And this I find so hard to believe, but Guinness says that the females are more than 60 times the length of the males and half a million times as heavy.

1418
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,640
 That's crazy.

1419
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
 The mating is very wild.

1420
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
 The mating is odd.

1421
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,640
 I think the mating is...

1422
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,640
 Basically, the male sort of latches onto the female, just kind of bites the side of her.

1423
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,640
 And then fuses and then dissolves into her.

1424
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,640
 And all that's left is a tiny pair of testicles.

1425
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,640
 Oh my god, that's incredible.

1426
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,640
 That's basically it.

1427
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,640
 Their skin and their organs all fuse together.

1428
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,640
 And for a long time, I think they assumed that there wasn't a male in the picture at all, right?

1429
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
 They just thought it was female.

1430
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
 Actually, you're looking.

1431
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
 That's him.

1432
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,640
 Testicles!

1433
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
 I know those testicles anywhere.

1434
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
 This is great.

1435
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,640
 We all know couples like that.

1436
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,640
 I wonder if that's what the perfect distance is.

1437
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,640
 Kind of like with the eclipse of a moon and the sun, that you could have the male anglerfish near you and the female.

1438
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,640
 That they will appear to be the same size.

1439
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1440
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,640
 Do you get females, don't you, which have lots of pairs of testicles just hanging off them?

1441
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,640
 Yeah, you get six or seven males will have been fused into one female at once.

1442
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
 Really?

1443
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1444
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,640
 And it's just like, you know, have you had many previous boyfriends?

1445
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,640
 No, actually, you don't need to tell me.

1446
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
 Oh, it's like a brownie sash with your badge just that you've collected.

1447
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,640
 Yeah, exactly.

1448
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,640
 That's how you explain this to your five-year-old.

1449
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
 That's really brownies.

1450
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
 Oh, no, they're brilliant.

1451
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
 They're so good.

1452
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,640
 They are.

1453
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
 Yeah.

1454
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
 And they do, when they're lava, they look really cool.

1455
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,640
 And there's not enough focus on this in the anglerfish world of chat.

1456
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,640
 They, when they're lava, they're surrounded by this jelly egg.

1457
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,640
 So that is transparent.

1458
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,640
 And so you'll see this tiny little anglerfish and then it's got this big see-through pile of jelly around it.

1459
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,640
 Like, absorbing.

1460
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,640
 Like, absorbing, exactly.

1461
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
 Really?

1462
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
 Yeah.

1463
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
 That's very cool.

1464
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,640
 All absorbing.

1465
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,640
 You guys have seen an anglerfish in person?

1466
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,640
 No, not in the flesh.

1467
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,640
 Not in the flesh.

1468
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,640
 I've met one.

1469
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,640
 Get away.

1470
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1471
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,640
 I met one.

1472
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
 I met a very famous one.

1473
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:40,640
 I met the one that basically was in Blue Planet that was discovered by all your celebrity anecdotes.

1474
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,640
 Names dropping.

1475
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
 So exhausting.

1476
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,640
 Are you a close personal friend of this anglerfish?

1477
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
 I was at a cocktail party with her.

1478
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,640
 We got chatting.

1479
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,640
 I don't even remember you, Dan, okay?

1480
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,640
 How many testicles did she have on her?

1481
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,640
 No, so years ago I got to work with Alistair Fathergill.

1482
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,640
 He came on Museum of Curiosity and he's the person who found the hairy anglerfish.

1483
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
 So he went down and he filmed it.

1484
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,640
 They, so you filmed it for an a half, isn't it?

1485
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,640
 Did he show you his hairy anglerfish?

1486
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
 Fly me.

1487
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,640
 So they brought it back up and it dies in the process.

1488
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,640
 Oh, when they died, did their lights go out?

1489
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
 Like a Pixar.

1490
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
 It might do.

1491
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,640
 But they would live on, wouldn't they?

1492
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,640
 They would.

1493
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
 That's even sadder.

1494
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
 This is the nuts thing.

1495
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
 It's that they're bacteria.

1496
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
 And I was reading a thing.

1497
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
 How do they get these bacteria?

1498
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
 Yeah, yeah.

1499
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,640
 Because normally when hosts have symbionts, you know, things living on them that rely on them,

1500
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,640
 they either find them in the local area or they, um, or they inherit them.

1501
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,640
 Bacteria wants to live on your nose.

1502
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,640
 Um, no, but they sometimes inherit them from their parents with other animals.

1503
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,640
 But anglerfish never have any contact with their parents.

1504
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,640
 It will be insane for them to.

1505
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,640
 His dad's been dissolved.

1506
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,640
 Come say hi to your father.

1507
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,640
 He's like, what?

1508
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,640
 Give him a little jiggle.

1509
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,640
 It was a real male role model.

1510
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,640
 Um, but no, they don't get their lure until much later in life, even.

1511
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,640
 So they must find them in their area.

1512
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,640
 They must pick them up from around the place and they have them on the end of their nose.

1513
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
 What if they, like, didn't find enough?

1514
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,640
 That would be like a Pixar film, like the anglerfish that couldn't find the bacteria.

1515
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,640
 That's a good one.

1516
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
 That's good.

1517
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
 Don't maybe edit that out so I can write it.

1518
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
 Yeah.

1519
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
 Please don't.

1520
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
 I will never write that.

1521
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
 Yeah.

1522
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,640
 Um, I found something that swims, but it can never be upside down.

1523
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
 Ooh.

1524
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,640
 What are they doing to me this?

1525
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,640
 Okay.

1526
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
 What could that be?

1527
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
 Something big and flat like this.

1528
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
 My vision.

1529
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,640
 Like a manta ray?

1530
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
 Maybe they're big and flat, but they can't.

1531
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
 They swim, but they, no.

1532
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,640
 No.

1533
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,640
 Right.

1534
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
 A starfish.

1535
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
 Not a starfish.

1536
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,640
 Stupid.

1537
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,640
 A ball.

1538
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
 A ball.

1539
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
 A ball.

1540
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,640
 A ball has no upside down.

1541
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
 A boat.

1542
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,640
 Do they swim?

1543
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
 Oh, okay.

1544
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
 A water boat.

1545
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,800
 - Yes, you probably are.

1546
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,980
 - The answer is the word swims.

1547
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,560
 - Smooth.

1548
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,400
 - Swims is an ambegram.

1549
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,880
 You flip it upside down and it's exactly the same.

1550
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,200
 - I've got my hot.

1551
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,480
 - Wow, with arousal.

1552
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,560
 - Yes, I'm incredibly aroused.

1553
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,400
 - That's amazing.

1554
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,600
 - I love that stuff.

1555
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,520
 - That's really good.

1556
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,000
 That is great. - That is great.

1557
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,160
 - That's really lovely stuff, Dan.

1558
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,000
 - That's a good riddle.

1559
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,080
 - Who would have thought?

1560
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,920
 - The riddle. - The riddle.

1561
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
 - Finally.

1562
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,200
 - You can stay.

1563
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,400
 - You've passed the audition.

1564
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,560
 - I said a boat.

1565
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
 - What the fuck are you saying?

1566
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,200
 (laughing)

1567
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,080
 - That's why I'm hostess podcast.

1568
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,720
 - They don't swim and they can be upside down.

1569
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,560
 - Namely.

1570
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:55,520
 - Just another thing on how fish swim.

1571
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,680
 Do you know how to tell if a fish is depressed?

1572
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,320
 - Oh, no, don't.

1573
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,400
 - Is that too sad?

1574
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,240
 - Okay.

1575
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,080
 - 'Cause we've got a cure.

1576
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,920
 - Great.

1577
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,760
 - There you go.

1578
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,600
 - What a roller coaster.

1579
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,440
 - I know.

1580
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,280
 (laughing)

1581
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,640
 - So you only said the fact yet, please.

1582
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,480
 - That's the cure.

1583
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,300
 Come on, the podcast.

1584
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,560
 It'll raise your spirits right up.

1585
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,960
 - What's the cure?

1586
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,920
 - Well, antidepressants.

1587
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,480
 And we only have a cure because we've trialled

1588
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,080
 human antidepressants on them to make them better.

1589
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,160
 But, how do you know that they're depressed?

1590
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,400
 - So they swim at the bottom of their tanks.

1591
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,240
 So depressed fish swim low and happy fish swim

1592
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,440
 at the top of the surface of the water

1593
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,720
 or the top of their tanks.

1594
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,480
 And this is actually really useful

1595
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,640
 according to scientists who do trial antidepressants

1596
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,560
 because it's a really obvious sign that they're depressed.

1597
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,200
 So we can trial antidepressants on them

1598
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,760
 and we know if they're working.

1599
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,600
 And they--

1600
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,440
 - They just go higher.

1601
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,600
 - 'Cause they just get higher and higher.

1602
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,440
 So you go, "Oh, pros out.

1603
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,280
 "That's doing the trick."

1604
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,200
 Look, it's like in the air.

1605
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,040
 - It's out of the water.

1606
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,240
 (laughing)

1607
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,200
 - Is it true or have I just made this up in my brain

1608
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,560
 that goldfish grow to fill their tanks?

1609
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,160
 If you actually give them a bigger tank,

1610
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,000
 they just keep going.

1611
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,840
 - That is true.

1612
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,560
 - And that's so sad in retrospect.

1613
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,360
 Because when I was growing up,

1614
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,080
 we had just a little tank with three fish

1615
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,680
 and you're like, "God, we were sort of shrinking off the tank."

1616
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,280
 - That's a thing when people throw them into the wild

1617
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,240
 into little lakes and so on.

1618
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,880
 They just turn into these turbo sharks.

1619
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,480
 - Exactly, you were doing a public service

1620
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,720
 by keeping them from, you know, taking over.

1621
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,240
 Upside downness?

1622
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,080
 Sure.

1623
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,320
 This is a very weird thing.

1624
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,320
 Which is better for a rhino to be?

1625
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,560
 Upside down or not upside down, lying down?

1626
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,440
 - Is it in the circus?

1627
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,600
 - It's not in the circus.

1628
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,440
 - It's not.

1629
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,280
 - Okay.

1630
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,080
 - Let me take you to the Vupetage favor button.

1631
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,920
 No, okay.

1632
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,760
 It's better for a rhino to be upside down

1633
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,640
 than it is for it to be lying on its side.

1634
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,480
 Isn't that weird?

1635
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,320
 - How does it get there?

1636
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,160
 Why?

1637
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,640
 - Well, I think we might have mentioned a while ago.

1638
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,840
 - We've done this about the rhinos.

1639
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,920
 - They transport rhinos to new areas

1640
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,040
 by putting them in a helicopter,

1641
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
 stringing them up by their ankles.

1642
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,880
 - No, not in the helicopter.

1643
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,040
 (laughing)

1644
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,960
 - No, they hogtie them.

1645
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,800
 - Right.

1646
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,160
 - They lift them up upside down

1647
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
 and then they fly to the new nature reserve

1648
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,000
 where they have to get them to.

1649
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,200
 It's the easiest way to transport them.

1650
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,040
 - Okay.

1651
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,200
 - It takes like 10 or 15 minutes.

1652
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,040
 It's really fast.

1653
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,980
 And no--

1654
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,820
 - What depends on the distance?

1655
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,800
 - Regardless of where they go.

1656
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,640
 (laughing)

1657
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,760
 - And on traffic.

1658
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1659
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,080
 But they're normally not taking them

1660
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,480
 like from South Africa to Tunisia.

1661
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,080
 You know, it's not like a short journey.

1662
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,840
 But nobody had checked how their hearts and lungs

1663
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,000
 actually cope with this journey.

1664
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,400
 And a team of scientists,

1665
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,920
 led by Robin Radcliffe from Cornell,

1666
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,560
 realized oh, we should probably look into

1667
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,400
 whether or not they're--

1668
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,240
 - Yeah, they're like--

1669
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,080
 - Incredibly upset.

1670
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,920
 - Oh my gosh.

1671
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

1672
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,200
 And so they held 12 rhinos upside down by their feet

1673
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,260
 for an experiment from a crane.

1674
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,320
 And they're also dated, obviously.

1675
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,880
 But they were just testing their heart and lungs.

1676
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,560
 And it turns out that it's much better

1677
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,400
 for it to be upside down.

1678
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,000
 Because when a rhino's on its side,

1679
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,360
 their lungs are a bit distorted.

1680
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,600
 You know, the gravity means--

1681
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,440
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

1682
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,360
 - The lungs are not getting equal amounts of oxygen

1683
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,280
 for the air exchange and all of that gas exchange.

1684
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,240
 But when they're upside down,

1685
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,120
 it is equal because they're just upside down.

1686
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,960
 - Lovely.

1687
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,780
 - So--

1688
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,620
 - When they sleep, they go upside down.

1689
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,560
 - They go upside down, yeah, yeah.

1690
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
 - Like on their backs.

1691
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,640
 - Liners, yeah, yeah.

1692
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,000
 If you go for a walk in certain bits of Namibia,

1693
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,120
 you'll look up in the trees

1694
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,040
 and you can see hanging from the trees.

1695
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,880
 - Stop it.

1696
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1697
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,560
 (laughing)

1698
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,920
 - I just want to be wrong on the back.

1699
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
 It's all I'm meant for.

1700
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,480
 - I don't think they like it.

1701
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,320
 - They should.

1702
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,160
 - They should.

1703
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,000
 - They should.

1704
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,920
 There are like rhino articles on the web.

1705
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,880
 You've been sleeping all wrong your whole life.

1706
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,860
 (laughing)

1707
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,880
 - There is another fish that swims upside down.

1708
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,720
 - Ooh.

1709
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,560
 - Well, it's not actually a fish.

1710
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,680
 It's krill, not technically a fish, I suppose.

1711
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,840
 (laughing)

1712
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,560
 - Forstalling the letters, very nice.

1713
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,800
 (laughing)

1714
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,640
 - Antarctic krill swim upside down in the Antarctic

1715
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,080
 when the water's covered in ice

1716
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,400
 so that they can graze like cows on the underside of the ice.

1717
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,240
 - Gorgeous.

1718
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,200
 - And they eat algae that grows

1719
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,520
 on the underside of the ice.

1720
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,080
 And they live such a weird life.

1721
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,760
 They migrate, quite weird migration, but up and down.

1722
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,620
 So they graze on algae swimming upside down

1723
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,620
 and then they get quite fat and heavy from it.

1724
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,860
 And then they sink 'cause they're too heavy

1725
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,140
 and they have to fan themselves out like a parachute

1726
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,380
 and they sink about 50 meters down

1727
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,980
 and then they think, oh God, I'm really hungry again.

1728
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,420
 So then they've used up all their food supply.

1729
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,780
 So then they have to swim up to the top again, eat

1730
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,580
 and then sink and that's their lives.

1731
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,940
 And they do about three times a day for their whole lives.

1732
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,780
 - Wow.

1733
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,660
 - And then they die.

1734
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,380
 - I go to the fridge more than three times a day.

1735
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,460
 I'm just saying I empathize.

1736
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,020
 That's my life too.

1737
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,480
 - It's like your whole life upside down.

1738
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,800
 - Go back and forth for a food source.

1739
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,800
 Yeah, it kind of is when you think about it.

1740
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,640
 - You're so right.

1741
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,480
 It's what we all do, isn't it?

1742
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,160
 - I'm at work, I then go downstairs, I guess food.

1743
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,280
 And he's always got a plate of something

1744
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,480
 that he just comes up with something on the go.

1745
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,720
 - Oh, I thought you Dan were saying

1746
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,480
 that is kind of our light and philosophical way.

1747
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,840
 - Oh, I thought you were saying that.

1748
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,680
 - Yeah, I thought that.

1749
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,000
 - And I was just saying yes too.

1750
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,160
 - The only reason they don't have a podcast

1751
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,800
 is it's too wet for all the equipment.

1752
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,520
 (all laughing)

1753
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,360
 That's fine.

1754
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,940
 (upbeat music)

1755
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,140
 (upbeat music)

1756
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,340
 - Okay, that's it.

1757
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,340
 That is all of our facts.

1758
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,540
 Thank you so much for listening.

1759
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,460

 Andy.

1767
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,940
 - @AndrewHondaM, various.

1768
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,260
 (laughing)

1769
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,080
 That's Stevie.

1770
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,420
 - Mastodon only.

1771
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,580
 (laughing)

1772
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,640
 Now I'm on Twitter and Instagram @stevm.

1773
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,300
 If the S is a five, I regret it.

1774
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,140
 - Right.

1775
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,140
 (laughing)

1776
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,140
 And if you wanna get to us as a group, Anna,

1777
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:32,980
 where do they go?

1778
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,180
 - You can tweet @NoSuchThing

1779
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,260
 or email podcast@QI.com.

1780
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,620
 - Yep, or you can go to our group account,

1781
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,900
 which is @NoSuchThing.

1782
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,520
 All of our previous episodes are up there,

1783
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,620
 so do check them out.

1784
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,140
 Also, lots of bits of merch,

1785
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,980
 and also there's the clubfish entrance point.

1786
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
 Join us, get access to all those fun things,

1787
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,060
 like Drop Us Align,

1788
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,820
 all the extra bonus shows that we do.

1789
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,660
 That's all there.

1790
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,380
 Anyway, otherwise, just come back next week.

1791
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,820
 We'll be back with another episode,

1792
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,720
 and we'll see you then.

1793
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,060
 Goodbye.

1794
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,640
 (upbeat music)

1795
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,220
 (upbeat music)

1796
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,640
 (upbeat music)

1797
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,000
