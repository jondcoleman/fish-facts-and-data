00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hi everybody, Andy here.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.020
 Just before we start this week's episode, wanted to introduce you to our special guest.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.480
 This week's guest is the brilliant Stevie Martin.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 If you haven't heard of Stevie, you are in for a treat.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.760
 She is a fantastic comedian.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760
 Everything she makes is good.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.320
 She makes wonderful sketches.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.440
 She's in shows.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 She's on stuff.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 And if you want to hear more of her after this episode, which you will, check out her

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320
 podcast which is called "Nobody Panic".

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 It's a great show.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.760
 It contains advice about absolutely everything in the world.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.880
 How to do your taxes.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.860
 How to brush your hair.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.380
 Some even funnier things than that, can you believe it?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.760
 And it's a great show.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.360
 I think I did an episode recently which is coming up for release, but just start listening

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360
 to that now.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.920
 Once again, it's called "Nobody Panic".

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.480
 Hope you enjoy this show.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 On with the podcast.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:11.200
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.520
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.800
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Honto Murray, Anna Toshinsky, and Stevie Martin.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.640
 from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Stevie.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 My fact is that Australia is wider than the moon, except technically it's not.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 What?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 Hello.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 You can't row back row back.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 I did some verification.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 I think you're absolutely right.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 Come on.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.320
 Back myself more says my mom, but so it is, if I was looking at it, it would be, but

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.200
 if I was like taking into account surface area, perhaps, and the fact that it's a sphere,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 that's all right.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 That's not what you said.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 Yeah, man.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 Why does?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 Why does?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 We moved Australia, so it's in the place of the moon.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 Yeah.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.960
 It would be, it would cover it from left to right and then some.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 Like an eclipse.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.880
 Like it could, you could move the moon and it would block the sun, possibly.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 Would it?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 Australia, yeah.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.880
 It may not be tall enough.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 I don't know.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 Is Australia quite flat?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.680
 Is it a flat boy from the top to the bottom?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680
 It's white.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.240
 I think that you would get bits of moon poking out.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.880
 I don't think there's any Australia arrangement that totally covers the moon, but it's definitely

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880
 wider left to right.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 There's no doubt.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600
 You might be able to cut bits off or move Tasmania, for instance, to one of the poking

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 out bits.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 They'd love that.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 They'd love that.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 Politically controversial plan already.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.240
 Feels like they probably had to put up with a lot.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240
 I don't know.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360
 I don't know anything about it.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.600
 So the moon is about three and a half thousand kilometres across and Australia's about, when

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.000
 we look at it in the sky, Australia's about 4,000 kilometres.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.120
 Yeah, it's about 4,000, yeah.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 Did you know that the smallest moon of Jupiter, which is so small, it's called, just called

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 Jupiter, L-I-I, it doesn't have a name, is the same size as Vatican City?

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 Is it?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 Yeah.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.520
 It's almost not worth it.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 It's not worth it.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.720
 Do we know it's a moon?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.160
 Does anyone know what the smallest amount has to be for it to be a moon?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160
 Oh, there are all sorts of...

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160
 Is it the Vatican City?

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160
 Is that it?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 That's it, yeah.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
 Yeah.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 If it can have a pope, it's a moon.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 It's a moon?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160
 That's it.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160
 It's hugely contentious.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
 That question's hugely contentious in that world.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 Okay, we'll get emails, just dozens, hundreds of emails now that you've asked it.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 Wait, yeah.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 Doesn't the moon have a bishop?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.680
 I'm sure we've vaguely said this in the past, that there is a guy whose role is a bishop

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680
 of the moon.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 Oh, yes, yeah.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.520
 When they tried to claim it as theirs, yeah, and they got given its own bishop.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.120
 I mean, I think self-proclaimed.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.400
 Is that like when I was 14, my mom bought me a little plot of land on the moon, and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 you get a little deed.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
 So I got a deed.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400
 Oh, no.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 You did that.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.040
 So there's any mineral rights in maybe a centimetre square somewhere on the moon.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040
 You'll get none of it.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.480
 I will get none of it, because it's not legally binding, because I'm sure she bought it like

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 a paper chase.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.160
 But the bishop thing, I think, checks out.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.040
 Imagine if there was a bishop in my bit.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040
 That's it.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.720
 Well, that's why the Pope Mobile has that dome over the top, the bubbles.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720
 Because people own it.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.600
 It's so that if he needs to, he can operate in a lunar environment.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600
 Yes.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.240
 I also own a small square of the Pope as well, so I got my 15th birthday.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.600
 Wouldn't it be crazy for the UN or whoever it is to say, right, we are going to divide

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.920
 up the moon, but we've decided that paper chase are the people who are going to administer

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.800
 this system.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.400
 You do need people to do admin.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 You do.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 You do.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 They might have put in the best bid.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 You're absolutely right.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.760
 I don't think that's too far a crazy idea.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.240
 They've got the paper to make the certificates.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.960
 I think it's a really...

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 It was high GS ads.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 It was.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.160
 Here's an interesting thing.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.800
 So the space between the moon and the earth, right?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 Yeah.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.120
 So that is roughly, because it changes all the time, but like it's furthest.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200
 It's big enough that you could take all of our planets in the solar system and you could

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.600
 put them next to each other in one big row and they would all fit between the space,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 between the earth and the moon.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 No.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 Yeah, that is weird.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 How?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 It's not extraordinary.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 Sorry.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.600
 I forgot to mention, I'm not true to it.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.440
 I always think we don't make a massive enough deal about the coincidence of the moon and

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.320
 the sun and the fact that we can have a full eclipse, right?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.520
 Because the only reason we can have a full solar eclipse is the fact that the moon and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.040
 the sun look exactly the same size to us on earth.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.440
 And that's just a total coincidence.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.280
 It's just proportionally the size of the moon and the distance of the moon from us

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.520
 makes it the same size to us.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.560
 And then in a million years, when the, because the moon's moving away like a few centimetres

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.040
 a year, we won't have full eclipses anymore because it'll be too far away to cover the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040
 entirety of the sun.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040
 Yeah.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040
 Yeah.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.160
 And the chances were just infinitismally tiny.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.040
 And I think that is evidence for a higher power.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.720
 If ever there was it, the fact that they're basically the same size to us.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.920
 I like the idea that in the future, when it's, when the moon is smaller and it goes across,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.760
 it'll make the sun look like a bagel.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760
 A really stingy bagel, though.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 Why don't you get your bagel that thin with a huge hole?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 Yeah.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 I like that.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.600
 Can I tell you about the first Australian person to go to space?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.360
 Paul Desmond Scully Power.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.360
 Cool.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.120
 It's the first ever astronaut.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120
 I'm calling him.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120
 Nice.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.120
 I did try and find online if anyone's used that.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.200
 I don't think anyone's says astronaut.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 Maybe because...

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200
 Trade market now.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200
 It happened to one guy.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.680
 Also, it could be like Austrian as well, so it's kind of confusing.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
 That'll lead to heaps of confusion.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 Yeah, sorry.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680
 I was confused.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.680
 Duns and duns.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.960
 But he was also the first astronaut with a beard.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
 Wow.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 Yeah.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.600
 In the grapity, his beard would be flip more of the place like he was a wizard.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 Exactly.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.520
 Was it like my beard or we talking Gandalf?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
 It's in between...

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.320
 He didn't have a Gandalf beard, very sadly.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.320
 I think even NASA did try and make him shave and he said, "No, it's fine."

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.440
 So they tried to make a joke, they said it won't form an airtight seal and presumably

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440
 Eula's Fixie-8.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.920
 And he said obviously it'll be all right and it won't make a risk.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.400
 She'll be right.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.160
 He is so Aussie, it's brilliant.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.120
 He said going to space was just one of those things that happened because he started off

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.560
 as an oceanographer and then he liked surfing and was studying maths and then he got into

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.960
 the Aussie Navy and then he exchanged over to the US Navy and they said, "We need someone

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.720
 to do a naval study, an ocean study rather from space."

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.480
 So do you want to get on board?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.480
 And he did.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.440
 He's founded a drone company called The Ripper Group.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.960
 He's created Shark Finding AI.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960
 Oh my God.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
 He's just like...

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.440
 It's in his contract conforming to stereotype.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440
 Really?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.240
 We'll only let you up there if...

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.240
 I know.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.080
 As the shuttle was about to take off, you know, you're sitting like, I guess you're facing

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.160
 the sky so you're sort of lying on your back beneath the chair, right?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.360
 What did he do?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360
 He fell asleep.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.360
 No!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360
 Okay.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.360
 And he was like, "He like barbecued something."

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.360
 Exactly.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.040
 He stood in a surf position as he went up.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.680
 And his beard was sort of parted as they went...

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.240
 That's all you could see is the rocket left the atmosphere, two strands of beard.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.520
 Anyway, what a guy.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520
 What's he named?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520
 What's he called?

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.640
 He's called Paul Desmond Scully Power.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.880
 What a great name.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.880
 Yeah.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.880
 Paul Power.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880
 Paul Power.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880
 That's brilliant.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.200
 There's just, speaking of the moon and Australia, I found a really cool thing online and it's

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.960
 an interactive page and it's created, is this website that's created by the people who wrote

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.480
 a book called Cosmos, the Infographic Book of Space, which I think has loads of really

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.720
 cool infographics about space in it, as you'd expect.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720
 Whoa!

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.080
 So, Shane, they couldn't nail that onto the camera somehow.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080
 They needed me writing their subtitles.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.440
 Your Amazon reviews of books are so shit right now, they're so bad.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.800
 Anyway, they've also got a website and they have this whole interactive section and one

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.640
 of the interactive sections, which I strongly amend that you Google, is you can see how

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.320
 high a human or a kangaroo could jump on various celestial bodies.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.880
 So they'll drop down, you can select human or kangaroo, no other things.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.760
 Because they're the two main ones that would go into space and then, yeah, you can see

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760
 how high they jump.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.440
 So, on the moon, we could jump three metres, pretty good, kangaroo, eleven metres, better.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440
 It's always better than kangaroo.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440
 That's good to say.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.120
 It's relative, isn't it?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120
 It's really fun.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120
 Quite a lot.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.160
 It really tricks you and I've wasted a lot of time because it has things like some of

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.760
 the tiniest moons in the solar system and it'll do see how high you could jump on this

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.740
 and you click jump and then you sit there as it goes up and up and it doesn't really tell

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.080
 you if it's going to go on forever or if it's going to stop at some point.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.240
 So I did sit there for about eight minutes watching it go up and up thinking, I wonder

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.760
 if I'm coming back down and sometimes you don't.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760
 Really?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.520
 Yeah, well, it's a bit sad, don't jump from asteroids and stuff.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.360
 You know how the moon looks too big, it looks bigger than it is when we look at it.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360
 Too big.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.760
 When you look at the moon and the nice guy, what a beautiful moon, then you take a photo

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.760
 and there's a dot.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 Yes.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.760
 Oh.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 I did that this morning.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.760
 Right.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760
 Yes.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
 And it's really weird, it's a weird effect.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760
 Yeah, why is that, though?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:17.040
 Well, we sort of prioritise it more with our eyes, but there are various reasons why, sometimes

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.480
 the moon looks very big near the horizon because it's closer to things that we recognise like

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.680
 houses or trees or whatever, you sort of see it in reference to those and you think it's

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.680
 bigger than it is.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.600
 But wait, are you saying that it takes you so long to grapple to get your camera that

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.080
 by the time you've taken the photo it's actually moved up into the sky?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.840
 No, because even when you look at it in the night sky it looks bigger to our eyes than

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840
 it does on a camera.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840
 Okay.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840
 Cameras are telling the truth.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.040
 But there is a way of negating the effect of the moon, this effect of it looking too

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.840
 big, which is look at it upside down.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840
 Oh.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.840
 Yeah.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840
 How do I turn my head up?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840
 I do a headstand.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.840
 You go to Australia.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.840
 You go to Australia.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.840
 You put your head between your legs as you're standing there and it looks the right size

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840
 again.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.840
 Really?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840
 Yeah, this was studied by two Japanese scientists.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.840
 They wanted an ignoble prize for their paper.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.520
 That's for telling people to put their head between their legs, look at me.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.160
 Perceived size and perceived distance of targets for you from between the legs.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.080
 I almost want to disagree with them, but it's a fact.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080
 You haven't tried it.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080
 True.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.680
 But next time you're out on a romantic night time stroll and the person you're with says,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.960
 "Look at the lovely moon."

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.320
 You can say to them, "No, look at it between your legs and we'll see it."

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320
 That works.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.400
 You know, like sometimes, I think it was the last year, you could see Jupiter really well

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.280
 next to the moon and yeah, I looked at some planes, but then I also did see Jupiter.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.840
 So if I looked between my legs, it would look like Jupiter.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840
 Yes.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840
 It brings it closer.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.840
 Oh wait, no, it's a make it smaller.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.840
 It looks smaller.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840
 It looks smaller between your legs.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840
 Oh, for God's sake.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.840
 So I want to be opposite.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840
 Okay, fine, Ryan.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.840
 Could we have a leg stream ahead?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840
 It'll bring it for Ryan.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.840
 Okay.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.840
 Good, thank you.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.840
 Check this out.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.740
 I don't fully understand the science of this, but I find it amazing because it's true.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:57.640
 And that is that on a rainy day, if the moon is overhead, it's going to rain less.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640
 I know.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640
 Yeah.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640
 That frightens me on a very deep level.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640
 On a rainy day.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640
 Yeah.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640
 If the moon is overhead, it's going to rain less.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.980
 So if the moon, rather than like sometimes you see the moon, which is like closer to

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.980
 horizontal.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.980
 On the horizon.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.980
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.980
 And then you get high in the sky, right?

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.980
 The moon.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.980
 Yeah.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.980
 Yeah.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.980
 Different spots.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.340
 When it's there, let's say it's a cloudy day and it's raining, it's going to rain less.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.340
 But it's already.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.340
 Is it the gravitational pull?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.340
 Is it sucking?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.340
 Yeah.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.340
 Sucking in the rain?

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.340
 Yeah.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340
 So the rain goes off in the air towards the moon?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.340
 What are you saying?

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.340
 Space rain is what happens.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.340
 Upside down, space rain.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.340
 Okay.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:34.600
 Well, it just doesn't, it just, it stays within the atmosphere.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 Yeah.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 Exactly.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 Close.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.240
 So the gravitational pull with the moon, it's all to do with the kind of pressure that

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.960
 it's creating around in the air as well.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.320
 So the pressure can suck up the moisture that's in there.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.840
 So it's just kind of, it's not, it's not weighted so that it falls down.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.040
 But so it will still rain, but by less.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040
 It does.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.040
 It does make sense.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.640
 It would be freaking bizarre if it just didn't rain in a Truman show way.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640
 Yeah.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640
 Yeah.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640
 But it's less by 1%.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640
 That's a lot.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.640
 Oh.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640
 It's not a lot.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.640
 Contrary.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640
 It's not a lot.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640
 Sorry.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640
 That's a really relevant.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.640
 There's a lot of rain.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.640
 I was about to leave my umbrella at home before Dan said it's 1%.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640
 I think I'll take it anyway.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640
 Yeah.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.840
 But you can drill a hole in your umbrella that's 1% the size of it.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.640
 And then as long as that's in the right position, then it won't matter.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.640
 Are you fine?

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640
 Yeah.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640
 It's a thought.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.640
 They did this.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.640
 Science.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640
 They studied it for ages.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640
 They were looking at reports.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.640
 And then they looked at meteorological reports.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.640
 They go all the way back to the 1800s.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.640
 And they found that on the days where the moon was in those positions.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.640
 1% less rainy.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.640
 1% less rainy.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640
 I just love that fact so much.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.640
 Australia's got its first ever moon rover.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.640
 It was getting its first ever moon rover.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640
 Okay.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.640
 This is quite cool.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640
 Yeah.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640
 It's going to go on.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640
 Why?

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640
 Why are they doing that?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640
 It's just being included on a future mission.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.640
 I think Australia has a space program.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640
 Ask Paul Power.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.640
 And it's going to be included.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.640
 But I'd just like to see, can you guess the name?

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.640
 There were 8,000 suggestions.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640
 Oh, okay.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640
 Of the name.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.640
 And one winner.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.640
 And it's gettable.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640
 And it's gettable.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.640
 And it's an Aussie.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.640
 Is it Mooney McMoon face?

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.640
 It's not Mooney McMoon face.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.640
 It is something actually Australian.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.640
 And you're going to kick yourselves right up the arse.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.640
 Big old moon spider.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640
 That's good.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640
 It's a rover.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640
 It's a car.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.640
 It's a rune rover.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.640
 You're so close.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.640
 This is agony.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.640
 What did you say?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640
 I'm going to give it to you.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.640
 Roover is what its name is.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640
 What?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640
 I was way closer.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 What did you say?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.640
 Rune rover.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.640
 Rune rover.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640
 Yeah.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.640
 Absolutely not.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.640
 That was a shock.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640
 Wait, say it again.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640
 What is it?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.640
 Roover.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
 Come on.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640
 You should put kangaroo in front.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.640
 She said kangaroo.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640
 Kangarova.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640
 It was closer than rune rover.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640
 I had to say it.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640
 Not saying anything.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640
 Just being like, mm-hmm.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640
 Yeah.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.640
 Anyway, it's going to be called Roover.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.640
 And it will weigh about the same as a western grey kangaroo.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640
 Cool.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.640
 Or four wallabies.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.640
 Is that deliberate?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640
 That's deliberate.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.640
 That's integral to the design.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.640
 Four wallabies by wallabies.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:14.640
 OK.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.640
 It is time for fact number two.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640
 And that's my fact.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.640
 My fact this week is that as a child,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.640
 Roald Dahl was used as a guinea pig

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.640
 for a chocolate factory.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 Cool.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640
 That's very on the nose.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.640
 Yeah.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.640
 Makes me wonder about all the other books as well.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.640
 Like, did he have a big peach one day?

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.640
 Was he a twit?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.640
 Yeah, no.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.640
 So he went to the school called Repton.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.640
 And at Repton, there was a local Cadbury's.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.640
 It was either a factory or it was just a base

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.640
 where they were sending chocolate out for it

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.640
 to be tested around the country.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.640
 Either way, what they used to do was they used to

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.640
 ask for kids from the school to apply to be guinea pigs

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.640
 in order to test out these chocolates

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.640
 and see whether they were fit for the market.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.640
 And Dahl happened to be there at the time.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.640
 So he would have been like 13, 14 years old at the time.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.640
 Yeah, he spent four years at this place.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.640
 And it had a huge impact on him.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640
 He did think off the back of it,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.640
 what's going on inside these chocolate factories?

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.640
 I bet it's a marvellous incredible place.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.640
 And it was the seed for what then became Charlie

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640
 and the Chocolate Factory.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.640
 The pod.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.640
 It was a lot of injuries.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.640
 But Charlie was there.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640
 My chocolate had a finger in it this week.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640
 Marvel.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640
 Wow.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.640
 Do we know if any of the kids in that classroom,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.640
 when the teacher said,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640
 "Have we got any volunteers to test out chocolate

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
 in a chocolate factory?"

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.640
 Was there a single child who didn't put their hand up?

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.640
 Yeah.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.640
 It's like a dream for a child.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640
 Oh my God.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.640
 Yeah, it's a dream gig.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.640
 Professional chocolate testers are a thing.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.640
 But not again, not many of them.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.640
 And it's not as good a gig as maybe Dahl made it sound.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.640
 You get quite sick, wouldn't you?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640
 You also develop an incredibly advanced palate.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 Oh, so nothing satisfies you.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.640
 You're ruined.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.640
 Basically, you get chocolate that's a few hours old.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640
 It's ultra-fresh.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.640
 And it's delicious.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.640
 And you're always thinking whenever you eat anything else,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.640
 you're ruined for your keys, basically.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.640
 You can't just taste like trash to you.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640
 But one thing they do is,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.640
 real chocolate experts and testers,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.640
 they listen to the chocolate.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640
 Okay.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640
 What's this thing?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.640
 What's going on there?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.640
 It's like a phrase.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.640
 Like wine has a nose or whatever.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640
 It literally is.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640
 They listen to it.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.640
 They listen to the snap sound it makes.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.640
 When you break a piece of the chocolate,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.640
 they'll give it a listen to make sure.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.640
 Is there a thing like with cheese where once I went to a party

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640
 and someone was like,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.640
 "Oh, we've fridgeed the brie for too long."

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.640
 And they were like panicking.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
 Did you like fridge chocolate or not?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.640
 You know, because if you put it in the fridge and then you snap it,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.640
 it goes...

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.640
 Lovely snap.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.640
 But would they hate that?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.640
 Probably.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.640
 I'm sure they would hate all sorts of things.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.640
 I'm sure the refrigerator chocolate is probably a deep no-no.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.640
 It probably is.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640
 You'd be sacked immediately.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640
 If you knew anyone who'd ever done it, probably.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640
 Yeah, that's true.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640
 But they do.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.640
 Actually, someone I know went on a chocolate expert in for the day.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.640
 Great.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640
 As a team building exercise,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.640
 I think they did a chocolate tasting.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.640
 Oh, okay.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640
 Just to the house.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640
 Yeah, good things.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.640
 And the chocolate expertier came around too.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640
 I want a chocolate expertier.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640
 This is going great.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640
 Right?

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.640
 You know, all these quite serious business people who work in finance.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.640
 And they all had to...

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.640
 They were all sitting there listening to their chocolate.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640
 Oh, really?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.640
 Yeah.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640
 Like a tuning fork.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640
 Wow.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640
 Yeah, they do.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.640
 Jobs don't come up much sort of publicly for chocolate factories.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.640
 But occasionally, Cadbury will sort of say,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.640
 "We're looking for new taste testers."

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.640
 And they did that at one point where they put a sort of open audition out.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.640
 And there's so many, 4,000 applicants.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.640
 Everyone went.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.640
 And they made the point of saying,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.640
 "This isn't going to be easy.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.640
 This isn't just you sitting and eating chocolate saying,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.640
 "Wow, how yummy."

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640
 Like, it's really intense.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.640
 They had to go spend two and a half hours a day having their taste buds

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.640
 put to different chocolate tasting tests.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.640
 They had to sit in a soundproof booth.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.640
 They had red lasers going around so that they could see the type of...

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640
 Why they had a soundproof booth?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640
 To hear the chocolate.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.640
 I guess it was a sensory booth rather than soundproof.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.640
 But it's a similar thing.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.640
 Sorry, you said that they said,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.640
 "Oh, it's not just about eating loads of chocolate all day."

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.640
 But the first thing you said was they had to sit

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.640
 and have their taste subjected to loads of chocolate for ages.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.640
 I mean, that was just eating loads of chocolate.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640
 No, no, but I think, yeah.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640
 Intensely, though.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640
 But it's intensely.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.640
 I think they're slightly trying to SAS what is quite a nice job.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.640
 You obviously have to write down quite a little detail, I guess,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640
 about what you're tasting.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640
 Because they don't like work.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640
 They don't like if you say,

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640
 "Mmm, caramelly."

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640
 They're like, "No, no, no.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640
 We want the components.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.640
 We want the makeup of this.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640
 We don't need to say anything."

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.640
 They should know what to do already.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.640
 They shouldn't be required to retro-engineer their chocolates for them.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640
 No, no, no.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
 I should be saying if I like it or not.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.640
 No, because you want to be able to say,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.640
 "Oh, that hint of nutmeg is really speaking to me."

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.640
 You know, they want to...

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640
 They don't like it.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.640
 The extra bits.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640
 You see what you mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.640
 You don't want to just go, "Wow, that's caramelly."

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640
 That's...

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.640
 My one was shaped like a tiny seahorse, and I love that.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.640
 A keyard.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.640
 I once did a...

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.640
 I once did a...

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.640
 for Aussie shampoo.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.640
 I went in and tested their new scent.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640
 Oh!

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.640
 I just remember smelling one and being like immediately,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.640
 they were like, "So what are the components can you smell?"

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.640
 And all I could think of was like, "It smells like a man one."

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.640
 "It smells like a musky, like a musk man one."

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640
 And they were like, "Yes, because of why?"

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.640
 And it was like, "Because it's like other men's shampoo."

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.640
 And then I didn't lose anything for the rest of the hour,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.640
 because I was like, "I actually can't smell."

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.640
 That's what I discovered.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.640
 Unless it's like, "Yeah, a man one."

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.640
 Sounds like they pay you in advance for that job.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640
 They do pay you in advance for that job.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.640
 Yes, thank God, otherwise it would have, yeah.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.640
 Well, I think it is nice enough that employees at the Cadbury's Factory,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.640
 and this was established about 10 years ago, so it may not be a true now,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.640
 but they can still eat as much of the product as they like,

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.640
 and they do tend to put on half a stone in the first 10 days of their employment.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.640
 10 days?

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640
 Yeah.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.640
 And then I imagine you pair back.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.640
 I don't think you keep on gaining half a stone for every 10 days.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 I would have thought they'd have a bucket.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.640
 You know, you spit your chocolate into the bucket.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.640
 Like tobacco, like a cowboy, or a bit joyless, yeah.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.640
 Maybe they do, but then you can eat whatever you like from that bucket at the end of the day.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.640
 Like a fondue.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.640
 Yeah, because I assume they all just have no teeth, right?

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640
 Yeah.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.640
 But then you guys come in again, and they're like,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.640
 "We want to be careful about the first 10 days."

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:23.640
 You do put on weight, but you save weight because your teeth aren't quite a lot.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.640
 It feels like a great job.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.640
 So, hey, Cadbury.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640
 That was the biggie.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.640
 That was the thing that started chocolate off, basically,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.640
 in terms of this big global Willy Wonka-esque world.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.640
 Well, for me, that's Cadbury's always been the global brand.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.640
 And so it started by a guy called John Cadbury.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.640
 I was looking into him.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.640
 He was born in Birmingham.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.640
 He's the son of Richard Cadbury and his wife, Elizabeth Head.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.640
 Very sad that they didn't take on the double barrel surname,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.640
 because you would have had Dickhead Cadbury.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640
 That would have been a lovely name.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.640
 And then, check this out, his second wife.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.640
 Actually, his middle name was Tapper, so that's good anyway.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640
 Dick Tapper.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.640
 Would you like a nice fruit and nut Dick Tapper?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.640
 What is his wife called, Ballant?

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.640
 So his second wife was called Candia.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.640
 He married a Candy.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640
 Oh, wow.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640
 Yeah.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.640
 So he was an amazing guy, John Cadbury.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.640
 He was very into animal rights.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.640
 He set up the Animals Friends Society,

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.640
 which basically is what led into the RSPCA eventually coming about.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.640
 It was sort of the forerunner and sort of molded into that.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.640
 And then he passed his company on to his sons,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.640
 and they set up this incredible place, because they were Quakers.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.640
 And so they've got this little place called Bourneville,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.640
 which was given its name because it sounded French,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.640
 and therefore would sound really kind of upper class.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640
 Oh, really?

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640
 Yeah.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640
 So they just gave it--

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.640
 They didn't fly for some reason.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.640
 Welcome out in the mayoral dickhead town.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.640
 And it's a model village.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.640
 It's a model village, and it's still going to stay.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.640
 I find the terminology model village quite confusing,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.640
 because it means two quite different things.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640
 You're right.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.640
 He didn't set up a village of tiny houses that you can--

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.640
 That's what I thought it was.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.640
 Wow, what a great hobby.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.640
 For all the oompa-loompas.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.640
 Yeah.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.640
 So he set up just like a nice small village?

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640
 What's a model village?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.640
 It was for the work-- it was for Cambry's workers,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.640
 and it was basically--

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.640
 it was a village of houses that were built

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.640
 along new architectural lines.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.640
 They were designed to be, you know,

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.640
 a development from the horrible slums that you've got--

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640
 Oh, I see, right.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640
 --in one of the urban centers.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.640
 Every house had a garden, and every house had a fruit tree,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.640
 and things like this.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.640
 And, you know, people were encouraged to live

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.640
 basically clean, healthy lives.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.640
 These were all quite teetotal places as well.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640
 That's the downside, yeah.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.640
 It's boring.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.640
 Unless it's changed recently,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.640
 and there's been quite a few people that have been trying

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.640
 to buckle it, it's a dry town, which is nuts.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.640
 It's because the Quakers were--

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.640
 Quakers were behind all three big chocolate companies,

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.640
 which were Cambry's, Fry's, and Roundtree.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640
 Yes, it was.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640
 And they weren't-- at the time,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.640
 Quakers weren't allowed in the professions.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.640
 There could be a doctor or anything like that.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.640
 And they weren't allowed in public office.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.640
 So they were in--

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.640
 If you can't do those two,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.640
 you've got to go into sweets and confectionery.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.640
 Also, I suppose if they're not drinking,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.640
 they've not got a lot of good stuff going on.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.640
 So, like, there's absolutely canitch on the chocolate.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640
 Yeah.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.640
 That's the vice.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.640
 You're actually missing a fourth Quaker chocolate,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.640
 and I've got a product of theirs here.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640
 This is by a different company now,

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640
 but I'm holding it in my hand.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640
 It's a Wonka Bar.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.640
 And the Wonka Bar was created by Quaker Oats.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.640
 You know Quaker Oats?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.640
 Yeah, they funded the movie.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.640
 They put $3 million into the funding of the movie,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.640
 and they had a deal that they would have the chocolate

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.640
 merchandise that would come off the back of it.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.640
 And that's where we started getting Wonka Bars.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.640
 But they had a huge problem,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.640
 because the movie didn't take off to begin with.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.640
 It was doing fine, but it didn't go massive.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.640
 Really, this is the one with Johnny--

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.640
 Not with Johnny Depp, sorry, with Gene Wilder.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640
 And the chocolate itself,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.640
 they produced at the wrong temperature,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.640
 as in the melting point of the chocolate,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.640
 was so inaccurate that when it was being transferred,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.640
 it would melt in the trucks and so on.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640
 So they had a few problems,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.640
 and they sold it and sold it to different companies.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.640
 But it was set up by Quaker Oats.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.640
 So we've got a fourth Quaker company.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640
 Wow.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.640
 Did you know that Cabry's once

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.640
 reverse shop lifted a bunch of their cream eggs?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.640
 So they sort of snuck them into shops?

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.640
 They snuck them in, yeah.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.640
 I couldn't quite work out why they went to these lengths.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.640
 This was in 2018.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.640
 You might remember, they did a kind of Willy Wonka promo thing

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.640
 where they hid a thousand,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.640
 about a thousand white chocolate eggs in cream egg wrapping.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640
 And I think if you opened a cream egg,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640
 there'd be a golden ticket in there,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.640
 and it'd be a white chocolate egg,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640
 and it was really exciting.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.640
 And then you could win 10,000 pounds.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.640
 But the way they did it was,

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640
 when they made the eggs,

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.640
 they didn't tell anyone in the factory in Bourneville

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640
 that they were making the eggs,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.640
 and they didn't tell any of the people in the shops

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640
 where they were planting the eggs.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.640
 They just got this crack team of spies

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.640
 to break into the factory overnight

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.640
 under cover of darkness, go in,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.640
 make these eggs, smuggle them out,

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.640
 and then kind of in disguise,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.640
 sneak into shops and slip them onto shelves.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.640
 How many, do we know how many they made?

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.640
 They said they made about a thousand.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.640
 You can do that in the course of a night.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.640
 That's insane.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640
 I think it might have been multiple nights,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.640
 but also, I think a chocolate factory

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.640
 can churn out, yes, even a thousand eggs.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640
 They make hundreds of thousands of cream eggs a year,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.640
 just for a tiny season.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640
 I know, you're breaking in,

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.640
 you've got to turn on the lights.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.640
 I'm sure they created a pretext of an away day.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.640
 We're all going on a chocolate listening course,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.640
 and so no one needs to come to work tomorrow, you know.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.640
 And if you notice any white smears around the machinery,

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.640
 just disregard it, get on with your work.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.640
 So who were the people who were sneaking them

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.640
 bit onto the shelves?

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.640
 That's such a cool job.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.640
 I suppose you have to be very high up in Cadbury

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640
 to get that gig.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.640
 But also inconspicuous looking.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640
 Very inconspicuous.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640
 Like you've got someone who looks

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.640
 just like a normal person, I guess.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.640
 I would invent a sleeve that allowed me

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.640
 to drop off an egg.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.640
 Lay an egg with your arm.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.640
 Exactly, exactly that.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.640
 So I would pick up an egg,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.640
 so no one would notice,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640
 and I would go and buy an egg, you know.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640
 But no one's noticed the one I've secretly

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.640
 glayed in the egg tray behind me.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.640
 Can I tell you like a real life, Willy Wonka?

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640
 Yeah.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.640
 This is a guy, have you heard of Forest Mars?

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640
 No.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.640
 Was he responsible for Mars Mars?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.640
 He was.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640
 Wow.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.640
 Forest Mars.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640
 Forest Mars.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.640
 Also Maltesers invented those.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640
 Okay.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.640
 Also Pedigree Chum and Uncle Ben's Rice.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.640
 But those were like huge though.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640
 Wow.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.640
 Like solo albums of his main career

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.640
 was in the confectionary world.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.640
 Did he hands-on invented all of those?

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640
 I don't know how.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.640
 Invented Rice?

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.640
 There was a technique with Uncle Ben's Rice.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640
 In a pouch.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.640
 I don't know how on his hands were on Pedigree Chum.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640
 But it's a big deal.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.640
 Yeah.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.640
 Huge deal.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640
 And he did, I think he did with Maltesers.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.640
 He took this tiny pellet of dough,

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640
 this pea-sized pellet of dough,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.640
 and then put it in a vacuum oven.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640
 You know, exploded it in a vacuum,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.640
 and then you cover that in chocolate,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640
 which is how they made today.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640
 They made the vacuum.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640
 Anyway, very cool.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.640
 But Forest Mars was very eccentric.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.640
 As in, he was a bit of a tyrant.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.640
 He would get his executives on their knees

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640
 praying in meetings.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640
 He would lead them in prayers,

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.640
 saying, "I pray for Milky Way.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.640
 I pray for Snickers."

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.640
 What?

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.640
 For the success of it,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.640
 or like literally for a bar of...

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640
 [laughter]

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.640
 For the success of it.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640
 So what about...

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.640
 He was a tyrant, I think, domestically as well.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640
 His adult son, John,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.640
 once asked to miss a sales meeting.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.640
 So Forest Senior said he had to spend the entire meeting

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.640
 on his knees in prayer.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640
 So I think...

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.640
 It's very interesting to make people just get on their knees

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.640
 and pray or something.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640
 A lot of praying is a theme.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640
 A lot of praying going on.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.640
 He was so secretive about his life

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.640
 that when he died in 1999,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.640
 Mars wouldn't even confirm that he died.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.640
 Gosh.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640
 I know.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640
 So there is a bit of a...

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.640
 It's quite an odd biography.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.640
 Someone once saw him in an airport

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.640
 and shouted out,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640
 "Forest, Forest Mars!"

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.640
 And he marched over and he...

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.640
 He made them get on their knees and pray.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.640
 [laughter]

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.640
 That's right.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.640
 It was more conspicuous, actually.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640
 He marched over and he said,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.640
 "Don't ever call my name out in public."

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640
 She was so concerned about being recognised

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640
 or spotted or any of that.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.640
 Yeah.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640
 I mean, really an unusual guy.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.640
 Why have you called your biggest product

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640
 after yourself?

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640
 [laughter]

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640
 Uncle Ben!

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.640
 [laughter]

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:24.640
 [music]

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.640
 Okay, it's time for fact number three

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.640
 and that is Anna.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.640
 My fact this week is that the thumbs up emoji

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.640
 is contractually binding in Canada.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640
 [laughter]

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.640
 Be careful, Canadians.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.640
 And this was as of this year.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.640
 No, as of last year, 2023.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.640
 We're now in 2024.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.640
 But this is because of a legal case

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.640
 in Canada, in Saskatchewan.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.640
 And they have the system there

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.640
 where a legal case will set legal precedent.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.640
 That will be the one that they refer back to.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.640
 And there was a legal case where a guy

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.640
 called Kent Mickelbrough,

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.640
 a grain buyer,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.640
 who wanted to buy some grain.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.640
 So he texted a bunch of farmers

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.640
 and said, "Anyone got any

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640
 flax to sell me?"

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.640
 "86 tonnes of flax I want at..."

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.640
 86, why 86?

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.640
 Kent, is it called Kent Mickelbrough?

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640
 Kent Mickelbrough, that's right.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.640
 It's a pretty cool name.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640
 Frankly, he wasted on a flax buyer.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.640
 [laughter]

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640
 Careful, buddy.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.640
 This guy's litigious.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.640
 [laughter]

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.640
 Flax buying is the coolest career.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640
 Sorry, yeah, yeah.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.640
 He needs the 86th ton for whatever reason.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.640
 He wants 86 tonnes, exactly.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.640
 Precisely 17 Canadian dollars a bushel.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.640
 And one farmer responded, Chris Achter.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.640
 That's A-C-H-T-E-R.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640
 Chris Achter responded.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.640
 They chatted on the phone.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.640
 And Kent was like, "Cool, I'll text your contract."

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.640
 Kent texts him the contract saying,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.640
 "Please confirm this is the grain you want to buy.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.640
 You want to sell at this price."

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.640
 And the farmer responded

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.640
 with a thumbs up emoji.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.640
 Fast forward a few months.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.640
 Grain doesn't arrive.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.640
 Kent's like, "Where the hell's my grain, mate?

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640
 You agree to this contract?"

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640
 Farmer says, "No."

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.640
 I was just saying, "I've received the message."

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.640
 I wasn't agreeing to the contract.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.640
 Confirming that he's thumbs-uping that this is the contract.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.640
 That I am that man.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.640
 Yes, that's me.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.640
 But he's not signing.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640
 No.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.640
 I understand that.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640
 Like, I get that position.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640
 Like, I've received this contract.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.640
 Thank you, but I never signed it.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.640
 Well, so these were the two positions that went to court.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.640
 I think I'm on Chris Achter's side.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.640
 Well, let's argue it out

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.640
 as they did in the Canadian courts.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.640
 You also had lost, I'm afraid.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.640
 And he had to pay $82,000 Canadian dollars in damages.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.640
 Because it was determined that thumbs-up,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.640
 because the guy said in his text message,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.640
 you said, "Please confirm this is okay."

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.640
 And then with a picture of the contract.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640
 And I'm with you.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.640
 A thumbs-up can just be like, I'm really lit.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.640
 I can't be honest to respond now,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.640
 but I'll do something to put them off.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.640
 I think it's an incredibly...

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.640
 I don't want to weigh in with an opinion here,

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.640
 but I think it is quite a passive-aggressive thing

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640
 to do a thumbs-up emoji.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640
 I tried.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.640
 I sent you one earlier this week, Dan,

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640
 as an experiment to see how it felt.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640
 Oh, yeah?

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640
 I didn't feel great after sending it.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640
 Oh.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640
 You know.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 Really?

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640
 You felt like it's a bit of a thumbs-down?

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.640
 I feel like it's a bit of a...

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640
 Whatever, mate.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640
 Jog on.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640
 You know, it's sort of a...

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.640
 What was a weird response to me

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.640
 telling you my dog died?

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.640
 Jog on, mate.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.640
 I like, instead of a thumbs-up,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.640
 I've started doing a top hat.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640
 Oh, that's nice.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.640
 A jaunty, just like a...

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640
 Yeah, cool.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.640
 I've got my glad rags on.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.640
 I think is what I'm saying there.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.640
 No, I like that.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.640
 I would feel a bit special receiving a top hat

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640
 from Stevie, you know?

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.640
 Yes, that's what I like to do.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640
 But also, as a...

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640
 When my driving instructor,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.640
 I have to formally confirm,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.640
 contractually over text,

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640
 and he'll say, like,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.640
 "This time in this place,

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.640
 confirm," and I just put a "why,"

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640
 and that means that is, like,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640
 if I...

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.640
 Wait, why?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.640
 Like, why?

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.640
 And a top hat.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.640
 And he doesn't seem to think that.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640
 No, why for yes.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.640
 Right, okay.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640
 And when I do that,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.640
 I am in this obligation

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.640
 to not cancel within seven days,

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.640
 and I did have to because I got COVID,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.640
 and I was liable for, like, 250 quid.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.640
 And, like, so it...

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.640
 But also, isn't it because, like,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640
 if you...

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.640
 What's the word?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.640
 This has turned into more of a personal complaint

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.640
 about your driving instructor's cancellation practice.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.640
 Because I read about a while back,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.640
 a long time ago,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.640
 but maybe in 2019,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.640
 about how, like, emojis are used in court

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.640
 for, like, someone sent their partner

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.640
 or ex-partner a gun emoji

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.640
 and actually got sentenced for threatening,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.640
 because people do use them in terms of words.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640
 So if you're gonna,

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640
 you've got to, I suppose,

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640
 come down on one side of it.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.640
 You can't just go,

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.640
 "Well, if it's a threat, yes,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640
 but if it's a thumbs up because of flax, no."

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.640
 Like, I suppose it's quite tricky.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.640
 You can see, I'm just excited that

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.640
 you have firsthand recent experience

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640
 of this actual fact.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640
 Yeah.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.640
 You said legal precedent.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.640
 You and your driving instructor.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.640
 Top hat means yes.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640
 Do you want to give it a quick, please?

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640
 Oh, God, yeah.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640
 It is an interesting point, though,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.640
 like, what if he had sent a heart,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.640
 for example, in response, you know,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.640
 what would be, where's the boundary

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.640
 of the early flax?

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640
 I love flax.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640
 And you.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.640
 Yes, you're right.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.640
 I think his thumbs up has that meaning.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.640
 Yeah.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.640
 I can sort of understand why it went that way as well.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.640
 You know, like, it's a sort of...

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.640
 It's a yes.

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.640
 It sounds good.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.640
 And actually, in fact, that was a thing

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640
 that was brought home in court,

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.640
 because the defence raised concerns that

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640
 what if you send a fist bump?

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640
 Is that a contract?

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.640
 Or is that I'm going to punch you,

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640
 and that's a threat, and then you go

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640
 to prison?

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.640
 Exactly.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640
 Or that Lady Tango dancer in the red dress.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.640
 Yeah.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.640
 I would take that as an absolute yes.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.640
 Like, we are, we're on, we're going.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.640
 You're sending twice as much flax as they've asked for.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.640
 We're dating now.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
 That's a...

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640
 Dating the flax.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640
 Yeah.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.640
 No.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.640
 But I think the judge says,

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.640
 "Don't be silly.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640
 This is about a thumbs up."

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.640
 And that's, that's all it is, you know.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.640
 Well, they, just to Andy's point

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.640
 about the thumbs up, actually, in China,

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640
 you'd be right.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.640
 Apparently, the thumbs up emoji in China is bad.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.640
 Oh.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.640
 Amongst the youth, because it is...

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.640
 But they asked some Chinese people.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640
 More like passive-aggressive?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640
 Yeah, I think.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.640
 Basically, Jen Zeds in China said

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.640
 that if someone said them a thumbs up,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.640
 it means, "I don't like talking to you.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.640
 I want you to go away."

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.640
 It reads like, like, okay,

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640
 and no punctuation.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640
 That's what it reads like.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640
 Okay.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640
 You're like, you're angry.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.640
 If I ever said, "Okay, I'm a full stop."

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.640
 That's as angry as I can possibly express myself.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.640
 Like, that's absolutely a white-hot with fury, you know.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640
 Yeah.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.640
 You know the Gagas cave paintings and the Pyrenees?

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640
 The ancient...

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640
 Intimately.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.640
 No, can you explain?

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640
 No, no.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640
 Sorry, yeah.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640
 But there are these cave paintings and the Pyrenees

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640
 in the Gagas caves.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.640
 Yeah.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.640
 And they're very, very, very old.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.640
 They're between 20 and 40,000 years old.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.640
 They're quite hard to date, but like, they're old.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.640
 And they're all stencils of hands, right?

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640
 Okay, yes.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.640
 And there are...

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640
 There are amazing images of them.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.640
 They're beautiful.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.640
 There are sort of dozens of hands overlaid on each other.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.640
 I have seen this, yeah.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.640
 I think they made them by putting the hand on the cave wall

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.640
 and then spitting ochre paint.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.640
 Really?

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640
 Yeah, it says, yeah.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.640
 But the weird thing is, about half the hands

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.640
 would be injured or mutilated.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.640
 You know, they're short a finger or two,

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.640
 or some of them are short all four fingers.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.640
 And there's a theory that...

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.640
 It's a language about hunting,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.640
 or it's an indication of something or another.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.640
 But there is a theory that that could be the first thumbs up.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.640
 It's either someone who's been tragically ritually mutilated

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640
 with the loss of all four of their fingers,

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.640
 or it's the first ever thumbs up.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640
 Or it's an emoji.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640
 It's an emoji.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640
 Yeah.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640
 That's fun.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640
 So that's...

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640
 It's hard to know.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.640
 A Egyptian hieroglyphs like emojis.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.640
 They are, because they're open to interpretation.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640
 Yeah.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640
 And they're pictures.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640
 Great.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
 Thank you.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.640
 (ALL LAUGH)

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.640
 Do you think they actually had a writing system,

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.640
 but it just got so popular with the emoji side of things?

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.640
 (ALL LAUGH)

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.640
 Because that's where we're heading, anyway.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.640
 They were really frowned upon at first, the hieroglyphs.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640
 Among the older generations.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640
 Hieroglyphs are past ag.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.640
 Dumb it down.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.640
 (ALL LAUGH)

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.640
 Right, where does the word emoji come from?

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640
 What does it mean?

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640
 Oh.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.640
 Emotion and something Japanese.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.640
 Exactly.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
 Bang, you fell right into my trap.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.640
 It's nothing to do with emotion.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640
 Oh, and it's so weird.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.640
 So it's from the Japanese words for picture and character.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.640
 Oh.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.640
 So air is picture, moji is character, right?

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640
 That's weird.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.640
 It has nothing to do with emotion.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.640
 But weirdly, do you remember the emoticon?

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.640
 Yes.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.640
 Like a colon and then a closed bracket is a smiley face.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.640
 Yeah.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640
 That is an emotion icon.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.640
 And that came first.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.640
 That's so weird.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.640
 But then emoji came second and it has nothing to do with emotion.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.640
 This is like the sun and the moon being the same size coincidence.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.640
 This is all falling into place.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.640
 It's like a lot of emojis that have got nothing to do with emotion.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.640
 Like a suitcase or like Easter Island hat.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640
 Exactly, yeah.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.640
 So that does now kind of check out, doesn't it?

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640
 Yeah.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640
 I like what they decide to add each year.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.640
 So like there was a big uproar because there was no avocado for ages.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640
 Right.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.640
 And I think there wasn't a seal for a long time and that really got me down.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640
 And I think it got me down.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.640
 A seal like when you seal an envelope.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640
 No, unless a sea line.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.640
 I'm right.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.640
 Again, Anna, we're getting more of a glimpse into your communication style.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.640
 And mine.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.640
 Well, wax seal.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640
 There was no wax seal.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.640
 Let's send it by seal.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.640
 That's what I do.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.640
 Do you know what the least popular emojis are?

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.640
 Because I really look this up because when, you know, when you go to send one and you

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.640
 see this vast selection and you think, God, none of these must ever get a look in ever.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.640
 And there's actually a Twitter account called at least used emoji,

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.640
 which kind of sandy for it doesn't seem to have tweeted since 2020.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.640
 But in 2020, the same one had been top of its list for 264 days,

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.640
 which I guess is when it gave up and thought this is the ultimate loser.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640
 And he guesses.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.640
 What am I doing with my life?

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.640
 Even bots get depressed.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640
 Okay.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.640
 Is this gettable?

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.640
 I don't know.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.640
 I mean, I guess it's one that you won't have seen very often.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640
 Is it an object?

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640
 No, it's a flag.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.640
 You'll never get it.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.640
 I've just realized the least used one is the symbol that is an ampersand,

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.640
 an equal sign, a musical note and a percentage sign.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640
 What is it?

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.640
 They come as one.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.640
 What is it?

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.640
 What does it mean?

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.640
 Well, I suppose no one's ever known.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640
 Which is why.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.640
 Because you don't really get package emojis.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.640
 Like that's like four really unpopular ones that have got together in a supergroup

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.640
 to try and bump themselves up.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.640
 Yeah.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.640
 It's the opposite of a supergroup, isn't it?

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.640
 They thought they would be the traveling wheel breeze and they, yeah.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640
 Also the tramway symbol.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.640
 I really thought, Andy, that you can't have been on Line March in 2020,

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.640
 given that that was the joint lease popular.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640
 Yeah.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.640
 An aerial tramway symbol.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.640
 Oh, I, I've already talked about that.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.640
 And it was a, it's a sort of hanging railway.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640
 It's a suspended railway.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640
 Yeah.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.640
 And I saw someone claiming that there's only one suspended railway

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.640
 and widespread use of the world nets in China,

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.640
 which is why the emoji is not used.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.640
 Actually, there is one in Germany, the Wuppertalsch Weberbahn,

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.640
 which is a very popular suspended railway.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.640
 Great.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640
 I just can't believe you won.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640
 And that's, I'm stupid now.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640
 That's where the train's like underneath the track.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640
 Yeah.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.640
 Right.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.640
 So I think it's that an emoji before and been like, why, what's that?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640
 But that is actually real.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.640
 I didn't, I didn't know.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.640
 Go to Wuppertal.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.640
 And you'll have a whale of a time.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.640
 It's, it's a really good, I think they put an elephant in it once.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640
 I've just had a memory that.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640
 Oh, it feels.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640
 Wow.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640
 Unnecessary, doesn't it?

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.640
 I can't.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640
 Can they?

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.640
 Oh, to prove that it clings to the top.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.640
 Like you can even put an elephant in it.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.640
 I think.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.640
 You know, really, I know.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.640
 Really.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.640
 I'm really doubting myself.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.640
 I've got to find out.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.640
 I've got to find out.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.640
 I'm not sure what you do.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.640
 You go quiet for a bit and then go, oh, did you put an elephant in it?

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.640
 Supposedly they put an elephant, they did put an elephant in it.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:36.640
 They put an elephant in the Wuppertal Schraberbahn in 1950 as a stunt either to promote the monorail

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.640
 or the circus.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.640
 Both.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.640
 Why not?

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.640
 And it fell in.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.640
 The panic had broken out in the carriage, which apparently also had passengers in it.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.640
 Oh my God.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.640
 Oh my God.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640
 This is bizarre.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.640
 This is insane.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.640
 I'm just on the Wikipedia for it now.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.640
 It was called Tuffy Was Fine and survived another 39 years.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.640
 I thought you meant he was fine.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.640
 I was going to be like, this is not his fault.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.640
 I haven't paid for a ticket, mate.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640
 Right.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640
 I'm glad he was okay.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640
 I'm famous in 1950.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640
 Oh, it was she.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.640
 She actually accidentally, obviously, fell from the Wuppertal Schraberbahn into the River

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.640
 Wuppa.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.640
 Oh, no.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.640
 But she survived.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.640
 Yep.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640
 For 39 years.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.640
 Yeah.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.640
 I'm going to keep that in mind.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.640
 How did she thought did they not shut the doors?

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:23.640
 Well, what it says here is that she was put on the monorail as a publicity stunt, tick.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.400
 Elephant trumpeted wildly and ran through the carriage, broke through a window and fell

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.640
 12 meters down into the river, suffering only minor injuries.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.640
 A panic had broken out in the carriage, naturally, and some passengers were injured.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.640
 That's right.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.640
 Big-ass window.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.640
 Yeah.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.640
 It's a big window.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.640
 Yeah.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640
 Or small elephant.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.640
 Small elephant.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.640
 Not African elephant.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.640
 It depends how you're looking at it.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:57.640
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.640
 My fact is that there is a fish that spends its entire life upside down.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.640
 Is it trying to make the moon look smaller?

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.640
 That's right.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.640
 This is a fact.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.640
 It was sent in, actually, by Kate Glyzinski.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.640
 So, thank you, Kate.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.640
 It's about a kind of anglerfish.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.640
 Sorry, that does sound like a pseudonym for Anna.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640
 Kate Glyzinski.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640
 Yeah.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.640
 Absolutely right.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.640
 This was sent in by Anna.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.640
 So, anglerfish are the ones which they have a tentacle and they have like a fishing rod

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.640
 sticking out of their head, and then they use the end of the rod.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.640
 There's got a little glowing ball of light on it, and they use that to attract prey to them.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.640
 It's pretty incredible.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.640
 We say it casually.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.640
 It's amazing.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.640
 But you've got a light bulb hanging off your face.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640
 Absolutely amazing.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.640
 Well, and it's bacteria that is lighting it up as well.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.640
 It's not like an actual light bulb.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640
 It is an actual...

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640
 Hang on.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.640
 You've got to feed the rod for them to...

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640
 It's so weird.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.640
 Yeah.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640
 It's genuinely amazing.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.640
 And sometimes they accidentally chew their own tentacle sort of thing.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.640
 Because they close their mouth and they go, you know, and then they obviously sometimes

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.640
 they trap themselves.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.640
 Ow!

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.640
 Anyway.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640
 Like biting your tongue, basically.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640
 They're light.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.640
 So this is the whip nose anglerfish.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.640
 And for years it was just assumed that it went the right way up.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.640
 It just went around the right way up.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.640
 Yeah.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.640
 People assumed that.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.640
 Because we've only seen dead ones, presumably, with anglerfish, right?

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.640
 You don't obviously see them in the wild.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.640
 Yeah, because they live very, very deep in the deep ocean.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.640
 And it was assumed to be upright.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.640
 An upright fish.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.640
 Like all fish.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.640
 But they got some camera footage in 1999 of one of these swimming around the ocean,

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.640
 upside down with the fishing rod dangling down beneath it.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640
 Very weird.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640
 They thought, what a weird...

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.640
 What a weird one or fish.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:43.640
 But they keep finding these, like deep sea drones, keep filming these anglerfish swimming

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640
 around upside down.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.640
 And it appears they spend their whole life swimming upside down to attract prey.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.640
 But apparently it is better for it so that it doesn't bite itself.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.640
 That's in part of the description of the whip nose.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640
 Yeah, it's just helpful.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.640
 It just gives it a tiny bit more of an advantage.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.640
 It's quite cute.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.640
 They're very cool, anyway.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.640
 They are weird anglerfish.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.640
 Anglerfish are insane.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.640
 They do this thing, and I know I always get too surprised by this, but evolution.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.640
 What a great idea.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.640
 So one of the things is that it's bioluminescent in that rod.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.640
 But also it will eat a lot of fish that are bioluminescent.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.640
 And an anglerfish has a really elastic kind of tummy, very rubbery.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.640
 So it can eat things that are almost twice its size.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.640
 And so it goes quite transparent, except it doesn't, because there's black lining on the inside.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.640
 So you can't see the bioluminescence inside it.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.640
 So it can't attract predators if there's something inside swimming around that's still not dead.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.640
 Kind of like a car that has tinted windows.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.640
 You don't know what's inside the car, but you can...

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.640
 It is on purpose so that it's not gone transparent.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.640
 Like I went to the gym once and my leggings had gone see-through and everyone could see my knickers and butt.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.640
 That's the opposite.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:58.640
 If I was an anglerfish, I could have just made my leggings more opaque, for example.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.640
 One of the many reasons to want to be one.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640
 That really puts it in context.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.640
 It really brings it down to earth, or up to earth.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:14.640
 This one that you mentioned, Andy, the whipnose is a classic anglerfish in that it's just the females you're talking about.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.640
 It's pretty much whenever anyone talks about cool stuff with anglerfish, it's just the ladies.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.640
 Because they are way bigger than the males.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.640
 So in the whipnose ones, then the females are like half a metre and the males are two centimetres.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:33.640
 And I think there's another kind of anglerfish which has the Guinness record for the biggest dimorphism between males and females.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:43.640
 And this I find so hard to believe, but Guinness says that the females are more than 60 times the length of the males and half a million times as heavy.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.640
 That's crazy.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.640
 The mating is very wild.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640
 The mating is odd.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640
 I think the mating is...

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.640
 Basically, the male sort of latches onto the female, just kind of bites the side of her.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.640
 And then fuses and then dissolves into her.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.640
 And all that's left is a tiny pair of testicles.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.640
 Oh my god, that's incredible.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640
 That's basically it.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.640
 Their skin and their organs all fuse together.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.640
 And for a long time, I think they assumed that there wasn't a male in the picture at all, right?

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.640
 They just thought it was female.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.640
 Actually, you're looking.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640
 That's him.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640
 Testicles!

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.640
 I know those testicles anywhere.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.640
 This is great.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.640
 We all know couples like that.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.640
 I wonder if that's what the perfect distance is.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.640
 Kind of like with the eclipse of a moon and the sun, that you could have the male anglerfish near you and the female.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.640
 That they will appear to be the same size.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.640
 Do you get females, don't you, which have lots of pairs of testicles just hanging off them?

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.640
 Yeah, you get six or seven males will have been fused into one female at once.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.640
 Really?

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.640
 And it's just like, you know, have you had many previous boyfriends?

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.640
 No, actually, you don't need to tell me.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.640
 Oh, it's like a brownie sash with your badge just that you've collected.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.640
 That's how you explain this to your five-year-old.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.640
 That's really brownies.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.640
 Oh, no, they're brilliant.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640
 They're so good.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.640
 They are.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.640
 Yeah.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.640
 And they do, when they're lava, they look really cool.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.640
 And there's not enough focus on this in the anglerfish world of chat.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.640
 They, when they're lava, they're surrounded by this jelly egg.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.640
 So that is transparent.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:19.640
 And so you'll see this tiny little anglerfish and then it's got this big see-through pile of jelly around it.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640
 Like, absorbing.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640
 Like, absorbing, exactly.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.640
 Really?

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.640
 Yeah.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.640
 That's very cool.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.640
 All absorbing.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.640
 You guys have seen an anglerfish in person?

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.640
 No, not in the flesh.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.640
 Not in the flesh.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.640
 I've met one.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.640
 Get away.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640
 I met one.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640
 I met a very famous one.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:40.640
 I met the one that basically was in Blue Planet that was discovered by all your celebrity anecdotes.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.640
 Names dropping.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.640
 So exhausting.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.640
 Are you a close personal friend of this anglerfish?

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.640
 I was at a cocktail party with her.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.640
 We got chatting.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.640
 I don't even remember you, Dan, okay?

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.640
 How many testicles did she have on her?

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.640
 No, so years ago I got to work with Alistair Fathergill.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.640
 He came on Museum of Curiosity and he's the person who found the hairy anglerfish.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.640
 So he went down and he filmed it.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:10.640
 They, so you filmed it for an a half, isn't it?

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.640
 Did he show you his hairy anglerfish?

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.640
 Fly me.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.640
 So they brought it back up and it dies in the process.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.640
 Oh, when they died, did their lights go out?

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.640
 Like a Pixar.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.640
 It might do.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.640
 But they would live on, wouldn't they?

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640
 They would.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640
 That's even sadder.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.640
 This is the nuts thing.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.640
 It's that they're bacteria.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.640
 And I was reading a thing.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640
 How do they get these bacteria?

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.640
 Because normally when hosts have symbionts, you know, things living on them that rely on them,

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.640
 they either find them in the local area or they, um, or they inherit them.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.640
 Bacteria wants to live on your nose.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.640
 Um, no, but they sometimes inherit them from their parents with other animals.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.640
 But anglerfish never have any contact with their parents.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.640
 It will be insane for them to.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.640
 His dad's been dissolved.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.640
 Come say hi to your father.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640
 He's like, what?

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:11.640
 Give him a little jiggle.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.640
 It was a real male role model.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.640
 Um, but no, they don't get their lure until much later in life, even.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.640
 So they must find them in their area.

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.640
 They must pick them up from around the place and they have them on the end of their nose.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.640
 What if they, like, didn't find enough?

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.640
 That would be like a Pixar film, like the anglerfish that couldn't find the bacteria.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.640
 That's a good one.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.640
 That's good.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.640
 Don't maybe edit that out so I can write it.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.640
 Yeah.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640
 Please don't.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.640
 I will never write that.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.640
 Yeah.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.640
 Um, I found something that swims, but it can never be upside down.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.640
 Ooh.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.640
 What are they doing to me this?

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.640
 Okay.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.640
 What could that be?

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.640
 Something big and flat like this.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.640
 My vision.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.640
 Like a manta ray?

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.640
 Maybe they're big and flat, but they can't.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640
 They swim, but they, no.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640
 No.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640
 Right.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.640
 A starfish.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640
 Not a starfish.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640
 Stupid.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640
 A ball.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640
 A ball.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.640
 A ball.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.640
 A ball has no upside down.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.640
 A boat.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.640
 Do they swim?

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.640
 Oh, okay.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.640
 A water boat.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.800
 - Yes, you probably are.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.980
 - The answer is the word swims.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.560
 - Smooth.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.400
 - Swims is an ambegram.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.880
 You flip it upside down and it's exactly the same.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.200
 - I've got my hot.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.480
 - Wow, with arousal.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.560
 - Yes, I'm incredibly aroused.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.400
 - That's amazing.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.600
 - I love that stuff.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.520
 - That's really good.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.000
 That is great. - That is great.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.160
 - That's really lovely stuff, Dan.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.000
 - That's a good riddle.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.080
 - Who would have thought?

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.920
 - The riddle. - The riddle.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920
 - Finally.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.200
 - You can stay.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.400
 - You've passed the audition.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.560
 - I said a boat.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.560
 - What the fuck are you saying?

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.200
 (laughing)

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.080
 - That's why I'm hostess podcast.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.720
 - They don't swim and they can be upside down.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.560
 - Namely.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:55.520
 - Just another thing on how fish swim.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.680
 Do you know how to tell if a fish is depressed?

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.320
 - Oh, no, don't.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.400
 - Is that too sad?

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.240
 - Okay.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.080
 - 'Cause we've got a cure.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.920
 - Great.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.760
 - There you go.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.600
 - What a roller coaster.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.440
 - I know.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.280
 (laughing)

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.640
 - So you only said the fact yet, please.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.480
 - That's the cure.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.300
 Come on, the podcast.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.560
 It'll raise your spirits right up.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.960
 - What's the cure?

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.920
 - Well, antidepressants.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.480
 And we only have a cure because we've trialled

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.080
 human antidepressants on them to make them better.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.160
 But, how do you know that they're depressed?

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.400
 - So they swim at the bottom of their tanks.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.240
 So depressed fish swim low and happy fish swim

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.440
 at the top of the surface of the water

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.720
 or the top of their tanks.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.480
 And this is actually really useful

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.640
 according to scientists who do trial antidepressants

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.560
 because it's a really obvious sign that they're depressed.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.200
 So we can trial antidepressants on them

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.760
 and we know if they're working.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.600
 And they--

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.440
 - They just go higher.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.600
 - 'Cause they just get higher and higher.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.440
 So you go, "Oh, pros out.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.280
 "That's doing the trick."

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.200
 Look, it's like in the air.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.040
 - It's out of the water.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.240
 (laughing)

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.200
 - Is it true or have I just made this up in my brain

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.560
 that goldfish grow to fill their tanks?

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.160
 If you actually give them a bigger tank,

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.000
 they just keep going.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.840
 - That is true.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.560
 - And that's so sad in retrospect.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.360
 Because when I was growing up,

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.080
 we had just a little tank with three fish

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.680
 and you're like, "God, we were sort of shrinking off the tank."

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.280
 - That's a thing when people throw them into the wild

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.240
 into little lakes and so on.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.880
 They just turn into these turbo sharks.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.480
 - Exactly, you were doing a public service

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.720
 by keeping them from, you know, taking over.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.240
 Upside downness?

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.080
 Sure.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.320
 This is a very weird thing.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.320
 Which is better for a rhino to be?

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:32.560
 Upside down or not upside down, lying down?

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.440
 - Is it in the circus?

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.600
 - It's not in the circus.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.440
 - It's not.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.280
 - Okay.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.080
 - Let me take you to the Vupetage favor button.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.920
 No, okay.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.760
 It's better for a rhino to be upside down

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.640
 than it is for it to be lying on its side.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.480
 Isn't that weird?

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.320
 - How does it get there?

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.160
 Why?

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.640
 - Well, I think we might have mentioned a while ago.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.840
 - We've done this about the rhinos.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.920
 - They transport rhinos to new areas

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.040
 by putting them in a helicopter,

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.040
 stringing them up by their ankles.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.880
 - No, not in the helicopter.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.040
 (laughing)

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.960
 - No, they hogtie them.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.800
 - Right.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.160
 - They lift them up upside down

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.160
 and then they fly to the new nature reserve

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.000
 where they have to get them to.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.200
 It's the easiest way to transport them.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.040
 - Okay.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.200
 - It takes like 10 or 15 minutes.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.040
 It's really fast.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.980
 And no--

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.820
 - What depends on the distance?

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.800
 - Regardless of where they go.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.640
 (laughing)

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.760
 - And on traffic.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.080
 But they're normally not taking them

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.480
 like from South Africa to Tunisia.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.080
 You know, it's not like a short journey.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.840
 But nobody had checked how their hearts and lungs

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.000
 actually cope with this journey.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.400
 And a team of scientists,

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.920
 led by Robin Radcliffe from Cornell,

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.560
 realized oh, we should probably look into

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.400
 whether or not they're--

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.240
 - Yeah, they're like--

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.080
 - Incredibly upset.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.920
 - Oh my gosh.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.200
 And so they held 12 rhinos upside down by their feet

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.260
 for an experiment from a crane.

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:46.320
 And they're also dated, obviously.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.880
 But they were just testing their heart and lungs.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.560
 And it turns out that it's much better

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.400
 for it to be upside down.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.000
 Because when a rhino's on its side,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.360
 their lungs are a bit distorted.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.600
 You know, the gravity means--

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.440
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.360
 - The lungs are not getting equal amounts of oxygen

00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.280
 for the air exchange and all of that gas exchange.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.240
 But when they're upside down,

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.120
 it is equal because they're just upside down.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.960
 - Lovely.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.780
 - So--

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.620
 - When they sleep, they go upside down.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.560
 - They go upside down, yeah, yeah.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.560
 - Like on their backs.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.640
 - Liners, yeah, yeah.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.000
 If you go for a walk in certain bits of Namibia,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.120
 you'll look up in the trees

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.040
 and you can see hanging from the trees.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:14.880
 - Stop it.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.560
 (laughing)

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.920
 - I just want to be wrong on the back.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920
 It's all I'm meant for.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.480
 - I don't think they like it.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.320
 - They should.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.160
 - They should.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.000
 - They should.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.920
 There are like rhino articles on the web.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.880
 You've been sleeping all wrong your whole life.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.860
 (laughing)

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.880
 - There is another fish that swims upside down.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.720
 - Ooh.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.560
 - Well, it's not actually a fish.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.680
 It's krill, not technically a fish, I suppose.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.840
 (laughing)

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.560
 - Forstalling the letters, very nice.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.800
 (laughing)

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.640
 - Antarctic krill swim upside down in the Antarctic

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.080
 when the water's covered in ice

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.400
 so that they can graze like cows on the underside of the ice.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.240
 - Gorgeous.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.200
 - And they eat algae that grows

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.520
 on the underside of the ice.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.080
 And they live such a weird life.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.760
 They migrate, quite weird migration, but up and down.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.620
 So they graze on algae swimming upside down

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.620
 and then they get quite fat and heavy from it.

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.860
 And then they sink 'cause they're too heavy

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.140
 and they have to fan themselves out like a parachute

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.380
 and they sink about 50 meters down

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.980
 and then they think, oh God, I'm really hungry again.

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.420
 So then they've used up all their food supply.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.780
 So then they have to swim up to the top again, eat

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.580
 and then sink and that's their lives.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.940
 And they do about three times a day for their whole lives.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.780
 - Wow.

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.660
 - And then they die.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:25.380
 - I go to the fridge more than three times a day.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.460
 I'm just saying I empathize.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.020
 That's my life too.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.480
 - It's like your whole life upside down.

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.800
 - Go back and forth for a food source.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.800
 Yeah, it kind of is when you think about it.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.640
 - You're so right.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.480
 It's what we all do, isn't it?

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.160
 - I'm at work, I then go downstairs, I guess food.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.280
 And he's always got a plate of something

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.480
 that he just comes up with something on the go.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.720
 - Oh, I thought you Dan were saying

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.480
 that is kind of our light and philosophical way.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.840
 - Oh, I thought you were saying that.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.680
 - Yeah, I thought that.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.000
 - And I was just saying yes too.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.160
 - The only reason they don't have a podcast

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.800
 is it's too wet for all the equipment.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.520
 (all laughing)

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.360
 That's fine.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.940
 (upbeat music)

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.140
 (upbeat music)

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.340
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.540
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.460

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.940
 - @AndrewHondaM, various.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.260
 (laughing)

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.080
 That's Stevie.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.420
 - Mastodon only.

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.580
 (laughing)

 Now I'm on Twitter and Instagram @stevm.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.300
 If the S is a five, I regret it.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.140
 - Right.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.140
 (laughing)

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.140
 And if you wanna get to us as a group, Anna,

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:32.980
 where do they go?

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.180
 - You can tweet @NoSuchThing

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.260
 or email podcast@QI.com.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.620
 - Yep, or you can go to our group account,

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.900
 which is @NoSuchThing.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.520

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.620
 so do check them out.

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.140
 Also, lots of bits of merch,

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.980
 and also there's the clubfish entrance point.

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.980
 Join us, get access to all those fun things,

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.060
 like Drop Us Align,

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.820
 all the extra bonus shows that we do.

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:52.660
 That's all there.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.380
 Anyway, otherwise, just come back next week.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:55.820
 We'll be back with another episode,

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:56.720
 and we'll see you then.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.060
 Goodbye.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.640
