00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, Andy here."
00:00:04,00:00:08,"Just before we start this week's episode, wanted to introduce you to our special guest."
00:00:08,00:00:11,This week's guest is the brilliant Stevie Martin.
00:00:11,00:00:13,"If you haven't heard of Stevie, you are in for a treat."
00:00:13,00:00:15,She is a fantastic comedian.
00:00:15,00:00:16,Everything she makes is good.
00:00:16,00:00:18,She makes wonderful sketches.
00:00:18,00:00:19,She's in shows.
00:00:19,00:00:20,She's on stuff.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"And if you want to hear more of her after this episode, which you will, check out her"
00:00:24,00:00:27,"podcast which is called ""Nobody Panic""."
00:00:27,00:00:28,It's a great show.
00:00:28,00:00:31,It contains advice about absolutely everything in the world.
00:00:31,00:00:32,How to do your taxes.
00:00:32,00:00:34,How to brush your hair.
00:00:34,00:00:38,"Some even funnier things than that, can you believe it?"
00:00:38,00:00:39,And it's a great show.
00:00:39,00:00:43,"I think I did an episode recently which is coming up for release, but just start listening"
00:00:43,00:00:44,to that now.
00:00:44,00:00:45,"Once again, it's called ""Nobody Panic""."
00:00:45,00:00:47,Hope you enjoy this show.
00:00:47,00:00:48,On with the podcast.
00:00:48,00:01:11,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:11,00:01:13,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:13,00:01:14,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:14,00:01:18,"I'm sitting here with Andrew Honto Murray, Anna Toshinsky, and Stevie Martin."
00:01:18,00:01:22,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:01:22,00:01:26,"from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:01:26,00:01:29,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Stevie."
00:01:29,00:01:36,"My fact is that Australia is wider than the moon, except technically it's not."
00:01:36,00:01:37,What?
00:01:37,00:01:38,Hello.
00:01:38,00:01:39,You can't row back row back.
00:01:39,00:01:40,I did some verification.
00:01:40,00:01:41,I think you're absolutely right.
00:01:41,00:01:42,Come on.
00:01:42,00:01:51,"Back myself more says my mom, but so it is, if I was looking at it, it would be, but"
00:01:51,00:01:57,"if I was like taking into account surface area, perhaps, and the fact that it's a sphere,"
00:01:57,00:01:58,that's all right.
00:01:58,00:01:59,That's not what you said.
00:01:59,00:02:00,"Yeah, man."
00:02:00,00:02:01,Why does?
00:02:01,00:02:02,Why does?
00:02:02,00:02:03,"We moved Australia, so it's in the place of the moon."
00:02:03,00:02:04,Yeah.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"It would be, it would cover it from left to right and then some."
00:02:06,00:02:07,Like an eclipse.
00:02:07,00:02:11,"Like it could, you could move the moon and it would block the sun, possibly."
00:02:11,00:02:12,Would it?
00:02:12,00:02:13,"Australia, yeah."
00:02:13,00:02:14,It may not be tall enough.
00:02:14,00:02:15,I don't know.
00:02:15,00:02:16,Is Australia quite flat?
00:02:16,00:02:18,Is it a flat boy from the top to the bottom?
00:02:18,00:02:19,It's white.
00:02:19,00:02:21,I think that you would get bits of moon poking out.
00:02:21,00:02:24,"I don't think there's any Australia arrangement that totally covers the moon, but it's definitely"
00:02:24,00:02:25,wider left to right.
00:02:25,00:02:26,There's no doubt.
00:02:26,00:02:30,"You might be able to cut bits off or move Tasmania, for instance, to one of the poking"
00:02:30,00:02:31,out bits.
00:02:31,00:02:32,They'd love that.
00:02:32,00:02:33,They'd love that.
00:02:33,00:02:34,Politically controversial plan already.
00:02:34,00:02:37,Feels like they probably had to put up with a lot.
00:02:37,00:02:38,I don't know.
00:02:38,00:02:40,I don't know anything about it.
00:02:40,00:02:43,"So the moon is about three and a half thousand kilometres across and Australia's about, when"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"we look at it in the sky, Australia's about 4,000 kilometres."
00:02:46,00:02:48,"Yeah, it's about 4,000, yeah."
00:02:48,00:02:53,"Did you know that the smallest moon of Jupiter, which is so small, it's called, just called"
00:02:53,00:02:58,"Jupiter, L-I-I, it doesn't have a name, is the same size as Vatican City?"
00:02:58,00:02:59,Is it?
00:02:59,00:03:00,Yeah.
00:03:00,00:03:01,It's almost not worth it.
00:03:01,00:03:02,It's not worth it.
00:03:02,00:03:04,Do we know it's a moon?
00:03:04,00:03:08,Does anyone know what the smallest amount has to be for it to be a moon?
00:03:08,00:03:09,"Oh, there are all sorts of..."
00:03:09,00:03:10,Is it the Vatican City?
00:03:10,00:03:11,Is that it?
00:03:11,00:03:12,"That's it, yeah."
00:03:12,00:03:13,Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:14,"If it can have a pope, it's a moon."
00:03:14,00:03:15,It's a moon?
00:03:15,00:03:16,That's it.
00:03:16,00:03:17,It's hugely contentious.
00:03:17,00:03:19,That question's hugely contentious in that world.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Okay, we'll get emails, just dozens, hundreds of emails now that you've asked it."
00:03:22,00:03:23,"Wait, yeah."
00:03:23,00:03:24,Doesn't the moon have a bishop?
00:03:24,00:03:27,"I'm sure we've vaguely said this in the past, that there is a guy whose role is a bishop"
00:03:27,00:03:28,of the moon.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Oh, yes, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:32,"When they tried to claim it as theirs, yeah, and they got given its own bishop."
00:03:32,00:03:34,"I mean, I think self-proclaimed."
00:03:34,00:03:40,"Is that like when I was 14, my mom bought me a little plot of land on the moon, and"
00:03:40,00:03:41,you get a little deed.
00:03:41,00:03:42,So I got a deed.
00:03:42,00:03:43,"Oh, no."
00:03:43,00:03:44,You did that.
00:03:44,00:03:49,So there's any mineral rights in maybe a centimetre square somewhere on the moon.
00:03:49,00:03:50,You'll get none of it.
00:03:50,00:03:54,"I will get none of it, because it's not legally binding, because I'm sure she bought it like"
00:03:54,00:03:55,a paper chase.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"But the bishop thing, I think, checks out."
00:03:58,00:04:00,Imagine if there was a bishop in my bit.
00:04:00,00:04:01,That's it.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"Well, that's why the Pope Mobile has that dome over the top, the bubbles."
00:04:03,00:04:04,Because people own it.
00:04:04,00:04:07,"It's so that if he needs to, he can operate in a lunar environment."
00:04:07,00:04:08,Yes.
00:04:08,00:04:13,"I also own a small square of the Pope as well, so I got my 15th birthday."
00:04:13,00:04:16,"Wouldn't it be crazy for the UN or whoever it is to say, right, we are going to divide"
00:04:16,00:04:19,"up the moon, but we've decided that paper chase are the people who are going to administer"
00:04:19,00:04:21,this system.
00:04:21,00:04:23,You do need people to do admin.
00:04:23,00:04:24,You do.
00:04:24,00:04:25,You do.
00:04:25,00:04:26,They might have put in the best bid.
00:04:26,00:04:27,You're absolutely right.
00:04:27,00:04:28,I don't think that's too far a crazy idea.
00:04:28,00:04:30,They've got the paper to make the certificates.
00:04:30,00:04:31,I think it's a really...
00:04:31,00:04:32,It was high GS ads.
00:04:32,00:04:33,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:33,00:04:34,It was.
00:04:34,00:04:37,Here's an interesting thing.
00:04:37,00:04:41,"So the space between the moon and the earth, right?"
00:04:41,00:04:42,Yeah.
00:04:42,00:04:46,"So that is roughly, because it changes all the time, but like it's furthest."
00:04:46,00:04:50,It's big enough that you could take all of our planets in the solar system and you could
00:04:50,00:04:54,"put them next to each other in one big row and they would all fit between the space,"
00:04:54,00:04:55,between the earth and the moon.
00:04:55,00:04:56,No.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Yeah, that is weird."
00:04:57,00:04:58,How?
00:04:58,00:04:59,It's not extraordinary.
00:04:59,00:05:00,Sorry.
00:05:00,00:05:06,"I forgot to mention, I'm not true to it."
00:05:06,00:05:11,I always think we don't make a massive enough deal about the coincidence of the moon and
00:05:11,00:05:15,"the sun and the fact that we can have a full eclipse, right?"
00:05:15,00:05:20,Because the only reason we can have a full solar eclipse is the fact that the moon and
00:05:20,00:05:24,the sun look exactly the same size to us on earth.
00:05:24,00:05:25,And that's just a total coincidence.
00:05:25,00:05:29,It's just proportionally the size of the moon and the distance of the moon from us
00:05:29,00:05:31,makes it the same size to us.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"And then in a million years, when the, because the moon's moving away like a few centimetres"
00:05:34,00:05:39,"a year, we won't have full eclipses anymore because it'll be too far away to cover the"
00:05:39,00:05:40,entirety of the sun.
00:05:40,00:05:41,Yeah.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Yeah.
00:05:42,00:05:43,And the chances were just infinitismally tiny.
00:05:43,00:05:46,And I think that is evidence for a higher power.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"If ever there was it, the fact that they're basically the same size to us."
00:05:49,00:05:53,"I like the idea that in the future, when it's, when the moon is smaller and it goes across,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,it'll make the sun look like a bagel.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:56,00:05:58,"A really stingy bagel, though."
00:05:58,00:06:01,Why don't you get your bagel that thin with a huge hole?
00:06:01,00:06:02,Yeah.
00:06:02,00:06:03,I like that.
00:06:03,00:06:08,Can I tell you about the first Australian person to go to space?
00:06:08,00:06:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:09,00:06:11,Paul Desmond Scully Power.
00:06:11,00:06:12,Cool.
00:06:12,00:06:16,It's the first ever astronaut.
00:06:16,00:06:17,I'm calling him.
00:06:17,00:06:18,Nice.
00:06:18,00:06:19,I did try and find online if anyone's used that.
00:06:19,00:06:21,I don't think anyone's says astronaut.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Maybe because...
00:06:22,00:06:23,Trade market now.
00:06:23,00:06:24,It happened to one guy.
00:06:24,00:06:27,"Also, it could be like Austrian as well, so it's kind of confusing."
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:28,00:06:29,That'll lead to heaps of confusion.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Yeah, sorry."
00:06:30,00:06:31,I was confused.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Duns and duns.
00:06:32,00:06:35,But he was also the first astronaut with a beard.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Wow.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:41,"In the grapity, his beard would be flip more of the place like he was a wizard."
00:06:41,00:06:42,Exactly.
00:06:42,00:06:45,Was it like my beard or we talking Gandalf?
00:06:45,00:06:46,It's in between...
00:06:46,00:06:48,"He didn't have a Gandalf beard, very sadly."
00:06:48,00:06:52,"I think even NASA did try and make him shave and he said, ""No, it's fine."""
00:06:52,00:06:56,"So they tried to make a joke, they said it won't form an airtight seal and presumably"
00:06:56,00:06:57,Eula's Fixie-8.
00:06:57,00:07:00,And he said obviously it'll be all right and it won't make a risk.
00:07:00,00:07:03,She'll be right.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"He is so Aussie, it's brilliant."
00:07:05,00:07:09,He said going to space was just one of those things that happened because he started off
00:07:09,00:07:15,as an oceanographer and then he liked surfing and was studying maths and then he got into
00:07:15,00:07:19,"the Aussie Navy and then he exchanged over to the US Navy and they said, ""We need someone"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"to do a naval study, an ocean study rather from space."""
00:07:22,00:07:24,So do you want to get on board?
00:07:24,00:07:25,And he did.
00:07:25,00:07:28,He's founded a drone company called The Ripper Group.
00:07:28,00:07:30,He's created Shark Finding AI.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Oh my God.
00:07:31,00:07:32,He's just like...
00:07:32,00:07:35,It's in his contract conforming to stereotype.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Really?
00:07:36,00:07:38,We'll only let you up there if...
00:07:38,00:07:39,I know.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"As the shuttle was about to take off, you know, you're sitting like, I guess you're facing"
00:07:42,00:07:45,"the sky so you're sort of lying on your back beneath the chair, right?"
00:07:45,00:07:46,What did he do?
00:07:46,00:07:47,He fell asleep.
00:07:47,00:07:48,No!
00:07:48,00:07:49,Okay.
00:07:49,00:07:51,"And he was like, ""He like barbecued something."""
00:07:51,00:07:52,Exactly.
00:07:52,00:07:56,He stood in a surf position as he went up.
00:07:56,00:08:01,And his beard was sort of parted as they went...
00:08:01,00:08:08,"That's all you could see is the rocket left the atmosphere, two strands of beard."
00:08:08,00:08:10,"Anyway, what a guy."
00:08:10,00:08:11,What's he named?
00:08:11,00:08:12,What's he called?
00:08:12,00:08:14,He's called Paul Desmond Scully Power.
00:08:14,00:08:15,What a great name.
00:08:15,00:08:16,Yeah.
00:08:16,00:08:17,Paul Power.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Paul Power.
00:08:18,00:08:19,That's brilliant.
00:08:19,00:08:26,"There's just, speaking of the moon and Australia, I found a really cool thing online and it's"
00:08:26,00:08:29,"an interactive page and it's created, is this website that's created by the people who wrote"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"a book called Cosmos, the Infographic Book of Space, which I think has loads of really"
00:08:34,00:08:37,"cool infographics about space in it, as you'd expect."
00:08:37,00:08:38,Whoa!
00:08:38,00:08:44,"So, Shane, they couldn't nail that onto the camera somehow."
00:08:44,00:08:46,They needed me writing their subtitles.
00:08:46,00:08:51,"Your Amazon reviews of books are so shit right now, they're so bad."
00:08:51,00:08:55,"Anyway, they've also got a website and they have this whole interactive section and one"
00:08:55,00:09:00,"of the interactive sections, which I strongly amend that you Google, is you can see how"
00:09:00,00:09:04,high a human or a kangaroo could jump on various celestial bodies.
00:09:04,00:09:08,"So they'll drop down, you can select human or kangaroo, no other things."
00:09:08,00:09:13,"Because they're the two main ones that would go into space and then, yeah, you can see"
00:09:13,00:09:14,how high they jump.
00:09:14,00:09:21,"So, on the moon, we could jump three metres, pretty good, kangaroo, eleven metres, better."
00:09:21,00:09:22,It's always better than kangaroo.
00:09:22,00:09:23,That's good to say.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"It's relative, isn't it?"
00:09:26,00:09:27,It's really fun.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Quite a lot.
00:09:28,00:09:31,It really tricks you and I've wasted a lot of time because it has things like some of
00:09:31,00:09:34,the tiniest moons in the solar system and it'll do see how high you could jump on this
00:09:34,00:09:38,and you click jump and then you sit there as it goes up and up and it doesn't really tell
00:09:38,00:09:41,you if it's going to go on forever or if it's going to stop at some point.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"So I did sit there for about eight minutes watching it go up and up thinking, I wonder"
00:09:44,00:09:46,if I'm coming back down and sometimes you don't.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Really?
00:09:47,00:09:54,"Yeah, well, it's a bit sad, don't jump from asteroids and stuff."
00:09:54,00:09:59,"You know how the moon looks too big, it looks bigger than it is when we look at it."
00:09:59,00:10:00,Too big.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"When you look at the moon and the nice guy, what a beautiful moon, then you take a photo"
00:10:02,00:10:03,and there's a dot.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Yes.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Oh.
00:10:05,00:10:06,I did that this morning.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Right.
00:10:07,00:10:08,Yes.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"And it's really weird, it's a weird effect."
00:10:09,00:10:10,"Yeah, why is that, though?"
00:10:10,00:10:17,"Well, we sort of prioritise it more with our eyes, but there are various reasons why, sometimes"
00:10:17,00:10:21,the moon looks very big near the horizon because it's closer to things that we recognise like
00:10:21,00:10:25,"houses or trees or whatever, you sort of see it in reference to those and you think it's"
00:10:25,00:10:26,bigger than it is.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"But wait, are you saying that it takes you so long to grapple to get your camera that"
00:10:29,00:10:32,by the time you've taken the photo it's actually moved up into the sky?
00:10:32,00:10:35,"No, because even when you look at it in the night sky it looks bigger to our eyes than"
00:10:35,00:10:36,it does on a camera.
00:10:36,00:10:37,Okay.
00:10:37,00:10:38,Cameras are telling the truth.
00:10:38,00:10:42,"But there is a way of negating the effect of the moon, this effect of it looking too"
00:10:42,00:10:43,"big, which is look at it upside down."
00:10:43,00:10:44,Oh.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,How do I turn my head up?
00:10:46,00:10:47,I do a headstand.
00:10:47,00:10:48,You go to Australia.
00:10:48,00:10:49,You go to Australia.
00:10:49,00:10:54,You put your head between your legs as you're standing there and it looks the right size
00:10:54,00:10:55,again.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Really?
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Yeah, this was studied by two Japanese scientists."
00:10:57,00:10:59,They wanted an ignoble prize for their paper.
00:10:59,00:11:02,"That's for telling people to put their head between their legs, look at me."
00:11:02,00:11:05,Perceived size and perceived distance of targets for you from between the legs.
00:11:05,00:11:09,"I almost want to disagree with them, but it's a fact."
00:11:09,00:11:10,You haven't tried it.
00:11:10,00:11:11,True.
00:11:11,00:11:13,"But next time you're out on a romantic night time stroll and the person you're with says,"
00:11:13,00:11:14,"""Look at the lovely moon."""
00:11:14,00:11:18,"You can say to them, ""No, look at it between your legs and we'll see it."""
00:11:18,00:11:19,That works.
00:11:19,00:11:24,"You know, like sometimes, I think it was the last year, you could see Jupiter really well"
00:11:24,00:11:29,"next to the moon and yeah, I looked at some planes, but then I also did see Jupiter."
00:11:29,00:11:31,"So if I looked between my legs, it would look like Jupiter."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Yes.
00:11:32,00:11:33,It brings it closer.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"Oh wait, no, it's a make it smaller."
00:11:35,00:11:36,It looks smaller.
00:11:36,00:11:37,It looks smaller between your legs.
00:11:37,00:11:38,"Oh, for God's sake."
00:11:38,00:11:39,So I want to be opposite.
00:11:39,00:11:40,"Okay, fine, Ryan."
00:11:40,00:11:41,Could we have a leg stream ahead?
00:11:41,00:11:42,It'll bring it for Ryan.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Okay.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"Good, thank you."
00:11:46,00:11:47,Check this out.
00:11:47,00:11:51,"I don't fully understand the science of this, but I find it amazing because it's true."
00:11:51,00:11:57,"And that is that on a rainy day, if the moon is overhead, it's going to rain less."
00:11:57,00:11:58,I know.
00:11:58,00:11:59,Yeah.
00:11:59,00:12:00,That frightens me on a very deep level.
00:12:00,00:12:01,On a rainy day.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:03,"If the moon is overhead, it's going to rain less."
00:12:03,00:12:07,"So if the moon, rather than like sometimes you see the moon, which is like closer to"
00:12:07,00:12:08,horizontal.
00:12:08,00:12:09,On the horizon.
00:12:09,00:12:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:12:10,00:12:11,"And then you get high in the sky, right?"
00:12:11,00:12:12,The moon.
00:12:12,00:12:13,Yeah.
00:12:13,00:12:14,Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:15,Different spots.
00:12:15,00:12:17,"When it's there, let's say it's a cloudy day and it's raining, it's going to rain less."
00:12:17,00:12:18,But it's already.
00:12:18,00:12:19,Is it the gravitational pull?
00:12:19,00:12:20,Is it sucking?
00:12:20,00:12:21,Yeah.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Sucking in the rain?
00:12:22,00:12:23,Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:24,So the rain goes off in the air towards the moon?
00:12:24,00:12:25,What are you saying?
00:12:25,00:12:26,Space rain is what happens.
00:12:26,00:12:27,"Upside down, space rain."
00:12:27,00:12:28,Okay.
00:12:28,00:12:34,"Well, it just doesn't, it just, it stays within the atmosphere."
00:12:34,00:12:35,Yeah.
00:12:35,00:12:36,Exactly.
00:12:36,00:12:37,Close.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"So the gravitational pull with the moon, it's all to do with the kind of pressure that"
00:12:39,00:12:40,it's creating around in the air as well.
00:12:40,00:12:44,So the pressure can suck up the moisture that's in there.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"So it's just kind of, it's not, it's not weighted so that it falls down."
00:12:47,00:12:51,"But so it will still rain, but by less."
00:12:51,00:12:52,It does.
00:12:52,00:12:53,It does make sense.
00:12:53,00:12:55,It would be freaking bizarre if it just didn't rain in a Truman show way.
00:12:55,00:12:56,Yeah.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Yeah.
00:12:57,00:12:58,But it's less by 1%.
00:12:58,00:12:59,That's a lot.
00:12:59,00:13:00,Oh.
00:13:00,00:13:01,It's not a lot.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Contrary.
00:13:02,00:13:03,It's not a lot.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Sorry.
00:13:04,00:13:05,That's a really relevant.
00:13:05,00:13:06,There's a lot of rain.
00:13:06,00:13:10,I was about to leave my umbrella at home before Dan said it's 1%.
00:13:10,00:13:11,I think I'll take it anyway.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:16,But you can drill a hole in your umbrella that's 1% the size of it.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"And then as long as that's in the right position, then it won't matter."
00:13:19,00:13:20,Are you fine?
00:13:20,00:13:21,Yeah.
00:13:21,00:13:22,It's a thought.
00:13:22,00:13:23,They did this.
00:13:23,00:13:24,Science.
00:13:24,00:13:25,They studied it for ages.
00:13:25,00:13:26,They were looking at reports.
00:13:26,00:13:28,And then they looked at meteorological reports.
00:13:28,00:13:30,They go all the way back to the 1800s.
00:13:30,00:13:33,And they found that on the days where the moon was in those positions.
00:13:33,00:13:34,1% less rainy.
00:13:34,00:13:35,1% less rainy.
00:13:35,00:13:36,I just love that fact so much.
00:13:36,00:13:38,Australia's got its first ever moon rover.
00:13:38,00:13:40,It was getting its first ever moon rover.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Okay.
00:13:41,00:13:42,This is quite cool.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Yeah.
00:13:43,00:13:44,It's going to go on.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Why?
00:13:45,00:13:46,Why are they doing that?
00:13:46,00:13:47,It's just being included on a future mission.
00:13:47,00:13:49,I think Australia has a space program.
00:13:49,00:13:50,Ask Paul Power.
00:13:50,00:13:52,And it's going to be included.
00:13:52,00:13:55,"But I'd just like to see, can you guess the name?"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"There were 8,000 suggestions."
00:13:57,00:13:58,"Oh, okay."
00:13:58,00:13:59,Of the name.
00:13:59,00:14:00,And one winner.
00:14:00,00:14:01,And it's gettable.
00:14:01,00:14:02,And it's gettable.
00:14:02,00:14:03,And it's an Aussie.
00:14:03,00:14:04,Is it Mooney McMoon face?
00:14:04,00:14:06,It's not Mooney McMoon face.
00:14:06,00:14:08,It is something actually Australian.
00:14:08,00:14:10,And you're going to kick yourselves right up the arse.
00:14:10,00:14:12,Big old moon spider.
00:14:12,00:14:13,That's good.
00:14:13,00:14:14,It's a rover.
00:14:14,00:14:15,It's a car.
00:14:15,00:14:18,It's a rune rover.
00:14:18,00:14:20,You're so close.
00:14:20,00:14:23,This is agony.
00:14:23,00:14:26,What did you say?
00:14:26,00:14:27,I'm going to give it to you.
00:14:27,00:14:29,Roover is what its name is.
00:14:29,00:14:30,What?
00:14:30,00:14:31,I was way closer.
00:14:31,00:14:32,What did you say?
00:14:32,00:14:33,Rune rover.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Rune rover.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Yeah.
00:14:35,00:14:36,Absolutely not.
00:14:36,00:14:37,That was a shock.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"Wait, say it again."
00:14:38,00:14:39,What is it?
00:14:39,00:14:40,Roover.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Come on.
00:14:41,00:14:42,You should put kangaroo in front.
00:14:42,00:14:43,She said kangaroo.
00:14:43,00:14:44,Kangarova.
00:14:44,00:14:45,It was closer than rune rover.
00:14:45,00:14:46,I had to say it.
00:14:46,00:14:47,Not saying anything.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"Just being like, mm-hmm."
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"Anyway, it's going to be called Roover."
00:14:51,00:14:54,And it will weigh about the same as a western grey kangaroo.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Cool.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Or four wallabies.
00:14:56,00:14:58,Is that deliberate?
00:14:58,00:14:59,That's deliberate.
00:14:59,00:15:01,That's integral to the design.
00:15:01,00:15:03,Four wallabies by wallabies.
00:15:03,00:15:14,OK.
00:15:14,00:15:15,It is time for fact number two.
00:15:15,00:15:16,And that's my fact.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"My fact this week is that as a child,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,Roald Dahl was used as a guinea pig
00:15:20,00:15:22,for a chocolate factory.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Cool.
00:15:23,00:15:24,That's very on the nose.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Yeah.
00:15:25,00:15:27,Makes me wonder about all the other books as well.
00:15:27,00:15:30,"Like, did he have a big peach one day?"
00:15:30,00:15:32,Was he a twit?
00:15:32,00:15:36,"Yeah, no."
00:15:36,00:15:38,So he went to the school called Repton.
00:15:38,00:15:41,"And at Repton, there was a local Cadbury's."
00:15:41,00:15:43,It was either a factory or it was just a base
00:15:43,00:15:45,where they were sending chocolate out for it
00:15:45,00:15:47,to be tested around the country.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"Either way, what they used to do was they used to"
00:15:49,00:15:52,ask for kids from the school to apply to be guinea pigs
00:15:52,00:15:54,in order to test out these chocolates
00:15:54,00:15:56,and see whether they were fit for the market.
00:15:56,00:15:58,And Dahl happened to be there at the time.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"So he would have been like 13, 14 years old at the time."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"Yeah, he spent four years at this place."
00:16:02,00:16:04,And it had a huge impact on him.
00:16:04,00:16:05,"He did think off the back of it,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,what's going on inside these chocolate factories?
00:16:07,00:16:09,I bet it's a marvellous incredible place.
00:16:09,00:16:11,And it was the seed for what then became Charlie
00:16:11,00:16:12,and the Chocolate Factory.
00:16:12,00:16:13,The pod.
00:16:13,00:16:14,It was a lot of injuries.
00:16:14,00:16:17,But Charlie was there.
00:16:17,00:16:19,My chocolate had a finger in it this week.
00:16:19,00:16:20,Marvel.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Wow.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"Do we know if any of the kids in that classroom,"
00:16:24,00:16:25,"when the teacher said,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,"""Have we got any volunteers to test out chocolate"
00:16:27,00:16:28,"in a chocolate factory?"""
00:16:28,00:16:30,Was there a single child who didn't put their hand up?
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:33,It's like a dream for a child.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Oh my God.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"Yeah, it's a dream gig."
00:16:36,00:16:39,Professional chocolate testers are a thing.
00:16:39,00:16:40,"But not again, not many of them."
00:16:40,00:16:43,And it's not as good a gig as maybe Dahl made it sound.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"You get quite sick, wouldn't you?"
00:16:45,00:16:47,You also develop an incredibly advanced palate.
00:16:47,00:16:49,"Oh, so nothing satisfies you."
00:16:49,00:16:50,You're ruined.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"Basically, you get chocolate that's a few hours old."
00:16:53,00:16:54,It's ultra-fresh.
00:16:54,00:16:56,And it's delicious.
00:16:56,00:16:59,"And you're always thinking whenever you eat anything else,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"you're ruined for your keys, basically."
00:17:01,00:17:04,You can't just taste like trash to you.
00:17:04,00:17:05,"But one thing they do is,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"real chocolate experts and testers,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,they listen to the chocolate.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Okay.
00:17:10,00:17:11,What's this thing?
00:17:11,00:17:13,What's going on there?
00:17:13,00:17:16,It's like a phrase.
00:17:16,00:17:18,Like wine has a nose or whatever.
00:17:18,00:17:19,It literally is.
00:17:19,00:17:20,They listen to it.
00:17:20,00:17:22,They listen to the snap sound it makes.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"When you break a piece of the chocolate,"
00:17:24,00:17:26,they'll give it a listen to make sure.
00:17:26,00:17:29,Is there a thing like with cheese where once I went to a party
00:17:29,00:17:30,"and someone was like,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"""Oh, we've fridgeed the brie for too long."""
00:17:32,00:17:33,And they were like panicking.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Did you like fridge chocolate or not?
00:17:34,00:17:36,"You know, because if you put it in the fridge and then you snap it,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,it goes...
00:17:37,00:17:38,Lovely snap.
00:17:38,00:17:39,But would they hate that?
00:17:39,00:17:40,Probably.
00:17:40,00:17:42,I'm sure they would hate all sorts of things.
00:17:42,00:17:46,I'm sure the refrigerator chocolate is probably a deep no-no.
00:17:46,00:17:47,It probably is.
00:17:47,00:17:48,You'd be sacked immediately.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"If you knew anyone who'd ever done it, probably."
00:17:50,00:17:51,"Yeah, that's true."
00:17:51,00:17:52,But they do.
00:17:52,00:17:56,"Actually, someone I know went on a chocolate expert in for the day."
00:17:56,00:17:57,Great.
00:17:57,00:17:58,"As a team building exercise,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,I think they did a chocolate tasting.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"Oh, okay."
00:18:01,00:18:02,Just to the house.
00:18:02,00:18:03,"Yeah, good things."
00:18:03,00:18:06,And the chocolate expertier came around too.
00:18:06,00:18:07,I want a chocolate expertier.
00:18:07,00:18:08,This is going great.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Right?
00:18:09,00:18:12,"You know, all these quite serious business people who work in finance."
00:18:12,00:18:13,And they all had to...
00:18:13,00:18:15,They were all sitting there listening to their chocolate.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Oh, really?"
00:18:16,00:18:17,Yeah.
00:18:17,00:18:18,Like a tuning fork.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Wow.
00:18:19,00:18:20,"Yeah, they do."
00:18:20,00:18:22,Jobs don't come up much sort of publicly for chocolate factories.
00:18:22,00:18:25,"But occasionally, Cadbury will sort of say,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"""We're looking for new taste testers."""
00:18:27,00:18:30,And they did that at one point where they put a sort of open audition out.
00:18:30,00:18:33,"And there's so many, 4,000 applicants."
00:18:33,00:18:34,Everyone went.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"And they made the point of saying,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,"""This isn't going to be easy."
00:18:36,00:18:38,"This isn't just you sitting and eating chocolate saying,"
00:18:38,00:18:39,"""Wow, how yummy."""
00:18:39,00:18:40,"Like, it's really intense."
00:18:40,00:18:45,They had to go spend two and a half hours a day having their taste buds
00:18:45,00:18:48,put to different chocolate tasting tests.
00:18:48,00:18:50,They had to sit in a soundproof booth.
00:18:50,00:18:53,They had red lasers going around so that they could see the type of...
00:18:53,00:18:54,Why they had a soundproof booth?
00:18:54,00:18:55,To hear the chocolate.
00:18:55,00:18:59,I guess it was a sensory booth rather than soundproof.
00:18:59,00:19:00,But it's a similar thing.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"Sorry, you said that they said,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"""Oh, it's not just about eating loads of chocolate all day."""
00:19:05,00:19:08,But the first thing you said was they had to sit
00:19:08,00:19:11,and have their taste subjected to loads of chocolate for ages.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"I mean, that was just eating loads of chocolate."
00:19:13,00:19:14,"No, no, but I think, yeah."
00:19:14,00:19:15,"Intensely, though."
00:19:15,00:19:16,But it's intensely.
00:19:16,00:19:19,I think they're slightly trying to SAS what is quite a nice job.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"You obviously have to write down quite a little detail, I guess,"
00:19:21,00:19:22,about what you're tasting.
00:19:22,00:19:23,Because they don't like work.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"They don't like if you say,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,"""Mmm, caramelly."""
00:19:25,00:19:26,"They're like, ""No, no, no."
00:19:26,00:19:27,We want the components.
00:19:27,00:19:28,We want the makeup of this.
00:19:28,00:19:29,"We don't need to say anything."""
00:19:29,00:19:30,They should know what to do already.
00:19:30,00:19:34,They shouldn't be required to retro-engineer their chocolates for them.
00:19:34,00:19:35,"No, no, no."
00:19:35,00:19:36,I should be saying if I like it or not.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"No, because you want to be able to say,"
00:19:38,00:19:41,"""Oh, that hint of nutmeg is really speaking to me."""
00:19:41,00:19:42,"You know, they want to..."
00:19:42,00:19:43,They don't like it.
00:19:43,00:19:45,The extra bits.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"You see what you mean, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:46,00:19:48,"You don't want to just go, ""Wow, that's caramelly."""
00:19:48,00:19:49,That's...
00:19:49,00:19:53,"My one was shaped like a tiny seahorse, and I love that."
00:19:53,00:19:54,A keyard.
00:19:54,00:19:56,I once did a...
00:19:56,00:19:57,I once did a...
00:19:57,00:19:59,for Aussie shampoo.
00:19:59,00:20:02,I went in and tested their new scent.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Oh!
00:20:03,00:20:08,"I just remember smelling one and being like immediately,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,"they were like, ""So what are the components can you smell?"""
00:20:11,00:20:14,"And all I could think of was like, ""It smells like a man one."""
00:20:14,00:20:17,"""It smells like a musky, like a musk man one."""
00:20:17,00:20:18,"And they were like, ""Yes, because of why?"""
00:20:18,00:20:21,"And it was like, ""Because it's like other men's shampoo."""
00:20:21,00:20:23,"And then I didn't lose anything for the rest of the hour,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,"because I was like, ""I actually can't smell."""
00:20:25,00:20:26,That's what I discovered.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"Unless it's like, ""Yeah, a man one."""
00:20:28,00:20:30,Sounds like they pay you in advance for that job.
00:20:30,00:20:31,They do pay you in advance for that job.
00:20:31,00:20:34,"Yes, thank God, otherwise it would have, yeah."
00:20:34,00:20:39,"Well, I think it is nice enough that employees at the Cadbury's Factory,"
00:20:39,00:20:42,"and this was established about 10 years ago, so it may not be a true now,"
00:20:42,00:20:45,"but they can still eat as much of the product as they like,"
00:20:45,00:20:48,and they do tend to put on half a stone in the first 10 days of their employment.
00:20:48,00:20:49,10 days?
00:20:49,00:20:50,Yeah.
00:20:50,00:20:51,And then I imagine you pair back.
00:20:51,00:20:53,I don't think you keep on gaining half a stone for every 10 days.
00:20:53,00:20:55,I would have thought they'd have a bucket.
00:20:55,00:20:57,"You know, you spit your chocolate into the bucket."
00:20:57,00:21:01,"Like tobacco, like a cowboy, or a bit joyless, yeah."
00:21:01,00:21:04,"Maybe they do, but then you can eat whatever you like from that bucket at the end of the day."
00:21:04,00:21:06,Like a fondue.
00:21:06,00:21:10,"Yeah, because I assume they all just have no teeth, right?"
00:21:10,00:21:11,Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"But then you guys come in again, and they're like,"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"""We want to be careful about the first 10 days."""
00:21:16,00:21:23,"You do put on weight, but you save weight because your teeth aren't quite a lot."
00:21:26,00:21:28,It feels like a great job.
00:21:28,00:21:33,"So, hey, Cadbury."
00:21:33,00:21:34,That was the biggie.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"That was the thing that started chocolate off, basically,"
00:21:36,00:21:41,in terms of this big global Willy Wonka-esque world.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"Well, for me, that's Cadbury's always been the global brand."
00:21:44,00:21:47,And so it started by a guy called John Cadbury.
00:21:47,00:21:48,I was looking into him.
00:21:48,00:21:50,He was born in Birmingham.
00:21:50,00:21:54,"He's the son of Richard Cadbury and his wife, Elizabeth Head."
00:21:54,00:21:57,"Very sad that they didn't take on the double barrel surname,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,because you would have had Dickhead Cadbury.
00:21:59,00:22:00,That would have been a lovely name.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"And then, check this out, his second wife."
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Actually, his middle name was Tapper, so that's good anyway."
00:22:05,00:22:06,Dick Tapper.
00:22:06,00:22:08,Would you like a nice fruit and nut Dick Tapper?
00:22:08,00:22:14,"What is his wife called, Ballant?"
00:22:14,00:22:18,So his second wife was called Candia.
00:22:18,00:22:19,He married a Candy.
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Oh, wow."
00:22:20,00:22:21,Yeah.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"So he was an amazing guy, John Cadbury."
00:22:23,00:22:25,He was very into animal rights.
00:22:25,00:22:27,"He set up the Animals Friends Society,"
00:22:27,00:22:30,which basically is what led into the RSPCA eventually coming about.
00:22:30,00:22:33,It was sort of the forerunner and sort of molded into that.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"And then he passed his company on to his sons,"
00:22:36,00:22:39,"and they set up this incredible place, because they were Quakers."
00:22:39,00:22:43,"And so they've got this little place called Bourneville,"
00:22:43,00:22:46,"which was given its name because it sounded French,"
00:22:46,00:22:49,and therefore would sound really kind of upper class.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Oh, really?"
00:22:50,00:22:51,Yeah.
00:22:51,00:22:52,So they just gave it--
00:22:52,00:22:55,They didn't fly for some reason.
00:22:55,00:22:58,Welcome out in the mayoral dickhead town.
00:22:58,00:23:04,And it's a model village.
00:23:04,00:23:07,"It's a model village, and it's still going to stay."
00:23:07,00:23:09,"I find the terminology model village quite confusing,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,because it means two quite different things.
00:23:11,00:23:12,You're right.
00:23:12,00:23:14,He didn't set up a village of tiny houses that you can--
00:23:14,00:23:16,That's what I thought it was.
00:23:16,00:23:18,"Wow, what a great hobby."
00:23:18,00:23:19,For all the oompa-loompas.
00:23:19,00:23:21,Yeah.
00:23:21,00:23:24,So he set up just like a nice small village?
00:23:24,00:23:25,What's a model village?
00:23:25,00:23:27,"It was for the work-- it was for Cambry's workers,"
00:23:27,00:23:29,and it was basically--
00:23:29,00:23:31,it was a village of houses that were built
00:23:31,00:23:33,along new architectural lines.
00:23:33,00:23:35,"They were designed to be, you know,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,a development from the horrible slums that you've got--
00:23:37,00:23:38,"Oh, I see, right."
00:23:38,00:23:39,--in one of the urban centers.
00:23:39,00:23:42,"Every house had a garden, and every house had a fruit tree,"
00:23:42,00:23:43,and things like this.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"And, you know, people were encouraged to live"
00:23:45,00:23:47,"basically clean, healthy lives."
00:23:47,00:23:49,These were all quite teetotal places as well.
00:23:49,00:23:50,"That's the downside, yeah."
00:23:50,00:23:51,It's boring.
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Unless it's changed recently,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,and there's been quite a few people that have been trying
00:23:54,00:23:57,"to buckle it, it's a dry town, which is nuts."
00:23:57,00:23:59,It's because the Quakers were--
00:23:59,00:24:02,"Quakers were behind all three big chocolate companies,"
00:24:02,00:24:04,"which were Cambry's, Fry's, and Roundtree."
00:24:04,00:24:05,"Yes, it was."
00:24:05,00:24:06,"And they weren't-- at the time,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,Quakers weren't allowed in the professions.
00:24:08,00:24:10,There could be a doctor or anything like that.
00:24:10,00:24:12,And they weren't allowed in public office.
00:24:12,00:24:14,So they were in--
00:24:14,00:24:15,"If you can't do those two,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,you've got to go into sweets and confectionery.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Also, I suppose if they're not drinking,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,they've not got a lot of good stuff going on.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"So, like, there's absolutely canitch on the chocolate."
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:25,That's the vice.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"You're actually missing a fourth Quaker chocolate,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,and I've got a product of theirs here.
00:24:30,00:24:31,"This is by a different company now,"
00:24:31,00:24:32,but I'm holding it in my hand.
00:24:32,00:24:33,It's a Wonka Bar.
00:24:33,00:24:36,And the Wonka Bar was created by Quaker Oats.
00:24:36,00:24:38,You know Quaker Oats?
00:24:38,00:24:40,"Yeah, they funded the movie."
00:24:40,00:24:42,"They put $3 million into the funding of the movie,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,and they had a deal that they would have the chocolate
00:24:44,00:24:46,merchandise that would come off the back of it.
00:24:46,00:24:48,And that's where we started getting Wonka Bars.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"But they had a huge problem,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,because the movie didn't take off to begin with.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"It was doing fine, but it didn't go massive."
00:24:54,00:24:56,"Really, this is the one with Johnny--"
00:24:56,00:24:58,"Not with Johnny Depp, sorry, with Gene Wilder."
00:24:58,00:24:59,"And the chocolate itself,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,"they produced at the wrong temperature,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"as in the melting point of the chocolate,"
00:25:03,00:25:06,"was so inaccurate that when it was being transferred,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,it would melt in the trucks and so on.
00:25:08,00:25:09,"So they had a few problems,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,and they sold it and sold it to different companies.
00:25:11,00:25:13,But it was set up by Quaker Oats.
00:25:13,00:25:15,So we've got a fourth Quaker company.
00:25:15,00:25:16,Wow.
00:25:16,00:25:18,Did you know that Cabry's once
00:25:18,00:25:22,reverse shop lifted a bunch of their cream eggs?
00:25:22,00:25:24,So they sort of snuck them into shops?
00:25:24,00:25:26,"They snuck them in, yeah."
00:25:26,00:25:28,I couldn't quite work out why they went to these lengths.
00:25:28,00:25:29,This was in 2018.
00:25:29,00:25:33,"You might remember, they did a kind of Willy Wonka promo thing"
00:25:33,00:25:35,"where they hid a thousand,"
00:25:35,00:25:38,about a thousand white chocolate eggs in cream egg wrapping.
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:39,00:25:40,"And I think if you opened a cream egg,"
00:25:40,00:25:41,"there'd be a golden ticket in there,"
00:25:41,00:25:42,"and it'd be a white chocolate egg,"
00:25:42,00:25:43,and it was really exciting.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"And then you could win 10,000 pounds."
00:25:45,00:25:47,"But the way they did it was,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,"when they made the eggs,"
00:25:49,00:25:52,they didn't tell anyone in the factory in Bourneville
00:25:52,00:25:53,"that they were making the eggs,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,and they didn't tell any of the people in the shops
00:25:55,00:25:56,where they were planting the eggs.
00:25:56,00:26:00,They just got this crack team of spies
00:26:00,00:26:03,to break into the factory overnight
00:26:03,00:26:05,"under cover of darkness, go in,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"make these eggs, smuggle them out,"
00:26:07,00:26:09,"and then kind of in disguise,"
00:26:09,00:26:12,sneak into shops and slip them onto shelves.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"How many, do we know how many they made?"
00:26:14,00:26:16,They said they made about a thousand.
00:26:16,00:26:18,You can do that in the course of a night.
00:26:18,00:26:19,That's insane.
00:26:19,00:26:20,"I think it might have been multiple nights,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,"but also, I think a chocolate factory"
00:26:22,00:26:24,"can churn out, yes, even a thousand eggs."
00:26:24,00:26:25,"They make hundreds of thousands of cream eggs a year,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,just for a tiny season.
00:26:26,00:26:27,"I know, you're breaking in,"
00:26:27,00:26:28,you've got to turn on the lights.
00:26:28,00:26:31,I'm sure they created a pretext of an away day.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"We're all going on a chocolate listening course,"
00:26:33,00:26:37,"and so no one needs to come to work tomorrow, you know."
00:26:37,00:26:41,"And if you notice any white smears around the machinery,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"just disregard it, get on with your work."
00:26:44,00:26:46,So who were the people who were sneaking them
00:26:46,00:26:47,bit onto the shelves?
00:26:47,00:26:48,That's such a cool job.
00:26:48,00:26:50,I suppose you have to be very high up in Cadbury
00:26:50,00:26:51,to get that gig.
00:26:51,00:26:52,But also inconspicuous looking.
00:26:52,00:26:53,Very inconspicuous.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Like you've got someone who looks
00:26:54,00:26:56,"just like a normal person, I guess."
00:26:56,00:26:58,I would invent a sleeve that allowed me
00:26:58,00:27:00,to drop off an egg.
00:27:00,00:27:02,Lay an egg with your arm.
00:27:02,00:27:04,"Exactly, exactly that."
00:27:04,00:27:06,"So I would pick up an egg,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,"so no one would notice,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,"and I would go and buy an egg, you know."
00:27:08,00:27:10,But no one's noticed the one I've secretly
00:27:10,00:27:12,glayed in the egg tray behind me.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"Can I tell you like a real life, Willy Wonka?"
00:27:15,00:27:16,Yeah.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"This is a guy, have you heard of Forest Mars?"
00:27:18,00:27:19,No.
00:27:19,00:27:21,Was he responsible for Mars Mars?
00:27:21,00:27:22,He was.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Wow.
00:27:23,00:27:24,Forest Mars.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Forest Mars.
00:27:25,00:27:27,Also Maltesers invented those.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Okay.
00:27:28,00:27:30,Also Pedigree Chum and Uncle Ben's Rice.
00:27:30,00:27:32,But those were like huge though.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Wow.
00:27:33,00:27:35,Like solo albums of his main career
00:27:35,00:27:37,was in the confectionary world.
00:27:37,00:27:39,Did he hands-on invented all of those?
00:27:39,00:27:40,I don't know how.
00:27:40,00:27:42,Invented Rice?
00:27:42,00:27:44,There was a technique with Uncle Ben's Rice.
00:27:44,00:27:46,In a pouch.
00:27:46,00:27:49,I don't know how on his hands were on Pedigree Chum.
00:27:49,00:27:50,But it's a big deal.
00:27:50,00:27:51,Yeah.
00:27:51,00:27:52,Huge deal.
00:27:52,00:27:53,"And he did, I think he did with Maltesers."
00:27:53,00:27:55,"He took this tiny pellet of dough,"
00:27:55,00:27:56,"this pea-sized pellet of dough,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,and then put it in a vacuum oven.
00:27:58,00:27:59,"You know, exploded it in a vacuum,"
00:27:59,00:28:00,"and then you cover that in chocolate,"
00:28:00,00:28:01,which is how they made today.
00:28:01,00:28:02,They made the vacuum.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Anyway, very cool."
00:28:03,00:28:06,But Forest Mars was very eccentric.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"As in, he was a bit of a tyrant."
00:28:08,00:28:10,He would get his executives on their knees
00:28:10,00:28:11,praying in meetings.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"He would lead them in prayers,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"saying, ""I pray for Milky Way."
00:28:14,00:28:16,"I pray for Snickers."""
00:28:16,00:28:17,What?
00:28:17,00:28:18,"For the success of it,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,or like literally for a bar of...
00:28:20,00:28:21,[laughter]
00:28:21,00:28:22,For the success of it.
00:28:22,00:28:23,So what about...
00:28:23,00:28:25,"He was a tyrant, I think, domestically as well."
00:28:25,00:28:26,"His adult son, John,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,once asked to miss a sales meeting.
00:28:28,00:28:30,So Forest Senior said he had to spend the entire meeting
00:28:30,00:28:32,on his knees in prayer.
00:28:32,00:28:33,So I think...
00:28:33,00:28:35,It's very interesting to make people just get on their knees
00:28:35,00:28:36,and pray or something.
00:28:36,00:28:37,A lot of praying is a theme.
00:28:37,00:28:38,A lot of praying going on.
00:28:38,00:28:40,He was so secretive about his life
00:28:40,00:28:42,"that when he died in 1999,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,Mars wouldn't even confirm that he died.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Gosh.
00:28:45,00:28:46,I know.
00:28:46,00:28:47,So there is a bit of a...
00:28:47,00:28:49,It's quite an odd biography.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Someone once saw him in an airport
00:28:50,00:28:51,"and shouted out,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,"""Forest, Forest Mars!"""
00:28:52,00:28:54,And he marched over and he...
00:28:54,00:28:56,He made them get on their knees and pray.
00:28:56,00:29:00,[laughter]
00:29:00,00:29:01,That's right.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"It was more conspicuous, actually."
00:29:03,00:29:04,"He marched over and he said,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,"""Don't ever call my name out in public."""
00:29:06,00:29:08,She was so concerned about being recognised
00:29:08,00:29:09,or spotted or any of that.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"I mean, really an unusual guy."
00:29:11,00:29:13,Why have you called your biggest product
00:29:13,00:29:14,after yourself?
00:29:14,00:29:15,[laughter]
00:29:15,00:29:16,Uncle Ben!
00:29:16,00:29:19,[laughter]
00:29:19,00:29:24,[music]
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Okay, it's time for fact number three"
00:29:26,00:29:28,and that is Anna.
00:29:28,00:29:30,My fact this week is that the thumbs up emoji
00:29:30,00:29:33,is contractually binding in Canada.
00:29:33,00:29:35,[laughter]
00:29:35,00:29:37,"Be careful, Canadians."
00:29:37,00:29:39,And this was as of this year.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"No, as of last year, 2023."
00:29:41,00:29:43,We're now in 2024.
00:29:43,00:29:45,But this is because of a legal case
00:29:45,00:29:47,"in Canada, in Saskatchewan."
00:29:47,00:29:49,And they have the system there
00:29:49,00:29:51,where a legal case will set legal precedent.
00:29:51,00:29:53,That will be the one that they refer back to.
00:29:53,00:29:55,And there was a legal case where a guy
00:29:55,00:29:57,"called Kent Mickelbrough,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"a grain buyer,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,who wanted to buy some grain.
00:30:01,00:30:02,So he texted a bunch of farmers
00:30:02,00:30:04,"and said, ""Anyone got any"
00:30:04,00:30:05,"flax to sell me?"""
00:30:05,00:30:08,"""86 tonnes of flax I want at..."""
00:30:08,00:30:10,"86, why 86?"
00:30:10,00:30:12,"Kent, is it called Kent Mickelbrough?"
00:30:12,00:30:13,"Kent Mickelbrough, that's right."
00:30:13,00:30:14,It's a pretty cool name.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Frankly, he wasted on a flax buyer."
00:30:15,00:30:17,[laughter]
00:30:17,00:30:18,"Careful, buddy."
00:30:18,00:30:20,This guy's litigious.
00:30:20,00:30:23,[laughter]
00:30:23,00:30:25,Flax buying is the coolest career.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Sorry, yeah, yeah."
00:30:26,00:30:28,He needs the 86th ton for whatever reason.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"He wants 86 tonnes, exactly."
00:30:30,00:30:33,Precisely 17 Canadian dollars a bushel.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"And one farmer responded, Chris Achter."
00:30:36,00:30:38,That's A-C-H-T-E-R.
00:30:38,00:30:39,Chris Achter responded.
00:30:39,00:30:41,They chatted on the phone.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"And Kent was like, ""Cool, I'll text your contract."""
00:30:43,00:30:46,"Kent texts him the contract saying,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"""Please confirm this is the grain you want to buy."
00:30:49,00:30:50,"You want to sell at this price."""
00:30:50,00:30:52,And the farmer responded
00:30:52,00:30:54,with a thumbs up emoji.
00:30:54,00:30:56,Fast forward a few months.
00:30:56,00:30:58,Grain doesn't arrive.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Kent's like, ""Where the hell's my grain, mate?"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"You agree to this contract?"""
00:31:01,00:31:02,"Farmer says, ""No."""
00:31:02,00:31:04,"I was just saying, ""I've received the message."""
00:31:04,00:31:06,I wasn't agreeing to the contract.
00:31:06,00:31:09,Confirming that he's thumbs-uping that this is the contract.
00:31:09,00:31:11,That I am that man.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Yes, that's me."
00:31:13,00:31:15,But he's not signing.
00:31:15,00:31:16,No.
00:31:16,00:31:17,I understand that.
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Like, I get that position."
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Like, I've received this contract."
00:31:19,00:31:21,"Thank you, but I never signed it."
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Well, so these were the two positions that went to court."
00:31:24,00:31:26,I think I'm on Chris Achter's side.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"Well, let's argue it out"
00:31:28,00:31:30,as they did in the Canadian courts.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"You also had lost, I'm afraid."
00:31:32,00:31:37,"And he had to pay $82,000 Canadian dollars in damages."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"Because it was determined that thumbs-up,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"because the guy said in his text message,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"you said, ""Please confirm this is okay."""
00:31:43,00:31:45,And then with a picture of the contract.
00:31:45,00:31:46,And I'm with you.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"A thumbs-up can just be like, I'm really lit."
00:31:48,00:31:50,"I can't be honest to respond now,"
00:31:50,00:31:52,but I'll do something to put them off.
00:31:52,00:31:54,I think it's an incredibly...
00:31:54,00:31:56,"I don't want to weigh in with an opinion here,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,but I think it is quite a passive-aggressive thing
00:31:58,00:31:59,to do a thumbs-up emoji.
00:31:59,00:32:00,I tried.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"I sent you one earlier this week, Dan,"
00:32:01,00:32:02,as an experiment to see how it felt.
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Oh, yeah?"
00:32:03,00:32:04,I didn't feel great after sending it.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Oh.
00:32:05,00:32:06,You know.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Really?
00:32:07,00:32:08,You felt like it's a bit of a thumbs-down?
00:32:08,00:32:09,I feel like it's a bit of a...
00:32:09,00:32:10,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:10,00:32:11,"Whatever, mate."
00:32:11,00:32:12,Jog on.
00:32:12,00:32:13,"You know, it's sort of a..."
00:32:13,00:32:14,What was a weird response to me
00:32:14,00:32:15,telling you my dog died?
00:32:15,00:32:19,"Jog on, mate."
00:32:19,00:32:21,"I like, instead of a thumbs-up,"
00:32:21,00:32:23,I've started doing a top hat.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"Oh, that's nice."
00:32:24,00:32:26,"A jaunty, just like a..."
00:32:26,00:32:27,"Yeah, cool."
00:32:27,00:32:29,I've got my glad rags on.
00:32:29,00:32:31,I think is what I'm saying there.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"No, I like that."
00:32:32,00:32:34,I would feel a bit special receiving a top hat
00:32:34,00:32:35,"from Stevie, you know?"
00:32:35,00:32:36,"Yes, that's what I like to do."
00:32:36,00:32:37,"But also, as a..."
00:32:37,00:32:38,"When my driving instructor,"
00:32:38,00:32:40,"I have to formally confirm,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,"contractually over text,"
00:32:42,00:32:43,"and he'll say, like,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,"""This time in this place,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"confirm,"" and I just put a ""why,"""
00:32:47,00:32:48,"and that means that is, like,"
00:32:48,00:32:49,if I...
00:32:49,00:32:50,"Wait, why?"
00:32:50,00:32:51,"Like, why?"
00:32:51,00:32:52,And a top hat.
00:32:52,00:32:54,And he doesn't seem to think that.
00:32:54,00:32:55,"No, why for yes."
00:32:55,00:32:56,"Right, okay."
00:32:56,00:32:57,"And when I do that,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,I am in this obligation
00:32:59,00:33:00,"to not cancel within seven days,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,"and I did have to because I got COVID,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"and I was liable for, like, 250 quid."
00:33:05,00:33:06,"And, like, so it..."
00:33:06,00:33:08,"But also, isn't it because, like,"
00:33:08,00:33:09,if you...
00:33:09,00:33:10,What's the word?
00:33:10,00:33:12,This has turned into more of a personal complaint
00:33:12,00:33:14,about your driving instructor's cancellation practice.
00:33:14,00:33:16,"Because I read about a while back,"
00:33:16,00:33:17,"a long time ago,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,"but maybe in 2019,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,"about how, like, emojis are used in court"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"for, like, someone sent their partner"
00:33:25,00:33:28,or ex-partner a gun emoji
00:33:28,00:33:30,"and actually got sentenced for threatening,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,because people do use them in terms of words.
00:33:33,00:33:34,"So if you're gonna,"
00:33:34,00:33:35,"you've got to, I suppose,"
00:33:35,00:33:36,come down on one side of it.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"You can't just go,"
00:33:37,00:33:38,"""Well, if it's a threat, yes,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,"but if it's a thumbs up because of flax, no."""
00:33:40,00:33:42,"Like, I suppose it's quite tricky."
00:33:42,00:33:44,"You can see, I'm just excited that"
00:33:44,00:33:46,you have firsthand recent experience
00:33:46,00:33:47,of this actual fact.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Yeah.
00:33:48,00:33:49,You said legal precedent.
00:33:49,00:33:50,You and your driving instructor.
00:33:50,00:33:52,Top hat means yes.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"Do you want to give it a quick, please?"
00:33:53,00:33:54,"Oh, God, yeah."
00:33:54,00:33:55,"It is an interesting point, though,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"like, what if he had sent a heart,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,"for example, in response, you know,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,"what would be, where's the boundary"
00:34:01,00:34:02,of the early flax?
00:34:02,00:34:03,I love flax.
00:34:03,00:34:04,And you.
00:34:04,00:34:07,"Yes, you're right."
00:34:07,00:34:09,I think his thumbs up has that meaning.
00:34:09,00:34:10,Yeah.
00:34:10,00:34:11,I can sort of understand why it went that way as well.
00:34:11,00:34:12,"You know, like, it's a sort of..."
00:34:12,00:34:13,It's a yes.
00:34:13,00:34:14,It sounds good.
00:34:14,00:34:15,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:16,00:34:18,"And actually, in fact, that was a thing"
00:34:18,00:34:19,"that was brought home in court,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,because the defence raised concerns that
00:34:21,00:34:22,what if you send a fist bump?
00:34:22,00:34:23,Is that a contract?
00:34:23,00:34:25,"Or is that I'm going to punch you,"
00:34:25,00:34:26,"and that's a threat, and then you go"
00:34:26,00:34:27,to prison?
00:34:27,00:34:28,Exactly.
00:34:28,00:34:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:29,00:34:30,Or that Lady Tango dancer in the red dress.
00:34:30,00:34:31,Yeah.
00:34:31,00:34:32,I would take that as an absolute yes.
00:34:32,00:34:34,"Like, we are, we're on, we're going."
00:34:34,00:34:36,You're sending twice as much flax as they've asked for.
00:34:36,00:34:37,We're dating now.
00:34:37,00:34:38,That's a...
00:34:38,00:34:39,Dating the flax.
00:34:39,00:34:40,Yeah.
00:34:40,00:34:41,No.
00:34:41,00:34:42,"But I think the judge says,"
00:34:42,00:34:43,"""Don't be silly."
00:34:43,00:34:44,"This is about a thumbs up."""
00:34:44,00:34:46,"And that's, that's all it is, you know."
00:34:46,00:34:48,"Well, they, just to Andy's point"
00:34:48,00:34:50,"about the thumbs up, actually, in China,"
00:34:50,00:34:51,you'd be right.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"Apparently, the thumbs up emoji in China is bad."
00:34:53,00:34:54,Oh.
00:34:54,00:34:56,"Amongst the youth, because it is..."
00:34:56,00:34:58,But they asked some Chinese people.
00:34:58,00:34:59,More like passive-aggressive?
00:34:59,00:35:00,"Yeah, I think."
00:35:00,00:35:02,"Basically, Jen Zeds in China said"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"that if someone said them a thumbs up,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,"it means, ""I don't like talking to you."
00:35:05,00:35:06,"I want you to go away."""
00:35:06,00:35:08,"It reads like, like, okay,"
00:35:08,00:35:09,and no punctuation.
00:35:09,00:35:10,That's what it reads like.
00:35:10,00:35:11,Okay.
00:35:11,00:35:12,"You're like, you're angry."
00:35:12,00:35:14,"If I ever said, ""Okay, I'm a full stop."""
00:35:14,00:35:17,That's as angry as I can possibly express myself.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"Like, that's absolutely a white-hot with fury, you know."
00:35:20,00:35:21,Yeah.
00:35:21,00:35:23,You know the Gagas cave paintings and the Pyrenees?
00:35:23,00:35:24,The ancient...
00:35:24,00:35:25,Intimately.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:35:26,00:35:29,"No, can you explain?"
00:35:29,00:35:30,"No, no."
00:35:30,00:35:31,"Sorry, yeah."
00:35:31,00:35:32,But there are these cave paintings and the Pyrenees
00:35:32,00:35:33,in the Gagas caves.
00:35:33,00:35:34,Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:35,"And they're very, very, very old."
00:35:35,00:35:37,"They're between 20 and 40,000 years old."
00:35:37,00:35:41,"They're quite hard to date, but like, they're old."
00:35:41,00:35:44,"And they're all stencils of hands, right?"
00:35:44,00:35:45,"Okay, yes."
00:35:45,00:35:46,And there are...
00:35:46,00:35:47,There are amazing images of them.
00:35:47,00:35:48,They're beautiful.
00:35:48,00:35:50,There are sort of dozens of hands overlaid on each other.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"I have seen this, yeah."
00:35:51,00:35:54,I think they made them by putting the hand on the cave wall
00:35:54,00:35:56,and then spitting ochre paint.
00:35:56,00:35:57,Really?
00:35:57,00:35:58,"Yeah, it says, yeah."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"But the weird thing is, about half the hands"
00:36:00,00:36:03,would be injured or mutilated.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"You know, they're short a finger or two,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,or some of them are short all four fingers.
00:36:07,00:36:09,And there's a theory that...
00:36:09,00:36:11,"It's a language about hunting,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,or it's an indication of something or another.
00:36:13,00:36:16,But there is a theory that that could be the first thumbs up.
00:36:16,00:36:18,It's either someone who's been tragically ritually mutilated
00:36:18,00:36:20,"with the loss of all four of their fingers,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,or it's the first ever thumbs up.
00:36:22,00:36:23,Or it's an emoji.
00:36:23,00:36:24,It's an emoji.
00:36:24,00:36:25,Yeah.
00:36:25,00:36:26,That's fun.
00:36:26,00:36:27,So that's...
00:36:27,00:36:28,It's hard to know.
00:36:28,00:36:30,A Egyptian hieroglyphs like emojis.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"They are, because they're open to interpretation."
00:36:32,00:36:33,Yeah.
00:36:33,00:36:34,And they're pictures.
00:36:34,00:36:35,Great.
00:36:35,00:36:36,Thank you.
00:36:36,00:36:39,(ALL LAUGH)
00:36:39,00:36:41,"Do you think they actually had a writing system,"
00:36:41,00:36:44,but it just got so popular with the emoji side of things?
00:36:44,00:36:46,(ALL LAUGH)
00:36:46,00:36:48,"Because that's where we're heading, anyway."
00:36:48,00:36:50,"They were really frowned upon at first, the hieroglyphs."
00:36:50,00:36:51,Among the older generations.
00:36:51,00:36:52,Hieroglyphs are past ag.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Dumb it down.
00:36:53,00:36:55,(ALL LAUGH)
00:36:55,00:36:57,"Right, where does the word emoji come from?"
00:36:57,00:36:58,What does it mean?
00:36:58,00:36:59,Oh.
00:36:59,00:37:01,Emotion and something Japanese.
00:37:01,00:37:02,Exactly.
00:37:02,00:37:03,"Bang, you fell right into my trap."
00:37:03,00:37:05,It's nothing to do with emotion.
00:37:05,00:37:06,"Oh, and it's so weird."
00:37:06,00:37:10,So it's from the Japanese words for picture and character.
00:37:10,00:37:11,Oh.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"So air is picture, moji is character, right?"
00:37:13,00:37:14,That's weird.
00:37:14,00:37:15,It has nothing to do with emotion.
00:37:15,00:37:17,"But weirdly, do you remember the emoticon?"
00:37:17,00:37:18,Yes.
00:37:18,00:37:20,Like a colon and then a closed bracket is a smiley face.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Yeah.
00:37:21,00:37:22,That is an emotion icon.
00:37:22,00:37:23,And that came first.
00:37:23,00:37:24,That's so weird.
00:37:24,00:37:26,But then emoji came second and it has nothing to do with emotion.
00:37:26,00:37:29,This is like the sun and the moon being the same size coincidence.
00:37:29,00:37:31,This is all falling into place.
00:37:31,00:37:34,It's like a lot of emojis that have got nothing to do with emotion.
00:37:34,00:37:37,Like a suitcase or like Easter Island hat.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"Exactly, yeah."
00:37:38,00:37:40,"So that does now kind of check out, doesn't it?"
00:37:40,00:37:41,Yeah.
00:37:41,00:37:42,I like what they decide to add each year.
00:37:42,00:37:46,So like there was a big uproar because there was no avocado for ages.
00:37:46,00:37:47,Right.
00:37:47,00:37:49,And I think there wasn't a seal for a long time and that really got me down.
00:37:49,00:37:50,And I think it got me down.
00:37:50,00:37:52,A seal like when you seal an envelope.
00:37:52,00:37:53,"No, unless a sea line."
00:37:53,00:37:54,I'm right.
00:37:54,00:37:58,"Again, Anna, we're getting more of a glimpse into your communication style."
00:37:58,00:37:59,And mine.
00:37:59,00:38:00,"Well, wax seal."
00:38:00,00:38:01,There was no wax seal.
00:38:01,00:38:03,Let's send it by seal.
00:38:03,00:38:06,That's what I do.
00:38:06,00:38:09,Do you know what the least popular emojis are?
00:38:09,00:38:13,"Because I really look this up because when, you know, when you go to send one and you"
00:38:13,00:38:18,"see this vast selection and you think, God, none of these must ever get a look in ever."
00:38:18,00:38:21,"And there's actually a Twitter account called at least used emoji,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,which kind of sandy for it doesn't seem to have tweeted since 2020.
00:38:24,00:38:29,"But in 2020, the same one had been top of its list for 264 days,"
00:38:29,00:38:33,which I guess is when it gave up and thought this is the ultimate loser.
00:38:33,00:38:34,And he guesses.
00:38:34,00:38:37,What am I doing with my life?
00:38:37,00:38:40,Even bots get depressed.
00:38:40,00:38:41,Okay.
00:38:41,00:38:43,Is this gettable?
00:38:43,00:38:44,I don't know.
00:38:44,00:38:46,"I mean, I guess it's one that you won't have seen very often."
00:38:46,00:38:47,Is it an object?
00:38:47,00:38:48,"No, it's a flag."
00:38:48,00:38:49,You'll never get it.
00:38:49,00:38:53,"I've just realized the least used one is the symbol that is an ampersand,"
00:38:53,00:38:57,"an equal sign, a musical note and a percentage sign."
00:38:57,00:38:58,What is it?
00:38:58,00:38:59,They come as one.
00:38:59,00:39:00,What is it?
00:39:00,00:39:01,What does it mean?
00:39:01,00:39:03,"Well, I suppose no one's ever known."
00:39:03,00:39:04,Which is why.
00:39:04,00:39:06,Because you don't really get package emojis.
00:39:06,00:39:09,Like that's like four really unpopular ones that have got together in a supergroup
00:39:09,00:39:11,to try and bump themselves up.
00:39:11,00:39:12,Yeah.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"It's the opposite of a supergroup, isn't it?"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"They thought they would be the traveling wheel breeze and they, yeah."
00:39:17,00:39:18,Also the tramway symbol.
00:39:18,00:39:22,"I really thought, Andy, that you can't have been on Line March in 2020,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,given that that was the joint lease popular.
00:39:24,00:39:25,Yeah.
00:39:25,00:39:27,An aerial tramway symbol.
00:39:27,00:39:29,"Oh, I, I've already talked about that."
00:39:29,00:39:32,"And it was a, it's a sort of hanging railway."
00:39:32,00:39:33,It's a suspended railway.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Yeah.
00:39:34,00:39:36,And I saw someone claiming that there's only one suspended railway
00:39:36,00:39:38,"and widespread use of the world nets in China,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,which is why the emoji is not used.
00:39:40,00:39:43,"Actually, there is one in Germany, the Wuppertalsch Weberbahn,"
00:39:43,00:39:46,which is a very popular suspended railway.
00:39:46,00:39:47,Great.
00:39:47,00:39:48,I just can't believe you won.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"And that's, I'm stupid now."
00:39:49,00:39:51,That's where the train's like underneath the track.
00:39:51,00:39:52,Yeah.
00:39:52,00:39:53,Right.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"So I think it's that an emoji before and been like, why, what's that?"
00:39:56,00:39:57,But that is actually real.
00:39:57,00:39:58,"I didn't, I didn't know."
00:39:58,00:39:59,Go to Wuppertal.
00:39:59,00:40:01,And you'll have a whale of a time.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"It's, it's a really good, I think they put an elephant in it once."
00:40:04,00:40:05,I've just had a memory that.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"Oh, it feels."
00:40:06,00:40:07,Wow.
00:40:07,00:40:08,"Unnecessary, doesn't it?"
00:40:08,00:40:09,I can't.
00:40:09,00:40:10,Can they?
00:40:10,00:40:11,"Oh, to prove that it clings to the top."
00:40:11,00:40:13,Like you can even put an elephant in it.
00:40:13,00:40:14,I think.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"You know, really, I know."
00:40:16,00:40:17,Really.
00:40:17,00:40:18,I'm really doubting myself.
00:40:18,00:40:19,I've got to find out.
00:40:19,00:40:20,I've got to find out.
00:40:20,00:40:22,I'm not sure what you do.
00:40:22,00:40:28,"You go quiet for a bit and then go, oh, did you put an elephant in it?"
00:40:28,00:40:30,"Supposedly they put an elephant, they did put an elephant in it."
00:40:30,00:40:36,They put an elephant in the Wuppertal Schraberbahn in 1950 as a stunt either to promote the monorail
00:40:36,00:40:37,or the circus.
00:40:37,00:40:38,Both.
00:40:38,00:40:39,Why not?
00:40:39,00:40:40,And it fell in.
00:40:40,00:40:44,"The panic had broken out in the carriage, which apparently also had passengers in it."
00:40:44,00:40:45,Oh my God.
00:40:45,00:40:46,Oh my God.
00:40:46,00:40:47,This is bizarre.
00:40:47,00:40:48,This is insane.
00:40:48,00:40:49,I'm just on the Wikipedia for it now.
00:40:49,00:40:53,It was called Tuffy Was Fine and survived another 39 years.
00:40:53,00:40:55,I thought you meant he was fine.
00:40:55,00:40:59,"I was going to be like, this is not his fault."
00:40:59,00:41:01,"I haven't paid for a ticket, mate."
00:41:01,00:41:02,Right.
00:41:02,00:41:03,I'm glad he was okay.
00:41:03,00:41:04,I'm famous in 1950.
00:41:04,00:41:05,"Oh, it was she."
00:41:05,00:41:08,"She actually accidentally, obviously, fell from the Wuppertal Schraberbahn into the River"
00:41:08,00:41:09,Wuppa.
00:41:09,00:41:10,"Oh, no."
00:41:10,00:41:11,But she survived.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Yep.
00:41:12,00:41:13,For 39 years.
00:41:13,00:41:14,Yeah.
00:41:14,00:41:15,I'm going to keep that in mind.
00:41:15,00:41:16,How did she thought did they not shut the doors?
00:41:16,00:41:23,"Well, what it says here is that she was put on the monorail as a publicity stunt, tick."
00:41:23,00:41:27,"Elephant trumpeted wildly and ran through the carriage, broke through a window and fell"
00:41:27,00:41:30,"12 meters down into the river, suffering only minor injuries."
00:41:30,00:41:34,"A panic had broken out in the carriage, naturally, and some passengers were injured."
00:41:34,00:41:35,That's right.
00:41:35,00:41:36,Big-ass window.
00:41:36,00:41:37,Yeah.
00:41:37,00:41:38,It's a big window.
00:41:38,00:41:39,Yeah.
00:41:39,00:41:40,Or small elephant.
00:41:40,00:41:41,Small elephant.
00:41:41,00:41:42,Not African elephant.
00:41:42,00:41:43,It depends how you're looking at it.
00:41:43,00:41:57,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:41:57,00:42:02,My fact is that there is a fish that spends its entire life upside down.
00:42:02,00:42:05,Is it trying to make the moon look smaller?
00:42:05,00:42:08,That's right.
00:42:08,00:42:10,This is a fact.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"It was sent in, actually, by Kate Glyzinski."
00:42:12,00:42:13,"So, thank you, Kate."
00:42:13,00:42:16,It's about a kind of anglerfish.
00:42:16,00:42:18,"Sorry, that does sound like a pseudonym for Anna."
00:42:18,00:42:19,Kate Glyzinski.
00:42:19,00:42:20,Yeah.
00:42:20,00:42:21,Absolutely right.
00:42:21,00:42:24,This was sent in by Anna.
00:42:24,00:42:29,"So, anglerfish are the ones which they have a tentacle and they have like a fishing rod"
00:42:29,00:42:32,"sticking out of their head, and then they use the end of the rod."
00:42:32,00:42:36,"There's got a little glowing ball of light on it, and they use that to attract prey to them."
00:42:36,00:42:37,It's pretty incredible.
00:42:37,00:42:38,We say it casually.
00:42:38,00:42:39,It's amazing.
00:42:39,00:42:41,But you've got a light bulb hanging off your face.
00:42:41,00:42:42,Absolutely amazing.
00:42:42,00:42:44,"Well, and it's bacteria that is lighting it up as well."
00:42:44,00:42:46,It's not like an actual light bulb.
00:42:46,00:42:47,It is an actual...
00:42:47,00:42:48,Hang on.
00:42:48,00:42:50,You've got to feed the rod for them to...
00:42:50,00:42:51,It's so weird.
00:42:51,00:42:52,Yeah.
00:42:52,00:42:53,It's genuinely amazing.
00:42:53,00:42:58,And sometimes they accidentally chew their own tentacle sort of thing.
00:42:58,00:43:02,"Because they close their mouth and they go, you know, and then they obviously sometimes"
00:43:02,00:43:03,they trap themselves.
00:43:03,00:43:04,Ow!
00:43:04,00:43:05,Anyway.
00:43:05,00:43:06,"Like biting your tongue, basically."
00:43:06,00:43:07,They're light.
00:43:07,00:43:10,So this is the whip nose anglerfish.
00:43:10,00:43:13,And for years it was just assumed that it went the right way up.
00:43:13,00:43:14,It just went around the right way up.
00:43:14,00:43:15,Yeah.
00:43:15,00:43:16,People assumed that.
00:43:16,00:43:19,"Because we've only seen dead ones, presumably, with anglerfish, right?"
00:43:19,00:43:20,You don't obviously see them in the wild.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"Yeah, because they live very, very deep in the deep ocean."
00:43:22,00:43:24,And it was assumed to be upright.
00:43:24,00:43:25,An upright fish.
00:43:25,00:43:26,Like all fish.
00:43:26,00:43:30,"But they got some camera footage in 1999 of one of these swimming around the ocean,"
00:43:30,00:43:33,upside down with the fishing rod dangling down beneath it.
00:43:33,00:43:34,Very weird.
00:43:34,00:43:35,"They thought, what a weird..."
00:43:35,00:43:38,What a weird one or fish.
00:43:38,00:43:43,"But they keep finding these, like deep sea drones, keep filming these anglerfish swimming"
00:43:43,00:43:44,around upside down.
00:43:44,00:43:48,And it appears they spend their whole life swimming upside down to attract prey.
00:43:48,00:43:52,But apparently it is better for it so that it doesn't bite itself.
00:43:52,00:43:54,That's in part of the description of the whip nose.
00:43:54,00:43:55,"Yeah, it's just helpful."
00:43:55,00:43:58,It just gives it a tiny bit more of an advantage.
00:43:58,00:43:59,It's quite cute.
00:43:59,00:44:00,"They're very cool, anyway."
00:44:00,00:44:01,They are weird anglerfish.
00:44:01,00:44:02,Anglerfish are insane.
00:44:02,00:44:07,"They do this thing, and I know I always get too surprised by this, but evolution."
00:44:07,00:44:10,What a great idea.
00:44:10,00:44:15,So one of the things is that it's bioluminescent in that rod.
00:44:15,00:44:18,But also it will eat a lot of fish that are bioluminescent.
00:44:18,00:44:22,"And an anglerfish has a really elastic kind of tummy, very rubbery."
00:44:22,00:44:25,So it can eat things that are almost twice its size.
00:44:25,00:44:30,"And so it goes quite transparent, except it doesn't, because there's black lining on the inside."
00:44:30,00:44:33,So you can't see the bioluminescence inside it.
00:44:33,00:44:37,So it can't attract predators if there's something inside swimming around that's still not dead.
00:44:37,00:44:40,Kind of like a car that has tinted windows.
00:44:40,00:44:43,"You don't know what's inside the car, but you can..."
00:44:43,00:44:45,It is on purpose so that it's not gone transparent.
00:44:45,00:44:50,Like I went to the gym once and my leggings had gone see-through and everyone could see my knickers and butt.
00:44:50,00:44:52,That's the opposite.
00:44:52,00:44:58,"If I was an anglerfish, I could have just made my leggings more opaque, for example."
00:44:58,00:45:01,One of the many reasons to want to be one.
00:45:01,00:45:03,That really puts it in context.
00:45:03,00:45:07,"It really brings it down to earth, or up to earth."
00:45:07,00:45:14,"This one that you mentioned, Andy, the whipnose is a classic anglerfish in that it's just the females you're talking about."
00:45:14,00:45:19,"It's pretty much whenever anyone talks about cool stuff with anglerfish, it's just the ladies."
00:45:19,00:45:22,Because they are way bigger than the males.
00:45:22,00:45:26,"So in the whipnose ones, then the females are like half a metre and the males are two centimetres."
00:45:26,00:45:33,And I think there's another kind of anglerfish which has the Guinness record for the biggest dimorphism between males and females.
00:45:33,00:45:43,"And this I find so hard to believe, but Guinness says that the females are more than 60 times the length of the males and half a million times as heavy."
00:45:43,00:45:44,That's crazy.
00:45:44,00:45:46,The mating is very wild.
00:45:46,00:45:47,The mating is odd.
00:45:47,00:45:48,I think the mating is...
00:45:48,00:45:53,"Basically, the male sort of latches onto the female, just kind of bites the side of her."
00:45:53,00:45:56,And then fuses and then dissolves into her.
00:45:56,00:45:58,And all that's left is a tiny pair of testicles.
00:45:58,00:46:01,"Oh my god, that's incredible."
00:46:01,00:46:02,That's basically it.
00:46:02,00:46:05,Their skin and their organs all fuse together.
00:46:05,00:46:09,"And for a long time, I think they assumed that there wasn't a male in the picture at all, right?"
00:46:09,00:46:10,They just thought it was female.
00:46:10,00:46:11,"Actually, you're looking."
00:46:11,00:46:12,That's him.
00:46:12,00:46:13,Testicles!
00:46:13,00:46:15,I know those testicles anywhere.
00:46:15,00:46:17,This is great.
00:46:17,00:46:19,We all know couples like that.
00:46:19,00:46:22,I wonder if that's what the perfect distance is.
00:46:22,00:46:27,"Kind of like with the eclipse of a moon and the sun, that you could have the male anglerfish near you and the female."
00:46:27,00:46:30,That they will appear to be the same size.
00:46:30,00:46:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:31,00:46:35,"Do you get females, don't you, which have lots of pairs of testicles just hanging off them?"
00:46:35,00:46:39,"Yeah, you get six or seven males will have been fused into one female at once."
00:46:39,00:46:40,Really?
00:46:40,00:46:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:41,00:46:44,"And it's just like, you know, have you had many previous boyfriends?"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"No, actually, you don't need to tell me."
00:46:46,00:46:48,"Oh, it's like a brownie sash with your badge just that you've collected."
00:46:48,00:46:50,"Yeah, exactly."
00:46:50,00:46:55,That's how you explain this to your five-year-old.
00:46:55,00:46:57,That's really brownies.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"Oh, no, they're brilliant."
00:46:59,00:47:00,They're so good.
00:47:00,00:47:01,They are.
00:47:01,00:47:02,Yeah.
00:47:02,00:47:04,"And they do, when they're lava, they look really cool."
00:47:04,00:47:08,And there's not enough focus on this in the anglerfish world of chat.
00:47:08,00:47:12,"They, when they're lava, they're surrounded by this jelly egg."
00:47:12,00:47:14,So that is transparent.
00:47:14,00:47:19,And so you'll see this tiny little anglerfish and then it's got this big see-through pile of jelly around it.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"Like, absorbing."
00:47:20,00:47:21,"Like, absorbing, exactly."
00:47:21,00:47:22,Really?
00:47:22,00:47:23,Yeah.
00:47:23,00:47:24,That's very cool.
00:47:24,00:47:25,All absorbing.
00:47:25,00:47:26,You guys have seen an anglerfish in person?
00:47:26,00:47:27,"No, not in the flesh."
00:47:27,00:47:28,Not in the flesh.
00:47:28,00:47:29,I've met one.
00:47:29,00:47:30,Get away.
00:47:30,00:47:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:47:31,00:47:32,I met one.
00:47:32,00:47:33,I met a very famous one.
00:47:33,00:47:40,I met the one that basically was in Blue Planet that was discovered by all your celebrity anecdotes.
00:47:40,00:47:41,Names dropping.
00:47:41,00:47:42,So exhausting.
00:47:42,00:47:45,Are you a close personal friend of this anglerfish?
00:47:45,00:47:47,I was at a cocktail party with her.
00:47:47,00:47:48,We got chatting.
00:47:48,00:47:50,"I don't even remember you, Dan, okay?"
00:47:50,00:47:54,How many testicles did she have on her?
00:47:54,00:47:58,"No, so years ago I got to work with Alistair Fathergill."
00:47:58,00:48:03,He came on Museum of Curiosity and he's the person who found the hairy anglerfish.
00:48:03,00:48:05,So he went down and he filmed it.
00:48:05,00:48:10,"They, so you filmed it for an a half, isn't it?"
00:48:10,00:48:15,Did he show you his hairy anglerfish?
00:48:15,00:48:17,Fly me.
00:48:17,00:48:20,So they brought it back up and it dies in the process.
00:48:20,00:48:23,"Oh, when they died, did their lights go out?"
00:48:23,00:48:24,Like a Pixar.
00:48:24,00:48:25,It might do.
00:48:25,00:48:27,"But they would live on, wouldn't they?"
00:48:27,00:48:28,They would.
00:48:28,00:48:29,That's even sadder.
00:48:29,00:48:30,This is the nuts thing.
00:48:30,00:48:31,It's that they're bacteria.
00:48:31,00:48:32,And I was reading a thing.
00:48:32,00:48:33,How do they get these bacteria?
00:48:33,00:48:34,"Yeah, yeah."
00:48:34,00:48:39,"Because normally when hosts have symbionts, you know, things living on them that rely on them,"
00:48:39,00:48:44,"they either find them in the local area or they, um, or they inherit them."
00:48:44,00:48:49,Bacteria wants to live on your nose.
00:48:49,00:48:55,"Um, no, but they sometimes inherit them from their parents with other animals."
00:48:55,00:48:58,But anglerfish never have any contact with their parents.
00:48:58,00:49:00,It will be insane for them to.
00:49:00,00:49:02,His dad's been dissolved.
00:49:02,00:49:04,Come say hi to your father.
00:49:04,00:49:05,"He's like, what?"
00:49:05,00:49:11,Give him a little jiggle.
00:49:11,00:49:16,It was a real male role model.
00:49:16,00:49:19,"Um, but no, they don't get their lure until much later in life, even."
00:49:19,00:49:21,So they must find them in their area.
00:49:21,00:49:25,They must pick them up from around the place and they have them on the end of their nose.
00:49:25,00:49:27,"What if they, like, didn't find enough?"
00:49:27,00:49:31,"That would be like a Pixar film, like the anglerfish that couldn't find the bacteria."
00:49:31,00:49:32,That's a good one.
00:49:32,00:49:33,That's good.
00:49:33,00:49:35,Don't maybe edit that out so I can write it.
00:49:35,00:49:36,Yeah.
00:49:36,00:49:37,Please don't.
00:49:37,00:49:38,I will never write that.
00:49:38,00:49:39,Yeah.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"Um, I found something that swims, but it can never be upside down."
00:49:42,00:49:43,Ooh.
00:49:43,00:49:45,What are they doing to me this?
00:49:45,00:49:46,Okay.
00:49:46,00:49:47,What could that be?
00:49:47,00:49:48,Something big and flat like this.
00:49:48,00:49:49,My vision.
00:49:49,00:49:52,Like a manta ray?
00:49:52,00:49:54,"Maybe they're big and flat, but they can't."
00:49:54,00:49:55,"They swim, but they, no."
00:49:55,00:49:56,No.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Right.
00:49:57,00:49:58,A starfish.
00:49:58,00:49:59,Not a starfish.
00:49:59,00:50:00,Stupid.
00:50:00,00:50:01,A ball.
00:50:01,00:50:02,A ball.
00:50:02,00:50:03,A ball.
00:50:03,00:50:04,A ball has no upside down.
00:50:04,00:50:05,A boat.
00:50:05,00:50:06,Do they swim?
00:50:06,00:50:07,"Oh, okay."
00:50:07,00:50:08,A water boat.
00:50:08,00:50:09,"- Yes, you probably are."
00:50:09,00:50:11,- The answer is the word swims.
00:50:11,00:50:14,- Smooth.
00:50:14,00:50:16,- Swims is an ambegram.
00:50:16,00:50:18,You flip it upside down and it's exactly the same.
00:50:18,00:50:20,- I've got my hot.
00:50:20,00:50:22,"- Wow, with arousal."
00:50:22,00:50:24,"- Yes, I'm incredibly aroused."
00:50:24,00:50:25,- That's amazing.
00:50:25,00:50:26,- I love that stuff.
00:50:26,00:50:27,- That's really good.
00:50:27,00:50:30,That is great. - That is great.
00:50:30,00:50:32,"- That's really lovely stuff, Dan."
00:50:32,00:50:33,- That's a good riddle.
00:50:33,00:50:34,- Who would have thought?
00:50:34,00:50:35,- The riddle. - The riddle.
00:50:35,00:50:36,- Finally.
00:50:36,00:50:38,- You can stay.
00:50:38,00:50:39,- You've passed the audition.
00:50:39,00:50:40,- I said a boat.
00:50:40,00:50:42,- What the fuck are you saying?
00:50:42,00:50:44,(laughing)
00:50:44,00:50:46,- That's why I'm hostess podcast.
00:50:46,00:50:48,- They don't swim and they can be upside down.
00:50:48,00:50:49,- Namely.
00:50:49,00:50:55,- Just another thing on how fish swim.
00:50:55,00:50:57,Do you know how to tell if a fish is depressed?
00:50:57,00:50:59,"- Oh, no, don't."
00:50:59,00:51:00,- Is that too sad?
00:51:00,00:51:01,- Okay.
00:51:01,00:51:02,- 'Cause we've got a cure.
00:51:02,00:51:02,- Great.
00:51:02,00:51:03,- There you go.
00:51:03,00:51:04,- What a roller coaster.
00:51:04,00:51:05,- I know.
00:51:05,00:51:06,(laughing)
00:51:06,00:51:07,"- So you only said the fact yet, please."
00:51:07,00:51:08,- That's the cure.
00:51:08,00:51:09,"Come on, the podcast."
00:51:09,00:51:10,It'll raise your spirits right up.
00:51:10,00:51:11,- What's the cure?
00:51:11,00:51:12,"- Well, antidepressants."
00:51:12,00:51:14,And we only have a cure because we've trialled
00:51:14,00:51:17,human antidepressants on them to make them better.
00:51:17,00:51:19,"But, how do you know that they're depressed?"
00:51:19,00:51:21,- So they swim at the bottom of their tanks.
00:51:21,00:51:25,So depressed fish swim low and happy fish swim
00:51:25,00:51:27,at the top of the surface of the water
00:51:27,00:51:28,or the top of their tanks.
00:51:28,00:51:30,And this is actually really useful
00:51:30,00:51:33,according to scientists who do trial antidepressants
00:51:33,00:51:36,because it's a really obvious sign that they're depressed.
00:51:36,00:51:38,So we can trial antidepressants on them
00:51:38,00:51:39,and we know if they're working.
00:51:39,00:51:40,And they--
00:51:40,00:51:41,- They just go higher.
00:51:41,00:51:42,- 'Cause they just get higher and higher.
00:51:42,00:51:43,"So you go, ""Oh, pros out."
00:51:43,00:51:44,"""That's doing the trick."""
00:51:44,00:51:45,"Look, it's like in the air."
00:51:45,00:51:46,- It's out of the water.
00:51:46,00:51:47,(laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:50,- Is it true or have I just made this up in my brain
00:51:50,00:51:54,that goldfish grow to fill their tanks?
00:51:54,00:51:56,"If you actually give them a bigger tank,"
00:51:56,00:51:57,they just keep going.
00:51:57,00:51:57,- That is true.
00:51:57,00:51:59,- And that's so sad in retrospect.
00:51:59,00:52:01,"Because when I was growing up,"
00:52:01,00:52:03,we had just a little tank with three fish
00:52:03,00:52:05,"and you're like, ""God, we were sort of shrinking off the tank."""
00:52:05,00:52:09,- That's a thing when people throw them into the wild
00:52:09,00:52:11,into little lakes and so on.
00:52:11,00:52:13,They just turn into these turbo sharks.
00:52:13,00:52:15,"- Exactly, you were doing a public service"
00:52:15,00:52:18,"by keeping them from, you know, taking over."
00:52:18,00:52:22,Upside downness?
00:52:22,00:52:23,Sure.
00:52:23,00:52:25,This is a very weird thing.
00:52:25,00:52:28,Which is better for a rhino to be?
00:52:28,00:52:32,"Upside down or not upside down, lying down?"
00:52:32,00:52:34,- Is it in the circus?
00:52:34,00:52:35,- It's not in the circus.
00:52:35,00:52:36,- It's not.
00:52:36,00:52:37,- Okay.
00:52:37,00:52:39,- Let me take you to the Vupetage favor button.
00:52:39,00:52:39,"No, okay."
00:52:39,00:52:42,It's better for a rhino to be upside down
00:52:42,00:52:44,than it is for it to be lying on its side.
00:52:44,00:52:45,Isn't that weird?
00:52:45,00:52:46,- How does it get there?
00:52:46,00:52:47,Why?
00:52:47,00:52:49,"- Well, I think we might have mentioned a while ago."
00:52:49,00:52:50,- We've done this about the rhinos.
00:52:50,00:52:52,- They transport rhinos to new areas
00:52:52,00:52:55,"by putting them in a helicopter,"
00:52:55,00:52:57,stringing them up by their ankles.
00:52:57,00:52:57,"- No, not in the helicopter."
00:52:57,00:53:00,(laughing)
00:53:00,00:53:02,"- No, they hogtie them."
00:53:02,00:53:03,- Right.
00:53:03,00:53:06,- They lift them up upside down
00:53:06,00:53:08,and then they fly to the new nature reserve
00:53:08,00:53:09,where they have to get them to.
00:53:09,00:53:10,It's the easiest way to transport them.
00:53:10,00:53:11,- Okay.
00:53:11,00:53:12,- It takes like 10 or 15 minutes.
00:53:12,00:53:13,It's really fast.
00:53:13,00:53:14,And no--
00:53:14,00:53:15,- What depends on the distance?
00:53:15,00:53:16,- Regardless of where they go.
00:53:16,00:53:17,(laughing)
00:53:17,00:53:18,- And on traffic.
00:53:18,00:53:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:53:19,00:53:21,But they're normally not taking them
00:53:21,00:53:23,like from South Africa to Tunisia.
00:53:23,00:53:26,"You know, it's not like a short journey."
00:53:26,00:53:27,But nobody had checked how their hearts and lungs
00:53:27,00:53:29,actually cope with this journey.
00:53:29,00:53:30,"And a team of scientists,"
00:53:30,00:53:32,"led by Robin Radcliffe from Cornell,"
00:53:32,00:53:34,"realized oh, we should probably look into"
00:53:34,00:53:35,whether or not they're--
00:53:35,00:53:36,"- Yeah, they're like--"
00:53:36,00:53:37,- Incredibly upset.
00:53:37,00:53:37,- Oh my gosh.
00:53:37,00:53:38,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:53:38,00:53:42,And so they held 12 rhinos upside down by their feet
00:53:42,00:53:45,for an experiment from a crane.
00:53:45,00:53:46,"And they're also dated, obviously."
00:53:46,00:53:47,But they were just testing their heart and lungs.
00:53:47,00:53:49,And it turns out that it's much better
00:53:49,00:53:50,for it to be upside down.
00:53:50,00:53:52,"Because when a rhino's on its side,"
00:53:52,00:53:53,their lungs are a bit distorted.
00:53:53,00:53:54,"You know, the gravity means--"
00:53:54,00:53:55,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:53:55,00:53:57,- The lungs are not getting equal amounts of oxygen
00:53:57,00:54:00,for the air exchange and all of that gas exchange.
00:54:00,00:54:01,"But when they're upside down,"
00:54:01,00:54:03,it is equal because they're just upside down.
00:54:03,00:54:03,- Lovely.
00:54:03,00:54:04,- So--
00:54:04,00:54:05,"- When they sleep, they go upside down."
00:54:05,00:54:06,"- They go upside down, yeah, yeah."
00:54:06,00:54:07,- Like on their backs.
00:54:07,00:54:08,"- Liners, yeah, yeah."
00:54:08,00:54:11,"If you go for a walk in certain bits of Namibia,"
00:54:11,00:54:12,you'll look up in the trees
00:54:12,00:54:14,and you can see hanging from the trees.
00:54:14,00:54:14,- Stop it.
00:54:14,00:54:15,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:15,00:54:16,(laughing)
00:54:16,00:54:17,- I just want to be wrong on the back.
00:54:17,00:54:18,It's all I'm meant for.
00:54:18,00:54:20,- I don't think they like it.
00:54:20,00:54:21,- They should.
00:54:21,00:54:22,- They should.
00:54:22,00:54:23,- They should.
00:54:23,00:54:25,There are like rhino articles on the web.
00:54:25,00:54:27,You've been sleeping all wrong your whole life.
00:54:27,00:54:30,(laughing)
00:54:30,00:54:32,- There is another fish that swims upside down.
00:54:32,00:54:33,- Ooh.
00:54:33,00:54:34,"- Well, it's not actually a fish."
00:54:34,00:54:36,"It's krill, not technically a fish, I suppose."
00:54:36,00:54:38,(laughing)
00:54:38,00:54:40,"- Forstalling the letters, very nice."
00:54:40,00:54:41,(laughing)
00:54:41,00:54:45,- Antarctic krill swim upside down in the Antarctic
00:54:45,00:54:47,when the water's covered in ice
00:54:47,00:54:50,so that they can graze like cows on the underside of the ice.
00:54:50,00:54:51,- Gorgeous.
00:54:51,00:54:52,- And they eat algae that grows
00:54:52,00:54:53,on the underside of the ice.
00:54:53,00:54:55,And they live such a weird life.
00:54:55,00:54:58,"They migrate, quite weird migration, but up and down."
00:54:58,00:55:01,So they graze on algae swimming upside down
00:55:01,00:55:03,and then they get quite fat and heavy from it.
00:55:03,00:55:05,And then they sink 'cause they're too heavy
00:55:05,00:55:08,and they have to fan themselves out like a parachute
00:55:08,00:55:10,and they sink about 50 meters down
00:55:10,00:55:11,"and then they think, oh God, I'm really hungry again."
00:55:11,00:55:13,So then they've used up all their food supply.
00:55:13,00:55:15,"So then they have to swim up to the top again, eat"
00:55:15,00:55:17,and then sink and that's their lives.
00:55:17,00:55:19,And they do about three times a day for their whole lives.
00:55:19,00:55:20,- Wow.
00:55:20,00:55:22,- And then they die.
00:55:22,00:55:25,- I go to the fridge more than three times a day.
00:55:25,00:55:26,I'm just saying I empathize.
00:55:26,00:55:28,That's my life too.
00:55:28,00:55:29,- It's like your whole life upside down.
00:55:29,00:55:31,- Go back and forth for a food source.
00:55:31,00:55:33,"Yeah, it kind of is when you think about it."
00:55:33,00:55:34,- You're so right.
00:55:34,00:55:35,"It's what we all do, isn't it?"
00:55:35,00:55:38,"- I'm at work, I then go downstairs, I guess food."
00:55:38,00:55:40,And he's always got a plate of something
00:55:40,00:55:42,that he just comes up with something on the go.
00:55:42,00:55:43,"- Oh, I thought you Dan were saying"
00:55:43,00:55:45,that is kind of our light and philosophical way.
00:55:45,00:55:46,"- Oh, I thought you were saying that."
00:55:46,00:55:47,"- Yeah, I thought that."
00:55:47,00:55:49,- And I was just saying yes too.
00:55:49,00:55:50,- The only reason they don't have a podcast
00:55:50,00:55:51,is it's too wet for all the equipment.
00:55:51,00:55:53,(all laughing)
00:55:53,00:55:54,That's fine.
00:55:54,00:55:56,(upbeat music)
00:55:57,00:56:00,(upbeat music)
00:56:00,00:56:02,"- Okay, that's it."
00:56:02,00:56:03,That is all of our facts.
00:56:03,00:56:04,Thank you so much for listening.
