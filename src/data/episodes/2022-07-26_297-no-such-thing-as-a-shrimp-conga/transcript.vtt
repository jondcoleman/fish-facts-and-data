00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.600
 (cheers and applause)

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.320
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.260
 this week coming to you live from New York City!

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 (cheers and applause)

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.280
 - My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.160
 I am sitting here with Anichezinski,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.200
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.660
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.880
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.360
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 my fact is Carl Sagan spent two years suing Apple computers

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.680
 for calling him a butt head.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.520
 (audience laughs)

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.080
 - That's gonna be hard 'cause you have to prove

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.280
 that you're not a butt head drinker.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.920
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.040
 So for listeners who don't know who Carl Sagan is,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.120
 he is of course the great scientist.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.040
 He did the TV show, "Cosmos," the golden disc

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.680
 on the Voyager, he was the person who dreamt that up.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920
 He's one of the greatest public science speakers

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.240
 of all time, if not the best.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.040
 - Is he a New Yorker, who's he?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 - He's born in Brooklyn, yeah.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 (audience cheers)

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.720
 Born in the same little village

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 that the three stoogers were born in.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.920
 So this was in 1993.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 So basically what happened is that Apple computers

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
 were releasing the Power Macintosh 7100,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.760
 and when they were putting it together,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.080
 and they had to talk to the media and stuff,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.640
 they had a code name that they used, which was Carl Sagan.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.160
 And the joke in the team was that the idea was

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.680
 they wanted to sell billions and billions

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.480
 of the new computer.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.240
 So Sagan found out about this, and he said,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.080
 he wrote them a letter saying,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.600
 "You absolutely can't do this.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.320
 "You're using my name to profit with your company,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.520
 "and I don't want you to do that.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.800
 "Can you please stop?"

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.640
 So they did stop, but what they did instead

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.000
 was rename the code name BHA,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.640
 which stood for Butthead Astronomer.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 (audience laughs)

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 And he thought that's defamation of characters.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.200
 So he sued them, and unfortunately he lost,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.080
 and so they carried on with it.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.760
 So then he then tried to sue them

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 for calling it Carl Sagan to begin with at all,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.400
 and he lost that as well.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520
 But then he then tried to sue them once again,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.600
 and they settled outside of court.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.720
 So we don't know what happened there,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.400
 but the final code name that was given in place of BHA

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.360
 was L.A.W. Law, which stood for Lawyers or Wimps.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.040
 (audience laughs)

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 - Wow.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.960
 - So there were no hard feelings at the end of it, clearly.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.800
 - Yeah.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.480
 - It must have hurt though, because billions and billions,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.200
 billions and billions is the phrase

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.600
 that he's really famous for, and that's, as you say,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.240
 why they named it that, and he never bloody said it,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.840
 and there's always used to really annoy him.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.000
 For someone who was interested in the huge cosmic questions,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 he had quite a petty side, it seems.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So he once was presenting on his documentaries,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.560
 and he said there are billions of stars out there.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.840
 And I think Johnny Carson on the tonight show

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
 did an impersonation of him where he said billions

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.360
 and billions, and that became his catchphrase,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.720
 and it really pissed him off.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.320
 And he used to be asked to say billions and billions.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.840
 It's not even a good catchphrase.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.760
 And he'd refuse to say it, and he'd refuse to write it,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.840
 and eventually he caved and started saying it,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.880
 and writing it all over the shop.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.320
 Well, that's the thing, I first read about billions and billions,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.800
 the fact that it wasn't his, in one of his later books,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.000
 a collection of essays, which was called "Billions and Billions."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.720
 Oh, there we go, yeah.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.520
 But he did that unit that he said

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.520
 that has become a kind of joke unit in astronomical terms.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.800
 A "sagan" means, it means four billion.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800
 Oh, really?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.480
 It's billions plus billions.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.000
 Wow, what is approximately four billion?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.720
 It's any number greater than four billion.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.560
 Yeah, it's a "sagan", so it's very useless term for--

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
 Yeah, exactly, how often are we using the "sagan" in life?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.920
 Never, never, never.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.680
 The story of the Voyager Gold Disc was also very, very cool,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 because I did not know that he was behind this,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.840
 so the Voyager exploration and the space was nearly a cassette tape.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.240
 They nearly put that up, but they realized

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.040
 that it would get shot to pieces by radiation and things like this.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.480
 Yeah, but it's copper coated in gold,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.600
 and that will last for a quarter of a "sagan" years.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.480
 Oh, cool.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.080
 Very cool.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.080
 And there are lots of stories about it.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 And one of the stories that I knew that you would like,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.080
 Dan, is that the song "Here Comes the Sun" by the Beatles

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.120
 was going to be on it, but the Beatles weren't

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.200
 allowed to put it on there because they didn't own the copyright

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080
 to a lot of their own material at the time.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.000
 That's the story.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.280
 It turns out it's not true, and the producer of the disc--

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.800
 I didn't know how to record producer behind it, but there we go--

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.000
 he said, in an article that he wrote about it,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.840
 it's not the Beatles' strongest work,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.880
 and the witticism of the title, if charming in the short run,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.040
 seemed unlikely to remain funny for a billion years.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 He's asking a huge amount of any joke

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.560
 to remain funny for one billion years.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.520
 He must have been really insulted

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.000
 to be called a butthead, as well, because he

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.560
 hated beaverson butthead.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560
 Did he?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.160
 Is he on record as having hated?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.320
 He is.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.800
 In one of his bloody side.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.760
 In one of his books, he said, "The dumbing down of America

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.040
 is most evident in the slow decay

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.120
 of substantive content in the enormously influential media.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.400
 As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.240
 is a movie, "Dum and Dumber."

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.600
 Beaverson Butthead also remains popular.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 Wow.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.800
 He absolutely hated beaverson butthead.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 Oh.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.640
 I think he just didn't get it.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.920
 Yeah.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920
 Yeah.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.200
 Do you know Beaverson Butthead are named the two people

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.520
 and named after real people?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.280
 No.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.560
 Yeah, so the guy who created it was Mike Judge,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.920
 and he lived next door to a 12-year-old who called himself

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.640
 Iron Butt, because he claimed that he felt no pain

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.400
 when anyone kicks him in the backside.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.000
 Right.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.240
 And his best friend, everyone called him butthead,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.720
 because he was such good friends with Iron Butt.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.880
 And then they had a third friend who was called Bobby Beaverson.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.720
 Wow.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.560
 And he was really not famous for anything,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.480
 apart from he had a really weird laugh.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.000
 This is a kind of high-brow content you get from our podcast.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.800
 If only Sagan could have heard us speaking tonight.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.280
 It's amazing that he didn't like them,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.160
 because he was a proper stoner, Carl Sagan.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.960
 Yeah.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.960
 Like, he really loved smoking.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.160
 And it's at the point where he used to write articles

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.520
 to magazines that just dealt purely in marijuana,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.720
 sort of saying, I wish this was legalized,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.240
 and he wrote them under pseudonyms.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.760
 We didn't find this out until after he died.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.240
 But he was an advocate while he was still alive.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.600
 Can I just tell you who the first person in history

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.040
 who was called the Butthead was?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.040
 Yeah.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.440
 That was, in 1896, it was describing a guy

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.600
 called Thomas Gage, who was the British commander-in-chief

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.400
 during the Battle of Bunker Hill.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.040
 Wow.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.880
 Yeah.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.600
 And that was when the British kind of won the battle,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.200
 but it was a massively peric victory,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.960
 because they lost, like, 1,000 men in the battle.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.280
 And someone wrote about him saying he was an absolute Butthead.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.320
 Oh.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.320
 That seems actually a bit too weakening, though,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.520
 for someone who's murdered thousands of men.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.560
 I know someone else who was called--

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.000
 what was it, Iron Butt?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.520
 Iron Butt.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.600
 So Iron Ass was also the nickname of Richard Nixon.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.120
 What was it?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.800
 Yeah.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.280
 The people used to kick him in the butt and he couldn't feel it.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 No, well, he got it for a slightly different reason.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.720
 When it was a student, he was known for his cast, Iron Ass.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.120
 If you've got an Iron Ass, it just means you're very dedicated

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.960
 and you keep on sitting down until you've finished sitting.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.840
 I don't know, until the work is done.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.880
 I'm going to sit here with my Iron Ass.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.200
 Oh, right.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.640
 But it's also, if you're being stubborn deliberately.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.600
 Because Iron Man, not the cartoon character,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.280
 the actual thing that you do to become an Iron Man

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.440
 is the triathlon, all that sort of stuff.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.760
 There's no bit where you just have to sit on a chair for hours.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.720
 Oh, we've come to the Iron Ass segment of the Iron Man competition.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.120
 Do you know Bussock used to mean a common strumpet?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.880
 A common what?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.040
 No, I didn't know that.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.560
 A strumpet.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.280
 What's a strumpet?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.120
 It's like a crumpet.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.520
 It's a sort of delicacy.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.240
 It's nice.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.200
 You should order one next time you'll have a café.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.160
 You know a strumpet.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.240
 It's like a bit somewhere between a prostitute

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.000
 and a quite flirtatious woman.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.480
 What?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.720
 There's a nimb between.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.880
 It's a promiscuous lady from days of your largely.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.080
 I thought it was still in common parlance, but apparently not.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.880
 Has everyone else heard that?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.880
 Wow, OK.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.120
 Usually if you're at a dinner and you say it's anyone else heard that,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.040
 one other person's like, yeah, 900 people is embarrassing.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.240
 There's a good German insult, which is if you call someone an ash-geiger,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.480
 that means a butt-viral in.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.520
 Which is cool.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.400
 And there's another one.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.280
 They've got quite a few of these.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.560
 And another one is an ash-mit-urren, which is, if you're an idiot,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.600
 they call you an ash-mit-urren, which means you're just an ash-with-ears.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 This is strong insult.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.640
 We're going to have to move on soon to our next fan.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.040
 I've just got one more defamation/buttuck fact.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.240
 Ah, yeah.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.080
 Well, I've got a few more, but I'm going to say one.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.960
 This is, do you guys know the company, The North Face,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.760
 that makes clothing?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760
 Yeah.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.480
 Well, there was a guy called Jimmy Winkelman Sr.,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.600
 who decided that he was going to make his own company

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.760
 called The South Butt.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.600
 Very funny.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.440
 And they obviously said, you can't do this,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.680
 because the logo was pretty similar to The North Face.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.600
 They said, you can't do that.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.800
 And he said, no, no, it's a parody.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.680
 It's a parody.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.080
 And in the end, they went to court, and they sued him.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.000
 And he was forced to cease all promotion and sales

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.360
 of South Butt products and abandon his trademark immediately.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.600
 And they also forced him to get rid of his other trademark, The Butt Face.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:57.960
 Just there's one other weird defamation case, which has been in the news recently.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.120
 And so you know, Rebel Wilson.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.960
 Have you heard?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.440
 OK, yeah.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.360
 Now I'm talking your language.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.360
 She just won the biggest payout in Australian history

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.480
 for a defamation suit.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.640
 It was $4.6 million Australian dollars.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.320
 And it was because she was accusing a media group of defamation

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.760
 for saying that she'd been well brought up.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.800
 So really?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.600
 She goes around saying that I'm such a bogeon.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.680
 You know, and she talks about how she's such a bogeon.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.720
 She really embraces it.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.720
 And a bogeon is like a male trumpet, I guess.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.840
 And it's not.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.440
 I'm an Aussie, it's not.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.960
 You guys here, do you know what a bogeon is?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.080
 It's like a-- it's so hard to explain what it is without being derogatory.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.680
 It's an Australian term for someone who's a bit rough and ready.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.520
 So she's always really embraced this.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.320
 She's gone from a real working class background,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.360
 real bogeon upbringing, and a media group called her Upper Middle Class.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.120
 And she's managed to successfully sue them.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.160
 She had to go to court with her family and prove that she was a bogeon.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.720
 Wow, no way.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720
 Wow.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.360
 Unbelievable.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.880
 Amazing.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.120
 They had to do things like talk about what the kids were called,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.360
 what her siblings were called.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.560
 So their names are rebel, liberty, and anarchy.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.800
 And his anarchy-- anarchy.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.760
 Anarchy spelled A-double-n-a-c-h-i.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.800
 I don't think understandably the judge decided

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.360
 this was irrefutable evidence that she was, in fact, a bogeon.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.120
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.840
 And that is Andy.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.480
 My fact is that, in 1995, astronaut Bill Gregory ate 48 meals in a row,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.440
 which included shrimp cocktail.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.960
 Was he in space at the time?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.880
 He was.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.840
 He's in space.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.920
 So--

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.280
 In 1995, while in space.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.440
 So astronauts love shrimp cocktail.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:50.960
 Yeah.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.840
 They can't get enough of it.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.040
 It's-- and it's hard to come by up there, obviously.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.000
 What do you mean, sorry, is this part of the selection process?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.640
 Yeah, it's one of the-- it's the final question.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.920
 You go through all of your training for a few years,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.360
 and then they just give you a plate of shrimp cocktail

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.800
 and say, what would you do with that?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.960
 Yeah, they do absolutely love it, don't they?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.120
 So Chris Hadfield, who was in space just a couple of years ago,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.720
 he said it was his favorite food.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.400
 And Edward White, who was in space in 1965,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.880
 said it was his favorite food.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.440
 And pretty much everyone from that guy to that guy

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.480
 was just love this stuff.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.280
 Really?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.640
 So I mean, Gregory was having it for breakfast.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.920
 He was having it with his breakfast.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.200
 He'd have fruit yoghurt, some oatmeal,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.040
 and then a shrimp cocktail for his breakfast.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.240
 And Jim Riley, when he was on the end of it,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.960
 he would take his Russian colleagues on mere bags

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.240
 of shrimp cocktail as a friendly offering between neighbors.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.600
 Although I think he might have done that

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.800
 because the Americans aren't allowed alcohol on board,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.320
 whereas the Russians are.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.640
 And so often, they'll get some medicinal alcohol return

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.400
 from the Russians.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400
 Yeah.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.600
 There was one astral called Story Musgrave,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.560
 which is a brilliant name.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.760
 He was on the space shuttle.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.480
 And he sometimes with threatened other astronauts

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.000
 when they were making their menu choices.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.680
 He'd say, you better put shrimp cocktail on your menu

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.760
 or you'll be sorry.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.280
 Wow.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.360
 Because he thought that if they didn't put it on their menu,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.880
 they'd try and steal his because they

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.120
 would realize how delicious it was.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.720
 It's because it stays spicy in space, basically.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.600
 And it provides a lot more flavor than other food.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.560
 Oh, and that's a thing, isn't it?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.960
 Spice is a thing because the spice they're often

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.880
 clogged up in their nostrils and the spice rises and clears them.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.120
 I didn't know the prawn cocktail, I'm going to call it,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.280
 because I'm British.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.880
 I didn't know that it was spicy.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.440
 No, but they add spicy stuff in there.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.760
 So they could just bring it up clumps of Tabasco.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.960
 If it's-- they like it because--

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.400
 There is Tabasco in it, definitely.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.360
 Tomatoy.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.400
 Tomatoy Tabasco-y.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.400
 Trimpy goodness.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.960
 The University of Suffolk have just

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.560
 done a study where they pulled a load of shrimp out of Britain's

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.000
 waterways and found that every single shrimp they looked at

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.920
 contained cocaine.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.800
 Wow.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.000
 Really?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.520
 Wow.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.160
 Every single.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.640
 How would you have a good time as a shrimp?

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.760
 How are you doing up there, Bill?

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.600
 Yeah, I'm doing really well.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.200
 The earth's really big.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.240
 I was ready massive.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.200
 Not as important as me, though.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.480
 I feel like I'm in top of the whole situation up here.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.920
 Desperately shoving shrimp up their nose.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.640
 That's incredible.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.280
 Do we-- why do they all have so much--

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.080
 It has been flushed into the rivers from human sewage

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:32.080
 because too many humans are taking illegal drugs.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.400
 And we're on to you.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.840
 Catamin as well.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.800
 A lot of catamin.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.160
 It's a horse tranquilizer.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.000
 Yeah, is it a downer?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.480
 Yeah, it's a bit of a downer when you're giving it a shrimp.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.080
 You must have to take much less as a shrimp than you do

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.880
 as a horse.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.120
 I mean, sorry.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.000
 Just to clarify, a horse don't take it for fun.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.400
 They don't.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.960
 I don't think the shrimp are doing that either, too bad.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.480
 That's right.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.120
 Someone emailed me, actually, this week saying

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.960
 that New York's drinking water is full of crustaceans.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.120
 Is this the thing that you guys are all familiar with?

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.640
 Isn't it?

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.720
 There seems to be a theme online, which

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.800
 is that New York has the best drinking water in the world.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.080
 But it's also riddled with--

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.920
 yeah, someone agrees, kid.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.560
 Riddled with tiny crustaceans.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.560
 And I read that once, so that is a problem

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.200
 because it's technically not kosher, is that right?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200
 Oh.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.000
 I think so, yeah.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.920
 Which I think, if you're a really orthodox Jew,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.160
 you have to get filtered water, I think.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160
 Oh, I felt like--

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.440
 A few people in this audience feeling so horrified.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.640
 I have another New York shrimp fact, surprising.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.320
 So there are some-- it's tangential.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.240
 But there are some shrimp species, which are social,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.080
 and they form little kingdoms.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.320
 So there's a king and a queen shrimp in these shrimp societies.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.720
 And these are really small shrimp.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.960
 They're about the size of a grain of rice.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.600
 There are many.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.760
 But they live inside sea sponges.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.680
 And if an intruder comes in and meets a single shrimp--

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.920
 shrimp is face-to-face with a big predator,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.280
 the shrimp will snap its claws rhythmically to summon its friends.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.880
 But like, is it West Side Story?

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.120
 Like, West Side Story.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.240
 Wow.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.120
 Jesus, it's the jets, the sharks, and the shrimp.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.560
 They have got the cocaine trade stitched up, the shrimps.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.120
 They're good clickers, actually.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.080
 Prawns aren't they?

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.120
 So they do a strong line in making clicking noises

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.280
 with their claws.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.040
 And there's the pistol shrimp, which does this.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.560
 So it looks bizarre.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.040
 It's got one incredibly fat swollen claw,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.200
 and one really slender one.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.400
 It looks kind of like Nadal.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.360
 Do you remember when he had one huge left arm?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.680
 Right.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.360
 The Nadal of the shrimp world.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.200
 And basically, it uses its giant claw

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.040
 to fire bubbles at its foes.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.080
 It's like a machine gun fire, so it projects bubbles

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.880
 through the water.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.720
 And they go so fast, and they reach unbelievable temperatures.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.040
 So when their bubbles burst and smash into the face of a predator,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.480
 then they reach 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.200
 They are hotter than the surface of the sun, which is mad.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.680
 And they also have this bizarre thing with their pinters,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.880
 where if they are attacked on the pincer,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.560
 then they can shed it.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.760
 So their pincer will drop off.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.360
 So let's say they're attacked in their big pincer.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.560
 It drops off, and that's OK, because it grows back.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.360
 But if they lose the big fat pincer,

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.520
 it grows back as a thin one.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.640
 And then the other one that used to be thin

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.720
 compensates and becomes big and fat.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.920
 And occasionally, you get shrimps who have screwed this up somehow.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.800
 And they've got two huge fat pincers.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.560
 And that seems really cool, but it's really sad,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.160
 because they're essentially like a knife and fork.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.320
 So they have respective purposes.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.840
 So the slender pincer is needed for sort of picking

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.920
 the meat out of their prey once they've killed it.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.440
 So if they only have the big fat ones,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.160
 they're just killing their prey left, right, and center.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.760
 And then they can't actually--

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.480
 So it's like Nadal, if he could only play really hard shots,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.840
 he could do any drop shots.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.840
 Exactly.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.080
 Brett's starting that analogy.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.640
 I was looking at general crustaceans as well as this.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.480
 There are some ancient crustaceans,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.920
 which spent so much energy growing their genitals

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.160
 that they went extinct.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.920
 Isn't--

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.440
 No, what?

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.760
 These are things called ostracods.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.440
 They're small-- the chalk-shelled crustaceans, they're tiny.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.680
 And they're very ancient as well.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.440
 They go back hundreds of millions of years.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.480
 And in fossils, you can tell the difference

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.320
 between male and female ones, because the males have more genitals,

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.280
 and they are a slightly larger shape

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.280
 to accommodate those said genitals.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.720
 In fact, they're mostly--

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.680
 a third of the internal volume of the male is genitals.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.440
 You've said genitals a lot in this sense of--

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.200
 I have a bit.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.520
 Yeah.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.120
 We'll get ready, James, because they're more to come.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.720
 I wish that's the first time I heard that.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:52.240
 It's all flooding back.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:59.680
 I wish this wasn't the show that our respected partners were at.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.640
 So the male ostracods with the bigger genitals

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.760
 of the species studied were likely to go extinct,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.440
 because they had put so many resources of their life

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.800
 into growing their genitals that they couldn't really

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.760
 respond to change.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.600
 It's like spending an enormous amount of money

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.920
 building a giant penis statue on your house.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.600
 If you then have a run of bad luck, you'll go bankrupt,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.520
 because you haven't got the necessary cash packing.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.240
 This is not as good as the Nadal one, I know.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.440
 I know, I know.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.880
 What it's like is, if you play tennis and you grow your arm

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.640
 really, really big, you're right arm, you get really good.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.480
 But then the rules change, and everyone has to play left-handed.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.840
 It's like that, isn't it?

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.400
 That is better than...

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.800
 I've spent so much money on that statue.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.440
 So just on then, they also had a huge sperm.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.000
 This is the incredible thing about them.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.080
 Their sperm were...

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.840
 I think their sperm were 10 times bigger than their bodies.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.520
 - What? - Yeah.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.000
 They had to sort of...

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.840
 Yeah, so once they developed a sperm,

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.960
 they'd only have one, I think.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.280
 How does that work, though?

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.160
 - They're folded. - Oh, they're folded.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.720
 It's not like coming out of his mouth, and I'm...

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.640
 Well, it does when it's delivered,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.440
 so it's all coiled up like a hose pipe,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.600
 but when it's delivered, I suppose,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.760
 you'd be able to just go on and on,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.000
 like one of those handkerchiefs coming out of a magician's pocket.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.320
 Wow.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.720
 What?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.360
 How obsessive.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.920
 How fun it sex be if that's what happened every time.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.960
 How fun would children's parties be if that happened every time?

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.440
 So, there was one shrimp-like animal

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.480
 from the Cambrian period called Sino-Falos Xynos,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.840
 and they had a groove on their face

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.640
 that could lock onto the tail of another one of their kind.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.120
 And so, what they would do is they would keep locking themselves

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.520
 on like a load of Legos

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.600
 and just became a massive version of that animal.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.200
 The human centipede.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.000
 The...

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.760
 The shrimp conger, I think, is what you mean.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.360
 That is a much nicer movie, isn't it?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.600
 (laughing)

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.200
 I imagine, Dan, you in a human centipede,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.720
 like, "Let's do a conger."

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.800
 (laughing)

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.400
 You always like to see the good in every situation, don't you?

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.680
 (laughing)

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.040
 Worst birthday party ever.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040
 (laughing)

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.440
 That's now the magician.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.360
 (laughing)

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.040
 Okay, we're gonna have to move on to our next fact.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.280
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.120
 Okay, my fact this week is that the loudest male birds

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.120
 on earth use their voices to yell at females

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.080
 who are sat right next to them.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.840
 (laughing)

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.160
 And I don't think we can see any kind of parallels in our species.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.680
 So, this is an article in the journal Current Biology

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.920
 by a couple of scientists called Jeffrey Podos

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.840
 and Mario Cohen Haft.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.040
 And they have found this bird called the white bellbird.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.440
 And it can shelter an average of 106,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.600
 at 116 decibels from a distance of one meter.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.640
 And the reason that they're really good at shouting

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.720
 is they have a really, really simple song.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.400
 So, there's no trills, nothing like that, no flourishes.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.600
 It's just one, it's like a fog horn.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.880
 (laughing)

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.400
 And also, when they've cut them up,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.920
 they've realized that they have,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.600
 well, according to this article, it says,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.400
 "Unlike most birds, the species has great habs."

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.680
 Whoa.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.760
 And so, what he can do is just go to a female

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.400
 and just go right next to her and go,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.040
 "I've got great habs!"

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.520
 (laughing)

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.600
 And she will find that very attractive.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.840
 - Well, I think, 'cause this is how they,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.280
 this is the ones that have been observed.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.040
 And the scientists studying them, this guy, Dr. Podos,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.040
 he said that they start by facing away from the female,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.960
 and they start shouting when they're looking

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.800
 in the other direction.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.880
 And then suddenly they just swing around

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.240
 and start shouting, and Podos said

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.880
 that we never saw copulation.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.560
 We never saw what a really good male does.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.280
 The ones we saw might have just been losers.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.880
 - Oh, really?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.800
 I didn't see that there.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.840
 That's to make a lot more sense, isn't it?

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.880
 I suppose the idea, from what they're saying is,

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.000
 because they don't have all these trills and whistles

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.800
 and things like that, the females can't judge

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.560
 how good the song is on how technically good it is.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.920
 All they can judge it on is how strong it is

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.760
 and how loud it is.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.600
 - Right, right.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.440
 - Let's say it.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 - Or how thoughtful and quiet it is.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.360
 (laughing)

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.200
 And I think, isn't it the case that the reason they are able

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.680
 to be so loud is because they don't chew their food.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.520
 So they... - That's right.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.880
 Yeah, their beak's open, don't they, really wide?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.760
 - Yeah, they've got massive mouths

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.800
 and they just eat whole fruit, swallow it down completely whole,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.640
 and they're just sits there in their stomach for ages,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.200
 which maybe is what that makes their absolute, so impressive.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.160
 And then they just throw up the seeds when they're done.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.520
 And because they've got these huge mouths

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.800
 and these strong digestive muscles,

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.440
 that's meant, had the side effect have been good at singing.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.280
 - Wow. - That's very cool.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.520
 They're a part of, so they're called the bellbird,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.960
 I believe. - That's right, the white bellbird.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.720
 - The white bellbird, so there's a few of those species

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.800
 dotted around, and there's one which is called

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.120
 the three-wattled bellbird, and they have a similar call

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.720
 as loud, so if you're a human listening to it,

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.360
 it's just under a mile away that you would hear

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.080
 this sound that comes out, and that's not the loudest.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.280
 Your one's loudest, imagine being right next to it,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.640
 but their sound, which is a three-part song that they do,

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.400
 for the mating call and for the, sort of, telling males

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.640
 that I'm in this territory, is called,

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.800
 and this is a very English word, but it's called the bonk.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.480
 - Hmm. - And for a mating call,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.480
 the bonk is, so an England bonk means to have the sex.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.320
 And, yeah, I mean, fancy a bonk, you strumped it,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.560
 is a common phrase in our culture.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.640
 - Yeah. (audience applauding)

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.000
 - So, there are other birds called satin bowerbirds,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.760
 and they actually are a bit more sensitive to the females

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.160
 than these, what was it, the billbirds.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.920
 So they are capable of being very loud,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.080
 but they realize that if they continue very loud,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.560
 once they have an initial lead with a female,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.920
 then they will startle and put off the females,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.320
 so they deliberately tone it down.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.720
 - Yeah, they give very intense behavioral displays,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.440
 as it's called, and then the females crouch

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.720
 and say, "I'm not having a nice date anymore,"

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.520
 and the males then back off.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.640
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.040
 - Do you say they're bowerbirds?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.880
 - Yes.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880
 - So, the one thing I know about bowerbirds

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.120
 is some of the species they make, like,

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.120
 they make nests that are like little tunnels, right?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.240
 And the, at the end of the tunnel,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.560
 they'll put a load of, like, blue objects, for instance.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.920
 It's always kind of the same column,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.120
 and they'll put a load of objects there,

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.800
 and then they'll funnel the female into this tunnel

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.400
 and show her the amazing objects that they collected.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.240
 - Yeah.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.600
 - But what they like to do is they like to put

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.480
 the bigger objects at the back,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.400
 and the smaller objects at the front,

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.560
 and that creates a force perspective.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.840
 So, when they stand in the middle of their blue objects,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.360
 they look way bigger.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.200
 (audience laughing)

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.440
 - Oh, cool. - Isn't that cool?

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.240
 - What do they stand next to the big ones?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.720
 - Yeah, or is it the other way around?

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.960
 I can't remember, right?

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.680
 - They understand perspective more than you do,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680
 it's what you're saying.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.600
 (audience laughing)

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.520
 They did a study on zebra finches, I think last year, in 2018,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.320
 and they found that they practiced singing in their sleep.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.360
 So, they look at zebra finches,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.520
 and they see that their vocal cords move

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.920
 in the exact same way that they move when they're awake,

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.080
 and their neurons are firing in the same way

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.160
 that they're firing when they're awake.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.040
 So, they're literally singing the same tunes,

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.560
 and the only reason that you can't hear them

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.240
 is because they have their mouths shut,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.160
 and they're not passing air over them.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.120
 And so, if you were to get a sleeping zebra finch,

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.640
 open its mouth, and then blow into its face.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.000
 - Well, you're gonna be arrested for that call.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 (audience laughing)

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.840
 - You do not get arrested for blowing it a zebra finch.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.760
 - Well, if you don't, you bloody well should do that.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.160
 - Anyway, if you do that, it will play the bird song.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.000
 - Wow.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.840
 - Isn't that incredible?

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.680
 - That's incredible.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.520
 - Nice and amazing.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.720
 Do you know there are some birds that French kiss?

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.560
 - Oh, no.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.680
 - White fronted parrots French kiss.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.160
 They will open their beaks,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.520
 and they'll flick their tongues back and forth.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.040
 It's quite romantic, actually.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.840
 The male will then regurgitate his food

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.920
 into the female's mouth as a form of affection.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.520
 - I was just looking into mating rituals generally

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.160
 within the animal world,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160
 and I found, so this is a bit of,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.720
 it's not quite directly connected,

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.400
 but I found the story that happened in China,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.000
 a male cat that had been put into a pet sort of hotel

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.280
 for the evening while his owners were away,

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.840
 and they told them the cat's not been neutered.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.080
 And so, you know, keep them away from other cats.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.360
 And they came back in the morning,

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.320
 and the cats, turned out, had all been let out,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.000
 and the staff had gone home,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.040
 and they saw on CCTV that this cat ended up sleeping

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.600
 with five different cats over the course of the evening.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.120
 They didn't know this to begin with,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.520
 but they worked out because the cat was so exhausted

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.720
 that it needed to be put on a glucose drip.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.040
 (laughing)

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.520
 - This cat was absolutely knackered,

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.880
 and the owner asked to see the CCTV.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.320
 He said, "Between the hours of 10, 40 PM

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.240
 "and 5 AM, my cat mated with five female cats,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.640
 "and those are the only ones I could see on the CCTV footage.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.720
 "Who knows what else?"

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.880
 And so they blamed him.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.520
 They were like, "Well, you should have neutered your cat."

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.400
 He said, "I told them, and now all these cats

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.320
 "are gonna be pregnant.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.320
 "No one, no owner wants their cats to be pregnant."

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.160
 And his quotes, my favorite quote,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.200
 "My fucking cat is exhausted, and on a glucose drip,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.400
 "and this is my fault."

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.160
 (laughing)

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.400
 (upbeat music)

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.160
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.160
 and that is Chazinski.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.120
 - My fact this week is that in the 1490s,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.320
 the Italians called syphilis the French disease,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.160
 the French called it the Italian disease,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.880
 the Russians called it the Polish disease,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.040
 the Polish called it the Turkish disease,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.560
 the Turkish called it the Christian disease,

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.440
 and the Tahitians called it the British disease.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.560
 Actually, they all should have been calling it

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.000
 the American disease.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.040
 (laughing)

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.760
 It's just scientific fact, guys.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.000
 (laughing)

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.480
 - I want to make clear at the start of this fact,

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.560
 I really don't think a nation should be blamed

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.200
 for being the origin of an illness.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.320
 I make that clear from the start,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.480
 but syphilis started here, and...

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.680
 (laughing)

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.800
 Well, this was a huge deal, so it was 1495,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.440
 this syphilis outbreak suddenly happened in Europe,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.880
 and they didn't know where this awful illness had come from,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.080
 and there have been a lot of talks,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.960
 it was just when Columbus had just popped over to America,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.720
 and picked up some stuff and come back.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.240
 And so there's been speculation that maybe one of the things

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.280
 that he brought back with him was syphilis,

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.560
 but they've recently done a study in 2011,

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.800
 they actually did a study,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.440
 and they looked at all the bones of people

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.240
 who maybe died of syphilis from the pre-Columbus era,

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.000
 and they found that none of them actually had,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 they're all sort of masquerading in syphilis,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.960
 but with something else.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.160
 And syphilis did not arrive in Europe

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.880
 until that expedition to the Americas,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.920
 but it devastated Europe.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.680
 This is one of the reasons why everyone was blaming their neighbours,

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.120
 'cause it was ruinous and disgusting.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.680
 There was a thing about the people who were living in Europe

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.600
 and were thought to have had syphilis pre-Columbus,

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.080
 so there were 16 bodies that were found,

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.960
 and I think there might have been monks in England,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.120
 in Lindisfan, somewhere,

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.880
 but they all have had it, and they were older,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.600
 so this was very good evidence for syphilis not being a Columban thing.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.480
 However, this is the amazing thing.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.760
 They lived in coastal regions

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.600
 where a load of their diet was seafood, okay?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.920
 And if you eat a load of seafood,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.600
 a lot of the water in the deep ocean contains old carbon,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.040
 it's carbon, which is a lot older

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.320
 than the carbon we get from our food today.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.680
 So, this thing called the marine reservoir effect

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.360
 means that if you eat a lot of seafood,

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.560
 that will have had deep old carbon in it,

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.720
 and the carbon in that is older.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.640
 So, your skeleton will look hundreds of years older

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.320
 to experts in the future.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.960
 So, these people died of syphilis,

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.160
 but they were older than we thought.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160
 No, younger than we thought.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.560
 These people were a lot younger than we thought.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560
 Oh, really?

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.120
 We thought they were from 800-80, for example,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.080
 but actually they were from way later than that.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.080
 Isn't that bizarre?

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.560
 Yeah, you can make yourself seem older by eating seafood.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560
 Yeah.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.320
 Oh, it's a good anti-aging tip, actually,

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.440
 for the afterlife.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.400
 Boyed fish.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.560
 It wasn't just syphilis that we got from the Americas.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:42.760
 We also got shaggers disease, which sounds like a synonym

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.040
 for syphilis, actually, but it isn't.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.240
 And there were about 8,000 people a year die of that.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.920
 Sorry, what do we know where that is?

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.840
 Yeah, it's like a parasitic infection that you get.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.120
 People always at the door and had it.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.400
 I think they've decided that he didn't know.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.840
 Their pinter is another one, which is non-fatal.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.000
 And as far as I can see, they're the three main things

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.960
 that we got from the Americas.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.280
 In return, Americans got bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera,

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.640
 diptheria, gonorrhea, influenza, leprosy, malaria,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.040
 measles, mumps, rubella, scallop fever,

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.880
 smallpox, and tuberculosis.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.760
 So it doesn't feel like we should be blaming them that much.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.360
 Oh, no.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.640
 I like whoever it was who was cheering that list, though.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.200
 From level of pride.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.440
 I've got them all.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.400
 I've got to catch them all.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.240
 There we go.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.880
 Do you think that was the Pokemon Go?

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.000
 Was there a foreseeable hunt?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.200
 Pokemon Go immediately to a doctor.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.760
 Do you know what, in the 15th, 16th centuries--

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.040
 16th onwards-- it was very contagious, obviously,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.000
 and transmitted sexually.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.200
 So it was seen as a big social problem.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.840
 Hence, everyone's blaming everyone else.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.000
 So if you were in a country that was not your own,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.680
 you might be deported if you got the disease.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.480
 And if you were wealthy, you might be put under house arrest.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.040
 But for people who were not wealthy,

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.760
 it was still an enormous problem.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.400
 And you could go to a hospital.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.840
 They actually constructed some hospitals

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.240
 to help people with this disease.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.040
 But the catch was, you would be publicly whipped

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.400
 before you went into hospital.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.440
 And then again, after you came out--

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.720
 Wow.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.600
 Yeah.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.160
 It's a good disincentive, though, if you're

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.400
 trying to keep the health budget down, I think.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.120
 Telling people you'll beat them before and after they

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.600
 go into hospital, would stop some people from going, wouldn't it?

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.760
 I guess, yeah.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.040
 I'm not advising it as a policy.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.600
 I'm just thinking, elections coming up in both of our countries.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.840
 It is definitely a thing, though, of blaming foreigners

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.680
 as net for illnesses.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.600
 So for instance, US Senate candidate from New Hampshire,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.960
 Scott Brown, said that undocumented immigrants

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.880
 were bringing Ebola into the US.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.960
 Tontellis said that they should shut down

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.200
 the southern border completely to keep Ebola at bay.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.440
 Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said that Ebola infected

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.000
 terrorists might launch a biological terror attack

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.240
 from Mexico.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.840
 Basically, they thought that people with Ebola

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.200
 were going to come up from Mexico and spread it in the US.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.840
 Now, Mexico has had no confirmed cases of Ebola

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.680
 in its entire history.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.600
 And in fact, the closest country to Mexico

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.800
 with any confirmed Ebola cases is, of course,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.160
 the United States of America.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.120
 There's a bizarre disease called jumping Frenchman syndrome.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.280
 Just a sense, in fact, is about sort of us blaming illnesses

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.160
 on the Gallic peoples.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.440
 So jumping Frenchman syndrome was only

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.000
 recorded in one place, one time.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.360
 And it was among the jumping Frenchmen of Maine in 1878.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.400
 And there were 50 cases of it.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.320
 And basically, it was these people

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.040
 who reacted really abnormally to sudden stimuli.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.840
 So if you sort of shouted at them,

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.720
 they just jumped really high in the air.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.320
 They either jumped really high, or they shouted,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.360
 or they hit someone.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.280
 And they also had this thing where they instinctively

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.520
 obeyed any instructions that you gave them.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.320
 If you gave them immediate instructions,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.000
 they did it straight away without thinking about it.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.600
 So if you said, push your life off a cliff, they'd just do it.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.120
 And no one knows what it is.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.200
 They were all French, Canadian, or sort of on the border

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.000
 of Canada, lumberjacks in this remote region.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.920
 And they think it might be just one of these remote illnesses

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.920
 confined to a very--

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.360
 like a genetic thing, I guess, if you live on a place.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.120
 How long would the belief in the command last for?

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.200
 Because if you were a lumberjack and they said,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.360
 push your life off a cliff, you'd have to grab her

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.520
 and run quite a long way to find your cliff.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.560
 But you could say, punch that guy to two of the lumberjacks,

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.160
 and they would punch each other immediately.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160
 Wow.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.080
 Yeah, it was dangerous.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.600
 You shouldn't say that around them, in fact.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.000
 Anyone from Northern Maine just don't risk it, in this case.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.560
 So I found a disease, which one of us has I've discovered.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.520
 And we won't be--

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.920
 This is like the best reality show ever.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.200
 Andy, you've got syphilis.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.600
 Well, if I have, James has.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:15.240
 Huge gossip there to be discussed in the dressing room.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.840
 Does the one of us know that we have it?

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.360
 No.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.160
 No, really.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.200
 Yeah, and I'm not sure, actually, if we do have it, but--

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.000
 Wow.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.720
 --but I've got evidence that we might.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.200
 So there's a thing called coprographia.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.680
 There's a few other variations on that word.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.800
 Oh, I know what you're going with that.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.520
 Yeah, so the idea is that you find yourself involuntarily

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.960
 if you're just sitting down and let's say you have a pen and paper

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.680
 or you're near a window drawing a cock and balls on the thing.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.760
 You just find yourself just doing it.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.080
 You didn't know you were doing it.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.720
 Now, the reason I think that one of us has it

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.080
 is because when we were recording the audiobook

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.440
 of the book of the year 2019, instead of reading from the book,

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.760
 they gave us iPads to read it from.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.080
 And halfway through, Anna discovered,

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.640
 there's a little button that means you can draw on the iPads.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.240
 And there was a bit in the book where she just

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.080
 didn't say anything for a tiny bit.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.680
 And we stopped, and she went, sorry, guys,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.360
 I don't know what happened.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.200
 I was really distracted.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.120
 Turned her iPads to us, and there was a massive cock and balls

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.160
 sitting--

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.760
 There wasn't one massive one.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.680
 There were loads of small ones to be fair.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.720
 That's a big difference, actually, that, dad.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.120
 OK.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.000
 It was like the shrimp conger.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.760
 It's one big one made up of lots of little.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.280
 Oh, OK.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.240
 That's the thing.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.080
 I was looking into-- so this fact is about how a disease

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.240
 got its name, and everyone said it was a fraction--

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.080
 or gave it a different name.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.680
 So I was just-- I was curious about names of diseases

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.920
 and how they get them.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.600
 And actually, quite recently, a Colorado-based scientist

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.800
 did a thing where she wanted to see if an AI machine

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.280
 could generate serious, sounding disease names.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:53.560
 And she fed in 3,765 conditions, all the descriptions

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.520
 of them into this machine to see what they came up with.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.240
 And some great names came out of it.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.040
 So according to AI, people out there

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.240
 are suffering from penis arthritis.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:12.040
 Makes me feel a bit stiff in the morning though, aren't they?

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.240
 They were all amazing.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.360
 Insect skulls was one cancer of the cancer.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.960
 And RIP syndrome.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.400
 That's amazing.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.120
 We need to wrap up, guys.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.160
 OK, that is it.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.840
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.840
 [APPLAUSE]

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.160

 @AndryHunterM.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.240
 James.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.200
 Ah, James Harkin.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.040
 And Shazinsky.

 Or you can go to our group account at no such thing or our website.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.600
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.040
 We have everything up there from upcoming tour dates

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.120
 to all of our previous episodes to things like our new book,

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.440
 The Book of the Year 2019.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.560
 Thank you so much, New York.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.560
 That was awesome.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.480
 We'll see you again.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.520
 Good night.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.040
 [APPLAUSE]

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.620

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.620
 (upbeat music)
