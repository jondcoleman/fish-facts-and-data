00:00:02,00:00:09,(cheers and applause)
00:00:09,00:00:17,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,this week coming to you live from New York City!
00:00:23,00:00:26,(cheers and applause)
00:00:28,00:00:30,- My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"I am sitting here with Anichezinski,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:34,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:36,00:00:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:39,00:00:42,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week,"
00:00:46,00:00:51,my fact is Carl Sagan spent two years suing Apple computers
00:00:51,00:00:53,for calling him a butt head.
00:00:53,00:00:55,(audience laughs)
00:00:55,00:00:57,- That's gonna be hard 'cause you have to prove
00:00:57,00:00:58,that you're not a butt head drinker.
00:00:58,00:00:59,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:00:59,00:01:03,"So for listeners who don't know who Carl Sagan is,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,he is of course the great scientist.
00:01:05,00:01:08,"He did the TV show, ""Cosmos,"" the golden disc"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"on the Voyager, he was the person who dreamt that up."
00:01:10,00:01:12,He's one of the greatest public science speakers
00:01:12,00:01:14,"of all time, if not the best."
00:01:14,00:01:16,"- Is he a New Yorker, who's he?"
00:01:16,00:01:17,"- He's born in Brooklyn, yeah."
00:01:17,00:01:18,(audience cheers)
00:01:18,00:01:20,Born in the same little village
00:01:20,00:01:23,that the three stoogers were born in.
00:01:23,00:01:24,So this was in 1993.
00:01:24,00:01:27,So basically what happened is that Apple computers
00:01:27,00:01:31,"were releasing the Power Macintosh 7100,"
00:01:31,00:01:32,"and when they were putting it together,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,"and they had to talk to the media and stuff,"
00:01:34,00:01:37,"they had a code name that they used, which was Carl Sagan."
00:01:37,00:01:41,And the joke in the team was that the idea was
00:01:41,00:01:43,they wanted to sell billions and billions
00:01:43,00:01:45,of the new computer.
00:01:45,00:01:48,"So Sagan found out about this, and he said,"
00:01:48,00:01:49,"he wrote them a letter saying,"
00:01:49,00:01:50,"""You absolutely can't do this."
00:01:50,00:01:53,"""You're using my name to profit with your company,"
00:01:53,00:01:54,"""and I don't want you to do that."
00:01:54,00:01:55,"""Can you please stop?"""
00:01:55,00:01:57,"So they did stop, but what they did instead"
00:01:57,00:02:01,"was rename the code name BHA,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,which stood for Butthead Astronomer.
00:02:03,00:02:04,(audience laughs)
00:02:04,00:02:06,And he thought that's defamation of characters.
00:02:06,00:02:10,"So he sued them, and unfortunately he lost,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,and so they carried on with it.
00:02:12,00:02:13,So then he then tried to sue them
00:02:13,00:02:16,"for calling it Carl Sagan to begin with at all,"
00:02:16,00:02:17,and he lost that as well.
00:02:17,00:02:19,"But then he then tried to sue them once again,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,and they settled outside of court.
00:02:21,00:02:22,"So we don't know what happened there,"
00:02:22,00:02:26,but the final code name that was given in place of BHA
00:02:26,00:02:30,"was L.A.W. Law, which stood for Lawyers or Wimps."
00:02:30,00:02:32,(audience laughs)
00:02:32,00:02:32,- Wow.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- So there were no hard feelings at the end of it, clearly."
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Yeah.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"- It must have hurt though, because billions and billions,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,billions and billions is the phrase
00:02:40,00:02:43,"that he's really famous for, and that's, as you say,"
00:02:43,00:02:47,"why they named it that, and he never bloody said it,"
00:02:47,00:02:48,and there's always used to really annoy him.
00:02:48,00:02:51,"For someone who was interested in the huge cosmic questions,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"he had quite a petty side, it seems."
00:02:53,00:02:58,"So he once was presenting on his documentaries,"
00:02:58,00:03:01,and he said there are billions of stars out there.
00:03:01,00:03:03,And I think Johnny Carson on the tonight show
00:03:03,00:03:05,did an impersonation of him where he said billions
00:03:05,00:03:07,"and billions, and that became his catchphrase,"
00:03:07,00:03:08,and it really pissed him off.
00:03:08,00:03:11,And he used to be asked to say billions and billions.
00:03:11,00:03:12,It's not even a good catchphrase.
00:03:12,00:03:16,"And he'd refuse to say it, and he'd refuse to write it,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,"and eventually he caved and started saying it,"
00:03:18,00:03:19,and writing it all over the shop.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Well, that's the thing, I first read about billions and billions,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"the fact that it wasn't his, in one of his later books,"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"a collection of essays, which was called ""Billions and Billions."""
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Oh, there we go, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:32,But he did that unit that he said
00:03:32,00:03:35,that has become a kind of joke unit in astronomical terms.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"A ""sagan"" means, it means four billion."
00:03:38,00:03:39,"Oh, really?"
00:03:39,00:03:41,It's billions plus billions.
00:03:41,00:03:43,"Wow, what is approximately four billion?"
00:03:43,00:03:44,It's any number greater than four billion.
00:03:44,00:03:47,"Yeah, it's a ""sagan"", so it's very useless term for--"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"Yeah, exactly, how often are we using the ""sagan"" in life?"
00:03:50,00:03:51,"Never, never, never."
00:03:51,00:03:54,"The story of the Voyager Gold Disc was also very, very cool,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,"because I did not know that he was behind this,"
00:03:56,00:04:01,so the Voyager exploration and the space was nearly a cassette tape.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"They nearly put that up, but they realized"
00:04:03,00:04:07,that it would get shot to pieces by radiation and things like this.
00:04:07,00:04:08,"Yeah, but it's copper coated in gold,"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"and that will last for a quarter of a ""sagan"" years."
00:04:12,00:04:14,"Oh, cool."
00:04:14,00:04:15,Very cool.
00:04:15,00:04:17,And there are lots of stories about it.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"And one of the stories that I knew that you would like,"
00:04:19,00:04:23,"Dan, is that the song ""Here Comes the Sun"" by the Beatles"
00:04:23,00:04:25,"was going to be on it, but the Beatles weren't"
00:04:25,00:04:27,allowed to put it on there because they didn't own the copyright
00:04:27,00:04:29,to a lot of their own material at the time.
00:04:29,00:04:30,That's the story.
00:04:30,00:04:33,"It turns out it's not true, and the producer of the disc--"
00:04:33,00:04:35,"I didn't know how to record producer behind it, but there we go--"
00:04:35,00:04:39,"he said, in an article that he wrote about it,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"it's not the Beatles' strongest work,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"and the witticism of the title, if charming in the short run,"
00:04:43,00:04:47,seemed unlikely to remain funny for a billion years.
00:04:47,00:04:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:49,00:04:51,He's asking a huge amount of any joke
00:04:51,00:04:52,to remain funny for one billion years.
00:04:52,00:04:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:55,00:04:56,He must have been really insulted
00:04:56,00:04:59,"to be called a butthead, as well, because he"
00:04:59,00:05:00,hated beaverson butthead.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Did he?
00:05:01,00:05:03,Is he on record as having hated?
00:05:03,00:05:04,He is.
00:05:04,00:05:05,In one of his bloody side.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"In one of his books, he said, ""The dumbing down of America"
00:05:08,00:05:11,is most evident in the slow decay
00:05:11,00:05:15,of substantive content in the enormously influential media.
00:05:15,00:05:18,"As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"is a movie, ""Dum and Dumber."""
00:05:20,00:05:23,Beaverson Butthead also remains popular.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Wow.
00:05:24,00:05:26,He absolutely hated beaverson butthead.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Oh.
00:05:27,00:05:29,I think he just didn't get it.
00:05:29,00:05:30,Yeah.
00:05:30,00:05:31,Yeah.
00:05:31,00:05:34,Do you know Beaverson Butthead are named the two people
00:05:34,00:05:35,and named after real people?
00:05:35,00:05:36,No.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"Yeah, so the guy who created it was Mike Judge,"
00:05:39,00:05:42,and he lived next door to a 12-year-old who called himself
00:05:42,00:05:46,"Iron Butt, because he claimed that he felt no pain"
00:05:46,00:05:49,when anyone kicks him in the backside.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Right.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"And his best friend, everyone called him butthead,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,because he was such good friends with Iron Butt.
00:05:55,00:05:58,And then they had a third friend who was called Bobby Beaverson.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Wow.
00:05:59,00:06:01,"And he was really not famous for anything,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,apart from he had a really weird laugh.
00:06:03,00:06:07,This is a kind of high-brow content you get from our podcast.
00:06:07,00:06:09,If only Sagan could have heard us speaking tonight.
00:06:09,00:06:11,"It's amazing that he didn't like them,"
00:06:11,00:06:14,"because he was a proper stoner, Carl Sagan."
00:06:14,00:06:14,Yeah.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"Like, he really loved smoking."
00:06:16,00:06:19,And it's at the point where he used to write articles
00:06:19,00:06:22,"to magazines that just dealt purely in marijuana,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"sort of saying, I wish this was legalized,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,and he wrote them under pseudonyms.
00:06:26,00:06:27,We didn't find this out until after he died.
00:06:27,00:06:30,But he was an advocate while he was still alive.
00:06:30,00:06:32,Can I just tell you who the first person in history
00:06:32,00:06:34,who was called the Butthead was?
00:06:34,00:06:35,Yeah.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"That was, in 1896, it was describing a guy"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"called Thomas Gage, who was the British commander-in-chief"
00:06:41,00:06:43,during the Battle of Bunker Hill.
00:06:43,00:06:44,Wow.
00:06:44,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:47,"And that was when the British kind of won the battle,"
00:06:47,00:06:49,"but it was a massively peric victory,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"because they lost, like, 1,000 men in the battle."
00:06:51,00:06:55,And someone wrote about him saying he was an absolute Butthead.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Oh.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"That seems actually a bit too weakening, though,"
00:06:58,00:07:01,for someone who's murdered thousands of men.
00:07:01,00:07:03,I know someone else who was called--
00:07:03,00:07:05,"what was it, Iron Butt?"
00:07:05,00:07:05,Iron Butt.
00:07:05,00:07:09,So Iron Ass was also the nickname of Richard Nixon.
00:07:09,00:07:10,What was it?
00:07:10,00:07:10,Yeah.
00:07:10,00:07:13,The people used to kick him in the butt and he couldn't feel it.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"No, well, he got it for a slightly different reason."
00:07:16,00:07:20,"When it was a student, he was known for his cast, Iron Ass."
00:07:20,00:07:23,"If you've got an Iron Ass, it just means you're very dedicated"
00:07:23,00:07:25,and you keep on sitting down until you've finished sitting.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"I don't know, until the work is done."
00:07:28,00:07:30,I'm going to sit here with my Iron Ass.
00:07:30,00:07:32,"Oh, right."
00:07:32,00:07:34,"But it's also, if you're being stubborn deliberately."
00:07:34,00:07:37,"Because Iron Man, not the cartoon character,"
00:07:37,00:07:40,the actual thing that you do to become an Iron Man
00:07:40,00:07:42,"is the triathlon, all that sort of stuff."
00:07:42,00:07:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:43,00:07:47,There's no bit where you just have to sit on a chair for hours.
00:07:47,00:07:53,"Oh, we've come to the Iron Ass segment of the Iron Man competition."
00:07:53,00:07:56,Do you know Bussock used to mean a common strumpet?
00:07:56,00:07:56,A common what?
00:07:56,00:07:58,"No, I didn't know that."
00:07:58,00:07:58,A strumpet.
00:07:58,00:07:59,What's a strumpet?
00:07:59,00:08:00,It's like a crumpet.
00:08:00,00:08:02,It's a sort of delicacy.
00:08:02,00:08:03,It's nice.
00:08:03,00:08:06,You should order one next time you'll have a café.
00:08:06,00:08:07,You know a strumpet.
00:08:07,00:08:10,It's like a bit somewhere between a prostitute
00:08:10,00:08:14,and a quite flirtatious woman.
00:08:14,00:08:14,What?
00:08:14,00:08:15,There's a nimb between.
00:08:15,00:08:21,It's a promiscuous lady from days of your largely.
00:08:21,00:08:27,"I thought it was still in common parlance, but apparently not."
00:08:27,00:08:29,Has everyone else heard that?
00:08:29,00:08:32,"Wow, OK."
00:08:32,00:08:35,"Usually if you're at a dinner and you say it's anyone else heard that,"
00:08:35,00:08:40,"one other person's like, yeah, 900 people is embarrassing."
00:08:40,00:08:45,"There's a good German insult, which is if you call someone an ash-geiger,"
00:08:45,00:08:48,that means a butt-viral in.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Which is cool.
00:08:49,00:08:50,And there's another one.
00:08:50,00:08:51,They've got quite a few of these.
00:08:51,00:08:55,"And another one is an ash-mit-urren, which is, if you're an idiot,"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"they call you an ash-mit-urren, which means you're just an ash-with-ears."
00:09:01,00:09:03,This is strong insult.
00:09:03,00:09:05,We're going to have to move on soon to our next fan.
00:09:05,00:09:10,I've just got one more defamation/buttuck fact.
00:09:10,00:09:11,"Ah, yeah."
00:09:11,00:09:14,"Well, I've got a few more, but I'm going to say one."
00:09:14,00:09:16,"This is, do you guys know the company, The North Face,"
00:09:16,00:09:17,that makes clothing?
00:09:17,00:09:18,Yeah.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"Well, there was a guy called Jimmy Winkelman Sr.,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,who decided that he was going to make his own company
00:09:23,00:09:26,called The South Butt.
00:09:26,00:09:28,Very funny.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"And they obviously said, you can't do this,"
00:09:30,00:09:33,because the logo was pretty similar to The North Face.
00:09:33,00:09:34,"They said, you can't do that."
00:09:34,00:09:35,"And he said, no, no, it's a parody."
00:09:35,00:09:36,It's a parody.
00:09:36,00:09:39,"And in the end, they went to court, and they sued him."
00:09:39,00:09:42,And he was forced to cease all promotion and sales
00:09:42,00:09:46,of South Butt products and abandon his trademark immediately.
00:09:46,00:09:50,"And they also forced him to get rid of his other trademark, The Butt Face."
00:09:50,00:09:57,"Just there's one other weird defamation case, which has been in the news recently."
00:09:57,00:10:00,"And so you know, Rebel Wilson."
00:10:00,00:10:00,Have you heard?
00:10:00,00:10:02,"OK, yeah."
00:10:02,00:10:05,Now I'm talking your language.
00:10:05,00:10:08,She just won the biggest payout in Australian history
00:10:08,00:10:10,for a defamation suit.
00:10:10,00:10:12,It was $4.6 million Australian dollars.
00:10:12,00:10:16,And it was because she was accusing a media group of defamation
00:10:16,00:10:18,for saying that she'd been well brought up.
00:10:18,00:10:20,So really?
00:10:20,00:10:23,She goes around saying that I'm such a bogeon.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"You know, and she talks about how she's such a bogeon."
00:10:25,00:10:26,She really embraces it.
00:10:26,00:10:28,"And a bogeon is like a male trumpet, I guess."
00:10:28,00:10:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:31,00:10:33,And it's not.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"I'm an Aussie, it's not."
00:10:35,00:10:36,"You guys here, do you know what a bogeon is?"
00:10:36,00:10:41,It's like a-- it's so hard to explain what it is without being derogatory.
00:10:41,00:10:43,It's an Australian term for someone who's a bit rough and ready.
00:10:43,00:10:46,So she's always really embraced this.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"She's gone from a real working class background,"
00:10:48,00:10:52,"real bogeon upbringing, and a media group called her Upper Middle Class."
00:10:52,00:10:54,And she's managed to successfully sue them.
00:10:54,00:10:58,She had to go to court with her family and prove that she was a bogeon.
00:10:58,00:10:59,"Wow, no way."
00:10:59,00:11:00,Wow.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Unbelievable.
00:11:01,00:11:01,Amazing.
00:11:01,00:11:05,"They had to do things like talk about what the kids were called,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,what her siblings were called.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"So their names are rebel, liberty, and anarchy."
00:11:09,00:11:11,And his anarchy-- anarchy.
00:11:11,00:11:16,Anarchy spelled A-double-n-a-c-h-i.
00:11:16,00:11:18,I don't think understandably the judge decided
00:11:18,00:11:21,"this was irrefutable evidence that she was, in fact, a bogeon."
00:11:21,00:11:27,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:11:27,00:11:28,And that is Andy.
00:11:28,00:11:34,"My fact is that, in 1995, astronaut Bill Gregory ate 48 meals in a row,"
00:11:34,00:11:37,which included shrimp cocktail.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Was he in space at the time?
00:11:38,00:11:39,He was.
00:11:39,00:11:40,He's in space.
00:11:40,00:11:41,So--
00:11:41,00:11:44,"In 1995, while in space."
00:11:44,00:11:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:46,00:11:50,So astronauts love shrimp cocktail.
00:11:50,00:11:50,Yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:52,They can't get enough of it.
00:11:52,00:11:57,"It's-- and it's hard to come by up there, obviously."
00:11:57,00:12:00,"What do you mean, sorry, is this part of the selection process?"
00:12:00,00:12:03,"Yeah, it's one of the-- it's the final question."
00:12:03,00:12:05,"You go through all of your training for a few years,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,and then they just give you a plate of shrimp cocktail
00:12:08,00:12:10,"and say, what would you do with that?"
00:12:10,00:12:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:11,00:12:13,"Yeah, they do absolutely love it, don't they?"
00:12:13,00:12:18,"So Chris Hadfield, who was in space just a couple of years ago,"
00:12:18,00:12:19,he said it was his favorite food.
00:12:19,00:12:22,"And Edward White, who was in space in 1965,"
00:12:22,00:12:23,said it was his favorite food.
00:12:23,00:12:26,And pretty much everyone from that guy to that guy
00:12:26,00:12:27,was just love this stuff.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Really?
00:12:28,00:12:30,"So I mean, Gregory was having it for breakfast."
00:12:30,00:12:31,He was having it with his breakfast.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"He'd have fruit yoghurt, some oatmeal,"
00:12:34,00:12:37,and then a shrimp cocktail for his breakfast.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"And Jim Riley, when he was on the end of it,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,he would take his Russian colleagues on mere bags
00:12:42,00:12:47,of shrimp cocktail as a friendly offering between neighbors.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Although I think he might have done that
00:12:48,00:12:51,"because the Americans aren't allowed alcohol on board,"
00:12:51,00:12:53,whereas the Russians are.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"And so often, they'll get some medicinal alcohol return"
00:12:56,00:12:58,from the Russians.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"There was one astral called Story Musgrave,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,which is a brilliant name.
00:13:02,00:13:03,He was on the space shuttle.
00:13:03,00:13:06,And he sometimes with threatened other astronauts
00:13:06,00:13:08,when they were making their menu choices.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"He'd say, you better put shrimp cocktail on your menu"
00:13:10,00:13:12,or you'll be sorry.
00:13:12,00:13:13,Wow.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"Because he thought that if they didn't put it on their menu,"
00:13:15,00:13:16,they'd try and steal his because they
00:13:16,00:13:18,would realize how delicious it was.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"It's because it stays spicy in space, basically."
00:13:20,00:13:22,And it provides a lot more flavor than other food.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"Oh, and that's a thing, isn't it?"
00:13:23,00:13:25,Spice is a thing because the spice they're often
00:13:25,00:13:29,clogged up in their nostrils and the spice rises and clears them.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"I didn't know the prawn cocktail, I'm going to call it,"
00:13:33,00:13:35,because I'm British.
00:13:35,00:13:37,I didn't know that it was spicy.
00:13:37,00:13:41,"No, but they add spicy stuff in there."
00:13:41,00:13:43,So they could just bring it up clumps of Tabasco.
00:13:43,00:13:44,If it's-- they like it because--
00:13:44,00:13:46,"There is Tabasco in it, definitely."
00:13:46,00:13:47,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:47,00:13:48,Tomatoy.
00:13:48,00:13:49,Tomatoy Tabasco-y.
00:13:49,00:13:51,Trimpy goodness.
00:13:51,00:13:52,The University of Suffolk have just
00:13:52,00:13:56,done a study where they pulled a load of shrimp out of Britain's
00:13:56,00:14:00,waterways and found that every single shrimp they looked at
00:14:00,00:14:01,contained cocaine.
00:14:01,00:14:02,Wow.
00:14:02,00:14:05,Really?
00:14:05,00:14:06,Wow.
00:14:06,00:14:07,Every single.
00:14:07,00:14:09,How would you have a good time as a shrimp?
00:14:09,00:14:10,"How are you doing up there, Bill?"
00:14:10,00:14:11,"Yeah, I'm doing really well."
00:14:11,00:14:12,The earth's really big.
00:14:12,00:14:13,I was ready massive.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Not as important as me, though."
00:14:14,00:14:16,I feel like I'm in top of the whole situation up here.
00:14:16,00:14:19,Desperately shoving shrimp up their nose.
00:14:19,00:14:20,That's incredible.
00:14:20,00:14:23,Do we-- why do they all have so much--
00:14:23,00:14:27,It has been flushed into the rivers from human sewage
00:14:27,00:14:32,because too many humans are taking illegal drugs.
00:14:32,00:14:34,And we're on to you.
00:14:34,00:14:36,Catamin as well.
00:14:36,00:14:37,A lot of catamin.
00:14:37,00:14:39,It's a horse tranquilizer.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"Yeah, is it a downer?"
00:14:41,00:14:46,"Yeah, it's a bit of a downer when you're giving it a shrimp."
00:14:46,00:14:49,You must have to take much less as a shrimp than you do
00:14:49,00:14:49,as a horse.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"I mean, sorry."
00:14:51,00:14:53,"Just to clarify, a horse don't take it for fun."
00:14:53,00:14:55,They don't.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"I don't think the shrimp are doing that either, too bad."
00:14:57,00:14:58,That's right.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"Someone emailed me, actually, this week saying"
00:15:00,00:15:02,that New York's drinking water is full of crustaceans.
00:15:02,00:15:05,Is this the thing that you guys are all familiar with?
00:15:05,00:15:05,Isn't it?
00:15:05,00:15:07,"There seems to be a theme online, which"
00:15:07,00:15:09,is that New York has the best drinking water in the world.
00:15:09,00:15:11,But it's also riddled with--
00:15:11,00:15:12,"yeah, someone agrees, kid."
00:15:12,00:15:14,Riddled with tiny crustaceans.
00:15:14,00:15:16,"And I read that once, so that is a problem"
00:15:16,00:15:19,"because it's technically not kosher, is that right?"
00:15:19,00:15:20,Oh.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"I think so, yeah."
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Which I think, if you're a really orthodox Jew,"
00:15:22,00:15:25,"you have to get filtered water, I think."
00:15:25,00:15:26,"Oh, I felt like--"
00:15:26,00:15:30,A few people in this audience feeling so horrified.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"I have another New York shrimp fact, surprising."
00:15:33,00:15:35,So there are some-- it's tangential.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"But there are some shrimp species, which are social,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,and they form little kingdoms.
00:15:41,00:15:45,So there's a king and a queen shrimp in these shrimp societies.
00:15:45,00:15:46,And these are really small shrimp.
00:15:46,00:15:47,They're about the size of a grain of rice.
00:15:47,00:15:48,There are many.
00:15:48,00:15:50,But they live inside sea sponges.
00:15:50,00:15:54,And if an intruder comes in and meets a single shrimp--
00:15:54,00:15:56,"shrimp is face-to-face with a big predator,"
00:15:56,00:16:01,the shrimp will snap its claws rhythmically to summon its friends.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"But like, is it West Side Story?"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"Like, West Side Story."
00:16:04,00:16:05,Wow.
00:16:05,00:16:10,"Jesus, it's the jets, the sharks, and the shrimp."
00:16:10,00:16:14,"They have got the cocaine trade stitched up, the shrimps."
00:16:14,00:16:16,"They're good clickers, actually."
00:16:16,00:16:17,Prawns aren't they?
00:16:17,00:16:20,So they do a strong line in making clicking noises
00:16:20,00:16:21,with their claws.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"And there's the pistol shrimp, which does this."
00:16:24,00:16:25,So it looks bizarre.
00:16:25,00:16:28,"It's got one incredibly fat swollen claw,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,and one really slender one.
00:16:30,00:16:31,It looks kind of like Nadal.
00:16:31,00:16:34,Do you remember when he had one huge left arm?
00:16:34,00:16:35,Right.
00:16:35,00:16:37,The Nadal of the shrimp world.
00:16:37,00:16:41,"And basically, it uses its giant claw"
00:16:41,00:16:43,to fire bubbles at its foes.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"It's like a machine gun fire, so it projects bubbles"
00:16:45,00:16:45,through the water.
00:16:45,00:16:48,"And they go so fast, and they reach unbelievable temperatures."
00:16:48,00:16:52,"So when their bubbles burst and smash into the face of a predator,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"then they reach 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit."
00:16:54,00:16:59,"They are hotter than the surface of the sun, which is mad."
00:16:59,00:17:02,"And they also have this bizarre thing with their pinters,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"where if they are attacked on the pincer,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,then they can shed it.
00:17:06,00:17:07,So their pincer will drop off.
00:17:07,00:17:09,So let's say they're attacked in their big pincer.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"It drops off, and that's OK, because it grows back."
00:17:12,00:17:14,"But if they lose the big fat pincer,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,it grows back as a thin one.
00:17:16,00:17:18,And then the other one that used to be thin
00:17:18,00:17:20,compensates and becomes big and fat.
00:17:20,00:17:23,"And occasionally, you get shrimps who have screwed this up somehow."
00:17:23,00:17:27,And they've got two huge fat pincers.
00:17:27,00:17:29,"And that seems really cool, but it's really sad,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,because they're essentially like a knife and fork.
00:17:31,00:17:33,So they have respective purposes.
00:17:33,00:17:35,So the slender pincer is needed for sort of picking
00:17:35,00:17:38,the meat out of their prey once they've killed it.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"So if they only have the big fat ones,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"they're just killing their prey left, right, and center."
00:17:42,00:17:43,And then they can't actually--
00:17:43,00:17:46,"So it's like Nadal, if he could only play really hard shots,"
00:17:46,00:17:47,he could do any drop shots.
00:17:47,00:17:50,Exactly.
00:17:50,00:17:54,Brett's starting that analogy.
00:17:54,00:17:56,I was looking at general crustaceans as well as this.
00:17:56,00:17:58,"There are some ancient crustaceans,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,which spent so much energy growing their genitals
00:18:01,00:18:03,that they went extinct.
00:18:03,00:18:07,Isn't--
00:18:07,00:18:09,"No, what?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,These are things called ostracods.
00:18:10,00:18:14,"They're small-- the chalk-shelled crustaceans, they're tiny."
00:18:14,00:18:15,And they're very ancient as well.
00:18:15,00:18:17,They go back hundreds of millions of years.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"And in fossils, you can tell the difference"
00:18:19,00:18:23,"between male and female ones, because the males have more genitals,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,and they are a slightly larger shape
00:18:25,00:18:29,to accommodate those said genitals.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"In fact, they're mostly--"
00:18:31,00:18:34,a third of the internal volume of the male is genitals.
00:18:34,00:18:36,You've said genitals a lot in this sense of--
00:18:36,00:18:37,I have a bit.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Yeah.
00:18:38,00:18:42,"We'll get ready, James, because they're more to come."
00:18:42,00:18:43,I wish that's the first time I heard that.
00:18:43,00:18:52,It's all flooding back.
00:18:52,00:18:59,I wish this wasn't the show that our respected partners were at.
00:18:59,00:19:03,So the male ostracods with the bigger genitals
00:19:03,00:19:06,"of the species studied were likely to go extinct,"
00:19:06,00:19:10,because they had put so many resources of their life
00:19:10,00:19:12,into growing their genitals that they couldn't really
00:19:12,00:19:13,respond to change.
00:19:13,00:19:16,It's like spending an enormous amount of money
00:19:16,00:19:18,building a giant penis statue on your house.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"If you then have a run of bad luck, you'll go bankrupt,"
00:19:21,00:19:24,because you haven't got the necessary cash packing.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"This is not as good as the Nadal one, I know."
00:19:27,00:19:29,"I know, I know."
00:19:29,00:19:32,"What it's like is, if you play tennis and you grow your arm"
00:19:32,00:19:35,"really, really big, you're right arm, you get really good."
00:19:35,00:19:38,"But then the rules change, and everyone has to play left-handed."
00:19:38,00:19:39,"It's like that, isn't it?"
00:19:39,00:19:42,That is better than...
00:19:42,00:19:47,I've spent so much money on that statue.
00:19:47,00:19:53,"So just on then, they also had a huge sperm."
00:19:53,00:19:55,This is the incredible thing about them.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Their sperm were...
00:19:56,00:19:58,I think their sperm were 10 times bigger than their bodies.
00:19:58,00:20:00,- What? - Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:02,They had to sort of...
00:20:02,00:20:03,"Yeah, so once they developed a sperm,"
00:20:03,00:20:04,"they'd only have one, I think."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"How does that work, though?"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- They're folded. - Oh, they're folded."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"It's not like coming out of his mouth, and I'm..."
00:20:10,00:20:12,"Well, it does when it's delivered,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,"so it's all coiled up like a hose pipe,"
00:20:14,00:20:15,"but when it's delivered, I suppose,"
00:20:15,00:20:16,"you'd be able to just go on and on,"
00:20:16,00:20:19,like one of those handkerchiefs coming out of a magician's pocket.
00:20:19,00:20:20,Wow.
00:20:20,00:20:21,What?
00:20:21,00:20:23,How obsessive.
00:20:23,00:20:26,How fun it sex be if that's what happened every time.
00:20:26,00:20:29,How fun would children's parties be if that happened every time?
00:20:32,00:20:35,"So, there was one shrimp-like animal"
00:20:35,00:20:39,"from the Cambrian period called Sino-Falos Xynos,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,and they had a groove on their face
00:20:41,00:20:45,that could lock onto the tail of another one of their kind.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"And so, what they would do is they would keep locking themselves"
00:20:48,00:20:49,on like a load of Legos
00:20:49,00:20:52,and just became a massive version of that animal.
00:20:52,00:20:54,The human centipede.
00:20:54,00:20:56,The...
00:20:56,00:20:58,"The shrimp conger, I think, is what you mean."
00:20:58,00:21:01,"That is a much nicer movie, isn't it?"
00:21:01,00:21:03,(laughing)
00:21:03,00:21:09,"I imagine, Dan, you in a human centipede,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,"like, ""Let's do a conger."""
00:21:10,00:21:11,(laughing)
00:21:11,00:21:14,"You always like to see the good in every situation, don't you?"
00:21:14,00:21:16,(laughing)
00:21:16,00:21:19,Worst birthday party ever.
00:21:19,00:21:20,(laughing)
00:21:20,00:21:21,That's now the magician.
00:21:21,00:21:24,(laughing)
00:21:24,00:21:27,"Okay, we're gonna have to move on to our next fact."
00:21:27,00:21:30,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:21:30,00:21:34,"Okay, my fact this week is that the loudest male birds"
00:21:34,00:21:38,on earth use their voices to yell at females
00:21:38,00:21:40,who are sat right next to them.
00:21:40,00:21:41,(laughing)
00:21:41,00:21:46,And I don't think we can see any kind of parallels in our species.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"So, this is an article in the journal Current Biology"
00:21:48,00:21:50,by a couple of scientists called Jeffrey Podos
00:21:50,00:21:52,and Mario Cohen Haft.
00:21:52,00:21:56,And they have found this bird called the white bellbird.
00:21:56,00:21:59,"And it can shelter an average of 106,"
00:21:59,00:22:03,at 116 decibels from a distance of one meter.
00:22:03,00:22:06,And the reason that they're really good at shouting
00:22:06,00:22:09,"is they have a really, really simple song."
00:22:09,00:22:12,"So, there's no trills, nothing like that, no flourishes."
00:22:12,00:22:14,"It's just one, it's like a fog horn."
00:22:14,00:22:15,(laughing)
00:22:15,00:22:17,"And also, when they've cut them up,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,"they've realized that they have,"
00:22:18,00:22:20,"well, according to this article, it says,"
00:22:20,00:22:24,"""Unlike most birds, the species has great habs."""
00:22:24,00:22:25,Whoa.
00:22:25,00:22:28,"And so, what he can do is just go to a female"
00:22:28,00:22:30,"and just go right next to her and go,"
00:22:30,00:22:32,"""I've got great habs!"""
00:22:32,00:22:33,(laughing)
00:22:33,00:22:35,And she will find that very attractive.
00:22:35,00:22:39,"- Well, I think, 'cause this is how they,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,this is the ones that have been observed.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"And the scientists studying them, this guy, Dr. Podos,"
00:22:44,00:22:49,"he said that they start by facing away from the female,"
00:22:49,00:22:50,and they start shouting when they're looking
00:22:50,00:22:51,in the other direction.
00:22:51,00:22:53,And then suddenly they just swing around
00:22:53,00:22:56,"and start shouting, and Podos said"
00:22:56,00:22:58,that we never saw copulation.
00:22:58,00:23:01,We never saw what a really good male does.
00:23:01,00:23:05,The ones we saw might have just been losers.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Oh, really?"
00:23:06,00:23:08,I didn't see that there.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"That's to make a lot more sense, isn't it?"
00:23:10,00:23:13,"I suppose the idea, from what they're saying is,"
00:23:13,00:23:16,because they don't have all these trills and whistles
00:23:16,00:23:18,"and things like that, the females can't judge"
00:23:18,00:23:21,how good the song is on how technically good it is.
00:23:21,00:23:23,All they can judge it on is how strong it is
00:23:23,00:23:24,and how loud it is.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"- Right, right."
00:23:25,00:23:26,- Let's say it.
00:23:26,00:23:28,- Or how thoughtful and quiet it is.
00:23:28,00:23:31,(laughing)
00:23:31,00:23:34,"And I think, isn't it the case that the reason they are able"
00:23:34,00:23:36,to be so loud is because they don't chew their food.
00:23:36,00:23:38,So they... - That's right.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Yeah, their beak's open, don't they, really wide?"
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- Yeah, they've got massive mouths"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"and they just eat whole fruit, swallow it down completely whole,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,"and they're just sits there in their stomach for ages,"
00:23:47,00:23:50,"which maybe is what that makes their absolute, so impressive."
00:23:50,00:23:53,And then they just throw up the seeds when they're done.
00:23:53,00:23:54,And because they've got these huge mouths
00:23:54,00:23:56,"and these strong digestive muscles,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"that's meant, had the side effect have been good at singing."
00:23:59,00:24:00,- Wow. - That's very cool.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"They're a part of, so they're called the bellbird,"
00:24:02,00:24:03,"I believe. - That's right, the white bellbird."
00:24:03,00:24:05,"- The white bellbird, so there's a few of those species"
00:24:05,00:24:07,"dotted around, and there's one which is called"
00:24:07,00:24:11,"the three-wattled bellbird, and they have a similar call"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"as loud, so if you're a human listening to it,"
00:24:13,00:24:16,it's just under a mile away that you would hear
00:24:16,00:24:19,"this sound that comes out, and that's not the loudest."
00:24:19,00:24:21,"Your one's loudest, imagine being right next to it,"
00:24:21,00:24:25,"but their sound, which is a three-part song that they do,"
00:24:25,00:24:28,"for the mating call and for the, sort of, telling males"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"that I'm in this territory, is called,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,"and this is a very English word, but it's called the bonk."
00:24:33,00:24:35,"- Hmm. - And for a mating call,"
00:24:35,00:24:40,"the bonk is, so an England bonk means to have the sex."
00:24:40,00:24:45,"And, yeah, I mean, fancy a bonk, you strumped it,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,is a common phrase in our culture.
00:24:48,00:24:52,- Yeah. (audience applauding)
00:24:52,00:24:57,"- So, there are other birds called satin bowerbirds,"
00:24:57,00:25:01,and they actually are a bit more sensitive to the females
00:25:01,00:25:04,"than these, what was it, the billbirds."
00:25:04,00:25:07,"So they are capable of being very loud,"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"but they realize that if they continue very loud,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"once they have an initial lead with a female,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"then they will startle and put off the females,"
00:25:15,00:25:18,so they deliberately tone it down.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"- Yeah, they give very intense behavioral displays,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"as it's called, and then the females crouch"
00:25:22,00:25:25,"and say, ""I'm not having a nice date anymore,"""
00:25:25,00:25:27,and the males then back off.
00:25:27,00:25:28,- Really? - Yeah.
00:25:28,00:25:30,- Do you say they're bowerbirds?
00:25:30,00:25:30,- Yes.
00:25:30,00:25:31,"- So, the one thing I know about bowerbirds"
00:25:31,00:25:34,"is some of the species they make, like,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,"they make nests that are like little tunnels, right?"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"And the, at the end of the tunnel,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"they'll put a load of, like, blue objects, for instance."
00:25:42,00:25:43,"It's always kind of the same column,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,"and they'll put a load of objects there,"
00:25:45,00:25:47,and then they'll funnel the female into this tunnel
00:25:47,00:25:50,and show her the amazing objects that they collected.
00:25:50,00:25:51,- Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:53,- But what they like to do is they like to put
00:25:53,00:25:55,"the bigger objects at the back,"
00:25:55,00:25:57,"and the smaller objects at the front,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,and that creates a force perspective.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"So, when they stand in the middle of their blue objects,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,they look way bigger.
00:26:03,00:26:04,(audience laughing)
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- Oh, cool. - Isn't that cool?"
00:26:05,00:26:07,- What do they stand next to the big ones?
00:26:07,00:26:08,"- Yeah, or is it the other way around?"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"I can't remember, right?"
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- They understand perspective more than you do,"
00:26:11,00:26:12,it's what you're saying.
00:26:12,00:26:15,(audience laughing)
00:26:15,00:26:19,"They did a study on zebra finches, I think last year, in 2018,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,and they found that they practiced singing in their sleep.
00:26:22,00:26:23,"So, they look at zebra finches,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,and they see that their vocal cords move
00:26:25,00:26:27,"in the exact same way that they move when they're awake,"
00:26:27,00:26:30,and their neurons are firing in the same way
00:26:30,00:26:31,that they're firing when they're awake.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"So, they're literally singing the same tunes,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,and the only reason that you can't hear them
00:26:34,00:26:36,"is because they have their mouths shut,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,and they're not passing air over them.
00:26:38,00:26:42,"And so, if you were to get a sleeping zebra finch,"
00:26:42,00:26:46,"open its mouth, and then blow into its face."
00:26:46,00:26:49,"- Well, you're gonna be arrested for that call."
00:26:49,00:26:50,(audience laughing)
00:26:50,00:26:52,- You do not get arrested for blowing it a zebra finch.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"- Well, if you don't, you bloody well should do that."
00:26:55,00:26:58,"- Anyway, if you do that, it will play the bird song."
00:26:58,00:26:59,- Wow.
00:26:59,00:26:59,- Isn't that incredible?
00:26:59,00:27:00,- That's incredible.
00:27:00,00:27:01,- Nice and amazing.
00:27:01,00:27:03,Do you know there are some birds that French kiss?
00:27:03,00:27:04,"- Oh, no."
00:27:04,00:27:07,- White fronted parrots French kiss.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"They will open their beaks,"
00:27:09,00:27:11,and they'll flick their tongues back and forth.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"It's quite romantic, actually."
00:27:13,00:27:16,The male will then regurgitate his food
00:27:16,00:27:20,into the female's mouth as a form of affection.
00:27:20,00:27:24,- I was just looking into mating rituals generally
00:27:24,00:27:26,"within the animal world,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,"and I found, so this is a bit of,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"it's not quite directly connected,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"but I found the story that happened in China,"
00:27:33,00:27:38,a male cat that had been put into a pet sort of hotel
00:27:38,00:27:41,"for the evening while his owners were away,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,and they told them the cat's not been neutered.
00:27:43,00:27:46,"And so, you know, keep them away from other cats."
00:27:46,00:27:47,"And they came back in the morning,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"and the cats, turned out, had all been let out,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"and the staff had gone home,"
00:27:52,00:27:55,and they saw on CCTV that this cat ended up sleeping
00:27:55,00:27:57,with five different cats over the course of the evening.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"They didn't know this to begin with,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,but they worked out because the cat was so exhausted
00:28:01,00:28:03,that it needed to be put on a glucose drip.
00:28:03,00:28:06,(laughing)
00:28:06,00:28:09,"- This cat was absolutely knackered,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,and the owner asked to see the CCTV.
00:28:12,00:28:15,"He said, ""Between the hours of 10, 40 PM"
00:28:15,00:28:18,"""and 5 AM, my cat mated with five female cats,"
00:28:18,00:28:21,"""and those are the only ones I could see on the CCTV footage."
00:28:21,00:28:22,"""Who knows what else?"""
00:28:22,00:28:23,And so they blamed him.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"They were like, ""Well, you should have neutered your cat."""
00:28:25,00:28:28,"He said, ""I told them, and now all these cats"
00:28:28,00:28:29,"""are gonna be pregnant."
00:28:29,00:28:32,"""No one, no owner wants their cats to be pregnant."""
00:28:32,00:28:34,"And his quotes, my favorite quote,"
00:28:34,00:28:37,"""My fucking cat is exhausted, and on a glucose drip,"
00:28:37,00:28:38,"""and this is my fault."""
00:28:38,00:28:40,(laughing)
00:28:40,00:28:43,(upbeat music)
00:28:43,00:28:46,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,and that is Chazinski.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"- My fact this week is that in the 1490s,"
00:28:51,00:28:54,"the Italians called syphilis the French disease,"
00:28:54,00:28:57,"the French called it the Italian disease,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"the Russians called it the Polish disease,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,"the Polish called it the Turkish disease,"
00:29:02,00:29:04,"the Turkish called it the Christian disease,"
00:29:04,00:29:07,and the Tahitians called it the British disease.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"Actually, they all should have been calling it"
00:29:10,00:29:12,the American disease.
00:29:12,00:29:14,(laughing)
00:29:14,00:29:15,"It's just scientific fact, guys."
00:29:15,00:29:17,(laughing)
00:29:17,00:29:18,"- I want to make clear at the start of this fact,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,I really don't think a nation should be blamed
00:29:20,00:29:22,for being the origin of an illness.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"I make that clear from the start,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"but syphilis started here, and..."
00:29:25,00:29:27,(laughing)
00:29:27,00:29:32,"Well, this was a huge deal, so it was 1495,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"this syphilis outbreak suddenly happened in Europe,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,"and they didn't know where this awful illness had come from,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"and there have been a lot of talks,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"it was just when Columbus had just popped over to America,"
00:29:41,00:29:44,and picked up some stuff and come back.
00:29:44,00:29:48,And so there's been speculation that maybe one of the things
00:29:48,00:29:50,"that he brought back with him was syphilis,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"but they've recently done a study in 2011,"
00:29:52,00:29:53,"they actually did a study,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,and they looked at all the bones of people
00:29:56,00:29:59,"who maybe died of syphilis from the pre-Columbus era,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"and they found that none of them actually had,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,"they're all sort of masquerading in syphilis,"
00:30:03,00:30:03,but with something else.
00:30:03,00:30:06,And syphilis did not arrive in Europe
00:30:06,00:30:08,"until that expedition to the Americas,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,but it devastated Europe.
00:30:10,00:30:13,"This is one of the reasons why everyone was blaming their neighbours,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,'cause it was ruinous and disgusting.
00:30:16,00:30:20,There was a thing about the people who were living in Europe
00:30:20,00:30:23,"and were thought to have had syphilis pre-Columbus,"
00:30:23,00:30:27,"so there were 16 bodies that were found,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"and I think there might have been monks in England,"
00:30:29,00:30:32,"in Lindisfan, somewhere,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"but they all have had it, and they were older,"
00:30:34,00:30:39,so this was very good evidence for syphilis not being a Columban thing.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"However, this is the amazing thing."
00:30:41,00:30:42,They lived in coastal regions
00:30:42,00:30:45,"where a load of their diet was seafood, okay?"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"And if you eat a load of seafood,"
00:30:47,00:30:52,"a lot of the water in the deep ocean contains old carbon,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,"it's carbon, which is a lot older"
00:30:54,00:30:56,than the carbon we get from our food today.
00:30:56,00:30:58,"So, this thing called the marine reservoir effect"
00:30:58,00:31:00,"means that if you eat a lot of seafood,"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"that will have had deep old carbon in it,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,and the carbon in that is older.
00:31:04,00:31:08,"So, your skeleton will look hundreds of years older"
00:31:08,00:31:10,to experts in the future.
00:31:10,00:31:11,"So, these people died of syphilis,"
00:31:11,00:31:14,but they were older than we thought.
00:31:14,00:31:15,"No, younger than we thought."
00:31:15,00:31:17,These people were a lot younger than we thought.
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Oh, really?"
00:31:18,00:31:21,"We thought they were from 800-80, for example,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,but actually they were from way later than that.
00:31:23,00:31:24,Isn't that bizarre?
00:31:24,00:31:26,"Yeah, you can make yourself seem older by eating seafood."
00:31:26,00:31:27,Yeah.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"Oh, it's a good anti-aging tip, actually,"
00:31:29,00:31:30,for the afterlife.
00:31:30,00:31:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:31,00:31:33,Boyed fish.
00:31:33,00:31:36,It wasn't just syphilis that we got from the Americas.
00:31:36,00:31:42,"We also got shaggers disease, which sounds like a synonym"
00:31:42,00:31:45,"for syphilis, actually, but it isn't."
00:31:45,00:31:48,"And there were about 8,000 people a year die of that."
00:31:48,00:31:49,"Sorry, what do we know where that is?"
00:31:49,00:31:52,"Yeah, it's like a parasitic infection that you get."
00:31:52,00:31:54,People always at the door and had it.
00:31:54,00:31:56,I think they've decided that he didn't know.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"Their pinter is another one, which is non-fatal."
00:31:58,00:32:01,"And as far as I can see, they're the three main things"
00:32:01,00:32:02,that we got from the Americas.
00:32:02,00:32:07,"In return, Americans got bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera,"
00:32:07,00:32:10,"diptheria, gonorrhea, influenza, leprosy, malaria,"
00:32:10,00:32:13,"measles, mumps, rubella, scallop fever,"
00:32:13,00:32:14,"smallpox, and tuberculosis."
00:32:14,00:32:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:18,00:32:20,So it doesn't feel like we should be blaming them that much.
00:32:20,00:32:22,"Oh, no."
00:32:22,00:32:25,"I like whoever it was who was cheering that list, though."
00:32:25,00:32:27,From level of pride.
00:32:27,00:32:30,I've got them all.
00:32:30,00:32:31,I've got to catch them all.
00:32:31,00:32:34,There we go.
00:32:34,00:32:35,Do you think that was the Pokemon Go?
00:32:35,00:32:38,Was there a foreseeable hunt?
00:32:38,00:32:41,Pokemon Go immediately to a doctor.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"Do you know what, in the 15th, 16th centuries--"
00:32:44,00:32:49,"16th onwards-- it was very contagious, obviously,"
00:32:49,00:32:50,and transmitted sexually.
00:32:50,00:32:53,So it was seen as a big social problem.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"Hence, everyone's blaming everyone else."
00:32:54,00:32:58,"So if you were in a country that was not your own,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,you might be deported if you got the disease.
00:33:00,00:33:03,"And if you were wealthy, you might be put under house arrest."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"But for people who were not wealthy,"
00:33:05,00:33:06,it was still an enormous problem.
00:33:06,00:33:08,And you could go to a hospital.
00:33:08,00:33:10,They actually constructed some hospitals
00:33:10,00:33:12,to help people with this disease.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"But the catch was, you would be publicly whipped"
00:33:15,00:33:17,before you went into hospital.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"And then again, after you came out--"
00:33:19,00:33:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:21,00:33:22,Wow.
00:33:22,00:33:23,Yeah.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"It's a good disincentive, though, if you're"
00:33:25,00:33:28,"trying to keep the health budget down, I think."
00:33:28,00:33:30,Telling people you'll beat them before and after they
00:33:30,00:33:32,"go into hospital, would stop some people from going, wouldn't it?"
00:33:32,00:33:33,"I guess, yeah."
00:33:33,00:33:35,I'm not advising it as a policy.
00:33:35,00:33:39,"I'm just thinking, elections coming up in both of our countries."
00:33:39,00:33:41,"It is definitely a thing, though, of blaming foreigners"
00:33:41,00:33:43,as net for illnesses.
00:33:43,00:33:48,"So for instance, US Senate candidate from New Hampshire,"
00:33:48,00:33:51,"Scott Brown, said that undocumented immigrants"
00:33:51,00:33:54,were bringing Ebola into the US.
00:33:54,00:33:56,Tontellis said that they should shut down
00:33:56,00:34:00,the southern border completely to keep Ebola at bay.
00:34:00,00:34:03,Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said that Ebola infected
00:34:03,00:34:06,terrorists might launch a biological terror attack
00:34:06,00:34:07,from Mexico.
00:34:07,00:34:09,"Basically, they thought that people with Ebola"
00:34:09,00:34:13,were going to come up from Mexico and spread it in the US.
00:34:13,00:34:16,"Now, Mexico has had no confirmed cases of Ebola"
00:34:16,00:34:18,in its entire history.
00:34:18,00:34:20,"And in fact, the closest country to Mexico"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"with any confirmed Ebola cases is, of course,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,the United States of America.
00:34:24,00:34:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:27,00:34:32,There's a bizarre disease called jumping Frenchman syndrome.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"Just a sense, in fact, is about sort of us blaming illnesses"
00:34:35,00:34:37,on the Gallic peoples.
00:34:37,00:34:39,So jumping Frenchman syndrome was only
00:34:39,00:34:42,"recorded in one place, one time."
00:34:42,00:34:46,And it was among the jumping Frenchmen of Maine in 1878.
00:34:46,00:34:48,And there were 50 cases of it.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"And basically, it was these people"
00:34:50,00:34:53,who reacted really abnormally to sudden stimuli.
00:34:53,00:34:54,"So if you sort of shouted at them,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,they just jumped really high in the air.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"They either jumped really high, or they shouted,"
00:34:58,00:34:59,or they hit someone.
00:34:59,00:35:01,And they also had this thing where they instinctively
00:35:01,00:35:03,obeyed any instructions that you gave them.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"If you gave them immediate instructions,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,they did it straight away without thinking about it.
00:35:07,00:35:11,"So if you said, push your life off a cliff, they'd just do it."
00:35:11,00:35:13,And no one knows what it is.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"They were all French, Canadian, or sort of on the border"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"of Canada, lumberjacks in this remote region."
00:35:19,00:35:20,And they think it might be just one of these remote illnesses
00:35:20,00:35:21,confined to a very--
00:35:21,00:35:24,"like a genetic thing, I guess, if you live on a place."
00:35:24,00:35:28,How long would the belief in the command last for?
00:35:28,00:35:30,"Because if you were a lumberjack and they said,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,"push your life off a cliff, you'd have to grab her"
00:35:32,00:35:36,and run quite a long way to find your cliff.
00:35:36,00:35:40,"But you could say, punch that guy to two of the lumberjacks,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,and they would punch each other immediately.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Wow.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"Yeah, it was dangerous."
00:35:44,00:35:46,"You shouldn't say that around them, in fact."
00:35:46,00:35:50,"Anyone from Northern Maine just don't risk it, in this case."
00:35:50,00:35:54,"So I found a disease, which one of us has I've discovered."
00:35:54,00:35:55,And we won't be--
00:35:55,00:35:57,This is like the best reality show ever.
00:35:57,00:36:01,"Andy, you've got syphilis."
00:36:01,00:36:02,"Well, if I have, James has."
00:36:02,00:36:15,Huge gossip there to be discussed in the dressing room.
00:36:15,00:36:16,Does the one of us know that we have it?
00:36:16,00:36:17,No.
00:36:17,00:36:18,"No, really."
00:36:18,00:36:22,"Yeah, and I'm not sure, actually, if we do have it, but--"
00:36:22,00:36:23,Wow.
00:36:23,00:36:24,--but I've got evidence that we might.
00:36:24,00:36:28,So there's a thing called coprographia.
00:36:28,00:36:30,There's a few other variations on that word.
00:36:30,00:36:31,"Oh, I know what you're going with that."
00:36:31,00:36:35,"Yeah, so the idea is that you find yourself involuntarily"
00:36:35,00:36:37,if you're just sitting down and let's say you have a pen and paper
00:36:37,00:36:42,or you're near a window drawing a cock and balls on the thing.
00:36:42,00:36:44,You just find yourself just doing it.
00:36:44,00:36:46,You didn't know you were doing it.
00:36:46,00:36:47,"Now, the reason I think that one of us has it"
00:36:47,00:36:50,is because when we were recording the audiobook
00:36:50,00:36:53,"of the book of the year 2019, instead of reading from the book,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,they gave us iPads to read it from.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"And halfway through, Anna discovered,"
00:36:58,00:37:01,there's a little button that means you can draw on the iPads.
00:37:01,00:37:04,And there was a bit in the book where she just
00:37:04,00:37:06,didn't say anything for a tiny bit.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"And we stopped, and she went, sorry, guys,"
00:37:07,00:37:08,I don't know what happened.
00:37:08,00:37:09,I was really distracted.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"Turned her iPads to us, and there was a massive cock and balls"
00:37:12,00:37:13,sitting--
00:37:13,00:37:14,There wasn't one massive one.
00:37:14,00:37:17,There were loads of small ones to be fair.
00:37:17,00:37:19,"That's a big difference, actually, that, dad."
00:37:19,00:37:21,OK.
00:37:21,00:37:23,It was like the shrimp conger.
00:37:23,00:37:24,It's one big one made up of lots of little.
00:37:24,00:37:25,"Oh, OK."
00:37:25,00:37:27,That's the thing.
00:37:27,00:37:30,I was looking into-- so this fact is about how a disease
00:37:30,00:37:32,"got its name, and everyone said it was a fraction--"
00:37:32,00:37:33,or gave it a different name.
00:37:33,00:37:35,So I was just-- I was curious about names of diseases
00:37:35,00:37:36,and how they get them.
00:37:36,00:37:41,"And actually, quite recently, a Colorado-based scientist"
00:37:41,00:37:44,did a thing where she wanted to see if an AI machine
00:37:44,00:37:48,"could generate serious, sounding disease names."
00:37:48,00:37:53,"And she fed in 3,765 conditions, all the descriptions"
00:37:53,00:37:56,of them into this machine to see what they came up with.
00:37:56,00:37:59,And some great names came out of it.
00:37:59,00:38:02,"So according to AI, people out there"
00:38:02,00:38:04,are suffering from penis arthritis.
00:38:04,00:38:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:07,00:38:12,"Makes me feel a bit stiff in the morning though, aren't they?"
00:38:12,00:38:13,They were all amazing.
00:38:13,00:38:17,Insect skulls was one cancer of the cancer.
00:38:17,00:38:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:20,00:38:21,And RIP syndrome.
00:38:21,00:38:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:24,00:38:26,That's amazing.
00:38:26,00:38:28,"We need to wrap up, guys."
00:38:28,00:38:29,"OK, that is it."
00:38:29,00:38:30,That is all of our facts.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Thank you so much for listening.
