00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,600
 (cheers and applause)

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,320
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,260
 this week coming to you live from New York City!

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,260
 (cheers and applause)

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,280
 - My name is Dan Schreiber.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,160
 I am sitting here with Anichezinski,

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,200
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,660
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,880
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,360
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week,

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,360
 my fact is Carl Sagan spent two years suing Apple computers

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
 for calling him a butt head.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
 (audience laughs)

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,080
 - That's gonna be hard 'cause you have to prove

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
 that you're not a butt head drinker.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,920
 - Yeah, absolutely.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,040
 So for listeners who don't know who Carl Sagan is,

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,120
 he is of course the great scientist.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,040
 He did the TV show, "Cosmos," the golden disc

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,680
 on the Voyager, he was the person who dreamt that up.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,920
 He's one of the greatest public science speakers

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,240
 of all time, if not the best.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,040
 - Is he a New Yorker, who's he?

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
 - He's born in Brooklyn, yeah.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,960
 (audience cheers)

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
 Born in the same little village

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,240
 that the three stoogers were born in.

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,920
 So this was in 1993.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,720
 So basically what happened is that Apple computers

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,200
 were releasing the Power Macintosh 7100,

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
 and when they were putting it together,

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,080
 and they had to talk to the media and stuff,

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,640
 they had a code name that they used, which was Carl Sagan.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,160
 And the joke in the team was that the idea was

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,680
 they wanted to sell billions and billions

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,480
 of the new computer.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,240
 So Sagan found out about this, and he said,

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,080
 he wrote them a letter saying,

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,600
 "You absolutely can't do this.

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,320
 "You're using my name to profit with your company,

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
 "and I don't want you to do that.

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
 "Can you please stop?"

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
 So they did stop, but what they did instead

47
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,000
 was rename the code name BHA,

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,640
 which stood for Butthead Astronomer.

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 (audience laughs)

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 And he thought that's defamation of characters.

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,200
 So he sued them, and unfortunately he lost,

52
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,080
 and so they carried on with it.

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,760
 So then he then tried to sue them

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,200
 for calling it Carl Sagan to begin with at all,

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
 and he lost that as well.

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,520
 But then he then tried to sue them once again,

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,600
 and they settled outside of court.

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,720
 So we don't know what happened there,

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
 but the final code name that was given in place of BHA

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,360
 was L.A.W. Law, which stood for Lawyers or Wimps.

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
 (audience laughs)

62
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
 - Wow.

63
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,960
 - So there were no hard feelings at the end of it, clearly.

64
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
 - Yeah.

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,480
 - It must have hurt though, because billions and billions,

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,200
 billions and billions is the phrase

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,600
 that he's really famous for, and that's, as you say,

68
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,240
 why they named it that, and he never bloody said it,

69
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,840
 and there's always used to really annoy him.

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,000
 For someone who was interested in the huge cosmic questions,

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 he had quite a petty side, it seems.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So he once was presenting on his documentaries,

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,560
 and he said there are billions of stars out there.

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,840
 And I think Johnny Carson on the tonight show

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
 did an impersonation of him where he said billions

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
 and billions, and that became his catchphrase,

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
 and it really pissed him off.

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,320
 And he used to be asked to say billions and billions.

79
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,840
 It's not even a good catchphrase.

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,760
 And he'd refuse to say it, and he'd refuse to write it,

81
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
 and eventually he caved and started saying it,

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,880
 and writing it all over the shop.

83
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,320
 Well, that's the thing, I first read about billions and billions,

84
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,800
 the fact that it wasn't his, in one of his later books,

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,000
 a collection of essays, which was called "Billions and Billions."

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,720
 Oh, there we go, yeah.

87
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,520
 But he did that unit that he said

88
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
 that has become a kind of joke unit in astronomical terms.

89
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,800
 A "sagan" means, it means four billion.

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
 Oh, really?

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,480
 It's billions plus billions.

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,000
 Wow, what is approximately four billion?

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,720
 It's any number greater than four billion.

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,560
 Yeah, it's a "sagan", so it's very useless term for--

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,680
 Yeah, exactly, how often are we using the "sagan" in life?

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,920
 Never, never, never.

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,680
 The story of the Voyager Gold Disc was also very, very cool,

98
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,280
 because I did not know that he was behind this,

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,840
 so the Voyager exploration and the space was nearly a cassette tape.

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
 They nearly put that up, but they realized

101
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,040
 that it would get shot to pieces by radiation and things like this.

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
 Yeah, but it's copper coated in gold,

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,600
 and that will last for a quarter of a "sagan" years.

104
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,480
 Oh, cool.

105
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,080
 Very cool.

106
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 And there are lots of stories about it.

107
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 And one of the stories that I knew that you would like,

108
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 Dan, is that the song "Here Comes the Sun" by the Beatles

109
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,120
 was going to be on it, but the Beatles weren't

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,200
 allowed to put it on there because they didn't own the copyright

111
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,080
 to a lot of their own material at the time.

112
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's the story.

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
 It turns out it's not true, and the producer of the disc--

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,800
 I didn't know how to record producer behind it, but there we go--

115
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,000
 he said, in an article that he wrote about it,

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,840
 it's not the Beatles' strongest work,

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,880
 and the witticism of the title, if charming in the short run,

118
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,040
 seemed unlikely to remain funny for a billion years.

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
 [LAUGHTER]

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 He's asking a huge amount of any joke

121
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
 to remain funny for one billion years.

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
 [LAUGHTER]

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,520
 He must have been really insulted

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,000
 to be called a butthead, as well, because he

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
 hated beaverson butthead.

126
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 Did he?

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,160
 Is he on record as having hated?

128
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
 He is.

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,800
 In one of his bloody side.

130
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,760
 In one of his books, he said, "The dumbing down of America

131
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,040
 is most evident in the slow decay

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,120
 of substantive content in the enormously influential media.

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,400
 As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America

134
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
 is a movie, "Dum and Dumber."

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,600
 Beaverson Butthead also remains popular.

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
 Wow.

137
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
 He absolutely hated beaverson butthead.

138
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
 Oh.

139
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,640
 I think he just didn't get it.

140
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,920
 Yeah.

141
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 Yeah.

142
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,200
 Do you know Beaverson Butthead are named the two people

143
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,520
 and named after real people?

144
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,280
 No.

145
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,560
 Yeah, so the guy who created it was Mike Judge,

146
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,920
 and he lived next door to a 12-year-old who called himself

147
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,640
 Iron Butt, because he claimed that he felt no pain

148
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,400
 when anyone kicks him in the backside.

149
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,000
 Right.

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,240
 And his best friend, everyone called him butthead,

151
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
 because he was such good friends with Iron Butt.

152
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,880
 And then they had a third friend who was called Bobby Beaverson.

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
 Wow.

154
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,560
 And he was really not famous for anything,

155
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
 apart from he had a really weird laugh.

156
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,000
 This is a kind of high-brow content you get from our podcast.

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,800
 If only Sagan could have heard us speaking tonight.

158
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,280
 It's amazing that he didn't like them,

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
 because he was a proper stoner, Carl Sagan.

160
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
 Yeah.

161
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
 Like, he really loved smoking.

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,160
 And it's at the point where he used to write articles

163
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,520
 to magazines that just dealt purely in marijuana,

164
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,720
 sort of saying, I wish this was legalized,

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
 and he wrote them under pseudonyms.

166
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,760
 We didn't find this out until after he died.

167
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,240
 But he was an advocate while he was still alive.

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,600
 Can I just tell you who the first person in history

169
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,040
 who was called the Butthead was?

170
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
 Yeah.

171
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,440
 That was, in 1896, it was describing a guy

172
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,600
 called Thomas Gage, who was the British commander-in-chief

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
 during the Battle of Bunker Hill.

174
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,040
 Wow.

175
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
 Yeah.

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,600
 And that was when the British kind of won the battle,

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
 but it was a massively peric victory,

178
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,960
 because they lost, like, 1,000 men in the battle.

179
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,280
 And someone wrote about him saying he was an absolute Butthead.

180
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,320
 Oh.

181
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 That seems actually a bit too weakening, though,

182
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,520
 for someone who's murdered thousands of men.

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,560
 I know someone else who was called--

184
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
 what was it, Iron Butt?

185
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,520
 Iron Butt.

186
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,600
 So Iron Ass was also the nickname of Richard Nixon.

187
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
 What was it?

188
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,800
 Yeah.

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
 The people used to kick him in the butt and he couldn't feel it.

190
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,280
 No, well, he got it for a slightly different reason.

191
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,720
 When it was a student, he was known for his cast, Iron Ass.

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
 If you've got an Iron Ass, it just means you're very dedicated

193
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,960
 and you keep on sitting down until you've finished sitting.

194
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,840
 I don't know, until the work is done.

195
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
 I'm going to sit here with my Iron Ass.

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,200
 Oh, right.

197
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,640
 But it's also, if you're being stubborn deliberately.

198
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,600
 Because Iron Man, not the cartoon character,

199
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,280
 the actual thing that you do to become an Iron Man

200
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,440
 is the triathlon, all that sort of stuff.

201
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
 Oh, yeah.

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,760
 There's no bit where you just have to sit on a chair for hours.

203
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,720
 Oh, we've come to the Iron Ass segment of the Iron Man competition.

204
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,120
 Do you know Bussock used to mean a common strumpet?

205
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
 A common what?

206
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,040
 No, I didn't know that.

207
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,560
 A strumpet.

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,280
 What's a strumpet?

209
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,120
 It's like a crumpet.

210
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,520
 It's a sort of delicacy.

211
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,240
 It's nice.

212
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,200
 You should order one next time you'll have a café.

213
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,160
 You know a strumpet.

214
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,240
 It's like a bit somewhere between a prostitute

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
 and a quite flirtatious woman.

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,480
 What?

217
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
 There's a nimb between.

218
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,880
 It's a promiscuous lady from days of your largely.

219
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,080
 I thought it was still in common parlance, but apparently not.

220
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,880
 Has everyone else heard that?

221
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
 Wow, OK.

222
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
 Usually if you're at a dinner and you say it's anyone else heard that,

223
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,040
 one other person's like, yeah, 900 people is embarrassing.

224
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,240
 There's a good German insult, which is if you call someone an ash-geiger,

225
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,480
 that means a butt-viral in.

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,520
 Which is cool.

227
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,400
 And there's another one.

228
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,280
 They've got quite a few of these.

229
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,560
 And another one is an ash-mit-urren, which is, if you're an idiot,

230
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,600
 they call you an ash-mit-urren, which means you're just an ash-with-ears.

231
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 This is strong insult.

232
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,640
 We're going to have to move on soon to our next fan.

233
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,040
 I've just got one more defamation/buttuck fact.

234
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
 Ah, yeah.

235
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,080
 Well, I've got a few more, but I'm going to say one.

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,960
 This is, do you guys know the company, The North Face,

237
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
 that makes clothing?

238
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 Yeah.

239
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,480
 Well, there was a guy called Jimmy Winkelman Sr.,

240
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,600
 who decided that he was going to make his own company

241
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,760
 called The South Butt.

242
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,600
 Very funny.

243
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
 And they obviously said, you can't do this,

244
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,680
 because the logo was pretty similar to The North Face.

245
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,600
 They said, you can't do that.

246
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,800
 And he said, no, no, it's a parody.

247
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
 It's a parody.

248
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,080
 And in the end, they went to court, and they sued him.

249
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,000
 And he was forced to cease all promotion and sales

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,360
 of South Butt products and abandon his trademark immediately.

251
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,600
 And they also forced him to get rid of his other trademark, The Butt Face.

252
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,960
 Just there's one other weird defamation case, which has been in the news recently.

253
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,120
 And so you know, Rebel Wilson.

254
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
 Have you heard?

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
 OK, yeah.

256
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,360
 Now I'm talking your language.

257
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 She just won the biggest payout in Australian history

258
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,480
 for a defamation suit.

259
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
 It was $4.6 million Australian dollars.

260
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
 And it was because she was accusing a media group of defamation

261
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,760
 for saying that she'd been well brought up.

262
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,800
 So really?

263
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
 She goes around saying that I'm such a bogeon.

264
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
 You know, and she talks about how she's such a bogeon.

265
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
 She really embraces it.

266
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 And a bogeon is like a male trumpet, I guess.

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,960
 [LAUGHTER]

268
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,840
 And it's not.

269
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
 I'm an Aussie, it's not.

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,960
 You guys here, do you know what a bogeon is?

271
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,080
 It's like a-- it's so hard to explain what it is without being derogatory.

272
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,680
 It's an Australian term for someone who's a bit rough and ready.

273
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,520
 So she's always really embraced this.

274
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
 She's gone from a real working class background,

275
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,360
 real bogeon upbringing, and a media group called her Upper Middle Class.

276
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,120
 And she's managed to successfully sue them.

277
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,160
 She had to go to court with her family and prove that she was a bogeon.

278
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,720
 Wow, no way.

279
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
 Wow.

280
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,360
 Unbelievable.

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,880
 Amazing.

282
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,120
 They had to do things like talk about what the kids were called,

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,360
 what her siblings were called.

284
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,560
 So their names are rebel, liberty, and anarchy.

285
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,800
 And his anarchy-- anarchy.

286
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,760
 Anarchy spelled A-double-n-a-c-h-i.

287
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,800
 I don't think understandably the judge decided

288
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
 this was irrefutable evidence that she was, in fact, a bogeon.

289
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,120
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,840
 And that is Andy.

291
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,480
 My fact is that, in 1995, astronaut Bill Gregory ate 48 meals in a row,

292
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
 which included shrimp cocktail.

293
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,960
 Was he in space at the time?

294
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
 He was.

295
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,840
 He's in space.

296
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
 So--

297
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,280
 In 1995, while in space.

298
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,520
 [LAUGHTER]

299
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,440
 So astronauts love shrimp cocktail.

300
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,960
 Yeah.

301
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,840
 They can't get enough of it.

302
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,040
 It's-- and it's hard to come by up there, obviously.

303
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,000
 What do you mean, sorry, is this part of the selection process?

304
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,640
 Yeah, it's one of the-- it's the final question.

305
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,920
 You go through all of your training for a few years,

306
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,360
 and then they just give you a plate of shrimp cocktail

307
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,800
 and say, what would you do with that?

308
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
 [LAUGHTER]

309
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,960
 Yeah, they do absolutely love it, don't they?

310
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,120
 So Chris Hadfield, who was in space just a couple of years ago,

311
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,720
 he said it was his favorite food.

312
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,400
 And Edward White, who was in space in 1965,

313
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,880
 said it was his favorite food.

314
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,440
 And pretty much everyone from that guy to that guy

315
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,480
 was just love this stuff.

316
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,280
 Really?

317
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,640
 So I mean, Gregory was having it for breakfast.

318
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,920
 He was having it with his breakfast.

319
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,200
 He'd have fruit yoghurt, some oatmeal,

320
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,040
 and then a shrimp cocktail for his breakfast.

321
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,240
 And Jim Riley, when he was on the end of it,

322
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,960
 he would take his Russian colleagues on mere bags

323
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,240
 of shrimp cocktail as a friendly offering between neighbors.

324
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
 Although I think he might have done that

325
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800
 because the Americans aren't allowed alcohol on board,

326
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,320
 whereas the Russians are.

327
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,640
 And so often, they'll get some medicinal alcohol return

328
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400
 from the Russians.

329
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 Yeah.

330
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
 There was one astral called Story Musgrave,

331
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,560
 which is a brilliant name.

332
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
 He was on the space shuttle.

333
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
 And he sometimes with threatened other astronauts

334
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
 when they were making their menu choices.

335
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,680
 He'd say, you better put shrimp cocktail on your menu

336
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,760
 or you'll be sorry.

337
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,280
 Wow.

338
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,360
 Because he thought that if they didn't put it on their menu,

339
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
 they'd try and steal his because they

340
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,120
 would realize how delicious it was.

341
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,720
 It's because it stays spicy in space, basically.

342
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,600
 And it provides a lot more flavor than other food.

343
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,560
 Oh, and that's a thing, isn't it?

344
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,960
 Spice is a thing because the spice they're often

345
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,880
 clogged up in their nostrils and the spice rises and clears them.

346
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,120
 I didn't know the prawn cocktail, I'm going to call it,

347
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,280
 because I'm British.

348
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,880
 I didn't know that it was spicy.

349
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,440
 No, but they add spicy stuff in there.

350
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
 So they could just bring it up clumps of Tabasco.

351
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
 If it's-- they like it because--

352
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,400
 There is Tabasco in it, definitely.

353
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
 Yeah, yeah.

354
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
 Tomatoy.

355
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,400
 Tomatoy Tabasco-y.

356
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
 Trimpy goodness.

357
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,960
 The University of Suffolk have just

358
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,560
 done a study where they pulled a load of shrimp out of Britain's

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,000
 waterways and found that every single shrimp they looked at

360
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
 contained cocaine.

361
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
 Wow.

362
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
 Really?

363
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,520
 Wow.

364
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,160
 Every single.

365
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,640
 How would you have a good time as a shrimp?

366
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
 How are you doing up there, Bill?

367
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,600
 Yeah, I'm doing really well.

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,200
 The earth's really big.

369
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,240
 I was ready massive.

370
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,200
 Not as important as me, though.

371
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,480
 I feel like I'm in top of the whole situation up here.

372
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
 Desperately shoving shrimp up their nose.

373
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,640
 That's incredible.

374
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,280
 Do we-- why do they all have so much--

375
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,080
 It has been flushed into the rivers from human sewage

376
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 because too many humans are taking illegal drugs.

377
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,400
 And we're on to you.

378
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,840
 Catamin as well.

379
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,800
 A lot of catamin.

380
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,160
 It's a horse tranquilizer.

381
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,000
 Yeah, is it a downer?

382
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,480
 Yeah, it's a bit of a downer when you're giving it a shrimp.

383
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,080
 You must have to take much less as a shrimp than you do

384
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,880
 as a horse.

385
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
 I mean, sorry.

386
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,000
 Just to clarify, a horse don't take it for fun.

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
 They don't.

388
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,960
 I don't think the shrimp are doing that either, too bad.

389
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,480
 That's right.

390
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,120
 Someone emailed me, actually, this week saying

391
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,960
 that New York's drinking water is full of crustaceans.

392
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
 Is this the thing that you guys are all familiar with?

393
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,640
 Isn't it?

394
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,720
 There seems to be a theme online, which

395
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,800
 is that New York has the best drinking water in the world.

396
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
 But it's also riddled with--

397
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,920
 yeah, someone agrees, kid.

398
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,560
 Riddled with tiny crustaceans.

399
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
 And I read that once, so that is a problem

400
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,200
 because it's technically not kosher, is that right?

401
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 Oh.

402
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
 I think so, yeah.

403
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,920
 Which I think, if you're a really orthodox Jew,

404
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,160
 you have to get filtered water, I think.

405
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 Oh, I felt like--

406
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,440
 A few people in this audience feeling so horrified.

407
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,640
 I have another New York shrimp fact, surprising.

408
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,320
 So there are some-- it's tangential.

409
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,240
 But there are some shrimp species, which are social,

410
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,080
 and they form little kingdoms.

411
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,320
 So there's a king and a queen shrimp in these shrimp societies.

412
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,720
 And these are really small shrimp.

413
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,960
 They're about the size of a grain of rice.

414
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,600
 There are many.

415
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,760
 But they live inside sea sponges.

416
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,680
 And if an intruder comes in and meets a single shrimp--

417
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,920
 shrimp is face-to-face with a big predator,

418
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,280
 the shrimp will snap its claws rhythmically to summon its friends.

419
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,880
 But like, is it West Side Story?

420
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
 Like, West Side Story.

421
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,240
 Wow.

422
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,120
 Jesus, it's the jets, the sharks, and the shrimp.

423
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,560
 They have got the cocaine trade stitched up, the shrimps.

424
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,120
 They're good clickers, actually.

425
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
 Prawns aren't they?

426
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,120
 So they do a strong line in making clicking noises

427
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,280
 with their claws.

428
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,040
 And there's the pistol shrimp, which does this.

429
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,560
 So it looks bizarre.

430
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,040
 It's got one incredibly fat swollen claw,

431
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,200
 and one really slender one.

432
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,400
 It looks kind of like Nadal.

433
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,360
 Do you remember when he had one huge left arm?

434
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,680
 Right.

435
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
 The Nadal of the shrimp world.

436
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,200
 And basically, it uses its giant claw

437
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,040
 to fire bubbles at its foes.

438
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,080
 It's like a machine gun fire, so it projects bubbles

439
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,880
 through the water.

440
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,720
 And they go so fast, and they reach unbelievable temperatures.

441
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,040
 So when their bubbles burst and smash into the face of a predator,

442
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,480
 then they reach 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

443
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,200
 They are hotter than the surface of the sun, which is mad.

444
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,680
 And they also have this bizarre thing with their pinters,

445
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,880
 where if they are attacked on the pincer,

446
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,560
 then they can shed it.

447
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
 So their pincer will drop off.

448
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,360
 So let's say they're attacked in their big pincer.

449
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,560
 It drops off, and that's OK, because it grows back.

450
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,360
 But if they lose the big fat pincer,

451
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,520
 it grows back as a thin one.

452
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,640
 And then the other one that used to be thin

453
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
 compensates and becomes big and fat.

454
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,920
 And occasionally, you get shrimps who have screwed this up somehow.

455
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,800
 And they've got two huge fat pincers.

456
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
 And that seems really cool, but it's really sad,

457
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,160
 because they're essentially like a knife and fork.

458
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,320
 So they have respective purposes.

459
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,840
 So the slender pincer is needed for sort of picking

460
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,920
 the meat out of their prey once they've killed it.

461
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,440
 So if they only have the big fat ones,

462
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,160
 they're just killing their prey left, right, and center.

463
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
 And then they can't actually--

464
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
 So it's like Nadal, if he could only play really hard shots,

465
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,840
 he could do any drop shots.

466
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,840
 Exactly.

467
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,080
 Brett's starting that analogy.

468
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,640
 I was looking at general crustaceans as well as this.

469
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
 There are some ancient crustaceans,

470
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,920
 which spent so much energy growing their genitals

471
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,160
 that they went extinct.

472
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,920
 Isn't--

473
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,440
 No, what?

474
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
 These are things called ostracods.

475
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,440
 They're small-- the chalk-shelled crustaceans, they're tiny.

476
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,680
 And they're very ancient as well.

477
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,440
 They go back hundreds of millions of years.

478
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,480
 And in fossils, you can tell the difference

479
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,320
 between male and female ones, because the males have more genitals,

480
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,280
 and they are a slightly larger shape

481
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,280
 to accommodate those said genitals.

482
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,720
 In fact, they're mostly--

483
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,680
 a third of the internal volume of the male is genitals.

484
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
 You've said genitals a lot in this sense of--

485
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,200
 I have a bit.

486
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,520
 Yeah.

487
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,120
 We'll get ready, James, because they're more to come.

488
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,720
 I wish that's the first time I heard that.

489
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:52,240
 It's all flooding back.

490
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,680
 I wish this wasn't the show that our respected partners were at.

491
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,640
 So the male ostracods with the bigger genitals

492
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,760
 of the species studied were likely to go extinct,

493
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,440
 because they had put so many resources of their life

494
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,800
 into growing their genitals that they couldn't really

495
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,760
 respond to change.

496
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,600
 It's like spending an enormous amount of money

497
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,920
 building a giant penis statue on your house.

498
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,600
 If you then have a run of bad luck, you'll go bankrupt,

499
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,520
 because you haven't got the necessary cash packing.

500
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,240
 This is not as good as the Nadal one, I know.

501
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,440
 I know, I know.

502
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
 What it's like is, if you play tennis and you grow your arm

503
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,640
 really, really big, you're right arm, you get really good.

504
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,480
 But then the rules change, and everyone has to play left-handed.

505
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
 It's like that, isn't it?

506
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
 That is better than...

507
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,800
 I've spent so much money on that statue.

508
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,440
 So just on then, they also had a huge sperm.

509
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,000
 This is the incredible thing about them.

510
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,080
 Their sperm were...

511
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,840
 I think their sperm were 10 times bigger than their bodies.

512
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,520
 - What? - Yeah.

513
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
 They had to sort of...

514
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,840
 Yeah, so once they developed a sperm,

515
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,960
 they'd only have one, I think.

516
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,280
 How does that work, though?

517
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,160
 - They're folded. - Oh, they're folded.

518
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,720
 It's not like coming out of his mouth, and I'm...

519
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
 Well, it does when it's delivered,

520
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,440
 so it's all coiled up like a hose pipe,

521
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,600
 but when it's delivered, I suppose,

522
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,760
 you'd be able to just go on and on,

523
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,000
 like one of those handkerchiefs coming out of a magician's pocket.

524
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,320
 Wow.

525
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,720
 What?

526
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,360
 How obsessive.

527
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,920
 How fun it sex be if that's what happened every time.

528
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,960
 How fun would children's parties be if that happened every time?

529
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,440
 So, there was one shrimp-like animal

530
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,480
 from the Cambrian period called Sino-Falos Xynos,

531
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,840
 and they had a groove on their face

532
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,640
 that could lock onto the tail of another one of their kind.

533
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,120
 And so, what they would do is they would keep locking themselves

534
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,520
 on like a load of Legos

535
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,600
 and just became a massive version of that animal.

536
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
 The human centipede.

537
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
 The...

538
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,760
 The shrimp conger, I think, is what you mean.

539
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,360
 That is a much nicer movie, isn't it?

540
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
 (laughing)

541
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,200
 I imagine, Dan, you in a human centipede,

542
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,720
 like, "Let's do a conger."

543
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,800
 (laughing)

544
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
 You always like to see the good in every situation, don't you?

545
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,680
 (laughing)

546
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,040
 Worst birthday party ever.

547
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
 (laughing)

548
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,440
 That's now the magician.

549
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,360
 (laughing)

550
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,040
 Okay, we're gonna have to move on to our next fact.

551
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,280
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

552
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,120
 Okay, my fact this week is that the loudest male birds

553
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,120
 on earth use their voices to yell at females

554
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,080
 who are sat right next to them.

555
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
 (laughing)

556
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,160
 And I don't think we can see any kind of parallels in our species.

557
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,680
 So, this is an article in the journal Current Biology

558
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,920
 by a couple of scientists called Jeffrey Podos

559
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,840
 and Mario Cohen Haft.

560
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,040
 And they have found this bird called the white bellbird.

561
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,440
 And it can shelter an average of 106,

562
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,600
 at 116 decibels from a distance of one meter.

563
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,640
 And the reason that they're really good at shouting

564
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,720
 is they have a really, really simple song.

565
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,400
 So, there's no trills, nothing like that, no flourishes.

566
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,600
 It's just one, it's like a fog horn.

567
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,880
 (laughing)

568
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
 And also, when they've cut them up,

569
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,920
 they've realized that they have,

570
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,600
 well, according to this article, it says,

571
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,400
 "Unlike most birds, the species has great habs."

572
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,680
 Whoa.

573
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,760
 And so, what he can do is just go to a female

574
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,400
 and just go right next to her and go,

575
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,040
 "I've got great habs!"

576
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,520
 (laughing)

577
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
 And she will find that very attractive.

578
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,840
 - Well, I think, 'cause this is how they,

579
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,280
 this is the ones that have been observed.

580
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,040
 And the scientists studying them, this guy, Dr. Podos,

581
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 he said that they start by facing away from the female,

582
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
 and they start shouting when they're looking

583
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,800
 in the other direction.

584
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,880
 And then suddenly they just swing around

585
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,240
 and start shouting, and Podos said

586
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
 that we never saw copulation.

587
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,560
 We never saw what a really good male does.

588
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,280
 The ones we saw might have just been losers.

589
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
 - Oh, really?

590
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,800
 I didn't see that there.

591
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,840
 That's to make a lot more sense, isn't it?

592
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,880
 I suppose the idea, from what they're saying is,

593
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,000
 because they don't have all these trills and whistles

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,800
 and things like that, the females can't judge

595
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,560
 how good the song is on how technically good it is.

596
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,920
 All they can judge it on is how strong it is

597
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,760
 and how loud it is.

598
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,600
 - Right, right.

599
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,440
 - Let's say it.

600
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 - Or how thoughtful and quiet it is.

601
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,360
 (laughing)

602
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,200
 And I think, isn't it the case that the reason they are able

603
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,680
 to be so loud is because they don't chew their food.

604
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,520
 So they... - That's right.

605
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,880
 Yeah, their beak's open, don't they, really wide?

606
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,760
 - Yeah, they've got massive mouths

607
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,800
 and they just eat whole fruit, swallow it down completely whole,

608
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,640
 and they're just sits there in their stomach for ages,

609
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,200
 which maybe is what that makes their absolute, so impressive.

610
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,160
 And then they just throw up the seeds when they're done.

611
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,520
 And because they've got these huge mouths

612
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,800
 and these strong digestive muscles,

613
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,440
 that's meant, had the side effect have been good at singing.

614
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,280
 - Wow. - That's very cool.

615
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,520
 They're a part of, so they're called the bellbird,

616
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
 I believe. - That's right, the white bellbird.

617
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
 - The white bellbird, so there's a few of those species

618
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,800
 dotted around, and there's one which is called

619
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,120
 the three-wattled bellbird, and they have a similar call

620
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,720
 as loud, so if you're a human listening to it,

621
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,360
 it's just under a mile away that you would hear

622
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,080
 this sound that comes out, and that's not the loudest.

623
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,280
 Your one's loudest, imagine being right next to it,

624
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,640
 but their sound, which is a three-part song that they do,

625
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,400
 for the mating call and for the, sort of, telling males

626
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
 that I'm in this territory, is called,

627
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,800
 and this is a very English word, but it's called the bonk.

628
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,480
 - Hmm. - And for a mating call,

629
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 the bonk is, so an England bonk means to have the sex.

630
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,320
 And, yeah, I mean, fancy a bonk, you strumped it,

631
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,560
 is a common phrase in our culture.

632
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,640
 - Yeah. (audience applauding)

633
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,000
 - So, there are other birds called satin bowerbirds,

634
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,760
 and they actually are a bit more sensitive to the females

635
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,160
 than these, what was it, the billbirds.

636
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,920
 So they are capable of being very loud,

637
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,080
 but they realize that if they continue very loud,

638
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,560
 once they have an initial lead with a female,

639
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,920
 then they will startle and put off the females,

640
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,320
 so they deliberately tone it down.

641
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,720
 - Yeah, they give very intense behavioral displays,

642
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,440
 as it's called, and then the females crouch

643
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,720
 and say, "I'm not having a nice date anymore,"

644
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,520
 and the males then back off.

645
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,640
 - Really? - Yeah.

646
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,040
 - Do you say they're bowerbirds?

647
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,880
 - Yes.

648
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
 - So, the one thing I know about bowerbirds

649
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,120
 is some of the species they make, like,

650
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,120
 they make nests that are like little tunnels, right?

651
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,240
 And the, at the end of the tunnel,

652
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,560
 they'll put a load of, like, blue objects, for instance.

653
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,920
 It's always kind of the same column,

654
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
 and they'll put a load of objects there,

655
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,800
 and then they'll funnel the female into this tunnel

656
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,400
 and show her the amazing objects that they collected.

657
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
 - Yeah.

658
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,600
 - But what they like to do is they like to put

659
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,480
 the bigger objects at the back,

660
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,400
 and the smaller objects at the front,

661
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,560
 and that creates a force perspective.

662
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,840
 So, when they stand in the middle of their blue objects,

663
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
 they look way bigger.

664
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
 (audience laughing)

665
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440
 - Oh, cool. - Isn't that cool?

666
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,240
 - What do they stand next to the big ones?

667
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,720
 - Yeah, or is it the other way around?

668
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,960
 I can't remember, right?

669
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,680
 - They understand perspective more than you do,

670
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
 it's what you're saying.

671
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,600
 (audience laughing)

672
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,520
 They did a study on zebra finches, I think last year, in 2018,

673
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
 and they found that they practiced singing in their sleep.

674
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,360
 So, they look at zebra finches,

675
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,520
 and they see that their vocal cords move

676
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,920
 in the exact same way that they move when they're awake,

677
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,080
 and their neurons are firing in the same way

678
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,160
 that they're firing when they're awake.

679
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,040
 So, they're literally singing the same tunes,

680
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,560
 and the only reason that you can't hear them

681
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,240
 is because they have their mouths shut,

682
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,160
 and they're not passing air over them.

683
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,120
 And so, if you were to get a sleeping zebra finch,

684
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,640
 open its mouth, and then blow into its face.

685
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,000
 - Well, you're gonna be arrested for that call.

686
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 (audience laughing)

687
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,840
 - You do not get arrested for blowing it a zebra finch.

688
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,760
 - Well, if you don't, you bloody well should do that.

689
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,160
 - Anyway, if you do that, it will play the bird song.

690
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,000
 - Wow.

691
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,840
 - Isn't that incredible?

692
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,680
 - That's incredible.

693
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,520
 - Nice and amazing.

694
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,720
 Do you know there are some birds that French kiss?

695
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,560
 - Oh, no.

696
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,680
 - White fronted parrots French kiss.

697
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
 They will open their beaks,

698
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,520
 and they'll flick their tongues back and forth.

699
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,040
 It's quite romantic, actually.

700
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,840
 The male will then regurgitate his food

701
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,920
 into the female's mouth as a form of affection.

702
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,520
 - I was just looking into mating rituals generally

703
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,160
 within the animal world,

704
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
 and I found, so this is a bit of,

705
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,720
 it's not quite directly connected,

706
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,400
 but I found the story that happened in China,

707
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,000
 a male cat that had been put into a pet sort of hotel

708
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,280
 for the evening while his owners were away,

709
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,840
 and they told them the cat's not been neutered.

710
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
 And so, you know, keep them away from other cats.

711
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,360
 And they came back in the morning,

712
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,320
 and the cats, turned out, had all been let out,

713
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
 and the staff had gone home,

714
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,040
 and they saw on CCTV that this cat ended up sleeping

715
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,600
 with five different cats over the course of the evening.

716
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,120
 They didn't know this to begin with,

717
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
 but they worked out because the cat was so exhausted

718
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,720
 that it needed to be put on a glucose drip.

719
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,040
 (laughing)

720
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,520
 - This cat was absolutely knackered,

721
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,880
 and the owner asked to see the CCTV.

722
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,320
 He said, "Between the hours of 10, 40 PM

723
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,240
 "and 5 AM, my cat mated with five female cats,

724
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,640
 "and those are the only ones I could see on the CCTV footage.

725
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,720
 "Who knows what else?"

726
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,880
 And so they blamed him.

727
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,520
 They were like, "Well, you should have neutered your cat."

728
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,400
 He said, "I told them, and now all these cats

729
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,320
 "are gonna be pregnant.

730
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,320
 "No one, no owner wants their cats to be pregnant."

731
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,160
 And his quotes, my favorite quote,

732
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,200
 "My fucking cat is exhausted, and on a glucose drip,

733
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,400
 "and this is my fault."

734
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,160
 (laughing)

735
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,400
 (upbeat music)

736
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,160
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

737
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
 and that is Chazinski.

738
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,120
 - My fact this week is that in the 1490s,

739
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,320
 the Italians called syphilis the French disease,

740
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,160
 the French called it the Italian disease,

741
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,880
 the Russians called it the Polish disease,

742
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,040
 the Polish called it the Turkish disease,

743
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,560
 the Turkish called it the Christian disease,

744
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,440
 and the Tahitians called it the British disease.

745
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,560
 Actually, they all should have been calling it

746
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,000
 the American disease.

747
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,040
 (laughing)

748
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,760
 It's just scientific fact, guys.

749
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,000
 (laughing)

750
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,480
 - I want to make clear at the start of this fact,

751
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,560
 I really don't think a nation should be blamed

752
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,200
 for being the origin of an illness.

753
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,320
 I make that clear from the start,

754
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,480
 but syphilis started here, and...

755
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,680
 (laughing)

756
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,800
 Well, this was a huge deal, so it was 1495,

757
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,440
 this syphilis outbreak suddenly happened in Europe,

758
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,880
 and they didn't know where this awful illness had come from,

759
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,080
 and there have been a lot of talks,

760
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,960
 it was just when Columbus had just popped over to America,

761
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,720
 and picked up some stuff and come back.

762
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
 And so there's been speculation that maybe one of the things

763
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,280
 that he brought back with him was syphilis,

764
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,560
 but they've recently done a study in 2011,

765
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,800
 they actually did a study,

766
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,440
 and they looked at all the bones of people

767
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,240
 who maybe died of syphilis from the pre-Columbus era,

768
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,000
 and they found that none of them actually had,

769
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 they're all sort of masquerading in syphilis,

770
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
 but with something else.

771
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,160
 And syphilis did not arrive in Europe

772
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,880
 until that expedition to the Americas,

773
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,920
 but it devastated Europe.

774
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,680
 This is one of the reasons why everyone was blaming their neighbours,

775
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,120
 'cause it was ruinous and disgusting.

776
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,680
 There was a thing about the people who were living in Europe

777
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,600
 and were thought to have had syphilis pre-Columbus,

778
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,080
 so there were 16 bodies that were found,

779
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,960
 and I think there might have been monks in England,

780
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,120
 in Lindisfan, somewhere,

781
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,880
 but they all have had it, and they were older,

782
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,600
 so this was very good evidence for syphilis not being a Columban thing.

783
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,480
 However, this is the amazing thing.

784
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,760
 They lived in coastal regions

785
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,600
 where a load of their diet was seafood, okay?

786
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,920
 And if you eat a load of seafood,

787
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,600
 a lot of the water in the deep ocean contains old carbon,

788
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
 it's carbon, which is a lot older

789
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,320
 than the carbon we get from our food today.

790
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,680
 So, this thing called the marine reservoir effect

791
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,360
 means that if you eat a lot of seafood,

792
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,560
 that will have had deep old carbon in it,

793
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,720
 and the carbon in that is older.

794
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,640
 So, your skeleton will look hundreds of years older

795
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,320
 to experts in the future.

796
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,960
 So, these people died of syphilis,

797
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,160
 but they were older than we thought.

798
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 No, younger than we thought.

799
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,560
 These people were a lot younger than we thought.

800
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
 Oh, really?

801
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,120
 We thought they were from 800-80, for example,

802
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,080
 but actually they were from way later than that.

803
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
 Isn't that bizarre?

804
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,560
 Yeah, you can make yourself seem older by eating seafood.

805
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
 Yeah.

806
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,320
 Oh, it's a good anti-aging tip, actually,

807
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,440
 for the afterlife.

808
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,800
 [LAUGHTER]

809
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
 Boyed fish.

810
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,560
 It wasn't just syphilis that we got from the Americas.

811
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,760
 We also got shaggers disease, which sounds like a synonym

812
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,040
 for syphilis, actually, but it isn't.

813
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,240
 And there were about 8,000 people a year die of that.

814
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,920
 Sorry, what do we know where that is?

815
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,840
 Yeah, it's like a parasitic infection that you get.

816
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,120
 People always at the door and had it.

817
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,400
 I think they've decided that he didn't know.

818
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,840
 Their pinter is another one, which is non-fatal.

819
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,000
 And as far as I can see, they're the three main things

820
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,960
 that we got from the Americas.

821
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,280
 In return, Americans got bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera,

822
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,640
 diptheria, gonorrhea, influenza, leprosy, malaria,

823
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,040
 measles, mumps, rubella, scallop fever,

824
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,880
 smallpox, and tuberculosis.

825
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,080
 [LAUGHTER]

826
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,760
 So it doesn't feel like we should be blaming them that much.

827
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,360
 Oh, no.

828
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,640
 I like whoever it was who was cheering that list, though.

829
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,200
 From level of pride.

830
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,440
 I've got them all.

831
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,400
 I've got to catch them all.

832
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,240
 There we go.

833
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,880
 Do you think that was the Pokemon Go?

834
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,000
 Was there a foreseeable hunt?

835
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,200
 Pokemon Go immediately to a doctor.

836
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,760
 Do you know what, in the 15th, 16th centuries--

837
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,040
 16th onwards-- it was very contagious, obviously,

838
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,000
 and transmitted sexually.

839
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
 So it was seen as a big social problem.

840
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,840
 Hence, everyone's blaming everyone else.

841
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,000
 So if you were in a country that was not your own,

842
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,680
 you might be deported if you got the disease.

843
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,480
 And if you were wealthy, you might be put under house arrest.

844
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,040
 But for people who were not wealthy,

845
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,760
 it was still an enormous problem.

846
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,400
 And you could go to a hospital.

847
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,840
 They actually constructed some hospitals

848
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,240
 to help people with this disease.

849
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,040
 But the catch was, you would be publicly whipped

850
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,400
 before you went into hospital.

851
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,440
 And then again, after you came out--

852
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,960
 [LAUGHTER]

853
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,720
 Wow.

854
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,600
 Yeah.

855
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,160
 It's a good disincentive, though, if you're

856
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,400
 trying to keep the health budget down, I think.

857
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,120
 Telling people you'll beat them before and after they

858
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,600
 go into hospital, would stop some people from going, wouldn't it?

859
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,760
 I guess, yeah.

860
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,040
 I'm not advising it as a policy.

861
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,600
 I'm just thinking, elections coming up in both of our countries.

862
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
 It is definitely a thing, though, of blaming foreigners

863
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,680
 as net for illnesses.

864
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,600
 So for instance, US Senate candidate from New Hampshire,

865
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,960
 Scott Brown, said that undocumented immigrants

866
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,880
 were bringing Ebola into the US.

867
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,960
 Tontellis said that they should shut down

868
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,200
 the southern border completely to keep Ebola at bay.

869
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,440
 Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said that Ebola infected

870
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,000
 terrorists might launch a biological terror attack

871
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,240
 from Mexico.

872
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,840
 Basically, they thought that people with Ebola

873
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,200
 were going to come up from Mexico and spread it in the US.

874
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,840
 Now, Mexico has had no confirmed cases of Ebola

875
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,680
 in its entire history.

876
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,600
 And in fact, the closest country to Mexico

877
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,800
 with any confirmed Ebola cases is, of course,

878
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,160
 the United States of America.

879
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,360
 [LAUGHTER]

880
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,120
 There's a bizarre disease called jumping Frenchman syndrome.

881
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,280
 Just a sense, in fact, is about sort of us blaming illnesses

882
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,160
 on the Gallic peoples.

883
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,440
 So jumping Frenchman syndrome was only

884
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,000
 recorded in one place, one time.

885
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,360
 And it was among the jumping Frenchmen of Maine in 1878.

886
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,400
 And there were 50 cases of it.

887
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,320
 And basically, it was these people

888
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,040
 who reacted really abnormally to sudden stimuli.

889
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,840
 So if you sort of shouted at them,

890
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,720
 they just jumped really high in the air.

891
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,320
 They either jumped really high, or they shouted,

892
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,360
 or they hit someone.

893
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,280
 And they also had this thing where they instinctively

894
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,520
 obeyed any instructions that you gave them.

895
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,320
 If you gave them immediate instructions,

896
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,000
 they did it straight away without thinking about it.

897
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,600
 So if you said, push your life off a cliff, they'd just do it.

898
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,120
 And no one knows what it is.

899
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,200
 They were all French, Canadian, or sort of on the border

900
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,000
 of Canada, lumberjacks in this remote region.

901
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,920
 And they think it might be just one of these remote illnesses

902
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
 confined to a very--

903
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,360
 like a genetic thing, I guess, if you live on a place.

904
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,120
 How long would the belief in the command last for?

905
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,200
 Because if you were a lumberjack and they said,

906
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,360
 push your life off a cliff, you'd have to grab her

907
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,520
 and run quite a long way to find your cliff.

908
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,560
 But you could say, punch that guy to two of the lumberjacks,

909
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,160
 and they would punch each other immediately.

910
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
 Wow.

911
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,080
 Yeah, it was dangerous.

912
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,600
 You shouldn't say that around them, in fact.

913
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,000
 Anyone from Northern Maine just don't risk it, in this case.

914
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,560
 So I found a disease, which one of us has I've discovered.

915
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,520
 And we won't be--

916
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,920
 This is like the best reality show ever.

917
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,200
 Andy, you've got syphilis.

918
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,600
 Well, if I have, James has.

919
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:15,240
 Huge gossip there to be discussed in the dressing room.

920
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,840
 Does the one of us know that we have it?

921
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,360
 No.

922
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,160
 No, really.

923
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,200
 Yeah, and I'm not sure, actually, if we do have it, but--

924
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,000
 Wow.

925
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,720
 --but I've got evidence that we might.

926
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,200
 So there's a thing called coprographia.

927
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,680
 There's a few other variations on that word.

928
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,800
 Oh, I know what you're going with that.

929
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,520
 Yeah, so the idea is that you find yourself involuntarily

930
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,960
 if you're just sitting down and let's say you have a pen and paper

931
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,680
 or you're near a window drawing a cock and balls on the thing.

932
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,760
 You just find yourself just doing it.

933
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,080
 You didn't know you were doing it.

934
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,720
 Now, the reason I think that one of us has it

935
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,080
 is because when we were recording the audiobook

936
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,440
 of the book of the year 2019, instead of reading from the book,

937
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,760
 they gave us iPads to read it from.

938
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,080
 And halfway through, Anna discovered,

939
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,640
 there's a little button that means you can draw on the iPads.

940
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,240
 And there was a bit in the book where she just

941
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,080
 didn't say anything for a tiny bit.

942
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,680
 And we stopped, and she went, sorry, guys,

943
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,360
 I don't know what happened.

944
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,200
 I was really distracted.

945
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,120
 Turned her iPads to us, and there was a massive cock and balls

946
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,160
 sitting--

947
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,760
 There wasn't one massive one.

948
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,680
 There were loads of small ones to be fair.

949
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,720
 That's a big difference, actually, that, dad.

950
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,120
 OK.

951
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,000
 It was like the shrimp conger.

952
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
 It's one big one made up of lots of little.

953
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,280
 Oh, OK.

954
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,240
 That's the thing.

955
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,080
 I was looking into-- so this fact is about how a disease

956
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,240
 got its name, and everyone said it was a fraction--

957
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,080
 or gave it a different name.

958
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,680
 So I was just-- I was curious about names of diseases

959
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,920
 and how they get them.

960
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,600
 And actually, quite recently, a Colorado-based scientist

961
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,800
 did a thing where she wanted to see if an AI machine

962
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,280
 could generate serious, sounding disease names.

963
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,560
 And she fed in 3,765 conditions, all the descriptions

964
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,520
 of them into this machine to see what they came up with.

965
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,240
 And some great names came out of it.

966
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,040
 So according to AI, people out there

967
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,240
 are suffering from penis arthritis.

968
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 [LAUGHTER]

969
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,040
 Makes me feel a bit stiff in the morning though, aren't they?

970
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,240
 They were all amazing.

971
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,360
 Insect skulls was one cancer of the cancer.

972
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,200
 [LAUGHTER]

973
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,960
 And RIP syndrome.

974
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,160
 [LAUGHTER]

975
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,400
 That's amazing.

976
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,120
 We need to wrap up, guys.

977
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,160
 OK, that is it.

978
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,360
 That is all of our facts.

979
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,840
 Thank you so much for listening.

980
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,840

 We have everything up there from upcoming tour dates

994

 Thank you so much, New York.

997
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
 That was awesome.
