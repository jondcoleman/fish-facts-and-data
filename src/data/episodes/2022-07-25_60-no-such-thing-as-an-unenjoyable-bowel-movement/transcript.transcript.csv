00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, welcome to episode 60 of No Such Thing as a Fish. Just a quick announcement"
00:00:06,00:00:11,"before we begin. My microphone didn't work this week, and as a result, it has infected"
00:00:11,00:00:17,"the entire other four working microphones. So the show does sound good, but as soon as"
00:00:17,00:00:22,"I start talking, it's terrible. No change that. Yep, so."
00:00:22,00:00:39,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:39,00:00:43,coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting
00:00:43,00:00:48,"here with James Harkin, Annotzzynski, Andy Murray, and we have a special guest today."
00:00:48,00:00:53,"It's the founder, creator of QI, it's Commander John Lloyd, and once again, we have gathered"
00:00:53,00:00:57,around our microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in
00:00:57,00:01:03,"no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:01:03,00:01:10,"Okay, my fact this week is that the final McDonald's burger ever sold in Iceland can currently"
00:01:10,00:01:16,be watched decomposing on a webcam. Is that in accordance with a statement that might
00:01:16,00:01:22,"have been made last week? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, last week I may well"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"have said that Iceland has the most expensive McDonald's burgers, but there has been no McDonald's"
00:01:27,00:01:33,in Iceland since 2009. A fact that everyone has been very willing to point out. That doesn't
00:01:33,00:01:37,explain why they're so expensive because it's scarcity value. And so no more McDonald's
00:01:37,00:01:43,in Iceland. And the last one they kept put it in a museum and now it's in a hostel under
00:01:43,00:01:47,a webcam. How's it looking? It's looking fine because burgers tend to not decompose very
00:01:47,00:01:53,"much. Yeah, so I read that because there's a some father who's got really outraged, didn't"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"he? He put one of his kids, McDonald's burgers in a jar or something and filmed it over"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"the course of weeks and weeks and months and months and said, isn't this outrageous? This"
00:02:01,00:02:04,"hasn't rotted at all. And McDonald's, I think, ended up, I assume having to be the first"
00:02:04,00:02:11,"franchise ever to protest. Our food does rot honestly. Please believe us, but yeah, they"
00:02:11,00:02:14,"don't rot. And it's like, if it doesn't have access to the fluids that allow the bacteria"
00:02:14,00:02:18,"to thrive, then they just go and be yes. If you keep it dry and you keep no animals near"
00:02:18,00:02:22,"it or bacteria near it or whatever, then it'll be fine. I like the fact that it's on a webcam"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"as well, 24 hours a day. Yeah, it's good. Do you know there are webcams where you can"
00:02:26,00:02:31,"actually watch paint dry? Have you seen that paint peel? There's one, a paint peeling website"
00:02:31,00:02:37,and there's a grass growing website. And there's one where you can or you could see a cheddar
00:02:37,00:02:43,"cheese mature. And it was on for a year, which I don't know how long this cheese takes to mature."
00:02:43,00:02:49,And the cheese was known as wedginalt apparently. And it got you to get Valentine's cards from
00:02:49,00:02:55,"America and assigned rugby ball from the British rugby team. The cheese. Yeah, it had a million"
00:02:55,00:03:01,"fans. Did they possibly read mature and think it was some other kind of online thing? Adults,"
00:03:01,00:03:10,cheese. X raises cheddar. I'd breakfast by cancer days with a guy used to work on the McDonald's
00:03:10,00:03:15,"advertising account. Oh, really? And he said that when they launched their I'm loving it,"
00:03:15,00:03:21,"which is a terrible slogan. I'm loving it to campaign. They had 30,000 parties all over"
00:03:21,00:03:25,the world simultaneously. It's a world record for a number of simultaneously held parties
00:03:25,00:03:29,"because they got 34,000 restaurants, as they call them. And I'm like, what is his wrong"
00:03:29,00:03:35,"restaurant, doesn't it? Yeah, what would you call them? Joints. Food halls. And I looked up some,"
00:03:35,00:03:44,"I looked up some of these 34,000 out there. Oh gosh. And here they are. Number one. The McDonald's"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"in Roswell, New Mexico is the only one in the world shaped like a UFO. Really? Actually,"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"just think about UFOs look a bit like burgers anyway. Yeah, they're. Yeah. Perhaps it's"
00:03:54,00:04:02,"an accident. And there's a ski through McDonald's in Sweden, in Linnvallem and Sweden. Is there"
00:04:02,00:04:06,a hundred yards between the order microphone and the bit where you pick it up? So good to
00:04:06,00:04:12,get the time to prepare it. The price. Did you also see about the world's most expensive
00:04:12,00:04:17,"burger, which I think came out this month? It's called the glam burger. And it's available"
00:04:17,00:04:23,"at Honky Tonk Restaurant, Chelsea. It's just not an ad. And it uses in the burger is Canadian"
00:04:23,00:04:29,"lobster, New Zealand venison, Kobe beef, black truffleberry, champagne, Iranian saffron,"
00:04:29,00:04:36,"Himalayan salt, blue gacavia and hickory smoked duck egg covered in edible gold leaf. The"
00:04:36,00:04:42,"bun is also covered in gold leaf. And it costs 1,100 pounds. Is that with fries? No, fries"
00:04:42,00:04:53,"are extra. It's 1,102.99. Okay, so you were saying about expensive burgers. I read an article"
00:04:53,00:04:58,"saying that burgers couldn't have existed 100 years ago. Oh, I love this theory. Yeah, you"
00:04:58,00:05:04,"saw this. And so it's apparently they didn't really exist back then. But the thing is, if"
00:05:04,00:05:09,"you have tomatoes, they have to be made at a certain time of year in a certain place in"
00:05:09,00:05:14,"the planet. The same with beef has to be, you know, in the olden days, you would kill the"
00:05:14,00:05:20,cow at a certain time. And the bread would have to be found at a certain time the wheat would
00:05:20,00:05:26,have to be. And so it would be impossible until we have modern farming techniques to actually
00:05:26,00:05:30,"have a burger. Wait, you could have had some burgers, right? You just couldn't have mass-produced"
00:05:30,00:05:35,them or you couldn't have made a burger. You'd have to take the cow to the wheat field. Yeah.
00:05:35,00:05:40,Kill it there. Yeah. They're not saying that you couldn't get beef on bread at the same
00:05:40,00:05:46,"time of year. But for instance, tomatoes would only come through in this summer. Yeah."
00:05:46,00:05:49,And so you'd have to pick those in the summer if you wanted to have tomatoes on your burger
00:05:49,00:05:56,and gokins hadn't been invented yet. It's a burger include the bun. I've never really
00:05:56,00:06:01,understood that. Yes. It does include the bun. Have you been to McDonald's? Can I get some
00:06:01,00:06:07,buns with my... I'll pay extra. I don't mind. I'll pay extra. It does not necessarily include
00:06:07,00:06:11,"tomatoes because McDonald's don't have tomatoes by a large. Yeah, that's just that true."
00:06:11,00:06:16,Cheeseburger doesn't. You know where you learn all this stuff? Had no idea this place existed?
00:06:16,00:06:22,"Burger University. McDonald's has hamburger universities? Is it in Hamburg? No, it's in Harvard."
00:06:22,00:06:27,"Sorry, it's not in Harvard. It's considered to be the Harvard of it. It's in Oak Grove Village,"
00:06:27,00:06:32,Illinois. And everyone says it's the Harvard of the fast food universities. And there are
00:06:32,00:06:39,"how many other. They have 5,000 students. They have 12 interactive educational teams. They"
00:06:39,00:06:47,"have in-house professors. Ray Croc taught there, the original McDonald's. Do you know Harvard University?"
00:06:47,00:06:52,Does Harvard University have Harvard University ever called itself the Oak Grove Illinois hamburger
00:06:52,00:06:59,"of the academic world? Do you know what is the Harvard of the luck-making world? No, it's"
00:06:59,00:07:14,"surprising. Is it Yale? So this is quite fun. Before 2012, I found this on NPR. Before 2012,"
00:07:14,00:07:20,Pizza Hut was the USA's biggest buyer of kale. They did not serve any of it. They used it as a
00:07:20,00:07:27,"decoration in their salad bars. NPR checked us out and they said they never heard back from Pizza Hut,"
00:07:27,00:07:31,"so they did try to fact-check it, but they haven't got it cast iron. That's amazing."
00:07:31,00:07:36,"And that was before kale. Yeah, just kale. Yeah, it's taken off now, isn't it? Yeah, really."
00:07:36,00:07:42,"You know the Queen technically owns a McDonald's. She works in it, doesn't she? On alternate"
00:07:42,00:07:50,"Tuesdays, yeah. She studied at that university. No, she basically, the Crown Estate bought up"
00:07:50,00:07:56,a big shopping centre effectively. And she's the landlord of it now. And McDonald's is
00:07:56,00:08:01,"there as a driver. McDonald's. So she's a landlord of that. She's only shopping centre it is. Yeah,"
00:08:01,00:08:08,"it's the, it's visible from Windsor Castle. Wow, slow, maybe. Yeah, it's in slow. Yeah, yeah."
00:08:08,00:08:13,I like that visible from Windsor Castle. Do you know the Great Wall of China's visible from
00:08:13,00:08:21,"Windsor Castle? No, I think that's been debunked, doesn't it? Yeah, so she also owns a BNQ Superstore."
00:08:23,00:08:29,"Some branches of Comet, a JJB sports and mother care. Is she like at one of those hands-on owners"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"of MicroManager? Do we know? She's always in there, inspecting the staff. She turns up and"
00:08:34,00:08:46,"demos the rent with a sled chamois every month. Okay, time for fact number two and that is John Lloyd."
00:08:47,00:08:54,My fact that I offer you elves is that in 1851 Prince Albert commissioned a ballroom for
00:08:54,00:09:02,Belmoral Castle made entirely of corrugated iron. Now you think of corrugated iron as being
00:09:02,00:09:07,"like a really cheesy, cheap material that's, you know, garden sheds and, you know, tin shacks and"
00:09:07,00:09:16,"Australia. But from the time that it was invented in 1829, it was an absolutely amazing wonder material."
00:09:16,00:09:22,"It's cheap, it's light, it's fireproof, corrosion proof, biodegradable and earthquake resistance,"
00:09:22,00:09:28,"and it can survive monsoons, heavy snow loads, immense heat, it can be re-acted by unskilled"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"labor, it really is amazing. I actually went and bought a book on corrugated iron. It's massive,"
00:09:33,00:09:38,it's about the size of a corrugated iron sheet because I got so fascinated by it. Wow. These days most
00:09:38,00:09:47,"corrugated iron is not iron. No, that's true. It sounds aluminium, zinc and steel generally."
00:09:47,00:09:52,"This is the 1890s, it has been that and language just has not caught up. So it's being not iron"
00:09:52,00:09:57,"for a lot longer than it was iron. Yeah, by now, yeah. Do you know where the word comes from?"
00:09:57,00:10:04,"The word corrugated, it's rouga, Latin for a wrinkle. Yeah, that's why you say testicles of rougos,"
00:10:04,00:10:11,"don't you? Do you? Well, I do. Oh, it's constantly. I think I've read that there's a theory and it's not,"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"it's very, very hard to prove, but there's a theory that more people have been sheltered by"
00:10:15,00:10:20,corrugated iron in the 20th century than by any other material in the world. Wow. Isn't that
00:10:20,00:10:26,incredible? I think that's probably true. Because something like 60% of Nairobi's population live in
00:10:26,00:10:34,"corrugated iron houses to this day. So isn't that amazing? Yeah. It's amazing, I guess it's"
00:10:34,00:10:38,"Jones pointing out. I just didn't know the first thing about corrugated iron. Yeah, this is what I"
00:10:38,00:10:44,"find about corrugated iron is I never thought about it in my whole life before. But then suddenly,"
00:10:44,00:10:49,"you think this is a really, really important thing. Because in, for example, the First World War,"
00:10:49,00:10:53,the Nissenhut invented by Captain Peter Nissen who was a Canadian mining engineer serving with
00:10:53,00:10:58,"royal engineers in Britain. He invented this thing again. You just need this because as I said,"
00:10:58,00:11:02,it bends in one direction perfectly and it's perfectly rigid in the other. So they build a
00:11:02,00:11:08,"hundred thousand Nissenhuts in the First World War, which has two and a half million men around the"
00:11:08,00:11:14,"trenches. In the Second World War in New Zealand, they came up with a thing called a Bob Semple tank,"
00:11:14,00:11:20,"which was, it wasn't invented by Bob Semple, but it was his idea. I think he was a politician or"
00:11:20,00:11:25,something. And the idea is they would take a tractor and put corrugated iron around it and turn it
00:11:25,00:11:34,"into a tank. But unfortunately, due to functional failures, tractor gear problems, public ridicule"
00:11:34,00:11:40,"and impracticality, the tanks were rejected. So they didn't work and everyone thought they were stupid."
00:11:40,00:11:47,"So the reason that corrugated is so strong is if you, it's a bit like, if you have a pizza slice and"
00:11:47,00:11:51,"you just hold the end of the pizza and it kind of flops over. But if you bend it into like a U shape,"
00:11:51,00:11:57,then it kind of stays stiff. And that's the maths behind that. And it was first discovered by Karl
00:11:57,00:12:04,"Friedrich Gauss, and he named it the Theorema agregium, which was Latin for the excellent theorem."
00:12:04,00:12:07,"He thought it was one of the best things, I mean, he was one of the great mathematicians, but he thought"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"this was one of the best things that he ever came up with. It's his own hype man there, isn't he?"
00:12:11,00:12:16,You like the excellent theorem? Wait till we hear the outstanding theorem.
00:12:16,00:12:22,"If you know that the Milky Way is supposedly corrugated, it's like a disc of matter and stars,"
00:12:22,00:12:30,"but it has ridges in it. Whoa, that's great. Yeah. Is that for strength? Well, it might be,"
00:12:30,00:12:37,"like because obviously in nature, just if you think about the hexagons in a, in a beast nest,"
00:12:37,00:12:41,"then they, they come because they're so strong, or so simple. Maybe it is. Maybe it's... Wait,"
00:12:41,00:12:45,was there anything else that's natural outside of the Milky Way that's corrugated? Yes.
00:12:45,00:12:51,"I know something. And so woodpeckers, they have this cartilage in between their beak and the rest of"
00:12:51,00:12:56,"their skull, because obviously they head a tree at 50 miles an hour every time. And this cartilage"
00:12:56,00:13:02,"is corrugated, and it absorbs the shock of the impact, and it stops them from killing themselves"
00:13:02,00:13:07,"every time they head a tree. No, that's clever. That's that corrugation. Someone is using it at the"
00:13:07,00:13:13,moment to develop a safer bike helmet by using a layer of corrugation inside to absorb impacts.
00:13:14,00:13:20,That's cool. That's really cool. Yeah. Just going back to Bel Moral for a minute. The actual ballroom
00:13:20,00:13:24,in Bel Moral now is the largest room in the castle. It's the only one that's open to the public.
00:13:24,00:13:30,"And Prince Albert, because Prince Albert bought Bel Moral with his own money,"
00:13:30,00:13:35,"unlike all the other royal residences, it's actually private properties actually owned"
00:13:35,00:13:40,"by the royal family, whereas all the other ones are owned by the Crown, which is the legal"
00:13:40,00:13:46,"personage, which, you know, manages the thing. So they can do with it as they wish. It should put them"
00:13:46,00:13:54,"McDonald's in it. They also, in the Bel Moral ballroom, the castle ballroom, as it's called, every year,"
00:13:54,00:14:00,"they hold a gillies ball, because there's 50,000 acres of Bel Moral, so they've already got quite a"
00:14:00,00:14:08,"few gillies. I think it's 150 staff full-time part-time. And holding a gillies ball, this is my part,"
00:14:08,00:14:14,"with his favorite joke. He used to say, he used to repeat this joke a lot, which is, he said,"
00:14:14,00:14:21,"""Moves in America."" They have these people called the Moosies. The order of the Moos in Canada,"
00:14:21,00:14:28,"which is a kind of mate, they like the Maesons. And this guy, my father used to say, he's trying to"
00:14:28,00:14:32,"get to sleep in this hotel. There's a terrible racket from downstairs. And he rings out the manager,"
00:14:32,00:14:40,"and he says, ""Would you please keep the noise down?"" And the manager says, ""But sir, they're holding a"
00:14:40,00:14:48,"Moosies ball."" And the guy says, ""Well, for God's sake, tell him to let it go."" He never taught it as that."
00:14:48,00:14:56,"I was reading over Christmas a book by, it was a biography on Robin Williams. And Robin Williams'"
00:14:56,00:15:01,"mother used to read, so Laurie Williams, she used to read him this book, which she said was her"
00:15:01,00:15:06,"favorite book, which was supposedly written by 19th century English aside to the hostess."
00:15:06,00:15:13,"And it was called, ""Balls I Have Held."" That's very good."
00:15:13,00:15:21,"There was a guide to Ballroom etiquette written in 1880, I think, which I, it has my various"
00:15:21,00:15:25,"good advice for attending a ball. So, like, for gentlemen, without proper introduction,"
00:15:25,00:15:31,"ask a lady who he's not acquainted with to dance. She should positively refuse. Things like that,"
00:15:31,00:15:37,"but I like the fact that during a ball in a ballroom no lady should be left unattended,"
00:15:37,00:15:40,which I just quite like. Because they may be removed and destroyed with that ball.
00:15:40,00:15:53,"Okay, time for fact number three. And that is just a sneak. My fact is that during the 19th"
00:15:53,00:15:58,"century, Sadler's Wells Theatre in London was routinely flooded to stage fake naval battles."
00:15:58,00:16:05,"I think it's really cool. So, if people aren't familiar with Sadler's Wells, these days it's more"
00:16:05,00:16:11,"of a ballet dancing theatre, but it's had about five or six iterations, I think, over the past few"
00:16:11,00:16:19,"hundred years. And yeah, at the turn of the, so between about 1800 and 1820s, this guy decided that"
00:16:19,00:16:26,"in celebration of Britain's naval prowess, that he would fill it with gallons and gallons of water"
00:16:26,00:16:29,and use it to stage fake naval battles. And they weren't a huge amount of trouble for it.
00:16:29,00:16:38,"So, they employed it was in 1804 that this, this was begun. And it was the brainchild of someone"
00:16:38,00:16:44,"called Charles Dibberden, Jr. And he employed all these shipwrites and rigors to exactly replicate"
00:16:44,00:16:49,"the ships that have been using the British Navy. The scale was one inch per foot, so they weren't"
00:16:49,00:16:56,"the actual size of ships otherwise, that wouldn't have fitted in the theatre. And yeah, it was filled"
00:16:56,00:17:01,"with 8,000 cubic feet of, as it was announced, the newspaper and capital letters, real water,"
00:17:01,00:17:08,"not just fake water, and 117 model ships. And they employed little children, so they put out"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"adverts asking for children who were able to swim, so that during performances they could have,"
00:17:12,00:17:16,"when they were staging all these fake naval battles, they could have kids who could swim in the water"
00:17:16,00:17:19,that had to be rescued by the actors. And it was commonplace at the end of performances for the
00:17:19,00:17:24,"audience to jump into the water at the end, to all flood forward, as it were, and jump in and start"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"swimming in it. Sounds great. That sounds amazing. The reason, do you know why the reason for these"
00:17:29,00:17:35,"battles, that between the licensing act of 1737 and the theatres act of 1843, for a hundred years,"
00:17:35,00:17:41,only two theatres in the country were allowed to do theatre with dialogue. The two theatres
00:17:41,00:17:46,"role, one in Covent Garden, one in Drury Lane. Everyone else could do music, but they couldn't have"
00:17:46,00:17:53,speech as well. Wow. So what happened was that they basically became dependent on stuff that didn't
00:17:53,00:17:58,"involve any sort of proper acting, so they had to have spectacles of various kinds, and sea battles"
00:17:58,00:18:07,"were just one of the main things. But in 1784-5, the top of the bill at Sadler's Wells were a play"
00:18:07,00:18:17,"by Skaglioni's troupe of Thessbian dogs, starring in a stash, the canine-masinee idol of his day,"
00:18:17,00:18:22,"apparently. Two horses dancing a minuette, a singing dark and a pig that could tell the time."
00:18:22,00:18:31,"Like the children's game, what's the time Mr. Pig? So there was this intense clowning,"
00:18:31,00:18:34,"and so you could have dancing and so on, but you couldn't have proper theatre for over a hundred"
00:18:34,00:18:41,"years. He was always reading a gremaldi, the great's original clown, he used to perform there a lot,"
00:18:41,00:18:47,"and indeed he made his first appearance there, age three as a dancer and an Easter Entertainment,"
00:18:47,00:18:55,"and his last in 1828. So to do his whole life, he was a big fan of Sadler's Wells, and I just want"
00:18:55,00:19:03,"to mention this thing that one of the highlights of gremaldi's career was in 1807, he was at Sadler's Wells,"
00:19:03,00:19:09,and he caused so much hilarity that a deaf and dumb man in the audience recovered his lost powers
00:19:09,00:19:13,"of speech and cried out, ""What a damned funny fellow!"""
00:19:13,00:19:25,"I don't want to sound like a Swirlsport or Darren Brown, but I think that guy was a plant."
00:19:26,00:19:34,It seemed more impressive if he was a plant. Can he tell the time as well?
00:19:34,00:19:38,"So I read that this genre, there was an actual genre of, as you said, these spectacles which specifically"
00:19:38,00:19:44,"involved naval scenes, and it was called Aquadrama, all the pages referred to it as Aquadrama,"
00:19:44,00:19:51,"and one of the shows of Sadler's Wells was called Philip and his dog, or Wes the Child,"
00:19:53,00:19:59,and the climax of that show was a dog actor jumping into the water and saving a child from drowning.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"Yeah, these huge dog celebrities. Can I have a lot of well-trained dog?"
00:20:04,00:20:09,I know. Did they have actors on the boats? Do they stand on the ships?
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Yes, they're big enough to do that."
00:20:10,00:20:15,"Yes, they did, and there's one quite funny article which points out that everyone so involved in"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"the show, and it's so captivating that no one notices the problem with perspective whereby the"
00:20:18,00:20:23,"boats are about a tenth the size, but the people obviously are just people-sized."
00:20:23,00:20:27,"I was going to say, because I think they had 117 mini ships on the stage."
00:20:27,00:20:29,That's a lot. Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"Well, they all on stage at once, they can't have been."
00:20:31,00:20:34,I don't know. Why would you not have them all on stage at once?
00:20:34,00:20:36,"Why would you show them the ship, yeah?"
00:20:36,00:20:40,"I think the biggest now, so these are called now Machia Sea Battles, and they date right back to"
00:20:40,00:20:46,"classical times, but the largest one we had in that era was in 1814, and I came across this by accident,"
00:20:46,00:20:53,"it was all any newspapers reporting on that day in 1814, and it was in Hyde Park on the Serpentine Lake,"
00:20:53,00:21:00,"and it was to celebrate the peace in the Napoleonic Wars, so the peace treaty with Napoleon"
00:21:00,00:21:03,"and the end of that fighting, and to celebrate that apparently, they say it's a huge naval battle,"
00:21:03,00:21:08,"but newspaper said the whole metropolis seemed depopulated, everyone was centred in the parks,"
00:21:08,00:21:12,and the whole of London flocked to Hyde Park and watched this huge naval battle on the Serpentine.
00:21:12,00:21:19,"Cool. We have to move on. I've just got one last thing to mention before we do, which is it's a bit of a"
00:21:19,00:21:24,"it's a bit of a famous rock myth, which I think is really interesting. You know that great rock myth"
00:21:24,00:21:31,"about the idea of Van Halen saying that if they had brown M&Ms inside there, so they would have"
00:21:31,00:21:34,there. This was in the right at you. This was in the right at the idea was that they said this is
00:21:34,00:21:40,"what we want in the green room, but we don't want any brown M&Ms. I thought that that was true,"
00:21:40,00:21:45,"but they did that. It is true that they did that, but so the idea is that they they would come back"
00:21:45,00:21:51,and one time David Lee Roth found brown M&Ms and he got furious and he trashed the whole room and
00:21:51,00:21:57,"that's what became very famous rock myth, and I say myth, the myth bit is the fact about why he got"
00:21:57,00:22:02,angry. He wasn't angry because there were brown M&Ms because he hates them. He was angry because
00:22:02,00:22:06,they were a tiny thing in a very big contract that he sent over because the Van Halen show was
00:22:06,00:22:11,such a spectacle. It was such a massive event that most venues in America couldn't accommodate the
00:22:11,00:22:17,"kind of show that they were going to do, and so he would put in precise detail this has to be like"
00:22:17,00:22:22,"this otherwise people may die, stages cause collapse or that sort of stuff, and if he found brown M&Ms"
00:22:22,00:22:26,"inside that bowl, he knew that they hadn't read the contract properly. That's really interesting."
00:22:26,00:22:31,"Of course, that's one reading that the contract hasn't been read properly, or the other reading is that"
00:22:31,00:22:34,the person who's in charge of setting up the stage so it doesn't collapse and kill people isn't
00:22:34,00:22:44,"also on M&Ms scouting duty. That's true, that's true. That's one of the great rock sort of stories,"
00:22:44,00:22:48,and it's interesting that there was actually a guy concerned with health and safety behind putting
00:22:48,00:22:52,"him in the right direction. Yeah, he's been unfairly maligned if that's the case. Yeah, exactly."
00:22:52,00:22:57,"Don't miss Adam to tell me this great story about Python's, the pythons when they were their first"
00:22:57,00:23:03,"live tour, and they went to America I think, and they were having a storm out live tour, and they"
00:23:03,00:23:09,"went to this hotel, and the manager said, ""Gentlemen, as soon as you want to trash the hotel room then go"
00:23:09,00:23:13,"right ahead, because they loved it, you know, because having the hotel room trash you've got massive"
00:23:13,00:23:19,"publicity, and of course it's all insured anyway, but you've got the papers."" And so the pythons being"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"very polite, and British said, ""No, no, that's quite necessary, don't need to trash anything, we're"
00:23:22,00:23:28,"very happy. No, please sir, please trash the room."" So, look, let me try with that, you know,"
00:23:28,00:23:34,"like start with this chair and all that stuff, so eventually after not wanting to do this,"
00:23:34,00:23:37,Michael Palin kindly went into the bathroom and broke a toothbrush.
00:23:37,00:23:49,"Okay, time for our final facts, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:23:49,00:23:52,My fact is that the practice of dog owners pretending that they haven't seen
00:23:52,00:23:59,"their dog having a crap. It's technically known as strategic non-knowledge, and it's conducted by"
00:23:59,00:24:07,"somebody who's genuinely called Dr. Gross. This old gross person, Matthew Gross, he's a German"
00:24:07,00:24:12,"sociology professor, and he's spent 10 years following dog owners around at all different times of"
00:24:12,00:24:20,day observing them and seeing how they live. And so he decided that this is a new sort of aspect
00:24:20,00:24:25,"to what we do. We kind of, yeah, it's that there's a specific way of not knowing about something,"
00:24:25,00:24:30,or deciding that you're not going to know about something happening because you think it's disgusting.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"So, and he found out a lot of other things, so often before people actually do pick up their dogs"
00:24:34,00:24:38,"poo, they will look over their shoulder and they will try and make sure that other people can see"
00:24:38,00:24:47,"them doing the right thing, basically, or sometimes if they, if there's no one around or if they"
00:24:47,00:24:51,"really don't want to, they'll start to put their hand in their pocket for a plastic bag or something"
00:24:51,00:24:56,"and they'll take it out again. They just, they'll decide at the last minute, not to. Wow."
00:24:56,00:25:01,"Andy, what is the thing about people doing the poop-a-scoop, putting it in the bag and then hanging"
00:25:01,00:25:08,"it on a tree? What's that for? Well, he has a theory about this. Which is that it's a form of passive"
00:25:08,00:25:15,"resistance that people are saying I don't, people are saying I know it's the right thing to pick this"
00:25:15,00:25:19,"up, but I resent having to do it. Therefore, I'm going to leave it anonymously because he said he"
00:25:19,00:25:24,"followed people for years and he never saw anyone leave it on a tree. Therefore, people must be leaving"
00:25:24,00:25:28,"it when there's no one else around, but making sure that no one sees them doing it. Is it a form of"
00:25:28,00:25:34,"decoration, maybe? Maybe it's making a double mark for their dog. So, the dog pisses on the tree"
00:25:34,00:25:40,"below. He sticks the poo up. It's just a total, that's my dog's tree. And no matter how high your dog is,"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"they do, they do this thing that because obviously it's a big problem. Everyone hates the idea of"
00:25:43,00:25:51,"seeing poo in the street. DNA dog testing is a new thing now, where they sample the poo and they can"
00:25:51,00:25:56,"identify now whose dog it is. So, you can no longer, they're doing this in London, London is where"
00:25:56,00:26:00,"it kind of started. It feels like it would really give you the DNA of whatever the dog's eaten,"
00:26:00,00:26:10,"rather than the dog itself, isn't it? Yeah, that's true. A cow took a poo. A tin of pedigree"
00:26:10,00:26:17,"charm has been defining the street again. That's true, but no. So, they now have 18,000 dogs when"
00:26:17,00:26:26,"this article was published in the power of barking. And they've registered their DNA. So, if you find poo"
00:26:26,00:26:31,"on the street now, you can take it in and they can go, okay, that's Mike's dog. I think I might just"
00:26:31,00:26:36,"still leave it rather than take it in. Well, you get big time. Also, the fatal flaw in this is that"
00:26:36,00:26:40,"because I think it's all voluntary, whether you submit your dog's DNA to this DNA database. So,"
00:26:40,00:26:46,"it relies on the people who decided to go and submit their dog's DNA, then also being the kind"
00:26:46,00:26:50,"of people who aren't going to pick up poo as a serious selection, but it's kind of problem here."
00:26:50,00:26:55,"That is tricky. Why don't policemen have to get off their police horses and, you know,"
00:26:55,00:27:02,with a shovel? Get a sack. Giant bin liner. Next to an enormous tree.
00:27:05,00:27:10,"The guy who did this, Matthew Gross, he wanted, you asked about leaving things by a tree. He wanted to ask"
00:27:10,00:27:16,"owners about the practice. And very bravely, he approached them and started asking them about it."
00:27:16,00:27:21,"And apparently, in his own words, some of the friendlier comments included mind your own business."
00:27:21,00:27:28,And don't you have anything else to do? That reminds me of the study of the guy who
00:27:29,00:27:35,"cycled around a town on a unicycle and made a list of all the different comments that he got,"
00:27:35,00:27:39,and something like two-thirds of them were something to be effected of was your other wheel.
00:27:39,00:27:48,"So, I'm pretending not to know things. This is from a book called Why Everyone Else Is A Hippocrite,"
00:27:48,00:27:52,"which deals with some of these questions, like Anna was saying, of self-deception. So, I just"
00:27:52,00:27:56,"wanted to quote a bit of it. So, there are lots of situations where if you don't know something,"
00:27:56,00:28:02,"you can avoid a situation, which is a lose-lose situation, just by pretending not to know or not to"
00:28:02,00:28:07,"understand something. So, this is the line. If you see a building on fire and a small boy comes to"
00:28:07,00:28:12,"tell you that a cat is caught in the window, your options are either to risk yourself to save the cat"
00:28:12,00:28:18,or take the reputational hit of neglecting or socially perceived duty to rescue the cat.
00:28:18,00:28:21,"And then there's a footnote in the book where it says, you could kill the boy, but then you've got"
00:28:21,00:28:33,"other problems. So, whereas if you simply pretend that you don't understand the language the boy is"
00:28:33,00:28:38,"speaking, then you don't have to rescue the cat. You don't have to risk your life. Yeah, or kill the boy."
00:28:38,00:28:42,"Or kill the boy. According to a survey commissioned by Samaritans quite recently,"
00:28:42,00:28:48,three times more men than women would pretend not to notice if a friend broke down in tears
00:28:48,00:28:52,in front of them. Bloody hell. That takes a lot of not noticing.
00:28:52,00:28:58,"Broke down in tears, not even just a little dribble and proper hysterical, crying fit. Three times more."
00:28:58,00:29:02,"I mean, you can't say whether that's positive or negative though, because is it thoughtfulness"
00:29:02,00:29:06,for the person? I might well do that because you don't want to make the person feel uncomfortable.
00:29:06,00:29:10,"It's true. You could go up to them and say they're there, or you could walk off, or you could kill them."
00:29:10,00:29:15,All of those would stop the cry. That will shut them up.
00:29:15,00:29:19,"But I have noticed with British people, generally, this is one observation I picked up from being here,"
00:29:19,00:29:26,"is that if people are talking in a room and someone farts loudly, just people just continue talking."
00:29:26,00:29:28,"They just walk over it. This is their own research, isn't it?"
00:29:28,00:29:34,Yeah. You may even have been noticing it would be conducting my study in the office for the last few years.
00:29:34,00:29:38,We've edited those all out of the book.
00:29:42,00:29:46,"Yeah, pretending not to know stuff is huge, especially in Britain."
00:29:46,00:29:51,"So, interestingly, because the scientists don't understand why we do lie though,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,and I don't think it's as simple as we think. That's what they say.
00:29:53,00:30:02,"So, there's this thing called smork, which is the simple model of rational crime,"
00:30:02,00:30:06,"which says that we lie for rational reasons. So, we lie when it's going to benefit us."
00:30:06,00:30:09,"So, I five stolen something and then someone asked me if I've stolen something in a lie,"
00:30:09,00:30:14,"so I don't get in trouble. But actually, and I basically started the podcast just as I was in the middle"
00:30:14,00:30:19,"of reading this. I didn't see examples, but it's this guy called Dan Ariely, who tested the smork principle."
00:30:19,00:30:23,And it's not true. We don't lie instinctively in a way that benefits us at all.
00:30:23,00:30:27,"We lie in a way that says we want to present ourselves as a certain as something,"
00:30:27,00:30:31,or something that's to do with our own self-image. It's not to save ourselves from something.
00:30:31,00:30:33,"So, we don't, I don't think we really know where we lie."
00:30:33,00:30:39,"I think my favourite thing about lying is that very small children under the age of about four never lie,"
00:30:39,00:30:43,because they think you can read their mind. Is that why?
00:30:43,00:30:47,Because they think that that voice we all have in our head that we've got used to.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"Small children just hear this as a kind of constant thing. They think, well, everybody,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,but I can hear it. Everyone else must be able to hear it.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"I can sort of, can't you remember, I can sort of remember thinking that."
00:30:54,00:30:57,I can remember being convinced that I could say which voice.
00:31:01,00:31:05,"And if you're a manipulative parent, you could really use that to your advantage,"
00:31:05,00:31:07,and show that the child never stole a biscuit again.
00:31:07,00:31:11,"Or you could kill the boy, but then you'd have other people."
00:31:11,00:31:15,So chimpanzees can do this thing.
00:31:15,00:31:20,"Sometimes if chimpanzee is foraging for food, he'll see something really tasty,"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"and then just kind of what past it pretending he didn't see it,"
00:31:24,00:31:28,just so that no other chimpanzee can see him kind of getting an eye on it.
00:31:28,00:31:33,"Wow. Apparently sometimes a competitor chimpanzee will kind of notice what he's doing,"
00:31:33,00:31:37,"and then what past the pretending chimpanzee hide behind a tree,"
00:31:37,00:31:42,and then peep out to see if the pretending chimpanzee really does have some food after all.
00:31:42,00:31:43,The geniuses.
00:31:43,00:31:48,"Yeah, I love it now, and then another animal apart from us has evolved nonchalants."
00:31:48,00:31:52,"Yes, that's great."
00:31:52,00:32:02,"No, no, don't get not a banana guy, not me. We should wrap up very quickly, because we should wrap it up."
00:32:02,00:32:06,"Indeed, I think that's the message of this podcast, because we should be wrapped up and disposed on"
00:32:06,00:32:10,responses. I think we really need to wrap up and tie this podcast around the tree.
00:32:10,00:32:16,"Actually, have you guys ever enjoyed your bowel movements?"
00:32:16,00:32:17,Love them.
00:32:17,00:32:22,Yes or no? Do you enjoy your bowel movements?
00:32:22,00:32:27,"This was a study done, actually, to test whether lions were more successful than they are,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,"and the way they did the study with these two scientists stayed up really late,"
00:32:30,00:32:33,"had a few drinks. This is in the '90s, I think."
00:32:33,00:32:36,"Had a few drinks and said, ""Okay, we need to ask people questions"
00:32:36,00:32:39,"that we definitely know the answers, yes, but I bet people will lie about it."""
00:32:39,00:32:42,"And so one of their questions was, ""Do you enjoy your bowel movements?"""
00:32:42,00:32:44,"And they were like, ""Well, obviously everyone does."""
00:32:44,00:32:49,"So if they say, ""No, they're lions."" And other questions in this study include it."
00:32:49,00:32:53,Have you ever doubted your sexual adequacy?
00:32:53,00:32:57,"Apparently, anyone who said no to that, they're going, ""Oh, obviously, a lion."""
00:32:57,00:33:00,And have you ever thought about committing suicide to get back at somebody?
00:33:00,00:33:05,"Anyone who says no to that, they've got to be a lion."
00:33:05,00:33:07,"That's how you tell, then you do this study."
00:33:07,00:33:12,"Apparently, these scientists concluded we've all wanted to do this."
00:33:12,00:33:14,They're called Ruben Gur and Harold Sakaiin.
00:33:14,00:33:15,Wow. Wow.
00:33:15,00:33:17,I'm going to kill myself to get back at them.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Or I'll just have a nice poo first.
00:33:18,00:33:25,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts."
00:33:25,00:33:27,Thank you so much for listening.
00:33:27,00:33:30,High five to Anna for asking her boss if he enjoys his bowel movements.
