00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hi everybody, welcome to episode 60 of No Such Thing as a Fish. Just a quick announcement

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.800
 before we begin. My microphone didn't work this week, and as a result, it has infected

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.240
 the entire other four working microphones. So the show does sound good, but as soon as

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.440
 I start talking, it's terrible. No change that. Yep, so.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.960
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.760
 here with James Harkin, Annotzzynski, Andy Murray, and we have a special guest today.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.560
 It's the founder, creator of QI, it's Commander John Lloyd, and once again, we have gathered

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.280
 around our microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.320
 Okay, my fact this week is that the final McDonald's burger ever sold in Iceland can currently

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 be watched decomposing on a webcam. Is that in accordance with a statement that might

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.160
 have been made last week? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, last week I may well

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.920
 have said that Iceland has the most expensive McDonald's burgers, but there has been no McDonald's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.120
 in Iceland since 2009. A fact that everyone has been very willing to point out. That doesn't

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.920
 explain why they're so expensive because it's scarcity value. And so no more McDonald's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.000
 in Iceland. And the last one they kept put it in a museum and now it's in a hostel under

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.680
 a webcam. How's it looking? It's looking fine because burgers tend to not decompose very

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.080
 much. Yeah, so I read that because there's a some father who's got really outraged, didn't

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.240
 he? He put one of his kids, McDonald's burgers in a jar or something and filmed it over

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.160
 the course of weeks and weeks and months and months and said, isn't this outrageous? This

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.880
 hasn't rotted at all. And McDonald's, I think, ended up, I assume having to be the first

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.240
 franchise ever to protest. Our food does rot honestly. Please believe us, but yeah, they

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.720
 don't rot. And it's like, if it doesn't have access to the fluids that allow the bacteria

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 to thrive, then they just go and be yes. If you keep it dry and you keep no animals near

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.640
 it or bacteria near it or whatever, then it'll be fine. I like the fact that it's on a webcam

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.280
 as well, 24 hours a day. Yeah, it's good. Do you know there are webcams where you can

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.400
 actually watch paint dry? Have you seen that paint peel? There's one, a paint peeling website

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.200
 and there's a grass growing website. And there's one where you can or you could see a cheddar

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 cheese mature. And it was on for a year, which I don't know how long this cheese takes to mature.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.720
 And the cheese was known as wedginalt apparently. And it got you to get Valentine's cards from

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.320
 America and assigned rugby ball from the British rugby team. The cheese. Yeah, it had a million

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.960
 fans. Did they possibly read mature and think it was some other kind of online thing? Adults,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:10.040
 cheese. X raises cheddar. I'd breakfast by cancer days with a guy used to work on the McDonald's

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.400
 advertising account. Oh, really? And he said that when they launched their I'm loving it,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.360
 which is a terrible slogan. I'm loving it to campaign. They had 30,000 parties all over

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.320
 the world simultaneously. It's a world record for a number of simultaneously held parties

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.960
 because they got 34,000 restaurants, as they call them. And I'm like, what is his wrong

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.680
 restaurant, doesn't it? Yeah, what would you call them? Joints. Food halls. And I looked up some,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:44.880
 I looked up some of these 34,000 out there. Oh gosh. And here they are. Number one. The McDonald's

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.600
 in Roswell, New Mexico is the only one in the world shaped like a UFO. Really? Actually,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.120
 just think about UFOs look a bit like burgers anyway. Yeah, they're. Yeah. Perhaps it's

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.240
 an accident. And there's a ski through McDonald's in Sweden, in Linnvallem and Sweden. Is there

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.240
 a hundred yards between the order microphone and the bit where you pick it up? So good to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.840
 get the time to prepare it. The price. Did you also see about the world's most expensive

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.680
 burger, which I think came out this month? It's called the glam burger. And it's available

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.720
 at Honky Tonk Restaurant, Chelsea. It's just not an ad. And it uses in the burger is Canadian

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.680
 lobster, New Zealand venison, Kobe beef, black truffleberry, champagne, Iranian saffron,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.120
 Himalayan salt, blue gacavia and hickory smoked duck egg covered in edible gold leaf. The

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.920
 bun is also covered in gold leaf. And it costs 1,100 pounds. Is that with fries? No, fries

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:53.240
 are extra. It's 1,102.99. Okay, so you were saying about expensive burgers. I read an article

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.960
 saying that burgers couldn't have existed 100 years ago. Oh, I love this theory. Yeah, you

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.760
 saw this. And so it's apparently they didn't really exist back then. But the thing is, if

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.480
 you have tomatoes, they have to be made at a certain time of year in a certain place in

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.600
 the planet. The same with beef has to be, you know, in the olden days, you would kill the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.240
 cow at a certain time. And the bread would have to be found at a certain time the wheat would

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.480
 have to be. And so it would be impossible until we have modern farming techniques to actually

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.920
 have a burger. Wait, you could have had some burgers, right? You just couldn't have mass-produced

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.160
 them or you couldn't have made a burger. You'd have to take the cow to the wheat field. Yeah.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.560
 Kill it there. Yeah. They're not saying that you couldn't get beef on bread at the same

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.040
 time of year. But for instance, tomatoes would only come through in this summer. Yeah.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.400
 And so you'd have to pick those in the summer if you wanted to have tomatoes on your burger

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.040
 and gokins hadn't been invented yet. It's a burger include the bun. I've never really

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.080
 understood that. Yes. It does include the bun. Have you been to McDonald's? Can I get some

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.640
 buns with my... I'll pay extra. I don't mind. I'll pay extra. It does not necessarily include

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.840
 tomatoes because McDonald's don't have tomatoes by a large. Yeah, that's just that true.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.880
 Cheeseburger doesn't. You know where you learn all this stuff? Had no idea this place existed?

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.920
 Burger University. McDonald's has hamburger universities? Is it in Hamburg? No, it's in Harvard.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.280
 Sorry, it's not in Harvard. It's considered to be the Harvard of it. It's in Oak Grove Village,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.480
 Illinois. And everyone says it's the Harvard of the fast food universities. And there are

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.840
 how many other. They have 5,000 students. They have 12 interactive educational teams. They

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.280
 have in-house professors. Ray Croc taught there, the original McDonald's. Do you know Harvard University?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.960
 Does Harvard University have Harvard University ever called itself the Oak Grove Illinois hamburger

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.520
 of the academic world? Do you know what is the Harvard of the luck-making world? No, it's

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:14.160
 surprising. Is it Yale? So this is quite fun. Before 2012, I found this on NPR. Before 2012,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.400
 Pizza Hut was the USA's biggest buyer of kale. They did not serve any of it. They used it as a

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.040
 decoration in their salad bars. NPR checked us out and they said they never heard back from Pizza Hut,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.280
 so they did try to fact-check it, but they haven't got it cast iron. That's amazing.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.960
 And that was before kale. Yeah, just kale. Yeah, it's taken off now, isn't it? Yeah, really.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.080
 You know the Queen technically owns a McDonald's. She works in it, doesn't she? On alternate

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:50.880
 Tuesdays, yeah. She studied at that university. No, she basically, the Crown Estate bought up

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.880
 a big shopping centre effectively. And she's the landlord of it now. And McDonald's is

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.920
 there as a driver. McDonald's. So she's a landlord of that. She's only shopping centre it is. Yeah,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.160
 it's the, it's visible from Windsor Castle. Wow, slow, maybe. Yeah, it's in slow. Yeah, yeah.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.360
 I like that visible from Windsor Castle. Do you know the Great Wall of China's visible from

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:21.680
 Windsor Castle? No, I think that's been debunked, doesn't it? Yeah, so she also owns a BNQ Superstore.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.680
 Some branches of Comet, a JJB sports and mother care. Is she like at one of those hands-on owners

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.560
 of MicroManager? Do we know? She's always in there, inspecting the staff. She turns up and

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:46.720
 demos the rent with a sled chamois every month. Okay, time for fact number two and that is John Lloyd.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:54.400
 My fact that I offer you elves is that in 1851 Prince Albert commissioned a ballroom for

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:02.240
 Belmoral Castle made entirely of corrugated iron. Now you think of corrugated iron as being

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.520
 like a really cheesy, cheap material that's, you know, garden sheds and, you know, tin shacks and

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:16.320
 Australia. But from the time that it was invented in 1829, it was an absolutely amazing wonder material.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.720
 It's cheap, it's light, it's fireproof, corrosion proof, biodegradable and earthquake resistance,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.320
 and it can survive monsoons, heavy snow loads, immense heat, it can be re-acted by unskilled

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.280
 labor, it really is amazing. I actually went and bought a book on corrugated iron. It's massive,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.640
 it's about the size of a corrugated iron sheet because I got so fascinated by it. Wow. These days most

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:47.120
 corrugated iron is not iron. No, that's true. It sounds aluminium, zinc and steel generally.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.560
 This is the 1890s, it has been that and language just has not caught up. So it's being not iron

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.040
 for a lot longer than it was iron. Yeah, by now, yeah. Do you know where the word comes from?

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:04.160
 The word corrugated, it's rouga, Latin for a wrinkle. Yeah, that's why you say testicles of rougos,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.360
 don't you? Do you? Well, I do. Oh, it's constantly. I think I've read that there's a theory and it's not,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.200
 it's very, very hard to prove, but there's a theory that more people have been sheltered by

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.160
 corrugated iron in the 20th century than by any other material in the world. Wow. Isn't that

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:26.560
 incredible? I think that's probably true. Because something like 60% of Nairobi's population live in

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:34.080
 corrugated iron houses to this day. So isn't that amazing? Yeah. It's amazing, I guess it's

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.800
 Jones pointing out. I just didn't know the first thing about corrugated iron. Yeah, this is what I

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.160
 find about corrugated iron is I never thought about it in my whole life before. But then suddenly,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.200
 you think this is a really, really important thing. Because in, for example, the First World War,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.920
 the Nissenhut invented by Captain Peter Nissen who was a Canadian mining engineer serving with

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.800
 royal engineers in Britain. He invented this thing again. You just need this because as I said,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.960
 it bends in one direction perfectly and it's perfectly rigid in the other. So they build a

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.640
 hundred thousand Nissenhuts in the First World War, which has two and a half million men around the

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.560
 trenches. In the Second World War in New Zealand, they came up with a thing called a Bob Semple tank,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.000
 which was, it wasn't invented by Bob Semple, but it was his idea. I think he was a politician or

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.520
 something. And the idea is they would take a tractor and put corrugated iron around it and turn it

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:34.400
 into a tank. But unfortunately, due to functional failures, tractor gear problems, public ridicule

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.800
 and impracticality, the tanks were rejected. So they didn't work and everyone thought they were stupid.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.120
 So the reason that corrugated is so strong is if you, it's a bit like, if you have a pizza slice and

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.680
 you just hold the end of the pizza and it kind of flops over. But if you bend it into like a U shape,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.520
 then it kind of stays stiff. And that's the maths behind that. And it was first discovered by Karl

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.000
 Friedrich Gauss, and he named it the Theorema agregium, which was Latin for the excellent theorem.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.200
 He thought it was one of the best things, I mean, he was one of the great mathematicians, but he thought

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.440
 this was one of the best things that he ever came up with. It's his own hype man there, isn't he?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.480
 You like the excellent theorem? Wait till we hear the outstanding theorem.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 If you know that the Milky Way is supposedly corrugated, it's like a disc of matter and stars,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:30.960
 but it has ridges in it. Whoa, that's great. Yeah. Is that for strength? Well, it might be,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.120
 like because obviously in nature, just if you think about the hexagons in a, in a beast nest,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.760
 then they, they come because they're so strong, or so simple. Maybe it is. Maybe it's... Wait,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.840
 was there anything else that's natural outside of the Milky Way that's corrugated? Yes.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.360
 I know something. And so woodpeckers, they have this cartilage in between their beak and the rest of

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.000
 their skull, because obviously they head a tree at 50 miles an hour every time. And this cartilage

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.960
 is corrugated, and it absorbs the shock of the impact, and it stops them from killing themselves

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.360
 every time they head a tree. No, that's clever. That's that corrugation. Someone is using it at the

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.520
 moment to develop a safer bike helmet by using a layer of corrugation inside to absorb impacts.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.320
 That's cool. That's really cool. Yeah. Just going back to Bel Moral for a minute. The actual ballroom

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.560
 in Bel Moral now is the largest room in the castle. It's the only one that's open to the public.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.400
 And Prince Albert, because Prince Albert bought Bel Moral with his own money,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.680
 unlike all the other royal residences, it's actually private properties actually owned

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.960
 by the royal family, whereas all the other ones are owned by the Crown, which is the legal

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.000
 personage, which, you know, manages the thing. So they can do with it as they wish. It should put them

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.800
 McDonald's in it. They also, in the Bel Moral ballroom, the castle ballroom, as it's called, every year,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.720
 they hold a gillies ball, because there's 50,000 acres of Bel Moral, so they've already got quite a

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:08.560
 few gillies. I think it's 150 staff full-time part-time. And holding a gillies ball, this is my part,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:14.640
 with his favorite joke. He used to say, he used to repeat this joke a lot, which is, he said,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:21.760
 "Moves in America." They have these people called the Moosies. The order of the Moos in Canada,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:28.320
 which is a kind of mate, they like the Maesons. And this guy, my father used to say, he's trying to

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.880
 get to sleep in this hotel. There's a terrible racket from downstairs. And he rings out the manager,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:40.000
 and he says, "Would you please keep the noise down?" And the manager says, "But sir, they're holding a

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.960
 Moosies ball." And the guy says, "Well, for God's sake, tell him to let it go." He never taught it as that.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:56.560
 I was reading over Christmas a book by, it was a biography on Robin Williams. And Robin Williams'

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.120
 mother used to read, so Laurie Williams, she used to read him this book, which she said was her

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.240
 favorite book, which was supposedly written by 19th century English aside to the hostess.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.600
 And it was called, "Balls I Have Held." That's very good.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:21.360
 There was a guide to Ballroom etiquette written in 1880, I think, which I, it has my various

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.760
 good advice for attending a ball. So, like, for gentlemen, without proper introduction,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.440
 ask a lady who he's not acquainted with to dance. She should positively refuse. Things like that,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.280
 but I like the fact that during a ball in a ballroom no lady should be left unattended,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.880
 which I just quite like. Because they may be removed and destroyed with that ball.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:53.760
 Okay, time for fact number three. And that is just a sneak. My fact is that during the 19th

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.960
 century, Sadler's Wells Theatre in London was routinely flooded to stage fake naval battles.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:05.440
 I think it's really cool. So, if people aren't familiar with Sadler's Wells, these days it's more

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.200
 of a ballet dancing theatre, but it's had about five or six iterations, I think, over the past few

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:19.520
 hundred years. And yeah, at the turn of the, so between about 1800 and 1820s, this guy decided that

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:26.320
 in celebration of Britain's naval prowess, that he would fill it with gallons and gallons of water

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.280
 and use it to stage fake naval battles. And they weren't a huge amount of trouble for it.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:38.640
 So, they employed it was in 1804 that this, this was begun. And it was the brainchild of someone

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.640
 called Charles Dibberden, Jr. And he employed all these shipwrites and rigors to exactly replicate

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.760
 the ships that have been using the British Navy. The scale was one inch per foot, so they weren't

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.400
 the actual size of ships otherwise, that wouldn't have fitted in the theatre. And yeah, it was filled

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.920
 with 8,000 cubic feet of, as it was announced, the newspaper and capital letters, real water,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.800
 not just fake water, and 117 model ships. And they employed little children, so they put out

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.320
 adverts asking for children who were able to swim, so that during performances they could have,

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.080
 when they were staging all these fake naval battles, they could have kids who could swim in the water

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.920
 that had to be rescued by the actors. And it was commonplace at the end of performances for the

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.800
 audience to jump into the water at the end, to all flood forward, as it were, and jump in and start

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.120
 swimming in it. Sounds great. That sounds amazing. The reason, do you know why the reason for these

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.600
 battles, that between the licensing act of 1737 and the theatres act of 1843, for a hundred years,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.520
 only two theatres in the country were allowed to do theatre with dialogue. The two theatres

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.560
 role, one in Covent Garden, one in Drury Lane. Everyone else could do music, but they couldn't have

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:53.120
 speech as well. Wow. So what happened was that they basically became dependent on stuff that didn't

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.720
 involve any sort of proper acting, so they had to have spectacles of various kinds, and sea battles

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:07.920
 were just one of the main things. But in 1784-5, the top of the bill at Sadler's Wells were a play

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:17.520
 by Skaglioni's troupe of Thessbian dogs, starring in a stash, the canine-masinee idol of his day,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.720
 apparently. Two horses dancing a minuette, a singing dark and a pig that could tell the time.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:31.280
 Like the children's game, what's the time Mr. Pig? So there was this intense clowning,

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.800
 and so you could have dancing and so on, but you couldn't have proper theatre for over a hundred

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:41.200
 years. He was always reading a gremaldi, the great's original clown, he used to perform there a lot,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.760
 and indeed he made his first appearance there, age three as a dancer and an Easter Entertainment,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.280
 and his last in 1828. So to do his whole life, he was a big fan of Sadler's Wells, and I just want

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:03.200
 to mention this thing that one of the highlights of gremaldi's career was in 1807, he was at Sadler's Wells,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:09.760
 and he caused so much hilarity that a deaf and dumb man in the audience recovered his lost powers

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.840
 of speech and cried out, "What a damned funny fellow!"

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:25.600
 I don't want to sound like a Swirlsport or Darren Brown, but I think that guy was a plant.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:34.400
 It seemed more impressive if he was a plant. Can he tell the time as well?

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.960
 So I read that this genre, there was an actual genre of, as you said, these spectacles which specifically

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.640
 involved naval scenes, and it was called Aquadrama, all the pages referred to it as Aquadrama,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.040
 and one of the shows of Sadler's Wells was called Philip and his dog, or Wes the Child,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.520
 and the climax of that show was a dog actor jumping into the water and saving a child from drowning.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.480
 Yeah, these huge dog celebrities. Can I have a lot of well-trained dog?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.120
 I know. Did they have actors on the boats? Do they stand on the ships?

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.240
 Yes, they're big enough to do that.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.280
 Yes, they did, and there's one quite funny article which points out that everyone so involved in

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.720
 the show, and it's so captivating that no one notices the problem with perspective whereby the

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.600
 boats are about a tenth the size, but the people obviously are just people-sized.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 I was going to say, because I think they had 117 mini ships on the stage.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.120
 That's a lot. Yeah.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.120
 Well, they all on stage at once, they can't have been.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.000
 I don't know. Why would you not have them all on stage at once?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400
 Why would you show them the ship, yeah?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.720
 I think the biggest now, so these are called now Machia Sea Battles, and they date right back to

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.560
 classical times, but the largest one we had in that era was in 1814, and I came across this by accident,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:53.280
 it was all any newspapers reporting on that day in 1814, and it was in Hyde Park on the Serpentine Lake,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.000
 and it was to celebrate the peace in the Napoleonic Wars, so the peace treaty with Napoleon

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.680
 and the end of that fighting, and to celebrate that apparently, they say it's a huge naval battle,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.000
 but newspaper said the whole metropolis seemed depopulated, everyone was centred in the parks,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.960
 and the whole of London flocked to Hyde Park and watched this huge naval battle on the Serpentine.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.360
 Cool. We have to move on. I've just got one last thing to mention before we do, which is it's a bit of a

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.880
 it's a bit of a famous rock myth, which I think is really interesting. You know that great rock myth

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.040
 about the idea of Van Halen saying that if they had brown M&Ms inside there, so they would have

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.800
 there. This was in the right at you. This was in the right at the idea was that they said this is

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.000
 what we want in the green room, but we don't want any brown M&Ms. I thought that that was true,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.680
 but they did that. It is true that they did that, but so the idea is that they they would come back

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.520
 and one time David Lee Roth found brown M&Ms and he got furious and he trashed the whole room and

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.680
 that's what became very famous rock myth, and I say myth, the myth bit is the fact about why he got

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.000
 angry. He wasn't angry because there were brown M&Ms because he hates them. He was angry because

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.880
 they were a tiny thing in a very big contract that he sent over because the Van Halen show was

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.920
 such a spectacle. It was such a massive event that most venues in America couldn't accommodate the

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.200
 kind of show that they were going to do, and so he would put in precise detail this has to be like

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.480
 this otherwise people may die, stages cause collapse or that sort of stuff, and if he found brown M&Ms

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.480
 inside that bowl, he knew that they hadn't read the contract properly. That's really interesting.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.280
 Of course, that's one reading that the contract hasn't been read properly, or the other reading is that

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.800
 the person who's in charge of setting up the stage so it doesn't collapse and kill people isn't

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:44.240
 also on M&Ms scouting duty. That's true, that's true. That's one of the great rock sort of stories,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.880
 and it's interesting that there was actually a guy concerned with health and safety behind putting

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.560
 him in the right direction. Yeah, he's been unfairly maligned if that's the case. Yeah, exactly.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.840
 Don't miss Adam to tell me this great story about Python's, the pythons when they were their first

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.680
 live tour, and they went to America I think, and they were having a storm out live tour, and they

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.360
 went to this hotel, and the manager said, "Gentlemen, as soon as you want to trash the hotel room then go

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.200
 right ahead, because they loved it, you know, because having the hotel room trash you've got massive

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:19.280
 publicity, and of course it's all insured anyway, but you've got the papers." And so the pythons being

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.960
 very polite, and British said, "No, no, that's quite necessary, don't need to trash anything, we're

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.080
 very happy. No, please sir, please trash the room." So, look, let me try with that, you know,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:34.640
 like start with this chair and all that stuff, so eventually after not wanting to do this,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.760
 Michael Palin kindly went into the bathroom and broke a toothbrush.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:49.200
 Okay, time for our final facts, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.880
 My fact is that the practice of dog owners pretending that they haven't seen

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:59.760
 their dog having a crap. It's technically known as strategic non-knowledge, and it's conducted by

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:07.040
 somebody who's genuinely called Dr. Gross. This old gross person, Matthew Gross, he's a German

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.080
 sociology professor, and he's spent 10 years following dog owners around at all different times of

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:20.480
 day observing them and seeing how they live. And so he decided that this is a new sort of aspect

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.520
 to what we do. We kind of, yeah, it's that there's a specific way of not knowing about something,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.000
 or deciding that you're not going to know about something happening because you think it's disgusting.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.560
 So, and he found out a lot of other things, so often before people actually do pick up their dogs

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.880
 poo, they will look over their shoulder and they will try and make sure that other people can see

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:47.840
 them doing the right thing, basically, or sometimes if they, if there's no one around or if they

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.920
 really don't want to, they'll start to put their hand in their pocket for a plastic bag or something

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.320
 and they'll take it out again. They just, they'll decide at the last minute, not to. Wow.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.360
 Andy, what is the thing about people doing the poop-a-scoop, putting it in the bag and then hanging

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:08.800
 it on a tree? What's that for? Well, he has a theory about this. Which is that it's a form of passive

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:15.440
 resistance that people are saying I don't, people are saying I know it's the right thing to pick this

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.840
 up, but I resent having to do it. Therefore, I'm going to leave it anonymously because he said he

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.720
 followed people for years and he never saw anyone leave it on a tree. Therefore, people must be leaving

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.960
 it when there's no one else around, but making sure that no one sees them doing it. Is it a form of

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.320
 decoration, maybe? Maybe it's making a double mark for their dog. So, the dog pisses on the tree

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.400
 below. He sticks the poo up. It's just a total, that's my dog's tree. And no matter how high your dog is,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.840
 they do, they do this thing that because obviously it's a big problem. Everyone hates the idea of

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:51.440
 seeing poo in the street. DNA dog testing is a new thing now, where they sample the poo and they can

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.320
 identify now whose dog it is. So, you can no longer, they're doing this in London, London is where

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.800
 it kind of started. It feels like it would really give you the DNA of whatever the dog's eaten,

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:10.080
 rather than the dog itself, isn't it? Yeah, that's true. A cow took a poo. A tin of pedigree

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:17.360
 charm has been defining the street again. That's true, but no. So, they now have 18,000 dogs when

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:26.320
 this article was published in the power of barking. And they've registered their DNA. So, if you find poo

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.040
 on the street now, you can take it in and they can go, okay, that's Mike's dog. I think I might just

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.080
 still leave it rather than take it in. Well, you get big time. Also, the fatal flaw in this is that

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.800
 because I think it's all voluntary, whether you submit your dog's DNA to this DNA database. So,

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.080
 it relies on the people who decided to go and submit their dog's DNA, then also being the kind

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.320
 of people who aren't going to pick up poo as a serious selection, but it's kind of problem here.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.600
 That is tricky. Why don't policemen have to get off their police horses and, you know,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:02.080
 with a shovel? Get a sack. Giant bin liner. Next to an enormous tree.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.560
 The guy who did this, Matthew Gross, he wanted, you asked about leaving things by a tree. He wanted to ask

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.160
 owners about the practice. And very bravely, he approached them and started asking them about it.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.680
 And apparently, in his own words, some of the friendlier comments included mind your own business.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:28.400
 And don't you have anything else to do? That reminds me of the study of the guy who

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:35.600
 cycled around a town on a unicycle and made a list of all the different comments that he got,

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 and something like two-thirds of them were something to be effected of was your other wheel.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:48.240
 So, I'm pretending not to know things. This is from a book called Why Everyone Else Is A Hippocrite,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.320
 which deals with some of these questions, like Anna was saying, of self-deception. So, I just

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.960
 wanted to quote a bit of it. So, there are lots of situations where if you don't know something,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.320
 you can avoid a situation, which is a lose-lose situation, just by pretending not to know or not to

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.440
 understand something. So, this is the line. If you see a building on fire and a small boy comes to

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.800
 tell you that a cat is caught in the window, your options are either to risk yourself to save the cat

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.000
 or take the reputational hit of neglecting or socially perceived duty to rescue the cat.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.600
 And then there's a footnote in the book where it says, you could kill the boy, but then you've got

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:33.120
 other problems. So, whereas if you simply pretend that you don't understand the language the boy is

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.560
 speaking, then you don't have to rescue the cat. You don't have to risk your life. Yeah, or kill the boy.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.960
 Or kill the boy. According to a survey commissioned by Samaritans quite recently,

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.320
 three times more men than women would pretend not to notice if a friend broke down in tears

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.480
 in front of them. Bloody hell. That takes a lot of not noticing.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.720
 Broke down in tears, not even just a little dribble and proper hysterical, crying fit. Three times more.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.240
 I mean, you can't say whether that's positive or negative though, because is it thoughtfulness

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.320
 for the person? I might well do that because you don't want to make the person feel uncomfortable.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.640
 It's true. You could go up to them and say they're there, or you could walk off, or you could kill them.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.120
 All of those would stop the cry. That will shut them up.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.920
 But I have noticed with British people, generally, this is one observation I picked up from being here,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.000
 is that if people are talking in a room and someone farts loudly, just people just continue talking.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.960
 They just walk over it. This is their own research, isn't it?

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.880
 Yeah. You may even have been noticing it would be conducting my study in the office for the last few years.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.880
 We've edited those all out of the book.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.960
 Yeah, pretending not to know stuff is huge, especially in Britain.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.120
 So, interestingly, because the scientists don't understand why we do lie though,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.920
 and I don't think it's as simple as we think. That's what they say.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:02.960
 So, there's this thing called smork, which is the simple model of rational crime,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.480
 which says that we lie for rational reasons. So, we lie when it's going to benefit us.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.440
 So, I five stolen something and then someone asked me if I've stolen something in a lie,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.080
 so I don't get in trouble. But actually, and I basically started the podcast just as I was in the middle

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.120
 of reading this. I didn't see examples, but it's this guy called Dan Ariely, who tested the smork principle.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.840
 And it's not true. We don't lie instinctively in a way that benefits us at all.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.520
 We lie in a way that says we want to present ourselves as a certain as something,

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.840
 or something that's to do with our own self-image. It's not to save ourselves from something.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.680
 So, we don't, I don't think we really know where we lie.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:39.680
 I think my favourite thing about lying is that very small children under the age of about four never lie,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.440
 because they think you can read their mind. Is that why?

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.040
 Because they think that that voice we all have in our head that we've got used to.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.480
 Small children just hear this as a kind of constant thing. They think, well, everybody,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.480
 but I can hear it. Everyone else must be able to hear it.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.800
 I can sort of, can't you remember, I can sort of remember thinking that.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.520
 I can remember being convinced that I could say which voice.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.040
 And if you're a manipulative parent, you could really use that to your advantage,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.680
 and show that the child never stole a biscuit again.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.040
 Or you could kill the boy, but then you'd have other people.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.840
 So chimpanzees can do this thing.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.960
 Sometimes if chimpanzee is foraging for food, he'll see something really tasty,

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.480
 and then just kind of what past it pretending he didn't see it,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.400
 just so that no other chimpanzee can see him kind of getting an eye on it.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.920
 Wow. Apparently sometimes a competitor chimpanzee will kind of notice what he's doing,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.760
 and then what past the pretending chimpanzee hide behind a tree,

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.400
 and then peep out to see if the pretending chimpanzee really does have some food after all.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.600
 The geniuses.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.240
 Yeah, I love it now, and then another animal apart from us has evolved nonchalants.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.480
 Yes, that's great.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:32:02.800
 No, no, don't get not a banana guy, not me. We should wrap up very quickly, because we should wrap it up.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.240
 Indeed, I think that's the message of this podcast, because we should be wrapped up and disposed on

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.000
 responses. I think we really need to wrap up and tie this podcast around the tree.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.800
 Actually, have you guys ever enjoyed your bowel movements?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.600
 Love them.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:22.800
 Yes or no? Do you enjoy your bowel movements?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.680
 This was a study done, actually, to test whether lions were more successful than they are,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.560
 and the way they did the study with these two scientists stayed up really late,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.680
 had a few drinks. This is in the '90s, I think.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.080
 Had a few drinks and said, "Okay, we need to ask people questions

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.600
 that we definitely know the answers, yes, but I bet people will lie about it."

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.560
 And so one of their questions was, "Do you enjoy your bowel movements?"

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.960
 And they were like, "Well, obviously everyone does."

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.440
 So if they say, "No, they're lions." And other questions in this study include it.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.440
 Have you ever doubted your sexual adequacy?

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.280
 Apparently, anyone who said no to that, they're going, "Oh, obviously, a lion."

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.480
 And have you ever thought about committing suicide to get back at somebody?

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.040
 Anyone who says no to that, they've got to be a lion.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.600
 That's how you tell, then you do this study.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.480
 Apparently, these scientists concluded we've all wanted to do this.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.800
 They're called Ruben Gur and Harold Sakaiin.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.840
 Wow. Wow.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.520
 I'm going to kill myself to get back at them.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.880
 Or I'll just have a nice poo first.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:25.440
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.280
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.640
 High five to Anna for asking her boss if he enjoys his bowel movements.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.320
 See you afterwards.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.240
 We could all be reached on our Twitter handles.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.480
