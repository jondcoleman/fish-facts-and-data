1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 We run it on QI a few years ago and which was there's no such thing as a fish.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,780
 It's not a nice such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,920
 No seriously it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,740
 He says it right up first paragraph no such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:27,740
 Okay hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you this time from Brussels, Belgium.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,860
 My name is Antraiva I'm sitting here with three of the regular elves.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,080
 It's Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and James Harkin and we also have a special guest this evening, the great Leven Skyra.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,280
 And once again we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,540
 Okay fact number one starting with you, Leven.

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:56,040
 Yes my fact is that apparently ants nest can get infested by ants.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:04,060
 On all ants nest infested by ants, that's why I definition it all the time they go where do they come from?

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,760
 No there's there's a very small species of ants and they're called a teeth ants.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,100
 They're smaller than a millimeter and they live inside the walls of the nests of bigger ants.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:25,980
 They just have small tunnels in the walls of ants nests and then they sit there and they wait and when there's food around and there's no soldier ants they sneak out, they steal the food and then they run back into the wall.

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,260
 And the bigger ants cannot follow them because the tunnels are too small.

16
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,960
 Wow that's ingenious. How big would I, one millimeter?

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,240
 Yeah a bit less than one millimeter, yeah wow.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,280
 Are the other ants like I don't know if I'm going crazy but I think we have an ant problem.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,520
 Yeah they put poison around and tell the children don't touch it.

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
 None of them can move.

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,360
 Yeah so hard to have a picnic in an ants nest.

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,180
 Yeah so what did they have a caught them?

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,700
 The theaf ants.

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,280
 Yeah no I just mean is it like a conspiracy theory in that world.

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,220
 They're like swear to God they're here.

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,220
 Look what was that bit of crumb I brought back. It's gone.

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,760
 Well I think every now and then one of these soldier ants will actually catch one and eat it.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:21,160
 Apparently you all may have one of these colonies of ants in your home and you won't know they're there because they're so small and they can get into sealed packages of food.

29
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,000
 Again because they are so small.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,920
 Wow I read that the smallest species of ants can are so small they could live inside the brain case of the largest species of ants.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 Wow that's cool.

32
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,200
 Like a colony of them could.

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,560
 There's one kind of ant called the acorn ant and they have an entire nest in one acorn.

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:51,120
 So there's this small animal it's called an acorn weevil very cute little bug and it eats the inside of acorns when there's still on the trees.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:03,160
 So it drills a little hole and then it sucks out the inside and then it falls down and so there's a hollow acorn on the ground with a small hole inside and that's where these acorn ants go in and they build an entire nest in one acorn.

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:20,060
 They're actually they can be found around Belgium and England so when you walk around and you see an oak and you just pick up acorns you look for for the ones that are in the wet ground and you crack them open like one in one hundred will have a small nest of acorn ants in it.

37
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,060
 Wow that's so cool.

38
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:35,900
 There's an ant isn't there? Is it Brunei ants that when they're threatened they're the ones that the worker ants are put on the front line and they explode their own heads so that they spill a sticky brain goo to slow down like this is trying to attack them.

39
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,420
 What they're like to suicide ant bombers?

40
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,420
 Yeah yeah come and cause the ants.

41
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
 Wow.

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,140
 There's a James and I we were talking about this on the train on the way for ants.

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,660
 Okay it's my favorite kind of ants.

44
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
 Okay so this is great.

45
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:53,340
 My favorite kind of ants are called door head ants and they're called door head ants because their heads are doors.

46
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
 Yeah what do you what do you have?

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
 Every door in your house.

48
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:08,620
 No they have this amazing flat head it's like a flat circle of their head and they use it to plug holes in trees and the other ants live inside that tree.

49
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
 What?

50
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,620
 Wait why do you need to plug a hole in it?

51
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:21,220
 The stuff like the people from coming in that's how doors work that's amazing but it's so funny because it's just one of those cases of your born and that's what you do.

52
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:31,460
 Like there's probably a door head ant sort of going oh I want to be a poet when I'm older dad or I'm afraid I'm sorry your father was a door, your brother was a door.

53
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
 Nothing else, not even a gate.

54
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:44,460
 So can I ask more about these tiny ants? Do they have any other homes outside of just infesting other nests or is it just a really charmed life?

55
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,460
 Well I think it's an easy life.

56
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,660
 I think they're also found outside of other nests but they're always looking for food and it's just the easiest thing.

57
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:03,260
 Some of them live next to an ants nest so not inside the walls but next to it and have just one small tunnel going to the other nest just to go back and forth every now and then to the shop.

58
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:14,260
 Have you heard there's a ant that has the quickest slam of doors of all the animal kingdom?

59
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
 I think it's the trap door.

60
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
 It's the trap door ant.

61
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,260
 A lot of door ants basically, door based ants.

62
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,260
 There's the swing door and the revolving door and that's good.

63
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:36,260
 What's really exciting about them is that they can slam really quickly. I think I wrote it down. It was something like 230 kilometers an hour.

64
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:49,260
 It's just really quick but what's really exciting is if they're being attacked they can use it as an escape mechanism by slamming their mouth into the ground and just launching themselves completely away from their prey.

65
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,260
 I think what they do is they kind of bite the floor and if the floor is hard enough then it fires them off.

66
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,260
 It's amazing. Lobsters can swim backwards but not forwards.

67
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,260
 What? Lobsters can walk.

68
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
 Oh, I remember they're doing backstroke.

69
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:14,260
 No, they can walk forwards but if they're in real trouble they flip their tail under them and that's really fast and that sort of jets water backwards and they are pushed back.

70
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,260
 So that's their escape mechanism but they can never use it to swim forwards. It's really tragic.

71
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:25,260
 They have one swim stroke. It's not yet anything they compete in. It's called escape.

72
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:34,260
 Apparently in Panama you can get ants to clean your house. So if you go out they're army ants in Panama so they all act on masks.

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:42,260
 Thousands and thousands of them in one ant army and if you leave your house at the right time so you know when it's army ant season then they come and they eat everything.

74
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:51,260
 So every crumb, every worm, every bit of dirt on your floor they eat it. So there are people in Panama who say we just go out for the day, come back at the end of the day, they've gone, everything is clean.

75
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,260
 They shouldn't make the canal like that, shouldn't they? Just put a line of ants down just to bite it.

76
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
 That would have been quite cool.

77
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
 We've got to start using them.

78
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
 I think that's high risk.

79
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
 Really?

80
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
 Yeah, personally.

81
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,260
 You've got to make sure all your foods in very, very safe places.

82
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,260
 Yeah, you're in trouble if you forget the dog of course.

83
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
 Yeah, you really are.

84
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
 You've got a skeleton.

85
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,260
 There's a lemon ant that tastes of lemon that I didn't know about.

86
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
 What?

87
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
 If you lick it, it tastes like lemon.

88
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,260
 How can you lick an ant, a single ant?

89
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,260
 You lick a bunch of them, you lick a lot of them.

90
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:32,260
 And they're really cool so they rely on these shrubs to survive as their homes and they're really good defenders of these shrubs so if any other plants try to grow around them then they kill them.

91
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
 So it's a really ideal kind of guard to have.

92
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,260
 Which I quite like, it's very loyal, very loyal.

93
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
 Are they any use for us for any drinks?

94
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
 No, unless you're a shrub.

95
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
 I haven't been suspected that about you.

96
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
 If life gives you lemon ants.

97
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
 Yeah.

98
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,260
 I'm still stuck on this door edge because I just love the idea that that's where he is all the time.

99
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,260
 And the only interaction he has is with the ants coming in and out.

100
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
 Hey Mike, how's it going?

101
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
 Yeah, pretty good.

102
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
 Yeah, are you having a good day mate?

103
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
 Yeah, catch your eye.

104
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,260
 Wait, so is he a species event?

105
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,260
 Yeah, it's, it's, are all the ants in the colony door-ents, but only some of them are used as actual doors.

106
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,260
 That's right, they're all cephalotes, ants.

107
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
 And yeah, only of some of them are used by doors, as doors, sorry.

108
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,260
 But some of them actually use their heads because they're kind of flattened around the top here.

109
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,260
 They can use them to float down if they want to jump out of a tree.

110
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,260
 It means that they won't, I mean, ants wouldn't die if they fell anyway.

111
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,260
 But it helps them to glide in whichever way they want.

112
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
 That's quite cool, isn't it?

113
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,260
 Yeah, they're also parachute ants. That's, that's, that's just bad marketing when you're both a door in a parachute.

114
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
 Don't call yourself a door.

115
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
 Call yourself a parachute.

116
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
 Parachute, yeah, much cooler, you're right.

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
 Branding, they need work on branding.

118
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,260
 Apparently the seagulls in the UK have started behaving quite badly this year.

119
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,260
 And it's because they've been eating red ants and the formic acid in red ants makes them drunk.

120
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,260
 And so seagulls have been crashing into buildings and they've been a bit more vicious stealing people's sandwiches.

121
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,260
 They've been flying out in front of cars and it's because they're all pissed.

122
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
 Sounds British to me.

123
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,260
 I was actually on drunk animals, which I know we mentioned, and we love.

124
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,260
 There was a story this week about Bohemian waxwing birds in Yukon in Canada.

125
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,260
 And they've been getting really drunk on fermented berries this year.

126
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:21,260
 So the National Park in Canada, Yukon Wildlife Sanctuary, has set up rehab centres for them.

127
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,260
 If you see one of these drunk birds, you've got to take it to the rehab centre and say it's a drunk bird.

128
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,260
 And they put it in this little cage and they let it sober up until it's responsible enough to be able to fly on its own again.

129
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,260
 That's amazing.

130
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
 You say they're eating berries?

131
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,260
 Yeah.

132
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,260
 Okay, so there's species of nematode worm that when it infects a certain type of ant,

133
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,260
 it makes that arse go bright red so it looks exactly like a berry.

134
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,260
 And so the birds come down and eat it and then get infected themselves, and then the nematode goes out of their TCs,

135
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
 and then it does a whole system.

136
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
 That's amazing.

137
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
 Yeah.

138
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
 That was really amazing.

139
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,260
 That's like the zombie ants, isn't it, which I think we've covered, and I love zombie ants.

140
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:07,260
 So zombie ants are the ones where there's a, what do you call it, not a mushroom, a fungus that spreads itself over the forest floor, doesn't it?

141
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,260
 And then it gets into the head of these ants and possesses them to climb high up the trees.

142
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,260
 And then they eat their brains from the inside out, so they die high up this tree.

143
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,260
 And then the fungus grows out of their brains and spreads itself over the forest floor again and the process starts all over again.

144
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,260
 You have another zombie ant that it's caused by the forest fly.

145
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,260
 So the forest fly, a very small fly, and it hovers over an ant, waits for the right moment,

146
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,260
 and then it dives down, and in the dive it puts an egg in the neck of the ant.

147
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,260
 And the egg will hatch, and the small larvae will start eating the brain.

148
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:48,260
 And this ant will just start walking straight forward, not returning to the nest, just walking, walking, walking.

149
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:57,260
 And when it has been walking long enough, the larvae will release a chemical that makes the neck solve away.

150
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,260
 So the head falls off.

151
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:07,260
 And then you have just an ant head lying there, and then the larvae will live there and eat, and then form a cocoon.

152
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,260
 And then it flies out as a new forest fly, and it returns to the nest and attacks a new ant.

153
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,260
 Oh my god, wow. Do they know about this? So they wear.

154
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,260
 I just wonder if you're like a quite balanced normal ant.

155
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,260
 You must be like, what the hell is going on here? This guy's just walked forward, he's come back, he's attacked us.

156
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,260
 This other guy thinks there's tiny little ants stealing our food.

157
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,260
 Make tastes of lemons.

158
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,260
 Frank's ass looks like a berry, this dude.

159
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,260
 We're out of control here.

160
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,260
 I just want to be a dog.

161
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,260
 Okay, we need to move on to fact number two, and that is Chazzynski.

162
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:52,260
 Yeah, my fact this week is that in Cambodia, a teenage girl's parents might build her a love hut,

163
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,260
 where her parents encourage her to sleep with as many boys as she wants until she finds the one that she likes.

164
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:05,260
 This is in the Krung, it's K-R-E-U-N-G Krung Krung tribe in Cambodia, which is in rural northern Cambodia.

165
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:13,260
 And basically when a girl turns about 13, it's between the ages of 13 and 15, her parents say, okay, we understand that you want to be getting to know boys now,

166
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,260
 and it's often embarrassing for the boys to come and visit your house when your parents are there.

167
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,260
 So their parents are traditional for the parents to build her, this love hut, which is removed from the house,

168
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,260
 away enough away, and she sleeps there, and boys come and visit her, and different boys come every night.

169
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,260
 So a lot of the girls say sometimes they just stare up and talk, but I guess you would say that when your parents ask.

170
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,260
 Sometimes, and they just do that until they find one who is their soulmate.

171
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,260
 And apparently they say it takes on average 10 boys for them to find their soulmate.

172
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
 So that's the average.

173
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,260
 I can see a bad Hollywood rom-com forming in your mind.

174
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,260
 Yeah, called lovehut, so it's got a good name as well.

175
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,260
 And you just know that Hugh Grant is going to be the 10 boys.

176
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,260
 Oh, there he is. The movie's going to be finished now.

177
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:11,260
 But also the fact that the parents build it themselves, and when it's finished, you get a tour.

178
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:18,260
 And your father is going like, "Yes, you know, I built this, and it's stable, and it'll sit on that bit, it creeps a bit down."

179
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,260
 Yeah, it's the exact opposite of what every other dad that I know would do.

180
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,260
 My dad would build that love hut for my sister, and then stand outside and try to kick the ass of every person.

181
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
 Yeah, with a shotgun.

182
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,260
 In the meantime, she's inviting boys into the house, you know.

183
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,260
 Look at my dad, he's still out there, no problem.

184
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,260
 I reckon he would build it with like the biggest, heaviest door ever, wouldn't he?

185
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
 Is there anything to stop them?

186
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,260
 Oh, my god, in the ant world, the door would be one ant that would never get asleep.

187
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
 Oh, that's nice.

188
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
 Hey, Mike, have fun in there. Hope she picks you.

189
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
 Okay. I'll keep her closed.

190
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
 Oh, no.

191
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:02,260
 Until the 18th century, most people slept twice per night, and they took a two hour break in between

192
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,260
 to smoke, have sex, or visit neighbours.

193
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
 Or all three.

194
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
 Just a wake-up.

195
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,260
 Well, what are three options again?

196
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
 I always forget.

197
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,260
 Which order should we do them tonight, dear?

198
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,260
 We haven't seen the neighbours for a while.

199
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:28,260
 They used to advise that the best time to make love was after your first sleep in the year

200
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
 where it was two sleeps a night.

201
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,260
 The scientist in the 17th century said the time it's going to be most productive and enjoyable

202
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,260
 after sleep number one.

203
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,260
 So it's first sleep, second sleep.

204
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
 It's because you're a bit refreshed.

205
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
 Yeah.

206
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
 Yeah, okay.

207
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,260
 It makes sense. It was when it got dark and no one had electricity and no one got afford candles.

208
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,260
 And so as soon as it got dark at eight in the evening, you just passed out and nothing else to do.

209
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,260
 And then you wake up at midnight and go, well...

210
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
 You reach out.

211
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,260
 Speaking of the darkness, do you know that people sleep 20 minutes longer on the night when there's a full moon

212
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
 compared to when there's not a full moon?

213
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
 No way.

214
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
 Yeah, way.

215
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260
 How come?

216
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:13,260
 I'm just speaking of lovehuts, I found out before Nintendo made video games, they had a bunch

217
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
 of other products.

218
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,260
 One of which was that Nintendo used to run love hotels.

219
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
 It was a love hotel.

220
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,260
 A love hotel is effectively a brothel, but done the Nintendo style.

221
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
 There are different levels.

222
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,260
 There's platforms, and we walk everywhere.

223
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,260
 Everyone dressed in someone order a plumber?

224
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
 Yeah.

225
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:46,260
 And they also like to give you a kind of sense of isolation and no contact with the people working in the actual hotel.

226
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,260
 They used to send the keys for rooms to you in the reception or in your room through pneumatic ice.

227
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
 Oh, like Mario.

228
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,260
 Like Mario, like the awesome green bit, and it's for couples, isn't it?

229
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
 It's for people who are in it.

230
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,260
 No, no, it's also for prostitution and so on.

231
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,260
 I miss that level in Super Mario, please.

232
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,260
 The keys get fed up to me so I can serve as my prostitute.

233
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
 Yeah, I don't remember that.

234
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,260
 I was in Tokyo last year, and there's a district which has a lot of these love hotels in.

235
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:25,260
 It's a really, they're all built in weird, fabulous styles, like medieval European castles, or one of them looks like a robot.

236
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,260
 They're bizarre buildings, and I was just, I stress I didn't enter any of them.

237
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,260
 The reason that they are popular is because the average Japanese flat is about two rooms.

238
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:45,260
 I mean, there are no lovehuts put it that way, and it's very difficult to have time as a couple by yourself.

239
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,260
 And often three generations of a family live in the same flat, and it's everyone's sort of right next to each other.

240
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,260
 So that it's kind of evolved out of the property market, basically, that's why it happens.

241
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:02,260
 So the reason I like the lovehuts is because it's like a real, it's an example, I guess, of gender roles being turned around a little bit.

242
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:09,260
 And so a anthropologist called Fiona McGregor went there and interviewed all generations, and they said the women are really independent,

243
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,260
 and they know exactly what they want, and there's a lot of equality and relationships between them.

244
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,260
 So I like examples of that. So there's the barry tribe of Venezuela and other South American tribes believe that children can have more than one father.

245
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:30,260
 So again, promiscuity in women is quite common, and they'll say, you know, you'll say who's your child's father, then she'll say, well, she was, it started with this guy,

246
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:38,260
 and then this guy came along a couple of months later, and the sperm sloshed together, which is what they think, and the child is sort of a combination of a bunch of men.

247
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:45,260
 So again, you know, promiscuity fine. You just wait till your dads get home, so you're in so much trouble.

248
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:52,260
 They used to think that the child would be able to get things from whoever they suckled from, didn't they?

249
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:02,260
 So they would think that a child, they would get a wet nurse who would be able to speak Greek in the hope that a child would suckle from that wet nurse and be able to speak Greek in the future.

250
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:15,260
 How did that go? I don't speak Greek. You could walk up to a very beautiful Greek woman, so I'd like to learn Greek.

251
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,260
 Guys, we need to move on. Does anyone have anything more they want to throw into this one?

252
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:35,260
 It was only in 2006 that the official Spanish siesta was cut down from three hours to one hour. Three hours until 2006 was the lunch break, but you'd stay awake until 10 in the evening, so it was also tough.

253
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:49,260
 Do you know they have world championships in siesta? No. How do you win? They have them in, they look for very loud places like shopping malls, and then they put beds there, and they just have the athletes come up,

254
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:58,260
 and they just have a countdown, and then go, "Nap!" and then the guy who follows a sleep fast and has the longest nap, he's the winner, he's the world champion in siesta.

255
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,260
 Wow, you could fake that.

256
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:08,260
 You can measure someone to sleep. I think they probably work out, it's not just the guy going, "Ah!"

257
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:24,260
 Okay, well, we should move on. Andy Murray. My fact is that the longest canyon in the world is 50% longer than the Grand Canyon, and we didn't know about it until August last year.

258
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:37,260
 How can that be the case? Well, it is buried under 1.9 miles of ice, so to be fair, but this is so cool. It's in Greenland, and the Grand Canyon is maybe

259
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:50,260
 280 miles long, and this one is 460 miles long, and it could be even bigger. But we didn't know about it because it's under this huge ice sheet, which is so heavy that it's turned Greenland into a bowl-shaped country.

260
00:19:50,260 --> 00:20:03,260
 For ages scientists had no idea why, if it's like a bowl with all this ice weighing down, surely there should be ice melting at the bottom, and there should be lakes under the ice sheet, but they aren't.

261
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:14,260
 And they couldn't find any with radar, so when they found this canyon, which goes towards the sea, they think, "Oh, this must be how the water has been getting out, and not causing the lakes to form."

262
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
 Wow. That's amazing.

263
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:23,260
 And last year, and no human has ever seen it, because when it happened, this canyon formed. It was 4 million years ago, and we didn't exist.

264
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:33,260
 Wow. Can we break the ice and have a look, get tourists there? I mean... If the ice goes, then the seas will rise by 7 meters, and we're all completely stuffed.

265
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,260
 Well, but that's a good question. What would happen if all the ice on Greenland would melt?

266
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:52,260
 So ice that is floating in seawater, when it melts, it doesn't make the sea level go up. But all the ice that is on land masses, such as Greenland and Antarctica, will make the sea level go up.

267
00:20:52,260 --> 00:21:00,260
 If you would only melt the ice that is on Greenland, then in Belgium and in England, nothing would change.

268
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:12,260
 And in Iceland, the sea level would go down by 3 meters, because this ice sheet has so much gravity that it pulls the water towards Greenland.

269
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,260
 And when you melt it, the water level around Greenland will go down, and then the rest of the world will go up.

270
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:27,260
 So, like, people like the seashells are screwed, or like Tuvalu, or Maldives, yeah, they're all screwed, but we're fine.

271
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:34,260
 Yeah, there's one problem, when the ice on Greenland melts, it probably starts melting to Antarctica, and that's what it looks like.

272
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
 Yeah, that is a problem.

273
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,260
 One thing I like about Greenland, is this in Greenland, right?

274
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:52,260
 So, Eric the Red was the guy who first founded, made a European settlement on Greenland, and the reason he did that was because he'd been expelled from Iceland in around 985 AD for murdering one of his neighbours.

275
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,260
 And the reason he lived in Iceland in the first place was because his father had been banished from Norway for committing an slaughter.

276
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:08,260
 So, his family was constantly murdering people. But his son, Leif Erickson, was actually the first European to land in North America, wasn't he?

277
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,260
 Yeah, wasn't he?

278
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,260
 And he settled in North America about 500 years before Columbus did landed on the North American continent, and then went back.

279
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:23,260
 But the reason, so I think this is really funny, the reason he could find it was because there was another guy in Iceland at the time whose father had moved to Greenland, and he wanted to find his father.

280
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:31,260
 So, he set sail for Greenland, not knowing where he was going, and he came across, so he'd had a description of Greenland, knew what he was looking for.

281
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:39,260
 He kept on seeing this kind of coast land, which was lots of forests and stuff, and then lots of verdant Greenland, and the other people on his boat kept saying, "Can we get off here? What is this?"

282
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:48,260
 And he was like, "No, we're going to Greenland." And he kept very detailed diaries of what it was, and it was North America, but he wouldn't let them get off, and he sailed off the whole coast of North America.

283
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:55,260
 Eventually arrived in Greenland, and Lee Ferguson was like, "You know that place, you saw... How did you find that?"

284
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,260
 But yeah, first guy to get to America.

285
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:03,260
 The tallest trees on Greenland are two inches high.

286
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
 Two inches!

287
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
 That doesn't really constitute a tree.

288
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
 It's a tree.

289
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,260
 You need to have a tree, because I think it's more than two inches.

290
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:21,260
 They say, they have the similar in Iceland, they have very small trees, and there's a joke that they say, is it like, "What do you do if you get lost in a forest in Iceland?"

291
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,260
 And the answer is stand up.

292
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
 That's very good.

293
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:36,260
 So they have birch trees that are about one meter high, but another fact about Greenland, there are no two towns in Greenland that are connected by road.

294
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,260
 Oh, you cannot drive to another town. You have to go by boat or fly. There's no roads between town.

295
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
 That is a pain.

296
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
 Yeah, it is.

297
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:53,260
 The other thing is about Greenland is if you look in a map, any kind of globe or whatever, you'll always have Newark, which is the capital, will always be on that map.

298
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
 So we'll probably go thup, so a few other places.

299
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:03,260
 Newark is the largest place. It's 19,000 people live there, which would be a village in the UK, but it's still on every globe.

300
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,260
 It's a tiny, tiny place where it's still on every globe, but you'd find.

301
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
 It's quite that quite interesting.

302
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:16,260
 And if you look at the 11th most populous city in the world is somewhere in China, that's on no globes, because it's right next to Hong Kong.

303
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
 So why would you put it on?

304
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,260
 And that's got like probably, I don't know, 50 million people living there, not on any globes.

305
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,260
 And then this place has got 10,000, 19,000, and it's on every globe.

306
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
 It's quite cool, that.

307
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:37,260
 There's a place the most northerly point of Greenland is called a coffee club island, and it was named by a guy in honor of his coffee club back in Denmark.

308
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
 I think he's Danish.

309
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,260
 He was called Large Cock.

310
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
 What?

311
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,260
 I know he was.

312
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
 What's he?

313
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,260
 No, he was called Laoga Cock, but I'm going to call him Large Cock.

314
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,260
 Yeah, I'm sure everyone at school did as well.

315
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,260
 And he found this place. He called it Coffee Club Island.

316
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,260
 It's right in the northern tip. It's another most point of land on all of Earth.

317
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:05,260
 It became quite famous, and then someone else went to look at it a few days later and found that there was actually another bit of land just over there.

318
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,260
 And it had been underwater when he'd been there, because the tide was so high.

319
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260
 Wow.

320
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,260
 But the other place doesn't really have a name, they call it Starbucks.

321
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
 Of course, Starbucks, that will go over.

322
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:22,260
 Coffee Club Island, where you could just, those are the days where you could just go and call things after your local reading club bays.

323
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:33,260
 The place where, when they first went to Greenland, the only bay that was good for fishing, the two settlements fished in, was called Disco Bay, which I quite like.

324
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
 Oh, that's great.

325
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
 This sounds like a fun place.

326
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
 Yeah.

327
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,260
 Was it named after anything?

328
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,260
 No, it's in the language, so I guess.

329
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,260
 Disco is Latin, but I can't remember what for.

330
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
 It's not related to that.

331
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:53,260
 It's a Viking talk of the 10th century, if I don't know if you're fluent there.

332
00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:02,260
 Disco is short for Disco Tech, and that was named after Bibliotech, which is French for a library, and it was named because it's a place where you have discs like records.

333
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,260
 So Disco Tech, as a Bibliotech is books, and Disco Tech is Disco.

334
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,260
 So actually, a Disco Tech should be a place where everybody has to be quite looking at vinyl, you know.

335
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,260
 Have you seen the Beatles albums?

336
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
 Okay, speaking of Beatles, while we're on that.

337
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:27,260
 And Canyon, as we were, there's a canyon in America, which I haven't written down the name of it, but there was a guy in America who was walking down there who's called James Richards.

338
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:40,260
 And when he was walking down the canyon, he tripped and he fell down quite a long way down the canyon, knocked himself unconscious, and he says that he then woke up in a parallel universe where the Beatles never broke up.

339
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,260
 There was a man called Jonas there, who told him all about what happened with the Beatles.

340
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:57,260
 And when he returned to our world, he brought one of their tapes with him, and he has a website where he has the music of the Beatles, because they never broke up in this parallel world.

341
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,260
 Oh yeah, how were they good after they didn't break up?

342
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,260
 Did they sound like a lunatic in the desert?

343
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,260
 And one of the Beatles started as the quarry men.

344
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:17,260
 And one of the members, Pete Shotin, he went on to become John Lennon and Yoko Ono's personal assistant.

345
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:25,260
 And years ago, there was an official biography by guy called Hunter Davies, who wrote about the Beatles in their time, and he went and he revisited all these original characters from the Beatles.

346
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:36,260
 Pete Shotin now lives on an island, somewhere off England, and he, when he was asked by Hunter Davies, how you doing? He said, "I'm really good. I'm actually back in contact with John."

347
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:43,260
 And they were, "What do you mean?" And he said, "I had an American medium come, and she got me back in contact with John, and we're writing songs again."

348
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:51,260
 He, by the way, in the quarry men, was the guy who played the washboard, not even an instrument. That's literally a kitchen item.

349
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,260
 Nobody does a washboard like Pete, if he was from Birmingham.

350
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:04,260
 Can I just on the subject of canyons? Because when I think of canyons, I think of Grand Canyon, and I immediately think of Evil Can Evil.

351
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:11,260
 And Evil Can Evil is extraordinary, because as far as I can tell from reading his career, we all know Evil Can Evil, right?

352
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:17,260
 The guy who tried to jump the Grand Canyon. He also was just one of the great stunt bike people of all time.

353
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:25,260
 Most people came, it turns out, just to watch him fail every time. And every single thing that he did, it was like, "Which bit do we want him to fall on?"

354
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,260
 So, one of his first, so actually he started doing stunts for Hunter.

355
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,260
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. So why did people want him to fail?

356
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:39,260
 Because he kept surviving. So it was just fun to watch a man go, "I'm jumping over two mountain lions, and a cargo of rattlesnakes."

357
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,260
 And when he goes, he pulls into the rattlesnakes, and they all cheer. And that genuinely happens.

358
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:51,260
 Because this man can't die, it's fine. This is the weird fact about Evil Can Evil. He practiced crashing more than he did landing.

359
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,260
 Well, that explains his problem.

360
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:08,260
 He was an interesting character. I mean, he used to carry a cane around, and he carried inside the cane while Turkey, the alcohol, and he would drink it from his cane directly, and no one would see.

361
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:14,260
 What's he doing for later in that cane?

362
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:20,260
 I'm not an especially observant person, but if I saw someone walking with a cane and then drink from it, I think I would sit up.

363
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,260
 Did he do that while he was riding? He was getting drunk while he was doing it.

364
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,260
 That's why he kept crashing. He kept trying to get the lid off the cane.

365
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:33,260
 There's an American car guy from the Indy 500, or whatever, called Dick Trickle. I always remember his name.

366
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:40,260
 I don't know why I remember his name. He liked to smoke, and it must have been in the 50s or something.

367
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:49,260
 He had a helmet, but he wanted to smoke while he was riding, so he would drill a hole in his helmet, so he could get the cigarette through there, so he could smoke while he was driving.

368
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:56,260
 I always wanted to run on QI. Why did Dick Trickle have a hole in his helmet? But they never let me do it.

369
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:03,260
 And we never will. In the Grand Canyon, do you know one of the most common cause of death is?

370
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
 Falling. Sort of.

371
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,260
 Not having enough strength on it. No, so I would have thought that it's playing crashes. It's weirdly common.

372
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:21,260
 In fact, so the reason the Federal Aviation Administration in America was set up, so I guess a safety overseer of air flights was because of the Grand Canyon,

373
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,260
 and there were two commercial flights used to detour to go over the Grand Canyon, so people were going to have a quick look, so they were doing flights, I think, in 1956.

374
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:38,260
 They provided. But also, I think it's a bit of a risk with the canyon. The air flow goes downwards, and so they have to clear airspace sometimes around the canyon now.

375
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:49,260
 So the biggest diamond mine in the world, which is somewhere in Africa, has airspace cleared around it because the downwards flow has pulled a bunch of helicopters into it.

376
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
 Let's say a bunch, too.

377
00:30:51,260 --> 00:31:00,260
 It's enough to say, actually, let's not do this anymore. That's a planet eating helicopters.

378
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,260
 Well, guys, we need to move on, by the way.

379
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:12,260
 I mean, I just wanted to say, the scariest crater in the world is in Turkmenistan, and do you guys know about this? The Davaza Crater, which is also called the Daughter Hell.

380
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:18,260
 Yeah, it's so terrifying. So it's where the Soviets were doing experiments there in, they were drilling for gas in the 1970s,

381
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:25,260
 and there was a leak, and essentially what happens was, not just gases leaked out, and it set fire, and it's been burning ever since.

382
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:32,260
 So for 40 years, 45 years now, it's been constantly on fire, and it's its huge crater, and a guy descended into it last year.

383
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,260
 George Corunus had to wear a kev last suit and sort of ab sailed down into it.

384
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,260
 And he said that he didn't know why anyone else hadn't done it before, because once you're there, there are no restrictions.

385
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,260
 If you can find the right place, you can drive out, up, get out of your car, walk over the edge, and jump right in, if you want.

386
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,260
 The choice is yours. I'm so far the only person who's actually done that.

387
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,260
 I would have thought no one had done it, because it's constantly on fire.

388
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
 Yeah.

389
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:05,260
 Can I really quickly tell you about the first ever expedition through the Grand Canyon, was by the American explorer Powell.

390
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:15,260
 And he was an incredible explorer, he had just one arm, he lost his other one in the Civil War, never mentioned it, but they took four boats, and 10 men went on this expedition.

391
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,260
 Four of them died on the expedition.

392
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,260
 They had to throw food overboard, they lost boats, it was a terrible thing.

393
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:32,260
 On the first day, they threw away 200 kilos of bacon, because they thought it was slowing them down, and by the end they were eating moldy flour, because they had no food left.

394
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:44,260
 And the boats were called, these were the four names of the boats, made of the canyon, Emma Dean, Kitty Clyde's sister, and no name.

395
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,260
 Just evidently that meeting, they just ran out of ideas after the first three.

396
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
 Come on, let's go ahead.

397
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,260
 We've been here for four hours, we must be able to think of one more, let's just go with no name.

398
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:03,260
 Okay, let's move on, okay, time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

399
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:12,260
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 2008, the University of Bath invented a 3D printer that could print a copy of itself.

400
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:22,260
 Within three minutes, that copy had copied itself to make a third copy, and today nobody knows how many of these printers exist in the world.

401
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,260
 But they're going to take it over, aren't they? Oh yeah, they're going to print us to that.

402
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
 What a way to go.

403
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:38,260
 This is one of the end of the world's scenarios, it's called the Grey Goo, and it's not about 3D printers, but it's about nano robots.

404
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,260
 So I think it was already mentioned by Feynman in the 60s.

405
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:50,260
 They were thinking about nano robots that could reproduce themselves, because of course, nano bots are so small, you need millions of them.

406
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:59,260
 Let's just build one that builds the others, and then they had this idea like, okay, what if they break out of the laboratory, and they just start collecting stuff.

407
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:10,260
 And so one of the end of the world's scenarios is that there would be some research center turning into a Grey Goo of nano robots, and it was just spread all over the world until we were a big bowl of nano robots.

408
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:22,260
 So they feed up carbon, so they start eating all of us as well. I read a quote by someone saying that mankind's last great invention will be the first self-replicating intelligent machine.

409
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:31,260
 Basically, that's the end of us. But the idea with the Grey Goo is actually they would have to get their energy from somewhere, so unless they could somehow be solar panel probably will probably be okay.

410
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,260
 Yeah, but we have invented the solar panel James, I don't want to worry you.

411
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:45,260
 We've given them their tools. They're going to get their energy chemically, you know, like we digest food. Once they figured out, well, once we figured out how to build them that way, then we're doomed.

412
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,260
 That's just not figure it out.

413
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:59,260
 There is, there are some researchers, I'm not sure where they are, who have come up with this machine, and they programmed it to get across a certain bit of land, which has got bumps or whatever.

414
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:12,260
 They 3D printed it, they made it walk, and then when it got somewhere or broke or whatever, then they fed that back into the computer and let it re-work itself out to try and make it a little bit better and a little bit better and a little bit better.

415
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,260
 And that's kind of like a way of making evolution through computers, and that's happening right now, right?

416
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
 Yeah, absolutely.

417
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:29,260
 Just so very quickly on the printer, so they've built a printer that can replicate itself. Sounds like it's really quick, and they sold that, and then someone else's replicated one.

418
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:41,260
 Yeah, so the idea is that they've sold a thousand of these printers that can print other 3D printers, and they assume that if you've bought one, you're probably making some yourself, and then you've probably given them to someone else, et cetera, et cetera.

419
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,260
 So they don't know how many of the extra ones have been made. This was in 2008.

420
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:52,260
 Because I was visiting, we have a very big 3D printing company here in Belgium called Materialize, and they do amazing stuff.

421
00:35:52,260 --> 00:36:02,260
 And I was visiting them, and one of the great things they do is when a surgeon has to operate on a broken bone, he does the operation completely in virtual reality.

422
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:14,260
 So they take a scan of the bone, and then he puts it in the computer, and then he's just looking in the computer how to fit them back together, what the best points are to drill in the bones and put the titanium plate on it.

423
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:20,260
 And then they treat deep print a template that he can use when he does the operation, so he can do the operation super quick.

424
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:27,260
 Just opening it up, clicking the plastic parts on the bone, pushing them together, and the hole where he has to drill, are already there.

425
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,260
 So he just goes, click, click, puts it together, drill, drill, the screws inside, and he's finished, and everything was prepared in the computer.

426
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:44,260
 It's like an IKEA broken bone up already. It's like a IKEA, that's good. Five hours later. I think we're missing one part.

427
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:53,260
 Someone had a skull printed, didn't they? 3D printed a skull, but this is a weird thing that's been done with 3D printers in Japan.

428
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:01,260
 They're having their fetuses 3D printed, so if you want to meet your baby before it comes out of you, you ask for a 3D printout.

429
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,260
 If anybody $800 for your fetus and it's 3D printed in a little see-through books, wow.

430
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,260
 When will we be able to 3D print a person, an actual living person?

431
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,260
 I don't have a key on a read. Sorry, no, they genuinely have 3D printed a key on a read.

432
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,260
 No, but I want a proper one. I'm like a real human.

433
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,260
 Yeah, I want a working key. I don't want to work a key on a read.

434
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:36,260
 There were two life-size mannequins of two guys who were looking for girlfriends. Match.com, an online dating site, did 3D printouts of those guys that looked exactly like them, didn't look anything like them.

435
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:42,260
 They put them in a shop window and the idea was that women would walk past and go, "Oh, I like the look of him."

436
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
 Do they remain single?

437
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,260
 I don't know, but yeah, I guess so.

438
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:55,260
 Anna, you were talking about Japan and the fetus thing. There was a Japanese lady called Megumi Igarashi.

439
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:02,260
 She was arrested quite recently for distributing data that allowed recipients to make 3D prints of her genitals.

440
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,260
 And what she wanted to do was to model a kayak in the shape of her genitals.

441
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,260
 What?

442
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,260
 She's an artist.

443
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,260
 That's no excuse.

444
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:24,260
 Her art is all about her body and making it more kayak-like.

445
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,260
 Which is weird, actually. I just remember the word kayak means men's boats.

446
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
 Oh, yeah.

447
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:38,260
 And there is another word for women's boats. So in the Olympics, the kayak should only be a men's event and they should have a different name for the women's events.

448
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,260
 All the Eskimos are watching your limbically.

449
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
 Women in the kayak.

450
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,260
 He's not a very feminine.

451
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:56,260
 James is letter writing campaigns saying, "Women should not be allowed to take part in the kayak event."

452
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,260
 So what's the resolution of the story?

453
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,260
 Oh, she was let go. Yeah, they arrested her and then they said, "Actually, we can't really arrest you for this."

454
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,260
 And then the publicity for the government, so they let her go.

455
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
 What kayak?

456
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,260
 Because it's one of the right shape, yes.

457
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
 Well, here in Belgium, you have me.

458
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,260
 Thank you for seeing a doctor around me.

459
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,260
 Let's move on.

460
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
 By the way, my favourite headlight of the week.

461
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,260
 I read it in the 40s and times just that you just mentioned arrest.

462
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
 Made me think of it.

463
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,260
 The headline was, "Police say quadruple amputee is armed and on the run."

464
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:41,260
 So initially, it was about 3D printed guitars.

465
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,260
 Yes, so no, actually, this fact is about 3D printers making themselves.

466
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,260
 But originally, my fact was going to be that the band claxons are doing a tour at the moment.

467
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,260
 And all the guitars are made from 3D printers, which I think is pretty cool.

468
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
 That's really cool.

469
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
 Why did they do that? Just because it's cool.

470
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
 Well, they are cool.

471
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,260
 Hey, are they having a printed jam? That's a very cool one.

472
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
 Thank you.

473
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,260
 No, they said earlier this year that they were going to do it, but they didn't think it was possible.

474
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,260
 And then some guys from the University of Sheffield, I think it was, came in and said,

475
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
 "Actually, we can do that."

476
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,260
 And they've made these 3D printed guitars, apparently, they're really good.

477
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:27,260
 There's a firm in America which will 3D print based on lots of photos of you and measurements,

478
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:33,260
 a model of your head, which is for your loved ones to keep your ashes in after you die.

479
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,260
 It's really, really creepy. It's so strange.

480
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,260
 And it says, hang on, there's a line from the company on the website.

481
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,260
 You will never again have to worry that you might forget what your loved one looked like.

482
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:52,260
 When you invest in one of these custom-made, very life-like cremation earns.

483
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,260
 Because we're all looking at photos of our loved ones going, "But what do they look like?"

484
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,260
 Do you know NASA has started investing in 3D printers?

485
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,260
 I'm not surprised.

486
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,260
 But what's really interesting is it's not just for items, because I think they already do that,

487
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,260
 where they print out stuff that they can use on the International Space Station and so on.

488
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,260
 They've started doing it for food, so they've started printing pizzas.

489
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:23,260
 But what's amazing is it actually, it looks like it's going to work and they're going to start feeding astronauts with this pizza.

490
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,260
 And it says that you can, it takes seven minutes to print a pizza.

491
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,260
 It takes less than that to make a pizza though.

492
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,260
 You're in space.

493
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,260
 And then it goes like, "We're sorry, but the tomato cartage ran out."

494
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,260
 And you go, "Oh god, you're putting a new cartage. I have to print a template now."

495
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,260
 And then you've got a whole new sort of green bluish pizza coming out.

496
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
 Throw it away, a new one.

497
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,260
 But then someone's working on a digital cookbook now for 3D printing.

498
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,260
 Yeah, yeah, it's going to be a thing. That's our future.

499
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,260
 Well, I have a bit of news for you. When you buy pancakes in the supermarket, they are printed.

500
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,260
 What? No pancakes in the supermarket are printed.

501
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:15,260
 What do you do with that? Of course, it's just in a factory. There's this big line running around entering the ovens.

502
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,260
 And the ink is coming out of extruders and they just print it on the...

503
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,260
 It would be easier for the companies now to make square pancakes, but nobody would buy them.

504
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,260
 The only reason they are around is because we're used to round pancakes.

505
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:35,260
 But they can even make them with your name, you know, big, long pancake that writes your name.

506
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,260
 Wow. Pancakes are printed, yeah.

507
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
 So I think they need to stop using the word "printed." That's the problem, isn't it?

508
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,260
 Because we don't trust printers. We need to come up with a better word.

509
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,260
 Because they're printing organs now, or they think they're the very close to printing organs.

510
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,260
 So they've been having trouble with capillaries, I think, at the moment.

511
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,260
 But we can print tissue and yeah, functioning, functioning blood vessels.

512
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,260
 But we know that printers screw up all the time.

513
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,260
 What if you get the wrong printer as well and you print out your thesis on the pancake maker?

514
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,260
 And then the dog literally eats your homework.

515
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,260
 That's gonna be a new thing.

516
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,260
 We need to wrap up guys, do you?

517
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,260
 Yeah, if you want to throw in.

518
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,260
 We were talking about having medical operations and guitars.

519
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,260
 This is where I went.

520
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,260
 Does anyone watch True Detective? Does anyone see True Detective?

521
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,260
 One of the guys in that, he's also in CSI, recently played the guitar during brain surgery.

522
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,260
 And so he's one of those.

523
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,260
 And he did this Reddit AMA, but we just quickly described that.

524
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,260
 So when you're having brain surgery done, they need to know that everything's working properly.

525
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,260
 And so the way that some people do it, if you play guitar, is they'll be cutting your brain open the back,

526
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,260
 and you'll be playing the guitar the whole time.

527
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,260
 And if they make any mistakes, then you'll do something wrong with the guitar playing,

528
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,260
 so they'll know that there's a mistake.

529
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,260
 Yeah. And he did an AMA on Reddit, like an ask me anything on Reddit.

530
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,260
 And first of all, I found it really weird, because maybe the first 50 questions were,

531
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
 what was it like to work with Matthew McConaughey?

532
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,260
 How did you find True Detective?

533
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,260
 Did you find you could identify with a character?

534
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,260
 And I had to do a command F for surgery, finally.

535
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,260
 But yeah, he described it as the worst thing ever, apparently.

536
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,260
 So if you ever thought brain surgery was gonna be fun.

537
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,260
 And he was asked to describe it further, and he said, sorry, it's like nothing else I know to compare it to.

538
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,260
 It's kind of like, I'm in this club of brain surgery people,

539
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,260
 and we're the only ones that understand it.

540
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,260
 I think that's quite a cool club.

541
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,260
 Wow.

542
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,260
 I think it was a Dutch brain surgeon who told that he had a similar operation,

543
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,260
 like somebody staying conscious just to see if they didn't do anything wrong.

544
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,260
 And they were working in the brain, and suddenly he said, hey, touch that bit again.

545
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,260
 And they said, what? Yeah, he said, the song "November Reen of Guns and Roses" is right there.

546
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,260
 What?

547
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,260
 Yeah.

548
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,260
 And so they said, touch it again, and they touched it.

549
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,260
 So yeah, I'm hearing it now.

550
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,260
 No.

551
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,260
 Yeah, and this guy told this story, and then afterwards his colleague said,

552
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,260
 like, why didn't you cut it out? It's a horrible song.

553
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
 Yeah.

554
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:12,260
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

555
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,260
 Thanks so much, you guys, for coming here today.

556
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,260
 If you want to get through to any of us to talk about the facts,

557
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,260
 if you're listening at home, you can get us on our Twitter,

558
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,260
 which is @QIPodcast, or you can get us all individually.

559
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,260
 I'm on @Sriberland.

560
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,260
 Leaven.

561
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,260
 Leaven's here to James.

562
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,260
 Ads, eggshapes.

563
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,260
 Andy.

564
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,260
 Andrew Hunter M.

565
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,260
 And Anna.

 You can email podcast@QI.com.

567
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,260
 Yep.

568
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,260
 And we're going to be back again next week with another episode.

569
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,260
 We just want to say thanks to the Atomium and Brussels Belgium.

570
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,260
 This has been amazing.

571
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,260
 Also, the free University of Brussels, who've helped us set up this whole thing.

572
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,260
 And to Nerdland, the new "Leavensky" or TV show,

573
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,260
 which is going to be premiering in Belgium on February.

574
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,260
 And yeah, we're going to be back again next week with another episode.

575
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,260
 And no such thing as a fish.

576
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,260
 Thanks so much. See you later. Goodbye.

577
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:08,260
 [Applause]

578
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,260
