00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Little Fish. We've been so happy to get

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,760
 a message just from you guys to say that you've been enjoying this show and we certainly

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,520
 enjoy making it. It's a little bit more loose, a little bit more silly than the normal

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,120
 shows, but we really, really love getting your facts so please do keep sending those in.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,480
 The reason I've disturbed the start of your show today is because I want to tell you about

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,920
 a quiz that we're doing. It is for Patreon subscribers on the top tier and it will take

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,200
 place on the 23rd of January at 7pm UK time, so that will be sometime in the afternoon

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,400
 if you're in North America and it will be very early in the morning if you're in Australia

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,400
 or New Zealand, but hopefully you will still be able to join us. It's going to be a whole

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,760
 load of fun. We've got loads of amazing stuff planned for you and if you are not a member

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,440
 of Patreon right now, then you have to go to patreon.com/nosusthingsaffish and join

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,520
 our top tier. You could probably just do it for a month and then quit if you just want

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,880
 to do the quiz, but honestly, there's so much good stuff on our Patreon that I really think

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,720
 once you join you will be hooked because we have extra content, we have merch, we have

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,960
 video content, there's all sorts of stuff on there. We hope we've made it value for money

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,960
 because people going on there help to support the podcast so it is a real good mutual

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,240
 benefit thing. Anyway, enough of that. Really hope you enjoyed this episode of Little Fish.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:46,320
 Hi, I'm Robonnie. Listen, Andy's got a cold and it's actually a really bad one. I've had

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,160
 a super sniffle. Hi everybody, welcome to Little Fish. This is our audience fact show,

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,760
 so never mind our boring old facts. It's time for your boring old facts instead. You've been

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,080
 sending them into podcast@QI.com and we've been reading them, collating them, winnowing them,

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,280
 doing extra research on them, and here are your best facts from the last seven days. So

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,640
 let's go. What you can't see listener is the most British thing is happening in the

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,920
 background. As Andy is introducing the show, he's pouring himself a thermos of tea. Yes,

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,680
 we're recording this on apparently my Duke of Edinburgh. I thought it was incredible how

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,360
 you multitasked there. Thank you very much. Because actually, I think the listener wouldn't have

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,160
 been able to tell he was pouring that tea until you mentioned it. Yeah, there you go. Well,

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,640
 thank you very much. Yeah. But look, enough of this, enough of this banter. Let's have some

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,440
 factor. Let's have some facts. Who would like to start? We got sent in a fact by Alex Hors

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,800
 and Alex says, Nazi propaganda in the 1930s relied heavily on an Englishman called Dick Seaman.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,960
 You had such a bad time in the English public school system that he just turned.

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,320
 Why would you give someone a name like that? You'd think his dad would have learned. Given the

33
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,240
 fact he was called William Seaman, Willie Seaman, come on. Good Lord. Come on indeed.

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,840
 So this is Richard Dick Seaman. He was a British racing driver and he was signed by the state-backed

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,840
 Mercedes team in the mid-1930s to race in the precursor to what is modern F1. And he was appointed

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,200
 as a non-German to be part of the team. He was signed off by Goebbels who showed him to Hitler,

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,680
 Hitler loved him. Hitler thought he was amazing. In fact, when he died and sadly Dick Seaman did die

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,400
 in a crash during a race, Hitler sent the biggest bouquet of flowers to the funeral. So so Hitler.

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,080
 I it is really. Oh, I've got to send the biggest bouquet of flowers. Do you know what I mean? Just show

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,040
 you off. He's the kind of person that you know like if someone does a sponsored swim and everyone

41
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,480
 sponsors you for five pounds, he would do six pounds. Yeah, he is. Oh God. I knew I didn't like him,

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,200
 but that's really taking it to a new territory. Interesting facts about Seaman. Yeah. I mentioned in

43
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,320
 an earlier, I think it was a little fish about a football team in Indonesia or the Philippines called

44
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:20,520
 Seaman Pandang. Yes. And I said that the name Seaman came from a cement company. Oh yeah. And someone

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:28,760
 messaged me on Instagram. It was Lars Van Toff. And Lars said that they lived in Bali most of their

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:37,560
 life and they they can tell me that the word Seaman means cement in Indonesia. So it's not a brand name.

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,120
 Yeah. It's just a generic word for the cement. So whatever this person ever had to buy cement

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,880
 because they were an English speaker, they thought it was very a music. Yeah. As you would. Just while

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,240
 we're on sports and fascism and the 1930s, who knew it was going to go in this direction? Who knew

50
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,840
 I list there is had such a niche knowledge base. Well, Stefan Barrett and Mark Norman have both sent

51
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,360
 in a brilliant fact. So Stefan, I'll start with Stefan. Stefan says infamous right wing dictator

52
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:12,120
 Benito Mussolini's great grandson, Romano Floriani Mussolini is a professional footballer who plays on

53
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,680
 and he guesses. Sorry, on the right wing. Oh, yes. Okay. And at a good level too, apparently

54
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,840
 in the the top Italian league. Really? Serious. Serious. Ah, that's right. And Mark, Ed's,

55
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,760
 Mark says that fact as well and says just a trivial thing I found amusing when I was told it.

56
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,320
 I'm sure he's a lovely person and it does state on his Wikipedia that he has no interest in politics.

57
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 Cool. Interesting. I've been feeling that Gaddafi's son might have played professional football.

58
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,960
 Really? At a relatively high level, maybe Seria Bay or something. Yeah.

59
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,720
 Thing. Can I be wrong about that? Here's a fact from Scott Parsons who writes that they work in

60
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,680
 clinical trials and thought we would like to know some of the papers that Scott has come across

61
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:07,080
 over the years. So he found that the half life of communal teaspoons is 42. So if you have a

62
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,760
 load of teaspoons in the office, then after 42 days, half of them will have disappeared.

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,000
 Interesting. That is interesting. And it breaks over an old wound for us, which we don't need to get

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,440
 into now. I still don't understand how I got involved in that controversy because you kept putting

65
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,240
 the spoons in the bin. I think it was there were no forks or knives. It was one of them. All I did

66
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,240
 was jump in saying, hey, it could have been any one of us so that whoever did it would feel,

67
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,800
 ah, okay, it's not a problem to admit to it. You know knives out. Yeah. The first ever mystery that

68
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,800
 Benoit Blanc solved was what happened to the knives in the QI office and that's how that series

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,920
 got its name. Yeah. There we go. And was I was I fingered by Benoit Blanc? It was it was cut

70
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:02,520
 from the final code that scene. But they also so Scott also found that if you need a problem to be

71
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,040
 solved quickly, brain surgeons are better than rocket scientists. Really? It's interesting to

72
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,640
 study because as that whole speaking of popular culture, as we were, there's that Michelin web

73
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,440
 sketches and the word their brain surgeon meets the rocket scientist. This is very good. But what

74
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 do you reckon is brain brain surgery or rocket science? I feel like brain surgery is harder. Because

75
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,160
 it's more fiddly. I think it's largely machines these days. So I think rocket science. What do you

76
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,800
 think rocket science is? It's one of the last sort of craftsmen. Yeah. What do you think they're

77
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 hearing those from Timber? Do you? It's an old nut in Italy makes it from Willow. It's mostly machines

78
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,320
 these days. I think brain surgery is largely you're you're not necessarily going in with your hands

79
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,560
 anymore. You program it, don't you? Yeah. Then you just press button one. Yeah. It's a bit it's

80
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,640
 no harder than playing Street Fighter these days. Yeah. Yeah. When in doubt, just mash all the buttons

81
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,720
 and that'll probably do something. It'll definitely do something. If it shouts finish him, you know

82
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,960
 you've done something wrong. So brain surgery in the UK, you need to do a five year medical degree

83
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,160
 then two years of foundation training, then at least eight more years of neurosurgical training

84
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,120
 whereas to be a rocket scientist, you need to do your degree, but then you could do an apprenticeship

85
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,120
 after that and go straight into the industry. So you need to do a lot more studying to be a brain

86
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,920
 surgeon. Okay. Interesting. There's got to be levels of rocket scientist. You start off

87
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:36,840
 making tea and just chatting with rockets on it. T minus five, T minus four. Come on. Please.

88
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:45,880
 I'm going to take the rest of the day off. That's it. I got a good one here. Yeah. From Alex Hartley.

89
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:54,200
 Oh. Who says the guy from Millie Vanillie. Where's Guy there were two? Well, there were two

90
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,280
 of them one sadly passed away now, but the other one. Who were they by the way? Just for more

91
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,080
 concepts. Millie Vanillie with this double act, two incredibly handsome guys, singers,

92
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,800
 ostensibly. Yes. But it turned out that they'd been miming on top of the pops.

93
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,280
 That's right. Well, not just miming on top of the pops. So they had this unbelievably successful

94
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,920
 debut album. It sold eight million copies. They were absolutely everywhere. They were huge. We're

95
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,480
 talking 1989 here. They were superstars. They won the Grammy for Best New Artist. And then they

96
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,440
 were revealed not to have sung any of their live gigs where they were all lip syncing or any of

97
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,040
 their recordings. Right. Yeah. So it just wasn't their voices. It was at any point. It was such a big

98
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,320
 story that I will have been like what 10 years old at this time. And at school, we all knew this story.

99
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,560
 Yeah. And we would make jokes about it and stuff like that. It's kind of and the backlash was

100
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,720
 huge fans destroyed their records. You know, and that's millions of records. It's the millions of

101
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,640
 vanillians. Brilliant. Absolutely. Brilliant. Well, why are you still here to make that joke?

102
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:07,000
 I feel like it's going downhill here. diminishing returns. Yeah. But it's the only time a Grammy has

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,520
 ever been rescinded. Wow. They took it off the date. And some real hounds of one Grammy's I suspect.

104
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,080
 I suspect some people of one Grammy's who are rotters. But probably saying this. So probably saying

105
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,360
 that's all. So anyway, that's the that's the situation. Right. And Alex's fact is the guy from

106
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,320
 Millie Vanillie who had to give back a Grammy is nominated this year for a Grammy for narrating

107
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,480
 the audiobook of the story of Millie Vanillie. So good. Absolutely stunning. And that I think is

108
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,920
 next year's Grammys. I think the 2026. The categories have been announced. Indeed, this year by

109
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,680
 the time this goes out. Absolutely. Yeah. Hello, everybody. And having you. Yeah. The golden

110
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,400
 gloves have added a podcast category this year. Have you seen that? Yeah. So the Grammys might

111
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,080
 eventually go on to that. We might get a Grammy one. Yeah. We were not eligible for the golden

112
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,160
 gloves one. Is that right? Yeah. It was like, I think only the top 10 podcasts in the world were

113
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,040
 up for like, there was some rule that meant a win number 11. Are we typical? There was definitely

114
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,640
 some rule that I saw it and thought, let's just throw a hat in the ring. Why not? Yeah. But we couldn't.

115
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,920
 Damn it. Gusted about that. Also, we don't do our own podcast. Do we have voice actors who come

116
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,160
 in and do this? Yeah. Yeah. I go. We had a sounding guy to do mine. The guy who's nominated for

117
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,200
 Bree Smorvin is up against a friend of yours, Dan, for the in the Grammy category. Is this a real

118
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,560
 friend or eight someone you, I think, admire and someone I associate with you? Is it the guy who runs

119
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,760
 the Crab Museum in Margate? It's the guy who runs the Crab Museum in Margate. He's nominated.

120
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,760
 That's very good. Brian blesses. Oh, they've both spent time in Tibet, I'd say.

121
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:04,760
 Is it a Yeti? Wow. Is that for a Grammy, which I think at this stage would be a real Philip for his

122
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,280
 career. I think he needs that boost. Yeah. How wonderful. Yeah. It's got lovely voice. Well,

123
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,120
 is it nice for them for Bree Smorvin's voice? I wouldn't know. I don't think anyone's heard it.

124
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,880
 Alice Hill has sent in two facts to us. One is from personal experience. She said, you can flip a

125
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,160
 breech baby while it's still inside the mum. She's like, it's pretty common. Breech baby being a

126
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,920
 breech baby is when the baby is facing the wrong way when it's birth is about to happen. Yeah. You

127
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,440
 want it the other way around so you can she says literally massage the baby. Two doctors can do it

128
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,160
 and they can massage at 180 degrees into the right position for birth, which is amazing. So this

129
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,960
 is obviously someone who loves a bit of science, curious about the world. Here's the actual fact

130
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,000
 she sent in years ago, I worked at a Christmas tree farm on a particularly hot summer's day and I

131
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,480
 saw a bumblebee performing oral sex on another bumblebee. The receiving bee was latched out,

132
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,680
 front arms up, holding some pine needles, front facing, bum forward. Other bee, face deep.

133
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,600
 I'll never forget that site. It was before the time of phone cameras. So a last new photographic

134
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:20,200
 proof. How convenient. It's tried to research it online. A bit tricky though for obvious reasons.

135
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,240
 Maybe you guys could find out if it's a thing. Alice, I looked into it. It is absolutely not a thing.

136
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:32,440
 I don't know what you saw. Alice, I assume it was two humans in bumblebee costumes.

137
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:49,240
 Quiz Corner. Oh yeah. Freyvand of Lert writes, "Why, in most car commercials, do you only see

138
00:13:49,240 --> 00:14:00,840
 the following letters and numbers on the number plates?" A H I M O T U V W X zero eight.

139
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:08,040
 I think I worked it out. Is it kind of like a lot of TV shows will use the same phone number because

140
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,080
 you don't want to use a license plate that's out there. That's a good idea. And those letters are not

141
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:20,520
 any other license plates in the world. Exactly. There you go. It can only be because they're all

142
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:28,840
 symmetrical. Yes. And so they must flip the footage or something? It's because the image can then

143
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,200
 be mirrored to make the car drive on the correct side of the road, depending on what country the

144
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,440
 commercial is area. Of course. There seems to be, I've looked into it a bit more. It seems to be true.

145
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,640
 And often you will see a car driving along with what is quite clearly southern Europe.

146
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,960
 Yeah, quite often in Iceland or something. Yeah. And they're driving on the left hand side of

147
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,960
 the road. A beautiful, sun-drenched canyon. Or you know, majestic mountain. It's just like, it's

148
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,840
 clear along the UK. So I don't know how much good it does. It's a really good fact.

149
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,560
 Yeah. And a good question as well. So thank you Freyvand. Here's another one that is based on

150
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:12,040
 roads. Yeah. This is from Alan Mitchell. And Alan says he used to be a motorcycle instructor.

151
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,640
 And one fun question we used to ask is if anyone knew what the black horizontal line was on a

152
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,480
 crossing patrol sign like a lollipop person would use on the round bit at the top. It says stop

153
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,360
 children. But then there's like a black lozenge in the middle of it. Okay. And Alan wonders what

154
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,680
 that was for. How in fact he knows what it's for. He's told us it's going to be for the drivers.

155
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,320
 You know, I read the email in the first place. I came into the inbox. So actually this quiz is

156
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,600
 for one person in this way, manly. Why would there be a black dot in the middle? Lozenge.

157
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,000
 Lot of dot, lozenge. That's, I'd say, essential. James, I don't know. The blackness is important.

158
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,680
 Lozenge's like the sweetie. Yeah, like a long, a long, like a sausage. Like a sausage. Right.

159
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,800
 Why would there be a sausage on a lollipop though?

160
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,640
 I'm just going to tell you. Yeah, I don't think I can get this.

161
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,280
 According to Alan, it's a blackboard and you would write down the number plates of vehicles

162
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:14,760
 who fail to stop his if you're a lollipop, if you're a lollipop person. Yeah, yeah. And one of the cars

163
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,920
 doesn't stop. They've committed an offense. So you would write down the number plate. Yeah, yeah.

164
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:27,480
 Now, the main problem is it doesn't really make a lot of sense. No. But I've looked online and it's

165
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,240
 definitely often said that this is true. And usually it's a lollipop people who say it.

166
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,440
 Right. I haven't found any sort of official sauce like the department of transport or the highway

167
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,040
 code or anything like that that says that this is true. It's hard to see how it would be useful.

168
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,680
 Well, I frequently try what I'm out and about to remember a license plate that passes by. Yeah.

169
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,920
 Yeah, just because I think I might be called on at some point to remember a license plate,

170
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:02,040
 you know, a short notice. Yeah, yeah. What if that car does commit an offense? Yeah, I'll need to,

171
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,680
 I'll need to say yes, officer. I remember it very clearly. How many do you retain? I've got them all

172
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,000
 cool. Gonna be four or five thousand, but I've memorized over the course of my life.

173
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,520
 Might one day that might come in useful. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Please test me now.

174
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:25,240
 November the 4th 2022. Didn't spot any that day. I was at home. You were sick. Yeah, yeah.

175
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,760
 Try to please another. November 3rd 2022. I was on the whole day. Were you? Yeah, no cars.

176
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,080
 Were you? Oh, he's on the island of Sark.

177
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:44,520
 Beautiful place. Lovely. Yeah, no cars. No cars. No cars on Sark, famously. All right. Well, story checks out.

178
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:52,200
 The thing is like, why not just have a notepad? Yeah. Why write it on something where it might get washed

179
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,440
 off or whatever. Yeah, it's true. If you need to keep hold of the license plate numbers,

180
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,920
 yes, that is not the best place to put it. You might want to write it on there so that people

181
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,680
 can see it and it shames people, but who remembers anyone's number plate enough to be like,

182
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:15,880
 oh, that's. Well, obviously, yeah. Obviously, for you, it would work, but for most people,

183
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,240
 it wouldn't. So it's really interesting whether this is true or not. Certainly, people who are

184
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,520
 involved in the community do think it's true, but there is no real evidence and it's hard to see

185
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,160
 how it would make sense. Very interesting. Yeah. So if you know the absolute certainty that this

186
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,920
 is true or not true, then do write it into podcast@QI.com. Very cool. I like it. I've got one that I

187
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:43,720
 can fashion into a question as well. This is from Sean Slater. He says, for every American president

188
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,920
 assassination, a Lincoln has been present. Certainly in the one where Abraham Lincoln was shot. Yeah.

189
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,960
 He was very Lincoln was there. His wife. Yeah. And Abraham was there too. So he got two

190
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:04,520
 Lincoln's. Okay. Garfield was shot by that guy with a weird name like a Gito. Yes. Charles Gito.

191
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,840
 Charles Lincoln Gito. Yeah. That's correct. And Robert Todd Lincoln, who was Abraham Lincoln's son,

192
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:18,440
 was there. Really? Yes. McKinley. Was McKinley shot? McKinley. Correct. McKinley was shot.

193
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,320
 Was there a Lincoln? Remember the Lincoln family was there? The same Lincoln. Robert Todd Lincoln.

194
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,560
 Was there? Really? Really? Yeah. He was even quoted later as saying, I'm not going to any more

195
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,880
 events because it's got a certain fatality about it when I go. And don't tell me JFK was driving in

196
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:43,160
 a Lincoln. He was in a Ford Lincoln. You got it. Wow. Very nice. That's great. Very, very fun quiz.

197
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,160
 I think we must be getting towards the end of this. I think so. I think let's switch over into

198
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,680
 Friend of the podcast mode and dedicate some facts to people who've joined on Patreon at the top

199
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,160
 tier. If you've joined at Friend of the podcast, we would like to dedicate one of our facts to you.

200
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:06,040
 So let's let's dish out a few of those now. I'll kick off with one. Vicki, congratulations to you.

201
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,960
 You are now the custodian of the fact that kangaroos have five legs.

202
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,040
 Bad luck, Vicki. Yeah. This is one of those rare ones when we just made stuff up. That's right.

203
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,280
 No, it's that the tailors of fifth leg. According to all sorts of tests, they've put kangaroos on

204
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,360
 treadmills and they've they've done all sorts of science on it because they use it for walking.

205
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,880
 Yes, they use it to propel themselves. Yeah. That was a James Harken fact, Vicki,

206
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,360
 episode 19. Yeah. Congratulations. Should I do one? Yeah. We've got an anitoshinsky fact to give out.

207
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,960
 And that's going to you and Taylor and that fact is that during the financial crisis of 1720,

208
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,080
 Parliament called for stockbrokers to be stitched into sacks and thrown into the Thames.

209
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,600
 Wow. Yeah. Gosh. Yeah. That's pretty wild, this fact. There's a bracket here,

210
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,120
 an extra bit of info for your fact, you and which is that this was a speech by Lord Mollsworth.

211
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,040
 People who committed parasite were stitched into the sack with a rooster, a monkey, and a dog.

212
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,000
 I think that was an ancient Rome, wasn't it? Yeah. I don't think it was in 1720s London.

213
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,280
 I know it was. I know it was. I mean, it is 300 years ago, but that's, that feels like it.

214
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,560
 Yeah, that was definitely an ancient thing. Okay. Well, congratulations to you,

215
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:28,760
 Ewan. And the next one is now under the custodianship of Jen Sykes. And Jen, this is your fact.

216
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,320
 It is that there are three times as many estate agents in the UK as members of the armed forces.

217
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,720
 Yes. Who could have brought that fact to the table? Who likes warfare. It's mine. It's my fact.

218
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,360
 Congratulations, Jen. This is a great fact. And excitingly, I imagine it'll have only the ratio

219
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,320
 will have only improved if you're a estate agent or or got worse if you remember the armed forces.

220
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,800
 Since then, because this was about 10 years ago. So yeah, I don't think the army's doubled in size

221
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,760
 in the last 10 years. Was this the the fact where Dan told us about how his wife made him hide his

222
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:10,280
 cocoa pops in the washing machine? Yeah. I feel like it was because maybe you were selling your house

223
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,000
 and people would come round and your wife didn't want people to know that there was an adult in there.

224
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,920
 It was cheating cocoa pops. Yeah, possibly, possibly is, is then that was the wildest

225
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,400
 guess where I came. I've ever had to play in my house. Everything was not where it should have been

226
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,960
 because it's a risk. It is a risk that if you have a viewing of your flat and someone opens the

227
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,360
 washing machine. Yes, they wouldn't do normally, but you never know people like to tie covers of

228
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,240
 things. They look at it and see cocoa pops and they think, well, this person's very unstable. I'm not

229
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,640
 going to buy them. All you really do when you're buying a house is bang on the worktops a few times.

230
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,200
 Yeah. And then hit the wall and go, oh, that's a supporting wall. Yeah, ask if there's any ghosts.

231
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,960
 You need to know that. I'm going to get out of there. Okay, here's another fact. And this one

232
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,320
 is one of my ones. It's going out to Brian Kelly. It's the fact that in medieval manuscripts,

233
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,160
 there are hundreds of drawings of snails and knights fighting each other and nobody knows why.

234
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,800
 Oh, yeah, I remember this one. It's really cool. It's really cool. In the margins of all these old books,

235
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 there's these drawings of these battles going on, but it's just like a cultural meme, isn't it?

236
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,880
 Yeah. It's just sort of, that's the thing everyone's drawn in the last, in the books for the last

237
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,080
 hundred, hundred and two hundred years. Oh, it's the 6/7 of its day, basically. 6/7 of its day.

238
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,880
 Here's a fact that is now under the custodian ship of Leah Smallercomb. It's that the most

239
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,680
 painful place to be stung by a bee is inside your nostril. Oh, yes. What a great fact. Yes.

240
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,720
 And that's because someone actually tried it out, right? Yeah. There was a student called Michael Smith

241
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,800
 who let bees sting him all over his body and rated, which was the most painful. Things we do for

242
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,600
 science. What heroes? Well, how, how precise do you want to get with it, though? Because I don't

243
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,040
 know if the student said, right, so test, I've done testicle, but I've only done top of testicle.

244
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,200
 Yeah. I'd better do mid-testicle, base of testicle, being stung by a bee. How scientific are we getting here?

245
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,720
 Probably there is work to be done from another scientist now, and building on Michael's work.

246
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,680
 That could be you. If you're at university and you're looking for something for your PhD,

247
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,480
 find yourself a bee. Yeah. If it's not mid-blow job, you could get it to, oh my goodness. I've just

248
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,680
 looked up Michael's study. He said he was carrying the work done by the Schmidt Sting Pain Index,

249
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,600
 which is all about different kinds of insect. Michael's study said the pain was rated on a one-to-ten

250
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,480
 scale relative to an internal standard, the forearm. So the forearm is your baseline. Okay.

251
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,360
 The three least painful locations were the skull, middle toe tip, and upper arm. The three most painful

252
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:46,920
 locations were the nostril, upper lip, and penis shaft. I mean, when you say penis shaft, it does

253
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,880
 imply that other parts have been tried. Otherwise, you would just say penis. Yeah, exactly.

254
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,640
 Okay. Well, here's another fact. This one is now under the custodianship of Stephen Winfield.

255
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:07,000
 Stephen, your new fact that you have to look after for saking all others is this one. Walt Disney's

256
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,080
 favorite breakfast was fresh donuts. Don't is scotch whiskey. Lovely. Yes. Wow. That was one of mine.

257
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,200
 We had a great chat about Disney and that one. It was the fact, I think, James that you found,

258
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,600
 which is the story that you went into crygenics to look after his body. Oh, yeah. He could be

259
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,720
 woken up one day, but you found that's not true. I think we all know that's not true. But what James

260
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,960
 found is that actually the one bit of his body that he did used to put on ice was his testicles,

261
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,000
 and that was that part of his self. I think it was you James. It was after he deliberately had a

262
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,200
 beast in them. The idea was I think it was a fertility idea that when him and his wife were trying

263
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,040
 to conceive, they said, put balls on ice. So he used to do that a lot. Yeah. There is the theory,

264
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,880
 which I don't think is true, which is that Disney's frozen was given that name so that when people

265
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,560
 Google frozen Disney, they don't get stories of his cryogenesis. It's a beautiful theory if it's

266
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,520
 not true. Like it's just a wonderful connection that's not as bad. And that's why the song Let It Go. He's

267
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,880
 talking to the people who keep spreading this room. He's like, let it go, guys. Let it go. See? I

268
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,440
 don't think that's a, you've built on the theory. Yeah. They're called never bothered by testicles,

269
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,000
 anyway. Okay. We got time for a couple more. Yeah. Let's do a couple more. This is going to bet.

270
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,680
 It's an Andrew Hunter Murray fact. Shouting at drivers improves their driving. Let's try and buy it.

271
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:37,000
 Watch the road. I cover stuff. Shouting at drivers improves. Was this presumably some kind of study?

272
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,640
 Yeah. It's a study in Kenya. They have lots of buses which crash quite frequently. All they

273
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,800
 certainly did at the time. And I think they put up stickers inside the buses saying, if your driver

274
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,440
 is driving erratically, please share it with them. Oh, right. That's what they're shouting.

275
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,560
 What are they shouting here? Yeah. There's a tradition that has to be adhered by Japanese train

276
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,600
 drivers that I read about where they have to point at things while they're driving as a way of

277
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,000
 maintaining their concentration. Really? Yeah. So you would point to the sign and read it out as well,

278
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,480
 I think. Right. And the idea is that you just don't get monotonous sleep kind of half asleep because

279
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 you're just doing the same thing over and over again. You have to go Osaka. But surely driving a

280
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,280
 high tech Japanese train these days is much like brain surgery and that you just, you know,

281
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,800
 program in the destination and then you just sit back and fall asleep. You think so? Yeah,

282
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,920
 you think. Yeah, there's more to it. Well, cool. Congratulations to Beth. I'll do one. This one

283
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:46,280
 goes out to Ali ML. Ali, your fact is that the French used to call arsenic succession powder

284
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,760
 because it was used in so many murders. Yes. Le Poudre du Succession. I'm not just

285
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,200
 clumsily assuming that that's what it is. I'm pretty sure that's what the French phrase is.

286
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,720
 Very cool. It was Ann Miller's fact, wasn't it? Because it was an area that she was

287
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,680
 particularly interested in at the time. Yes. And as we know, it's always wonderful to hear

288
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:13,000
 a Scottish person say, Mardad. Mardad. And will I say what? She wasn't interested in murdering her

289
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,680
 husband. It was that she was into her crime novels and not her first husband who sadly passed away

290
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:26,440
 in the accident and the second through fifth husbands as well. But now she's happy with Javier and

291
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:34,680
 there's no need to refer to any of those remarkably strange accidents. Anyway, so congratulations,

292
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,840
 Ali. That's a fact for you. And congratulations to all of the fact custodians today.

293
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,720
 Beth, Ali, Stephen, Leah, Brian, Jen, Yuan and Vicki. Those of you who have signed up and haven't

294
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,040
 had your shout out yet, it is coming. As I say, we've had a bit of a rush on. Sorry about that. We're

295
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,080
 going to try and do them as as speedily as is decent, but also in a way that remains fun for you,

296
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,320
 the listener. If you would like to join as a friend of the podcast, just go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasaffish.

297
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,560
 And you can have a look there and for all sorts of things like ad free episodes and bonus content.

298
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,840
 And all of that. It's all there and it's a great club to be part of. But that's it for this

299
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,080
 episode of Little Fish. We'll be back again in a week's time with another one. And we'll be back

300
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,360
 in three days time with the main show. Unless, of course, you're doing club fish already in which case

301
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,760
 there'll be a drop of the line at some point in the next one. So we'll see you soon as the point

302
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:35,640
 we're trying to make. Thanks very much for listening. We'll see you next time. Bye now.

303
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,220
 (upbeat music)
