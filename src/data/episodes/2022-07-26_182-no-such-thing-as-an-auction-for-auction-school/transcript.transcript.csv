00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode and no such thing as a fish before we begin."
00:00:05,00:00:08,We just want to let you in on the special guests that we have this week.
00:00:08,00:00:13,He's called Jason Hazley and he is one of the people behind all the funny
00:00:13,00:00:17,things you've probably seen on TV in the last however many years.
00:00:17,00:00:21,He is behind that Michelin web look as one of the writers for that.
00:00:21,00:00:23,He also writes for Charlie Brooker's screen wipe.
00:00:23,00:00:28,He's also the co-writer along with his buddy Joel of the Ladybird books.
00:00:28,00:00:32,Those adult ones have come out of the hipster and the cat and the hangover in the
00:00:32,00:00:33,midlife crisis.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"They've got a whole new batch coming out this October, October the fifth."
00:00:36,00:00:41,So do get them and he is on because he's a really good buddy of ours and he
00:00:41,00:00:43,constantly sends us facts.
00:00:43,00:00:46,And we just saw this guy's going to be amazing on the show and he was as you're
00:00:46,00:00:50,about to hear. So enjoy this week's app. Here we go.
00:00:50,00:01:10,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:10,00:01:13,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:01:13,00:01:14,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:14,00:01:19,"I am sitting here with Annotch's in Ski, Andrew Hunter Murray and Jason Hazley."
00:01:19,00:01:22,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:27,00:01:29,"Starting with you, Jason."
00:01:29,00:01:35,My fact is the curator of the British lawnmower museum is allergic to grass.
00:01:35,00:01:42,So is it his mission to destroy all the grass in the world with lawnmowers?
00:01:42,00:01:43,"By mowing it to work. Yeah, exactly."
00:01:43,00:01:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:01:44,00:01:47,So it's suddenly very hateful back museum.
00:01:48,00:01:51,It's one act of revenge on gigantic scale.
00:01:51,00:01:56,This is a guy called Brian Radham who runs the British lawnmower museum in Southport.
00:01:56,00:01:59,He's an ex lawnmower racing champion.
00:01:59,00:02:02,"Oh, to say I mean he sits on lawnmowers."
00:02:02,00:02:04,"Yes, that's a rather cool race."
00:02:04,00:02:08,But he had to give up racing because it was making him sneeze so much.
00:02:08,00:02:14,"Oh, so, so, but he, so he took his love of lawnmowers and turned it into the British lawnmower museum,"
00:02:14,00:02:17,which is a place to behold. I have to say.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"Have you been to it? Yeah, I have."
00:02:18,00:02:20,"Oh, is it actually really good?"
00:02:20,00:02:24,It's really good because it's one of those odd bits of the British museum
00:02:24,00:02:28,that you sometimes get where you just get lots and lots of iterations of the same thing.
00:02:28,00:02:31,Which just makes it so interesting.
00:02:31,00:02:33,Yeah. So you're saying it's mainly lawnmowers?
00:02:33,00:02:35,"It is mainly lawnmowers, yeah."
00:02:35,00:02:39,"They do have what he calls grass cutters, which are lawnmowers he doesn't like."
00:02:39,00:02:46,"Like the flymo, for instance, because the flymo doesn't have the helical blade that cuts the grass."
00:02:46,00:02:49,It has a thing that spins around and just wax at it.
00:02:49,00:02:51,So he leaves a very unsatisfactory cut.
00:02:51,00:02:55,"So those are grass cutters, according to him, not lawnmowers."
00:02:55,00:02:59,"Right. So this, I, so I know that you've been there"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"because I've read a book that you wrote called ""Bollocks to Alt and Towers."""
00:03:02,00:03:03,"Yes. And that's a chapter in it, right?"
00:03:03,00:03:04,It is. Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:07,So you did this as part of a big research mission.
00:03:07,00:03:11,"It was, yeah, it was the mission of the books to try and find places to go for a day out"
00:03:11,00:03:15,"that were unexpected, unusual, esoteric, uncommercial."
00:03:15,00:03:16,That sort of thing.
00:03:16,00:03:19,And there's lots and lots of little museums all over Britain.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"You know, there's a pencil museum in Kessik famously."
00:03:22,00:03:22,I've been there.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Which is great.
00:03:23,00:03:24,It is great.
00:03:24,00:03:25,But they had a terrible time.
00:03:25,00:03:27,They were really badly flooded out.
00:03:27,00:03:28,"Now, Kessik does flood, doesn't it?"
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Yeah, and I think it was last, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:33,"I think they might have only just reopened after this terrible, terrible flooding that they had."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"That sounds like to can survive flooding, can't they?"
00:03:35,00:03:38,"You can, because a pen museum, that would have been a problem."
00:03:38,00:03:38,"Oh, terrible."
00:03:38,00:03:41,But you can lash the pencils together into a massive raft.
00:03:41,00:03:43,To escape a stride.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"Now, if it was a blotting paper museum, it would be really good, wouldn't it?"
00:03:46,00:03:47,"Yeah, disaster."
00:03:47,00:03:51,"Did you see at the Lorma Museum, the celebrity Lorma?"
00:03:51,00:03:52,Certainly did.
00:03:52,00:03:55,There is Brian May's Qualcast.
00:03:55,00:04:01,They asked Nicholas Parsons for a donation of a Lorma.
00:04:01,00:04:02,And he agreed.
00:04:02,00:04:05,"And then, unfortunately, his shed was broken into."
00:04:05,00:04:07,And his Lorma was stolen.
00:04:07,00:04:09,So he gave them a pair of secateurs instead.
00:04:11,00:04:17,But the crowning bit of the celebrity department is Joe Pascuali's strimmer.
00:04:17,00:04:21,What's so great about that?
00:04:21,00:04:23,"Well, because I think just those three words,"
00:04:23,00:04:27,"marking out as being possibly the finest museum exhibit in the country, don't they?"
00:04:27,00:04:32,What I find really weird is that apparently they've got Albert Pierre points
00:04:32,00:04:37,"while the really famous hangman who hanged over 400 people,"
00:04:37,00:04:40,which is kind of a more bid thing to have in the museum.
00:04:40,00:04:43,And someone on Pinterest pointed out when they went to the museum
00:04:43,00:04:45,that it's actually hanging by a noose.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"No, is it?"
00:04:46,00:04:47,So that's quite nice.
00:04:47,00:04:48,That is in TV's taste.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"Oh, I just saw it."
00:04:50,00:04:50,He just said the least.
00:04:50,00:04:55,He didn't know any of the condemned people to death.
00:04:55,00:04:57,Nor did he hang any Lormos.
00:04:57,00:05:02,"You're right, that's been misrepresented."
00:05:02,00:05:06,I forgot to mention the other significant thing about the Lorma Museum is that it's upstairs.
00:05:09,00:05:11,So all those Lormos must feel fairly...
00:05:11,00:05:15,"We're in an alien habitat, you know, we're so funny."
00:05:15,00:05:17,We're so far from the thing that we wish to cut.
00:05:17,00:05:19,The Dalek Museum being upstairs.
00:05:19,00:05:20,"Yeah, it's great."
00:05:20,00:05:22,They've got a couple of other quirky things there as well.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"They've got a two-inch Lormoa,"
00:05:24,00:05:28,which is a Lormoa that cuts a two-inch strip through the grass.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"Oh, wow."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"And Brian Radham, when he came across this,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,thought what on earth could this possibly have been for?
00:05:34,00:05:35,"So he rang the manufacturer and said,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"""Why did you make a two-inch Lormoa?"""
00:05:37,00:05:40,"And they said, ""We deny ever making a two-inch Lormoa."""
00:05:40,00:05:43,So no one knows what this thing was for.
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Oh, wow."
00:05:44,00:05:47,Do you know about Finnish postmen and Lormos?
00:05:47,00:05:50,"So postmen in Finland have started in the last year,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"mowing their customers' lawns for a small fee,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,"because they're trying to find extra things to do,"
00:05:55,00:05:56,because it doesn't take them all their time.
00:05:56,00:05:58,And maybe I think post is declining a little bit
00:05:58,00:06:00,in terms of the amount of post we've done.
00:06:00,00:06:03,"So on their quietest day, which is Tuesday,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"you can pay them, I think, about 60 quid a month,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,and they'll mow your lawn.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Wow.
00:06:07,00:06:08,But you have to provide the Lormoa.
00:06:08,00:06:10,The very insistent about that.
00:06:10,00:06:13,"That's like in just on the postman, the lack of mail."
00:06:13,00:06:16,"In New Zealand now, there's one particular city"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"that delivers KFC, as well as your mail."
00:06:19,00:06:22,Wrap it around the bucket with an elastic band.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"Yeah, there's doing a thing in France"
00:06:23,00:06:27,where you can get postmen to go and check on your elderly relatives
00:06:27,00:06:28,"if you don't want to, I presume."
00:06:28,00:06:32,"You can pay, and it's called, ""Watch over my parents."""
00:06:32,00:06:34,"Well, and you can order them to call in"
00:06:34,00:06:35,"and just check, no, just to check."
00:06:35,00:06:38,"They're all right, either two, four or six times a week."
00:06:38,00:06:42,"So in pre-Lormoa days, when people used to have to mow the lawn"
00:06:42,00:06:46,"by hand, by size, there would be tailor-made size,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,which would stay the same length.
00:06:48,00:06:50,And if you wanted to cut your grass different lengths
00:06:50,00:06:52,"in like the 17th, 13th centuries,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,then you added wooden blocks to your shoes or took them off.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"So if you had a lawn that you needed to be a bit longer,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"rather than changing the length of the size,"
00:06:59,00:07:01,"or I guess the position where you held it,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,then you put some wooden planks under your shoes.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"Well, what if you were really short?"
00:07:06,00:07:07,And the size came in the same size.
00:07:07,00:07:10,Wouldn't you end up just hacking into the earth?
00:07:10,00:07:13,"No, you just had to put very large wooden blocks under your shoes."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"I said, I understand."
00:07:15,00:07:16,Your mowing stilts.
00:07:16,00:07:18,I don't know the size of that long.
00:07:18,00:07:21,Were they an accessory that you bought with them?
00:07:21,00:07:22,I'm not sure if they came as a package.
00:07:22,00:07:23,I'm sure they did a two-for-one deal.
00:07:23,00:07:25,But you'd have to have all your gardeners
00:07:25,00:07:27,"would have to have different size blocks,"
00:07:27,00:07:28,"wouldn't they, depending on their height?"
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:32,And it's probably an amusing mix-up where two of the gardeners
00:07:32,00:07:35,"got the wrong block saw, and then, you know,"
00:07:35,00:07:36,one bit of lawn was uneven.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"Yeah, that was comedy sketches in the 18th century."
00:07:38,00:07:41,We're all about incorrectly mowing grass.
00:07:41,00:07:43,It was a better show.
00:07:43,00:07:46,Unless you had a very strict height policy when hiring gardeners.
00:07:46,00:07:48,Yes.
00:07:48,00:07:49,"For the other thing, like, you know,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,you must be this high to go on this ride.
00:07:51,00:07:51,Yes.
00:07:51,00:07:53,To be one of those.
00:07:53,00:07:57,"I was trying to find other people who were, so,"
00:07:57,00:07:59,"lawnbower man, allergic to grass."
00:07:59,00:08:01,I managed to find a journalist
00:08:01,00:08:02,who's allergic to newspaper.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"Yeah, it's really unfortunate."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"He has to go, right, he still does his job,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,but he has to wear gloves now whenever he's at the office.
00:08:10,00:08:12,And it's to do with the ink that they use
00:08:12,00:08:14,inside his name's Michael Dresser.
00:08:14,00:08:15,"He's been with the paper 38 years,"
00:08:15,00:08:18,so he's had this allergy for a really long time.
00:08:18,00:08:21,And it's the pine resin that they use in the newspaper ink.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"So, yeah, so he can't touch the newspaper."
00:08:23,00:08:24,So he's allergic to that.
00:08:24,00:08:27,Found a marathon runner who's allergic to exercise.
00:08:27,00:08:30,You can be allergic to exercise.
00:08:30,00:08:31,In what way?
00:08:31,00:08:34,"So, as soon as she started running"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"and doing any kind of exercise,"
00:08:36,00:08:40,she would just come out with puffiness and rashes and all sorts.
00:08:40,00:08:42,Does she still run marathons?
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Yeah, she does."
00:08:43,00:08:43,Yeah.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"On other allergies, I think,"
00:08:45,00:08:48,isn't Lisa Stansfield allergic to her own saliva?
00:08:48,00:08:50,Whoa!
00:08:50,00:08:51,How do you...
00:08:51,00:08:53,Pretty sure I've read that somewhere.
00:08:53,00:08:54,I don't know.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Or she's a singer.
00:08:55,00:08:56,How do you deal with that?
00:08:56,00:09:00,"I guess, get yourself a job which involves having your mouth open"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"a lot of the time, like she did."
00:09:02,00:09:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:03,00:09:05,Wouldn't that provoke more saliva production?
00:09:05,00:09:06,Good question.
00:09:06,00:09:07,I haven't thought this through.
00:09:07,00:09:10,Maybe she had one of those dentist things in her mouth the whole time.
00:09:10,00:09:13,"You know, when you're having any work done, they have that suction."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"Well, that would have showed up on her singles, though, wouldn't it?"
00:09:15,00:09:19,"Yeah, but you might have mistaken that for that sort of Madonna-style microphone."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"Oh, that's true, yeah."
00:09:20,00:09:23,She's the ones that goes into the mouth.
00:09:23,00:09:25,There's a constant background harm on all of her singles.
00:09:25,00:09:27,The dentist suction thing.
00:09:27,00:09:28,That's incredible.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:32,The other thing from the Lormo Museum is they've got...
00:09:32,00:09:37,"There was a prototype of a robot Lormo there, called it,"
00:09:37,00:09:40,"made by Husqvarna, I think I've pronounced that right,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,which cost something like a million pounds to develop
00:09:43,00:09:45,"and had a retail price of £2,000."
00:09:45,00:09:48,"I'm so expensive that obviously it didn't sell very well,"
00:09:48,00:09:52,which is a shame because it's got a brilliant anti-theft device built into it.
00:09:52,00:09:57,"If it detects its being stolen, it starts screaming."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"So, Husqvarna developed a screaming robot Lormo."
00:10:01,00:10:05,If only Nicholas Parsons had had one.
00:10:05,00:10:16,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Chuzanski."
00:10:16,00:10:20,My effect this week is that Jimmy Carter once gave a speech in Poland
00:10:20,00:10:23,where he accidentally announced he wanted to have sex with all Polish people.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"So, when he said we never fired a bullet,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,was he just talking about sexual frustration?
00:10:29,00:10:34,This was his first trip abroad as president.
00:10:34,00:10:39,"It was in 1977, and he had this translator called Stephen Seymour,"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"and he was a good translator, but Polish was his fourth language."
00:10:42,00:10:45,"And he was having to translate into Polish, and usually,"
00:10:45,00:10:48,"a translator's translating from the language into English,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,if they all translate it.
00:10:50,00:10:52,But Jimmy Carter asked him to translate his speech into Polish
00:10:52,00:10:59,"with Polish people, and he translated the phrase ""I want to get to know the Polish people better"""
00:10:59,00:11:02,"as ""I want to have sex with the Polish."""
00:11:02,00:11:05,"Or ""I want to have carnal sexual knowledge of the Polish people."""
00:11:05,00:11:09,"So, that's what he did, and he made all these other mistakes in this speech as well."
00:11:09,00:11:11,"For instance, he opened it by trying to say,"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"""I left the US just this morning to come here,"""
00:11:14,00:11:17,"and he ended up saying, ""I left the US never to return."""
00:11:20,00:11:24,"He was moving to Poland. That would be a major league defection,"
00:11:24,00:11:25,"coup, for the Soviets."
00:11:25,00:11:30,"I read that another of the reasons was that Seymour,"
00:11:30,00:11:34,"the original translator, was a really good translator of written Polish,"
00:11:34,00:11:38,but it wasn't quite so good at simultaneous spoken translation.
00:11:38,00:11:40,I see. So maybe that was something to do with the tour.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"Okay, yeah."
00:11:41,00:11:46,"So he should have been writing it down on a big screen behind people, yeah."
00:11:46,00:11:49,So my favourite Jimmy Carter mis-translation in one of his speeches
00:11:49,00:11:51,is that we've all got one.
00:11:51,00:11:54,He's got a greatest hits list.
00:11:54,00:11:57,"He was in Japan, and he was giving a speech,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,and this is post him being president.
00:11:59,00:12:02,"When he started the speech with a joke,"
00:12:02,00:12:06,"and halfway through, he realised, ""Oh no, this is not going to translate."""
00:12:06,00:12:09,"I'm telling a joke, and the punchline's just going to come out all wrong"
00:12:09,00:12:11,through translation of this Japanese translator.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"So I'm just going to get this weird, confused silence."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"But he's like, ""I'm halfway through. I've got to do it."""
00:12:16,00:12:20,"So he delivers the joke, and then the Japanese translator,"
00:12:20,00:12:24,"translate, and it gets this massive laugh, humongous laugh."
00:12:24,00:12:25,"And so afterwards, he went up to the guy and said,"
00:12:25,00:12:28,"""That is incredible that you managed to translate that joke."
00:12:28,00:12:30,"You must be an incredible translator."""
00:12:30,00:12:33,"And the translator said, ""Oh, no, what I did actually was say,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"President Carter just told a joke. Everyone must laugh."""
00:12:36,00:12:39,That resulted in just trying all of his laugh.
00:12:39,00:12:41,What a dude.
00:12:41,00:12:44,Is that translator still working?
00:12:44,00:12:46,"And does he do stat-up gigs in the UK, please?"
00:12:46,00:12:52,So did you know that Jimmy Carter set up a hotline
00:12:52,00:12:56,that you could ring to report people for being too cool?
00:12:56,00:12:59,This is true.
00:12:59,00:13:02,"He was a big environmentalist, Jimmy Carter,"
00:13:02,00:13:05,"who set up the Department of the Environment in the States,"
00:13:05,00:13:08,and he put solar panels on the roof of the White House.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"And one of the things he did was that he, at some point,"
00:13:10,00:13:15,he passed a law saying that air conditioning in government buildings and businesses
00:13:15,00:13:21,"couldn't go any lower than 26.7 degrees Celsius, which is 80 Fahrenheit."
00:13:21,00:13:22,That is quite hard.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"It is quite hard, isn't it?"
00:13:23,00:13:26,And this effective 55 million people
00:13:26,00:13:28,who had a very sweaty time.
00:13:28,00:13:33,But he set up a hotline so that you could ring and report people
00:13:33,00:13:35,if they turned their aircon lower than that.
00:13:35,00:13:38,"And they could be given a $10,000 fine."
00:13:39,00:13:44,"No, of course, Reagan took the solar panel straight off, didn't he?"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"When he went to the White House, what was that in the face?"
00:13:46,00:13:47,He said they were a joke.
00:13:47,00:13:51,Jimmy Carter has won three Grammys.
00:13:51,00:13:52,I see.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"Yeah, for what?"
00:13:54,00:13:58,"Spoken word, so all the spoken word of his books that he keeps pumping out."
00:13:58,00:14:02,"He's written a lot of books, and he's won three Grammys,"
00:14:02,00:14:04,but he's been nominated a lot more times.
00:14:04,00:14:07,"I think he, looking through the list of spoken word Grammys,"
00:14:07,00:14:09,he has been nominated more than anyone else.
00:14:09,00:14:10,Really?
00:14:10,00:14:10,Yeah.
00:14:10,00:14:13,He lost in 1999 to Christopher E.
00:14:13,00:14:15,He lost in 2002 to Quincy Jones.
00:14:15,00:14:21,"In 2008, he lost to Obama, but he was up against Obama as was Bill Clinton."
00:14:21,00:14:27,"So three of the nominees were presidents of the United States of America, the Grammys."
00:14:27,00:14:29,"That was the big presidential race of 2008, wasn't it?"
00:14:29,00:14:31,That was the one I was watching.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Yeah.
00:14:32,00:14:34,Then he lost in 2010 to Michael J. Fox.
00:14:34,00:14:36,Then he lost in 2015 to Joan Rivers.
00:14:36,00:14:38,But then he won in 2016.
00:14:38,00:14:40,That feels like a pissy win.
00:14:40,00:14:43,"After all that effort, that feels like he's gone, just give it to him."
00:14:43,00:14:44,I'll go away.
00:14:44,00:14:45,I love Jimmy Carter.
00:14:45,00:14:46,Do you?
00:14:46,00:14:47,He's just the best guy.
00:14:47,00:14:50,He's just the most principled moral guy.
00:14:50,00:14:54,"So he's the only president who doesn't really take speaking fees,"
00:14:54,00:14:58,"and any speaking fee has ever taken, which is always minimal goes to charity."
00:14:58,00:15:01,Do you think he stopped taking them because he keeps making such massive gaps?
00:15:03,00:15:06,It's automatically audience by accident by a translation.
00:15:06,00:15:08,Always just coming on to whoever's listening.
00:15:08,00:15:12,"He still gives, I was listening to a podcast, which is really good."
00:15:12,00:15:17,"It's the Washington Post presidential podcast, and they did about an hour on every president."
00:15:17,00:15:19,So it followed Jimmy Carter.
00:15:19,00:15:20,From start to finish.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"That's how, you've got quite esoteric tastes."
00:15:23,00:15:26,An hour without 45 now.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"I mean, I haven't, I haven't listened to, like, rather, for B. Hayes or anything yet."
00:15:31,00:15:33,I don't know how I'd fare there.
00:15:33,00:15:37,"But he still gives Sunday school classes, and people come all over the world to listen."
00:15:37,00:15:39,"But, you know, he's really, he's an evangelical born again, Christian."
00:15:39,00:15:43,So he just gives religious lessons at Sunday school every week.
00:15:43,00:15:45,He's just such a decent guy.
00:15:45,00:15:46,"I'm still a senior UFO, hasn't he?"
00:15:46,00:15:48,"Yeah, he's also a bit weird."
00:15:48,00:15:52,It's a very famous incident of Jimmy Carter claiming to have seen a UFO.
00:15:52,00:15:55,One of the promises he made in his presidential campaign was that
00:15:55,00:16:00,"he would investigate all extraterrestrial experiences or something, I think."
00:16:00,00:16:04,"And then when he got into power, he said he couldn't, because it was all too secret or something."
00:16:04,00:16:05,He's too busy now to go around.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:08,Turns out he's a counter-photo-class.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"He builds houses, doesn't he, as well?"
00:16:12,00:16:14,"Yeah, and fun, amazing furniture."
00:16:14,00:16:15,Does he?
00:16:15,00:16:16,"Yeah, come on, how good is the furniture?"
00:16:16,00:16:21,"It sells for, I think I might have mentioned this before, but if I haven't,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,"yeah, he builds, like, beds and Tests and Royals."
00:16:24,00:16:26,And do you say it sells for a lot of money?
00:16:26,00:16:26,"Yeah, thousands."
00:16:26,00:16:29,But how much would it sell for if you sold it under a pseudonym?
00:16:29,00:16:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:31,00:16:33,It wouldn't necessarily be an eccentric thing to do.
00:16:33,00:16:39,"Yeah, he sent his first text three years ago, Jimmy Carter."
00:16:39,00:16:40,"Oh, well done, Jimmy."
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:44,"And his second text, this was the message of his second text."
00:16:44,00:16:47,"It was, I did not mean to send that first text about wanting to have sex with you."
00:16:47,00:16:48,I'm sorry.
00:16:48,00:16:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:49,00:16:52,I'm still using Seymour to translate all my stuff.
00:16:52,00:16:58,"Yeah, no, his second text was, that was my first text message."
00:16:59,00:17:01,"Yeah, he was his first text."
00:17:01,00:17:02,"This is my first text, too."
00:17:02,00:17:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:03,00:17:04,That was his second text.
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Has it gone on like that, too?"
00:17:05,00:17:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:08,00:17:09,"Yeah, no, it was to his grandson."
00:17:09,00:17:13,"And it was, did you see, Colbert last night, P?"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"He ends up with P, which I think he's just referred to as Papa."
00:17:15,00:17:19,"But his grandson is on Twitter, so he did a screen grab of it."
00:17:19,00:17:20,It might be president.
00:17:20,00:17:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:21,00:17:23,It might just be a real ask about it.
00:17:23,00:17:24,Yeah.
00:17:24,00:17:25,Did you know Patti O'Furnich will make her?
00:17:25,00:17:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:27,00:17:30,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:17:30,00:17:35,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:17:35,00:17:37,And that is my fact.
00:17:37,00:17:41,My fact this week is that narcissists don't like looking at themselves.
00:17:41,00:17:42,[BUZZER]
00:17:42,00:17:43,It's not weird.
00:17:43,00:17:46,So this is a new study that's come out of Austria
00:17:46,00:17:48,from the University of Gratz.
00:17:48,00:17:51,And the idea is that they took a pool of around 600 people
00:17:51,00:17:54,and surveyed them to see whether or not they were narcissistic.
00:17:54,00:17:58,"And so out of that, they found 43 people that they selected 21"
00:17:58,00:18:01,who scored really highly as being narcissistic
00:18:01,00:18:03,and 22 with lower scores.
00:18:03,00:18:05,And they were shown pictures of themselves
00:18:05,00:18:07,and close family friends and so on.
00:18:07,00:18:09,"And their brain activity, which was monitored every time"
00:18:09,00:18:10,they saw the picture of themselves.
00:18:10,00:18:12,"When their eyes locked onto themselves,"
00:18:12,00:18:16,it registered as not enjoying it.
00:18:16,00:18:17,"Yeah, which is--"
00:18:17,00:18:20,And that was not enjoying it more so than non-asicists.
00:18:20,00:18:22,Or maybe just enjoying it the same amount or--
00:18:22,00:18:26,"Not having this in a special surge of enjoyment, I guess."
00:18:26,00:18:26,Yeah.
00:18:26,00:18:27,"Yeah, which is--"
00:18:27,00:18:30,I've just realised because obviously narcissists in the myth
00:18:30,00:18:31,does like looking at himself.
00:18:31,00:18:33,You've just got this fact.
00:18:33,00:18:33,Yeah.
00:18:33,00:18:36,That says he likes it a lot to his detriment.
00:18:36,00:18:37,It turns out--
00:18:37,00:18:38,This is he die.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"He doesn't die, but he gets turned into a flower."
00:18:40,00:18:42,I would say that is a kind of death.
00:18:42,00:18:43,That is a plot twist.
00:18:43,00:18:44,I did not see coming.
00:18:44,00:18:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:45,00:18:46,It's a daffodil.
00:18:46,00:18:47,Isn't it that he was turned into?
00:18:47,00:18:49,"Well, we think it's a narcissist."
00:18:49,00:18:50,It's like it always--
00:18:50,00:18:52,"There's flower called narcissists, which is yeah."
00:18:52,00:18:54,"And they sort of droop over the riverbank, Daniel,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,and they look like they're looking at themselves
00:18:56,00:18:57,with their little trumpets.
00:18:57,00:19:01,So that's why he was turned into one of those either gods.
00:19:01,00:19:03,But I think he starved to death first
00:19:03,00:19:05,because he was so captivated by his reflection.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"And I should just say for the pedants out there,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"when you're on his watch, QI, that we don't know"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"that the etymology of narcissists, the flower,"
00:19:11,00:19:13,"comes from narcissists, the person."
00:19:13,00:19:15,"To me, it seems so obvious that it definitely does."
00:19:15,00:19:17,"It's a flower that he was turned into,"
00:19:17,00:19:19,and it drapes over lakes.
00:19:19,00:19:24,But some people say it's related to a word that means to poison
00:19:24,00:19:24,or something.
00:19:24,00:19:25,They're OK.
00:19:25,00:19:27,They might be totally unrelated to each other.
00:19:27,00:19:31,Do you know how to tell us someone's a narcissist?
00:19:31,00:19:32,You just ask them.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Because they don't care.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"They'll say, yeah, I'm a narcissist."
00:19:35,00:19:36,"That's true, yeah."
00:19:36,00:19:39,The psychologists have developed a one-question test
00:19:39,00:19:41,for narcissism.
00:19:41,00:19:43,Wow.
00:19:43,00:19:44,And it's a pretty good one.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"And then there's a more advanced one, which"
00:19:46,00:19:47,is a 40-question test.
00:19:47,00:19:49,But it replicates pretty closely the one-question test.
00:19:49,00:19:53,Do you guys know about the Anna-Face Facial Beauty Analysis?
00:19:53,00:19:54,No.
00:19:54,00:19:55,This is the thing you can do.
00:19:55,00:19:56,"I thought, OK, well, let's do something"
00:19:56,00:19:58,about looking at yourself.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"So I went on this website, and it takes a photo of your face,"
00:20:01,00:20:02,"and then it analyzes you, and it gives you"
00:20:02,00:20:05,your facial beauty analysis.
00:20:05,00:20:06,So that's what the kind of thing a narcissist would do?
00:20:06,00:20:07,"It does, doesn't it?"
00:20:07,00:20:08,Yeah.
00:20:08,00:20:11,So I was roleplaying.
00:20:11,00:20:16,So this is how my facial beauty analysis reads.
00:20:16,00:20:19,Your nose is too long for your ears.
00:20:19,00:20:22,Your inner ocular distance is too big for your eyes.
00:20:22,00:20:25,Your nose is too wide for your face with.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Your face is too narrow.
00:20:26,00:20:30,Your nose is too wide for your mouth.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Wow.
00:20:31,00:20:32,"Look, only some of that is true."
00:20:32,00:20:34,"Pretty brutal, isn't it?"
00:20:34,00:20:36,What I got stuck on though is your nose
00:20:36,00:20:39,is too long for your ears.
00:20:39,00:20:42,How do those things correlate?
00:20:42,00:20:44,How are you not that your ears are too short for your nose?
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Why's the nose to blame?
00:20:46,00:20:49,"No, it's done."
00:20:49,00:20:52,"But I don't think you could fit it in your ears, even if you want to."
00:20:52,00:20:53,"No, I don't think so."
00:20:53,00:20:55,God knows I've tried.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Well, it's not that long, then, is it?"
00:20:56,00:20:59,If you can't even fit it in your ears.
00:20:59,00:21:01,So what was it trying to tell you?
00:21:01,00:21:03,I think it succeeded in telling me exactly what it wanted
00:21:03,00:21:06,to tell you.
00:21:06,00:21:08,It may just be an exercise in--
00:21:08,00:21:08,I don't know.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"--buse, honesty, no idea."
00:21:11,00:21:13,What's the URL for that?
00:21:13,00:21:14,It's ANA face.
00:21:14,00:21:16,ANA face.
00:21:16,00:21:18,Definitely doing that.
00:21:18,00:21:21,I was looking up stuff about looking in mirrors.
00:21:21,00:21:21,Yeah.
00:21:21,00:21:24,You know the thing about animals looking in mirrors.
00:21:24,00:21:25,Which I think we must have mentioned before.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Don't they do it?
00:21:26,00:21:28,But they do it.
00:21:28,00:21:31,And the way to tell if they can tell that they are the animal in the mirror
00:21:31,00:21:33,is by painting a dot on them.
00:21:33,00:21:38,"And then if they try and get rid of the dot, that's how they know."
00:21:38,00:21:41,"This was invented by a guy called Gordon Gallup, Jr."
00:21:41,00:21:45,This was his innovation experiment in the 1970s.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Although one of the first people to do it
00:21:46,00:21:51,"was Charles Darwin, who in 1838 went to London Zoo"
00:21:51,00:21:54,and entered an orangutan's cage with a mirror to experiment.
00:21:54,00:21:55,Wow.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"Well, that's been done all this time."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"Yeah, wow."
00:21:58,00:22:00,And the orangutan loved it.
00:22:00,00:22:02,He said she was astonished beyond measure.
00:22:02,00:22:03,But did she know it was her reflection?
00:22:03,00:22:04,Don't know.
00:22:04,00:22:06,I don't think he did the dot test.
00:22:06,00:22:09,Did you know about the 17th century fashion
00:22:09,00:22:13,for having a mirror hanging on the wall of your drawing room?
00:22:13,00:22:17,"And then next to it, an oil painting of exactly the reflection in the mirror."
00:22:17,00:22:18,What?
00:22:18,00:22:19,No.
00:22:19,00:22:20,Really?
00:22:20,00:22:21,Yeah.
00:22:21,00:22:22,That's cool.
00:22:22,00:22:24,I couldn't find out anything more about this.
00:22:24,00:22:27,I came across this fact and then couldn't get anywhere further with it.
00:22:27,00:22:31,But it was-- I don't know whether it was in order to show off the artist
00:22:31,00:22:34,or in order to show off the-- what the mirror can see.
00:22:34,00:22:34,Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Right.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"What a hassle, because if you ever wanted to redecorate,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,you always have to hang those two next to each other then.
00:22:40,00:22:40,Yeah.
00:22:40,00:22:45,"And in the same position, actually, obviously, because you can't move the mirror, can you?"
00:22:45,00:22:46,"Otherwise, it's not going to reflect the same thing."
00:22:46,00:22:51,"And also, if you walk up to the wrong one, you might think you're a vampire."
00:22:51,00:22:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:54,00:22:57,"There was another weird fashion for the Claude Glass, which was about the same time."
00:22:57,00:23:01,"I think the 18th century, which was a period of time where people decided that"
00:23:01,00:23:05,beautiful views and landscapes actually looked more attractive in mirrors
00:23:05,00:23:09,"than they did in real life, just with the bare eyes."
00:23:09,00:23:12,"And so this Claude Glass was invented, and people would walk up mountains,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,and they'd take a Claude Glass with them.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"And the idea was that you got to the top of a mountain, and then you get to take out"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"this mirror, and it would be a tinted mirror."
00:23:19,00:23:22,So it gave it a bit of a ethereal dreamlike quality.
00:23:22,00:23:25,And you'd get to look at the view in a mirror and then go down again.
00:23:25,00:23:28,"But you'd have to face away, wouldn't you, from the view?"
00:23:28,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"Look into the mirror, see the view behind you."
00:23:31,00:23:32,Imagine how bizarre that is.
00:23:32,00:23:35,So you're facing away from the thing you've come up the thing to see.
00:23:35,00:23:35,Yeah.
00:23:35,00:23:39,"And you can look at it in the mirror, which is exactly like the selfie thing,"
00:23:39,00:23:42,where you get a lot of people facing away from the view.
00:23:42,00:23:43,"Oh, yes."
00:23:43,00:23:44,For a hell of a friend of yours.
00:23:44,00:23:45,So that's the original selfie.
00:23:45,00:23:46,That's it.
00:23:46,00:23:49,It's sort of the original selfie.
00:23:49,00:23:49,Yes.
00:23:49,00:23:50,"Yeah, kind of."
00:23:50,00:23:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:53,00:23:56,How we all got quite excited about that for a minute was cool.
00:23:56,00:24:00,"So listen, Narcissus then was, because he was in love with his own reflection,"
00:24:00,00:24:04,"he might not have liked seeing a picture of himself, because that would have been"
00:24:04,00:24:05,the right way round.
00:24:05,00:24:06,Yeah.
00:24:06,00:24:07,"Oh, yes."
00:24:07,00:24:08,Absolutely.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Yes.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"So that's why people tend to much prefer their reflection to pictures, isn't it?"
00:24:11,00:24:12,Yeah.
00:24:12,00:24:16,"Because the image you're used to seeing is the one in the mirror, but as soon as you see"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"a photo, you think, oh, my face is too big."
00:24:18,00:24:19,No one knows it's too long for your ears.
00:24:19,00:24:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:20,00:24:21,OK.
00:24:21,00:24:22,OK.
00:24:22,00:24:32,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:24:32,00:24:36,My fact is that clenching one's buttocks is a technique Christy's auctioneers are taught
00:24:36,00:24:38,to stop their hands shaking.
00:24:38,00:24:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:40,00:24:44,But it doesn't actually say where they're being told to put their hands while they're clenching
00:24:44,00:24:45,their buttocks.
00:24:45,00:24:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:46,00:24:47,Yeah.
00:24:47,00:24:51,So this is a piece about extraordinary things that Christy's has found out over the years.
00:24:51,00:24:56,"It's by Christy's, and one of them was this amazing fact about how the auctioneers calm"
00:24:56,00:24:57,themselves down.
00:24:57,00:24:58,Wow.
00:24:58,00:25:02,"Are they having them holding priceless bits of art, or is this when they're actually conducting"
00:25:02,00:25:03,your auctioneer?
00:25:03,00:25:04,I think when you're conducting an auction because you're standing at the front of the front
00:25:04,00:25:10,"of everyone and you're gesturing, so you have to look in control of the situation, I suppose."
00:25:10,00:25:11,Yeah.
00:25:11,00:25:12,And so that apparently comes.
00:25:12,00:25:17,"I don't know how, what the mechanism is, whether simply the focusing on another muscle in"
00:25:17,00:25:19,your body removes the tension from your hands.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Yeah, I must do."
00:25:20,00:25:21,Right?
00:25:21,00:25:22,I guess so.
00:25:22,00:25:23,I don't know.
00:25:23,00:25:24,"I'm trying it now, and I think it makes you a bit more shaky."
00:25:24,00:25:30,"But I'm, so I guess the shaking is because they talk about auctioneers as being a sort of"
00:25:30,00:25:31,an acting gig almost.
00:25:31,00:25:35,You get up on stage and you need to make the audience love you because that's going to
00:25:35,00:25:40,"make an auction successful, and on Christy's site, they were saying, with interviews of various"
00:25:40,00:25:44,"auctioneers, the first 10 seconds is where you need to grab them, otherwise you might not"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"have a successful auction, which seems bizarre if you're there to buy things."
00:25:48,00:25:49,Do you know what I mean?
00:25:49,00:25:52,"Like it's, you're not buying off this guy's credibility."
00:25:52,00:25:53,You're buying because there's...
00:25:53,00:25:54,But you are.
00:25:54,00:26:00,"I mean, I remember going to a, which is quite similar, what's it called when you go to a charity"
00:26:00,00:26:01,thing and...
00:26:01,00:26:02,Raffle.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"No, there's above a raffle where you bid for..."
00:26:05,00:26:06,Super raffle?
00:26:06,00:26:07,Yeah.
00:26:07,00:26:13,One of those things where like you donate a holiday or you donate your mansion for a week.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"Oh, yeah, I've been to loads of things where people who donate to their mansion."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Where am I being?
00:26:18,00:26:19,Oh.
00:26:19,00:26:20,We mix in different circles.
00:26:20,00:26:21,What's it called?
00:26:21,00:26:22,It's a charity auction.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"Yeah, so you know when you go to a charity auction, it's..."
00:26:25,00:26:30,"You inspire people to buy stuff just by being that charming, I remember going to one recently"
00:26:30,00:26:34,in Clive Anderson was doing the auctioning and people definitely bid on stuff that they
00:26:34,00:26:38,would absolutely not have had to not kind of cajold them a bit here and persuaded them
00:26:38,00:26:39,a bit there.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"I think it makes such a difference because it's in the moment, isn't it?"
00:26:41,00:26:42,That's where it affects you in an auction.
00:26:42,00:26:43,That's true.
00:26:43,00:26:48,I did a gig not too long ago with a Christie's auctioneer and it was a very rowdy room
00:26:48,00:26:53,"and it was a charity night, it was raising money for this new university for brain studies"
00:26:53,00:26:59,and he was given a lot of stuff to auction off and the room was chaotic as you would expect
00:26:59,00:27:03,"it was in the V&A, everyone was just busy on round tables eating so he had to try and maintain"
00:27:03,00:27:07,their attention in order to sell all this stuff and he did this trick.
00:27:07,00:27:13,"When he felt like he lost the crowd, he went, he made that noise and every time the crowd"
00:27:13,00:27:17,"would silence, look back to him and then he'd continue on with the auction."
00:27:17,00:27:18,But he did it like 50 times during the night.
00:27:18,00:27:20,Well they all ponies.
00:27:20,00:27:26,"It was an amazing technique, that's how he shut up an entire row."
00:27:26,00:27:29,"Yeah, one of the things I didn't realise is that auctioneers will keep an eye on each"
00:27:29,00:27:31,other as well.
00:27:31,00:27:36,"So one of them, if they feel that if auctioneer A is up there and he doesn't think he's"
00:27:36,00:27:39,"quite got the room, he's not inspiring them and I think he can nod to auctioneer B who"
00:27:39,00:27:42,will come up and take his place and try and raise the temperature of the room and it works
00:27:42,00:27:43,the other way round as well.
00:27:43,00:27:46,"auctioneer B can just go up to him and tap him on the shoulder and go, you've lost him"
00:27:46,00:27:47,"mate, I'll do it."
00:27:47,00:27:48,Wow.
00:27:48,00:27:49,It's like a tag team.
00:27:49,00:27:54,"Imagine if that was true in all performing arts, imagine Andy, if you're bombing one night and Dan"
00:27:54,00:27:58,just comes up behind you taps you on the shoulder and says I'll take it from him.
00:27:58,00:28:01,What do you mean imagined?
00:28:01,00:28:04,"Remember, I think it's the one you're looking for."
00:28:04,00:28:08,"So in the old days I have to do mock auctions, the auctioneers at Christie's before the"
00:28:08,00:28:12,bosses of the company to just make sure that the skills were good.
00:28:12,00:28:16,The bosses would just sit around with the drink and then the auctioneers would have to do
00:28:16,00:28:17,it.
00:28:17,00:28:18,Oh really?
00:28:18,00:28:22,It's all a bit more professional now so they get voice actors and acting coaches in to
00:28:22,00:28:26,teach them about engaging the voice and maybe also about posture and engaging the audience
00:28:26,00:28:27,I don't know.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"Well Christie's does in house courses, if you want to get into it."
00:28:30,00:28:33,"You spend, you do a workshop with one of them."
00:28:33,00:28:34,Yeah.
00:28:34,00:28:36,Wolverhampton actually has a two year degree for auctioneering.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Right.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Yeah, they teach you to auctioneer and to value things as well."
00:28:40,00:28:41,But yeah.
00:28:41,00:28:45,How much money do I have over this place on the Yorkshire University auction course?
00:28:45,00:28:46,"9,000 pounds."
00:28:46,00:28:47,"9,000 pounds over here."
00:28:47,00:28:49,Do I hit ten?
00:28:49,00:28:50,Yeah.
00:28:50,00:28:52,So did anybody look up butter clenching?
00:28:52,00:28:53,No.
00:28:53,00:28:55,No more than usual.
00:28:55,00:28:59,"So butter clenching, you're all aware of the international penny chuffing competition"
00:28:59,00:29:00,are you?
00:29:00,00:29:01,No.
00:29:01,00:29:07,In the case annually at the new year in Wedmore in Somerset where the contestants have
00:29:07,00:29:14,"to clench three two pence coins in between the cheeks of their butters, then walk, waddle"
00:29:14,00:29:19,"or hop, four yards across the pub before depositing the coins in a pint glass."
00:29:19,00:29:20,Wow.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Oh my god.
00:29:21,00:29:26,You get one point for every coin you get in the glass and the last report that I could
00:29:26,00:29:30,"find from 2015, three people scored nine points."
00:29:30,00:29:32,Is that the full?
00:29:32,00:29:34,So they're managed three journeys across the pub.
00:29:34,00:29:35,Oh wow.
00:29:35,00:29:38,Do you have to pick them up with your buttocks?
00:29:38,00:29:40,That isn't indicated.
00:29:40,00:29:41,OK.
00:29:41,00:29:48,"Nor is what happens to the coins afterwards, whether they go into a particular till."
00:29:48,00:29:50,Is it a full point and do you have to down it once you've finished?
00:29:50,00:29:51,"No, it's just a pint glass."
00:29:51,00:29:52,"No, that's a shame."
00:29:52,00:29:53,That would make the competition more fun.
00:29:53,00:29:54,"No, it would, wouldn't it?"
00:29:54,00:29:55,Yeah.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Yeah.
00:29:56,00:29:57,That is fantastic.
00:29:57,00:29:59,I don't like to brag.
00:29:59,00:30:01,I think I could do that.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"Well, there's only one way to find out."
00:30:03,00:30:08,"So some of that is the other thing of course, right?"
00:30:08,00:30:11,"If you put yourself in the room there, that's a lot of bum, isn't it?"
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yes.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"Now, what happens is, apparently, they have, they have some sort of modesty blanket"
00:30:15,00:30:21,"that they put around themselves while hopping, waddling or walking four yards across the"
00:30:21,00:30:25,"pub with some money up there, ask."
00:30:25,00:30:32,"Didn't David Souchet, the pyro actor, he did a lot of butt clenching as well?"
00:30:32,00:30:33,Did he?
00:30:33,00:30:34,"Yeah, to get into the role."
00:30:34,00:30:35,"To get the model, right?"
00:30:35,00:30:36,Yeah.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"He wanted to be as pert as an auctioneer, didn't he?"
00:30:39,00:30:40,Yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:42,Is it called the Souchet Sache?
00:30:42,00:30:43,No.
00:30:43,00:30:44,You made that up?
00:30:44,00:30:45,Yeah.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Well, treat it."
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Treat it, treat it."
00:30:47,00:30:48,It's not.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"I feel like it's not mine to trademark, I don't think."
00:30:49,00:30:55,"But, guys, telegraph headline, David Souchet, I stuck coin in buttocks to walk like pyro."
00:30:55,00:30:59,And also to win this competition at the new inn in Wedmore.
00:30:59,00:31:02,"No, he was caught in a pub in Somerset with a modesty blanket right?"
00:31:02,00:31:09,"Like, this is a money up his ass and he said, ""Oh, I was doing it for the role."""
00:31:09,00:31:14,"Okay, that's it."
00:31:14,00:31:16,That is all of our facts.
