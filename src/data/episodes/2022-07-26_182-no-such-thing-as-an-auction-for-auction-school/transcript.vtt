00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode and no such thing as a fish before we begin.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.520
 We just want to let you in on the special guests that we have this week.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.680
 He's called Jason Hazley and he is one of the people behind all the funny

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.080
 things you've probably seen on TV in the last however many years.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.040
 He is behind that Michelin web look as one of the writers for that.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.800
 He also writes for Charlie Brooker's screen wipe.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.320
 He's also the co-writer along with his buddy Joel of the Ladybird books.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.360
 Those adult ones have come out of the hipster and the cat and the hangover in the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360
 midlife crisis.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.880
 They've got a whole new batch coming out this October, October the fifth.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.440
 So do get them and he is on because he's a really good buddy of ours and he

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.040
 constantly sends us facts.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.760
 And we just saw this guy's going to be amazing on the show and he was as you're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.080
 about to hear. So enjoy this week's app. Here we go.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:01:10.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.480
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.240
 I am sitting here with Annotch's in Ski, Andrew Hunter Murray and Jason Hazley.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.360
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.160
 Starting with you, Jason.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.840
 My fact is the curator of the British lawnmower museum is allergic to grass.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.360
 So is it his mission to destroy all the grass in the world with lawnmowers?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 By mowing it to work. Yeah, exactly.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.440
 So it's suddenly very hateful back museum.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.680
 It's one act of revenge on gigantic scale.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.040
 This is a guy called Brian Radham who runs the British lawnmower museum in Southport.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.080
 He's an ex lawnmower racing champion.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 Oh, to say I mean he sits on lawnmowers.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.480
 Yes, that's a rather cool race.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.000
 But he had to give up racing because it was making him sneeze so much.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 Oh, so, so, but he, so he took his love of lawnmowers and turned it into the British lawnmower museum,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 which is a place to behold. I have to say.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.720
 Have you been to it? Yeah, I have.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240
 Oh, is it actually really good?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.240
 It's really good because it's one of those odd bits of the British museum

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.480
 that you sometimes get where you just get lots and lots of iterations of the same thing.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.280
 Which just makes it so interesting.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.480
 Yeah. So you're saying it's mainly lawnmowers?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000
 It is mainly lawnmowers, yeah.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 They do have what he calls grass cutters, which are lawnmowers he doesn't like.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.080
 Like the flymo, for instance, because the flymo doesn't have the helical blade that cuts the grass.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.120
 It has a thing that spins around and just wax at it.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.680
 So he leaves a very unsatisfactory cut.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.120
 So those are grass cutters, according to him, not lawnmowers.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 Right. So this, I, so I know that you've been there

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.160
 because I've read a book that you wrote called "Bollocks to Alt and Towers."

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.760
 Yes. And that's a chapter in it, right?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.720
 It is. Yeah.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.280
 So you did this as part of a big research mission.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.760
 It was, yeah, it was the mission of the books to try and find places to go for a day out

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 that were unexpected, unusual, esoteric, uncommercial.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.640
 That sort of thing.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 And there's lots and lots of little museums all over Britain.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 You know, there's a pencil museum in Kessik famously.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.960
 I've been there.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.760
 Which is great.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.320
 It is great.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.120
 But they had a terrible time.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 They were really badly flooded out.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.400
 Now, Kessik does flood, doesn't it?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.920
 Yeah, and I think it was last, yeah.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.840
 I think they might have only just reopened after this terrible, terrible flooding that they had.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 That sounds like to can survive flooding, can't they?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
 You can, because a pen museum, that would have been a problem.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.480
 Oh, terrible.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.040
 But you can lash the pencils together into a massive raft.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.440
 To escape a stride.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 Now, if it was a blotting paper museum, it would be really good, wouldn't it?

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.840
 Yeah, disaster.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.200
 Did you see at the Lorma Museum, the celebrity Lorma?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 Certainly did.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.600
 There is Brian May's Qualcast.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.760
 They asked Nicholas Parsons for a donation of a Lorma.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.720
 And he agreed.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.760
 And then, unfortunately, his shed was broken into.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.760
 And his Lorma was stolen.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.920
 So he gave them a pair of secateurs instead.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 But the crowning bit of the celebrity department is Joe Pascuali's strimmer.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.280
 What's so great about that?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.040
 Well, because I think just those three words,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120
 marking out as being possibly the finest museum exhibit in the country, don't they?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.720
 What I find really weird is that apparently they've got Albert Pierre points

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.520
 while the really famous hangman who hanged over 400 people,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.160
 which is kind of a more bid thing to have in the museum.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.840
 And someone on Pinterest pointed out when they went to the museum

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.680
 that it's actually hanging by a noose.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.480
 No, is it?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.440
 So that's quite nice.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.800
 That is in TV's taste.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.000
 Oh, I just saw it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.960
 He just said the least.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.680
 He didn't know any of the condemned people to death.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.120
 Nor did he hang any Lormos.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.400
 You're right, that's been misrepresented.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.480
 I forgot to mention the other significant thing about the Lorma Museum is that it's upstairs.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.520
 So all those Lormos must feel fairly...

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.120
 We're in an alien habitat, you know, we're so funny.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.600
 We're so far from the thing that we wish to cut.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.440
 The Dalek Museum being upstairs.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.640
 Yeah, it's great.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.880
 They've got a couple of other quirky things there as well.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.720
 They've got a two-inch Lormoa,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.320
 which is a Lormoa that cuts a two-inch strip through the grass.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.040
 Oh, wow.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.760
 And Brian Radham, when he came across this,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.000
 thought what on earth could this possibly have been for?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.520
 So he rang the manufacturer and said,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.440
 "Why did you make a two-inch Lormoa?"

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.240
 And they said, "We deny ever making a two-inch Lormoa."

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.120
 So no one knows what this thing was for.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.240
 Oh, wow.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.120
 Do you know about Finnish postmen and Lormos?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.160
 So postmen in Finland have started in the last year,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.360
 mowing their customers' lawns for a small fee,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.120
 because they're trying to find extra things to do,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.800
 because it doesn't take them all their time.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.960
 And maybe I think post is declining a little bit

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.400
 in terms of the amount of post we've done.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.040
 So on their quietest day, which is Tuesday,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.600
 you can pay them, I think, about 60 quid a month,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.640
 and they'll mow your lawn.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.120
 Wow.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.800
 But you have to provide the Lormoa.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.080
 The very insistent about that.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.760
 That's like in just on the postman, the lack of mail.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.560
 In New Zealand now, there's one particular city

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.680
 that delivers KFC, as well as your mail.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.000
 Wrap it around the bucket with an elastic band.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.680
 Yeah, there's doing a thing in France

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.040
 where you can get postmen to go and check on your elderly relatives

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.560
 if you don't want to, I presume.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.240
 You can pay, and it's called, "Watch over my parents."

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.080
 Well, and you can order them to call in

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.120
 and just check, no, just to check.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.480
 They're all right, either two, four or six times a week.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.640
 So in pre-Lormoa days, when people used to have to mow the lawn

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.800
 by hand, by size, there would be tailor-made size,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.240
 which would stay the same length.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.480
 And if you wanted to cut your grass different lengths

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.560
 in like the 17th, 13th centuries,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.520
 then you added wooden blocks to your shoes or took them off.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.760
 So if you had a lawn that you needed to be a bit longer,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.760
 rather than changing the length of the size,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.680
 or I guess the position where you held it,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.240
 then you put some wooden planks under your shoes.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.320
 Well, what if you were really short?

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.840
 And the size came in the same size.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.480
 Wouldn't you end up just hacking into the earth?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.360
 No, you just had to put very large wooden blocks under your shoes.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.360
 I said, I understand.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.880
 Your mowing stilts.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.800
 I don't know the size of that long.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.120
 Were they an accessory that you bought with them?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.400
 I'm not sure if they came as a package.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.680
 I'm sure they did a two-for-one deal.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.120
 But you'd have to have all your gardeners

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.360
 would have to have different size blocks,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.720
 wouldn't they, depending on their height?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.520
 Yeah.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.880
 And it's probably an amusing mix-up where two of the gardeners

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.040
 got the wrong block saw, and then, you know,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.400
 one bit of lawn was uneven.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.640
 Yeah, that was comedy sketches in the 18th century.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.200
 We're all about incorrectly mowing grass.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.600
 It was a better show.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.880
 Unless you had a very strict height policy when hiring gardeners.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.400
 Yes.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.760
 For the other thing, like, you know,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.360
 you must be this high to go on this ride.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.920
 Yes.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.520
 To be one of those.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.360
 I was trying to find other people who were, so,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.600
 lawnbower man, allergic to grass.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.440
 I managed to find a journalist

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.880
 who's allergic to newspaper.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.600
 Yeah, it's really unfortunate.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.200
 He has to go, right, he still does his job,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.000
 but he has to wear gloves now whenever he's at the office.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.400
 And it's to do with the ink that they use

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.080
 inside his name's Michael Dresser.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.600
 He's been with the paper 38 years,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.080
 so he's had this allergy for a really long time.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.120
 And it's the pine resin that they use in the newspaper ink.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.840
 So, yeah, so he can't touch the newspaper.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.960
 So he's allergic to that.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.600
 Found a marathon runner who's allergic to exercise.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.480
 You can be allergic to exercise.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.200
 In what way?

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.240
 So, as soon as she started running

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.000
 and doing any kind of exercise,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.880
 she would just come out with puffiness and rashes and all sorts.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.240
 Does she still run marathons?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.280
 Yeah, she does.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.920
 Yeah.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.840
 On other allergies, I think,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.960
 isn't Lisa Stansfield allergic to her own saliva?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.640
 Whoa!

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.840
 How do you...

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.360
 Pretty sure I've read that somewhere.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.080
 I don't know.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.600
 Or she's a singer.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.560
 How do you deal with that?

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.400
 I guess, get yourself a job which involves having your mouth open

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.000
 a lot of the time, like she did.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.280
 Wouldn't that provoke more saliva production?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.960
 Good question.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.920
 I haven't thought this through.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.720
 Maybe she had one of those dentist things in her mouth the whole time.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.920
 You know, when you're having any work done, they have that suction.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.680
 Well, that would have showed up on her singles, though, wouldn't it?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.440
 Yeah, but you might have mistaken that for that sort of Madonna-style microphone.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.480
 Oh, that's true, yeah.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.120
 She's the ones that goes into the mouth.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.440
 There's a constant background harm on all of her singles.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.600
 The dentist suction thing.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.320
 That's incredible.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.680
 Yeah.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.960
 The other thing from the Lormo Museum is they've got...

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.360
 There was a prototype of a robot Lormo there, called it,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.160
 made by Husqvarna, I think I've pronounced that right,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.040
 which cost something like a million pounds to develop

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.360
 and had a retail price of £2,000.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.000
 I'm so expensive that obviously it didn't sell very well,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.480
 which is a shame because it's got a brilliant anti-theft device built into it.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.040
 If it detects its being stolen, it starts screaming.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.920
 So, Husqvarna developed a screaming robot Lormo.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.600
 If only Nicholas Parsons had had one.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:16.320
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Chuzanski.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.240
 My effect this week is that Jimmy Carter once gave a speech in Poland

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.840
 where he accidentally announced he wanted to have sex with all Polish people.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.600
 So, when he said we never fired a bullet,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.520
 was he just talking about sexual frustration?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.160
 This was his first trip abroad as president.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.120
 It was in 1977, and he had this translator called Stephen Seymour,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.560
 and he was a good translator, but Polish was his fourth language.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.120
 And he was having to translate into Polish, and usually,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.240
 a translator's translating from the language into English,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.080
 if they all translate it.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.960
 But Jimmy Carter asked him to translate his speech into Polish

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:59.600
 with Polish people, and he translated the phrase "I want to get to know the Polish people better"

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.240
 as "I want to have sex with the Polish."

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.520
 Or "I want to have carnal sexual knowledge of the Polish people."

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.520
 So, that's what he did, and he made all these other mistakes in this speech as well.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.680
 For instance, he opened it by trying to say,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.480
 "I left the US just this morning to come here,"

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.200
 and he ended up saying, "I left the US never to return."

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.320
 He was moving to Poland. That would be a major league defection,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.760
 coup, for the Soviets.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.880
 I read that another of the reasons was that Seymour,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.800
 the original translator, was a really good translator of written Polish,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.960
 but it wasn't quite so good at simultaneous spoken translation.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.880
 I see. So maybe that was something to do with the tour.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.840
 Okay, yeah.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.320
 So he should have been writing it down on a big screen behind people, yeah.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.840
 So my favourite Jimmy Carter mis-translation in one of his speeches

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840
 is that we've all got one.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.160
 He's got a greatest hits list.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.680
 He was in Japan, and he was giving a speech,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.760
 and this is post him being president.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.240
 When he started the speech with a joke,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.320
 and halfway through, he realised, "Oh no, this is not going to translate."

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.200
 I'm telling a joke, and the punchline's just going to come out all wrong

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.840
 through translation of this Japanese translator.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.480
 So I'm just going to get this weird, confused silence.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.640
 But he's like, "I'm halfway through. I've got to do it."

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.160
 So he delivers the joke, and then the Japanese translator,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.000
 translate, and it gets this massive laugh, humongous laugh.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.920
 And so afterwards, he went up to the guy and said,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.400
 "That is incredible that you managed to translate that joke.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.160
 You must be an incredible translator."

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.840
 And the translator said, "Oh, no, what I did actually was say,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.080
 President Carter just told a joke. Everyone must laugh."

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.680
 That resulted in just trying all of his laugh.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.920
 What a dude.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.240
 Is that translator still working?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.560
 And does he do stat-up gigs in the UK, please?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.800
 So did you know that Jimmy Carter set up a hotline

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.400
 that you could ring to report people for being too cool?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.920
 This is true.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.560
 He was a big environmentalist, Jimmy Carter,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.440
 who set up the Department of the Environment in the States,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.000
 and he put solar panels on the roof of the White House.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.480
 And one of the things he did was that he, at some point,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.600
 he passed a law saying that air conditioning in government buildings and businesses

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.280
 couldn't go any lower than 26.7 degrees Celsius, which is 80 Fahrenheit.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.640
 That is quite hard.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.360
 It is quite hard, isn't it?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.880
 And this effective 55 million people

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.880
 who had a very sweaty time.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.120
 But he set up a hotline so that you could ring and report people

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.120
 if they turned their aircon lower than that.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.800
 And they could be given a $10,000 fine.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.080
 No, of course, Reagan took the solar panel straight off, didn't he?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.480
 When he went to the White House, what was that in the face?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.440
 He said they were a joke.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.680
 Jimmy Carter has won three Grammys.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.880
 I see.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.000
 Yeah, for what?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.720
 Spoken word, so all the spoken word of his books that he keeps pumping out.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.000
 He's written a lot of books, and he's won three Grammys,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.480
 but he's been nominated a lot more times.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.520
 I think he, looking through the list of spoken word Grammys,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.600
 he has been nominated more than anyone else.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.240
 Really?

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:10.880
 Yeah.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.680
 He lost in 1999 to Christopher E.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.840
 He lost in 2002 to Quincy Jones.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.840
 In 2008, he lost to Obama, but he was up against Obama as was Bill Clinton.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.040
 So three of the nominees were presidents of the United States of America, the Grammys.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.520
 That was the big presidential race of 2008, wasn't it?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.360
 That was the one I was watching.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.080
 Yeah.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.160
 Then he lost in 2010 to Michael J. Fox.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.240
 Then he lost in 2015 to Joan Rivers.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.320
 But then he won in 2016.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.000
 That feels like a pissy win.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.600
 After all that effort, that feels like he's gone, just give it to him.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.560
 I'll go away.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.920
 I love Jimmy Carter.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.720
 Do you?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.920
 He's just the best guy.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.400
 He's just the most principled moral guy.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.400
 So he's the only president who doesn't really take speaking fees,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.560
 and any speaking fee has ever taken, which is always minimal goes to charity.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.280
 Do you think he stopped taking them because he keeps making such massive gaps?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.320
 It's automatically audience by accident by a translation.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.960
 Always just coming on to whoever's listening.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.880
 He still gives, I was listening to a podcast, which is really good.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.760
 It's the Washington Post presidential podcast, and they did about an hour on every president.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.200
 So it followed Jimmy Carter.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.400
 From start to finish.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.120
 That's how, you've got quite esoteric tastes.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.400
 An hour without 45 now.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.600
 I mean, I haven't, I haven't listened to, like, rather, for B. Hayes or anything yet.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.360
 I don't know how I'd fare there.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.120
 But he still gives Sunday school classes, and people come all over the world to listen.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.760
 But, you know, he's really, he's an evangelical born again, Christian.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.760
 So he just gives religious lessons at Sunday school every week.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.200
 He's just such a decent guy.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.960
 I'm still a senior UFO, hasn't he?

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.000
 Yeah, he's also a bit weird.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.480
 It's a very famous incident of Jimmy Carter claiming to have seen a UFO.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.680
 One of the promises he made in his presidential campaign was that

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.080
 he would investigate all extraterrestrial experiences or something, I think.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.400
 And then when he got into power, he said he couldn't, because it was all too secret or something.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.920
 He's too busy now to go around.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.640
 Yeah.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.480
 Turns out he's a counter-photo-class.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.400
 He builds houses, doesn't he, as well?

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.320
 Yeah, and fun, amazing furniture.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.120
 Does he?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.800
 Yeah, come on, how good is the furniture?

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.200
 It sells for, I think I might have mentioned this before, but if I haven't,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.240
 yeah, he builds, like, beds and Tests and Royals.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.240
 And do you say it sells for a lot of money?

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.880
 Yeah, thousands.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.440
 But how much would it sell for if you sold it under a pseudonym?

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.840
 It wouldn't necessarily be an eccentric thing to do.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.200
 Yeah, he sent his first text three years ago, Jimmy Carter.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.400
 Oh, well done, Jimmy.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.120
 Yeah.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.160
 And his second text, this was the message of his second text.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.440
 It was, I did not mean to send that first text about wanting to have sex with you.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.080
 I'm sorry.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.240
 I'm still using Seymour to translate all my stuff.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.960
 Yeah, no, his second text was, that was my first text message.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.120
 Yeah, he was his first text.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.320
 This is my first text, too.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.080
 That was his second text.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.360
 Has it gone on like that, too?

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.920
 Yeah, no, it was to his grandson.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.040
 And it was, did you see, Colbert last night, P?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.280
 He ends up with P, which I think he's just referred to as Papa.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.200
 But his grandson is on Twitter, so he did a screen grab of it.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.000
 It might be president.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.440
 It might just be a real ask about it.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.240
 Yeah.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.840
 Did you know Patti O'Furnich will make her?

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.520
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.360
 And that is my fact.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.440
 My fact this week is that narcissists don't like looking at themselves.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.640
 [BUZZER]

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.280
 It's not weird.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.240
 So this is a new study that's come out of Austria

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.080
 from the University of Gratz.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.280
 And the idea is that they took a pool of around 600 people

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.560
 and surveyed them to see whether or not they were narcissistic.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.640
 And so out of that, they found 43 people that they selected 21

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.120
 who scored really highly as being narcissistic

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.120
 and 22 with lower scores.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.360
 And they were shown pictures of themselves

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.280
 and close family friends and so on.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.520
 And their brain activity, which was monitored every time

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.960
 they saw the picture of themselves.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.960
 When their eyes locked onto themselves,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.240
 it registered as not enjoying it.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.360
 Yeah, which is--

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.560
 And that was not enjoying it more so than non-asicists.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.800
 Or maybe just enjoying it the same amount or--

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.160
 Not having this in a special surge of enjoyment, I guess.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.640
 Yeah.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.520
 Yeah, which is--

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.480
 I've just realised because obviously narcissists in the myth

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.760
 does like looking at himself.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.040
 You've just got this fact.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.840
 Yeah.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.400
 That says he likes it a lot to his detriment.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.280
 It turns out--

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.480
 This is he die.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.720
 He doesn't die, but he gets turned into a flower.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.240
 I would say that is a kind of death.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.120
 That is a plot twist.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.000
 I did not see coming.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.480
 It's a daffodil.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.600
 Isn't it that he was turned into?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.680
 Well, we think it's a narcissist.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.560
 It's like it always--

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.000
 There's flower called narcissists, which is yeah.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.320
 And they sort of droop over the riverbank, Daniel,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.480
 and they look like they're looking at themselves

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.840
 with their little trumpets.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.640
 So that's why he was turned into one of those either gods.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.440
 But I think he starved to death first

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.760
 because he was so captivated by his reflection.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.800
 And I should just say for the pedants out there,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.560
 when you're on his watch, QI, that we don't know

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.280
 that the etymology of narcissists, the flower,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.240
 comes from narcissists, the person.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.360
 To me, it seems so obvious that it definitely does.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.880
 It's a flower that he was turned into,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.240
 and it drapes over lakes.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.120
 But some people say it's related to a word that means to poison

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.880
 or something.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.800
 They're OK.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.840
 They might be totally unrelated to each other.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.000
 Do you know how to tell us someone's a narcissist?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.720
 You just ask them.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.920
 Because they don't care.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.840
 They'll say, yeah, I'm a narcissist.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.760
 That's true, yeah.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.640
 The psychologists have developed a one-question test

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.040
 for narcissism.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.360
 Wow.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.840
 And it's a pretty good one.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.080
 And then there's a more advanced one, which

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.040
 is a 40-question test.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.600
 But it replicates pretty closely the one-question test.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.760
 Do you guys know about the Anna-Face Facial Beauty Analysis?

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760
 No.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.800
 This is the thing you can do.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.920
 I thought, OK, well, let's do something

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.080
 about looking at yourself.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.120
 So I went on this website, and it takes a photo of your face,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.640
 and then it analyzes you, and it gives you

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.320
 your facial beauty analysis.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.960
 So that's what the kind of thing a narcissist would do?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.520
 It does, doesn't it?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.200
 Yeah.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.000
 So I was roleplaying.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.960
 So this is how my facial beauty analysis reads.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.880
 Your nose is too long for your ears.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.840
 Your inner ocular distance is too big for your eyes.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.160
 Your nose is too wide for your face with.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.720
 Your face is too narrow.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.440
 Your nose is too wide for your mouth.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.240
 Wow.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.840
 Look, only some of that is true.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.680
 Pretty brutal, isn't it?

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.520
 What I got stuck on though is your nose

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.600
 is too long for your ears.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.400
 How do those things correlate?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.800
 How are you not that your ears are too short for your nose?

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.560
 Yeah.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.720
 Why's the nose to blame?

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.400
 No, it's done.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.480
 But I don't think you could fit it in your ears, even if you want to.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.920
 No, I don't think so.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.080
 God knows I've tried.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.360
 Well, it's not that long, then, is it?

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.160
 If you can't even fit it in your ears.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.440
 So what was it trying to tell you?

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.640
 I think it succeeded in telling me exactly what it wanted

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.560
 to tell you.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.240
 It may just be an exercise in--

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.760
 I don't know.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.080
 --buse, honesty, no idea.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.360
 What's the URL for that?

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.600
 It's ANA face.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.120
 ANA face.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.760
 Definitely doing that.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.320
 I was looking up stuff about looking in mirrors.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.880
 Yeah.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.000
 You know the thing about animals looking in mirrors.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.920
 Which I think we must have mentioned before.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.960
 Don't they do it?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.000
 But they do it.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.880
 And the way to tell if they can tell that they are the animal in the mirror

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.400
 is by painting a dot on them.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.640
 And then if they try and get rid of the dot, that's how they know.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.360
 This was invented by a guy called Gordon Gallup, Jr.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.040
 This was his innovation experiment in the 1970s.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.840
 Although one of the first people to do it

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.160
 was Charles Darwin, who in 1838 went to London Zoo

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.480
 and entered an orangutan's cage with a mirror to experiment.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480
 Wow.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.320
 Well, that's been done all this time.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320
 Yeah, wow.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.000
 And the orangutan loved it.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.040
 He said she was astonished beyond measure.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.680
 But did she know it was her reflection?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.800
 Don't know.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.600
 I don't think he did the dot test.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.320
 Did you know about the 17th century fashion

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.240
 for having a mirror hanging on the wall of your drawing room?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.800
 And then next to it, an oil painting of exactly the reflection in the mirror.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.600
 What?

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600
 No.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.560
 Really?

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560
 Yeah.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.800
 That's cool.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.560
 I couldn't find out anything more about this.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.160
 I came across this fact and then couldn't get anywhere further with it.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.560
 But it was-- I don't know whether it was in order to show off the artist

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.120
 or in order to show off the-- what the mirror can see.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.720
 Yeah.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.600
 Right.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.560
 What a hassle, because if you ever wanted to redecorate,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.360
 you always have to hang those two next to each other then.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:40.880
 Yeah.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.160
 And in the same position, actually, obviously, because you can't move the mirror, can you?

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.640
 Otherwise, it's not going to reflect the same thing.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.120
 And also, if you walk up to the wrong one, you might think you're a vampire.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.600
 There was another weird fashion for the Claude Glass, which was about the same time.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.840
 I think the 18th century, which was a period of time where people decided that

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.920
 beautiful views and landscapes actually looked more attractive in mirrors

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.200
 than they did in real life, just with the bare eyes.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.200
 And so this Claude Glass was invented, and people would walk up mountains,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.000
 and they'd take a Claude Glass with them.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.480
 And the idea was that you got to the top of a mountain, and then you get to take out

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480
 this mirror, and it would be a tinted mirror.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.920
 So it gave it a bit of a ethereal dreamlike quality.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.840
 And you'd get to look at the view in a mirror and then go down again.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.320
 But you'd have to face away, wouldn't you, from the view?

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:28.560
 Yeah.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.120
 Look into the mirror, see the view behind you.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.440
 Imagine how bizarre that is.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.560
 So you're facing away from the thing you've come up the thing to see.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:35.880
 Yeah.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.440
 And you can look at it in the mirror, which is exactly like the selfie thing,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.480
 where you get a lot of people facing away from the view.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.240
 Oh, yes.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.280
 For a hell of a friend of yours.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.600
 So that's the original selfie.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.640
 That's it.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.120
 It's sort of the original selfie.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.920
 Yes.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.640
 Yeah, kind of.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.760
 How we all got quite excited about that for a minute was cool.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.760
 So listen, Narcissus then was, because he was in love with his own reflection,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.320
 he might not have liked seeing a picture of himself, because that would have been

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.560
 the right way round.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560
 Yeah.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560
 Oh, yes.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560
 Absolutely.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560
 Yes.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.840
 So that's why people tend to much prefer their reflection to pictures, isn't it?

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.840
 Yeah.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.400
 Because the image you're used to seeing is the one in the mirror, but as soon as you see

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.240
 a photo, you think, oh, my face is too big.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.600
 No one knows it's too long for your ears.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600
 OK.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600
 OK.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:32.080
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.400
 My fact is that clenching one's buttocks is a technique Christy's auctioneers are taught

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.080
 to stop their hands shaking.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.600
 But it doesn't actually say where they're being told to put their hands while they're clenching

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600
 their buttocks.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.600
 Yeah.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.760
 So this is a piece about extraordinary things that Christy's has found out over the years.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.540
 It's by Christy's, and one of them was this amazing fact about how the auctioneers calm

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.540
 themselves down.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.540
 Wow.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.040
 Are they having them holding priceless bits of art, or is this when they're actually conducting

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.040
 your auctioneer?

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.860
 I think when you're conducting an auction because you're standing at the front of the front

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:10.180
 of everyone and you're gesturing, so you have to look in control of the situation, I suppose.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.180
 Yeah.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.180
 And so that apparently comes.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.300
 I don't know how, what the mechanism is, whether simply the focusing on another muscle in

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.860
 your body removes the tension from your hands.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.860
 Yeah, I must do.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.860
 Right?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.860
 I guess so.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.860
 I don't know.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.860
 I'm trying it now, and I think it makes you a bit more shaky.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:30.220
 But I'm, so I guess the shaking is because they talk about auctioneers as being a sort of

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.740
 an acting gig almost.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.700
 You get up on stage and you need to make the audience love you because that's going to

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.600
 make an auction successful, and on Christy's site, they were saying, with interviews of various

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.300
 auctioneers, the first 10 seconds is where you need to grab them, otherwise you might not

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.540
 have a successful auction, which seems bizarre if you're there to buy things.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540
 Do you know what I mean?

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.180
 Like it's, you're not buying off this guy's credibility.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.180
 You're buying because there's...

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.180
 But you are.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.480
 I mean, I remember going to a, which is quite similar, what's it called when you go to a charity

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.480
 thing and...

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.480
 Raffle.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.620
 No, there's above a raffle where you bid for...

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.620
 Super raffle?

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.620
 Yeah.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:13.300
 One of those things where like you donate a holiday or you donate your mansion for a week.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.860
 Oh, yeah, I've been to loads of things where people who donate to their mansion.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.860
 Where am I being?

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.860
 Oh.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.860
 We mix in different circles.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.860
 What's it called?

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.860
 It's a charity auction.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.780
 Yeah, so you know when you go to a charity auction, it's...

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:30.100
 You inspire people to buy stuff just by being that charming, I remember going to one recently

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.020
 in Clive Anderson was doing the auctioning and people definitely bid on stuff that they

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.420
 would absolutely not have had to not kind of cajold them a bit here and persuaded them

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.420
 a bit there.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.660
 I think it makes such a difference because it's in the moment, isn't it?

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.940
 That's where it affects you in an auction.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.940
 That's true.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.180
 I did a gig not too long ago with a Christie's auctioneer and it was a very rowdy room

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:53.620
 and it was a charity night, it was raising money for this new university for brain studies

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:59.180
 and he was given a lot of stuff to auction off and the room was chaotic as you would expect

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.740
 it was in the V&A, everyone was just busy on round tables eating so he had to try and maintain

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.060
 their attention in order to sell all this stuff and he did this trick.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:13.700
 When he felt like he lost the crowd, he went, he made that noise and every time the crowd

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.020
 would silence, look back to him and then he'd continue on with the auction.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.980
 But he did it like 50 times during the night.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.460
 Well they all ponies.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.380
 It was an amazing technique, that's how he shut up an entire row.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.780
 Yeah, one of the things I didn't realise is that auctioneers will keep an eye on each

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.100
 other as well.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.060
 So one of them, if they feel that if auctioneer A is up there and he doesn't think he's

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.420
 quite got the room, he's not inspiring them and I think he can nod to auctioneer B who

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.820
 will come up and take his place and try and raise the temperature of the room and it works

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.820
 the other way round as well.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.860
 auctioneer B can just go up to him and tap him on the shoulder and go, you've lost him

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:47.860
 mate, I'll do it.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.860
 Wow.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.860
 It's like a tag team.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.060
 Imagine if that was true in all performing arts, imagine Andy, if you're bombing one night and Dan

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.180
 just comes up behind you taps you on the shoulder and says I'll take it from him.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.180
 What do you mean imagined?

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.100
 Remember, I think it's the one you're looking for.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.780
 So in the old days I have to do mock auctions, the auctioneers at Christie's before the

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.820
 bosses of the company to just make sure that the skills were good.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.300
 The bosses would just sit around with the drink and then the auctioneers would have to do

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.300
 it.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.300
 Oh really?

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.500
 It's all a bit more professional now so they get voice actors and acting coaches in to

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.700
 teach them about engaging the voice and maybe also about posture and engaging the audience

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.700
 I don't know.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.940
 Well Christie's does in house courses, if you want to get into it.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.100
 You spend, you do a workshop with one of them.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.100
 Yeah.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.100
 Wolverhampton actually has a two year degree for auctioneering.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.100
 Right.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.860
 Yeah, they teach you to auctioneer and to value things as well.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.860
 But yeah.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.340
 How much money do I have over this place on the Yorkshire University auction course?

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.340
 9,000 pounds.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.340
 9,000 pounds over here.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.340
 Do I hit ten?

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.340
 Yeah.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.340
 So did anybody look up butter clenching?

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.340
 No.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.380
 No more than usual.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.940
 So butter clenching, you're all aware of the international penny chuffing competition

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.940
 are you?

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.940
 No.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.660
 In the case annually at the new year in Wedmore in Somerset where the contestants have

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:14.300
 to clench three two pence coins in between the cheeks of their butters, then walk, waddle

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.740
 or hop, four yards across the pub before depositing the coins in a pint glass.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.740
 Wow.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.740
 Oh my god.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.980
 You get one point for every coin you get in the glass and the last report that I could

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.620
 find from 2015, three people scored nine points.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.620
 Is that the full?

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.940
 So they're managed three journeys across the pub.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.940
 Oh wow.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.340
 Do you have to pick them up with your buttocks?

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.140
 That isn't indicated.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.140
 OK.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:48.260
 Nor is what happens to the coins afterwards, whether they go into a particular till.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.820
 Is it a full point and do you have to down it once you've finished?

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.820
 No, it's just a pint glass.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.820
 No, that's a shame.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.820
 That would make the competition more fun.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.820
 No, it would, wouldn't it?

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.820
 Yeah.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.820
 Yeah.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.820
 That is fantastic.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.340
 I don't like to brag.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.500
 I think I could do that.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.940
 Well, there's only one way to find out.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.220
 So some of that is the other thing of course, right?

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.660
 If you put yourself in the room there, that's a lot of bum, isn't it?

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.660
 Yes.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.780
 Now, what happens is, apparently, they have, they have some sort of modesty blanket

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:21.380
 that they put around themselves while hopping, waddling or walking four yards across the

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.820
 pub with some money up there, ask.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:32.940
 Didn't David Souchet, the pyro actor, he did a lot of butt clenching as well?

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.940
 Did he?

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.940
 Yeah, to get into the role.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.940
 To get the model, right?

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.940
 Yeah.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.940
 He wanted to be as pert as an auctioneer, didn't he?

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.940
 Yeah.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.100
 Is it called the Souchet Sache?

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.100
 No.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.100
 You made that up?

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.100
 Yeah.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.100
 Well, treat it.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.100
 Treat it, treat it.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.100
 It's not.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.700
 I feel like it's not mine to trademark, I don't think.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:55.740
 But, guys, telegraph headline, David Souchet, I stuck coin in buttocks to walk like pyro.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.220
 And also to win this competition at the new inn in Wedmore.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.980
 No, he was caught in a pub in Somerset with a modesty blanket right?

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:09.820
 Like, this is a money up his ass and he said, "Oh, I was doing it for the role."

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.660
 Okay, that's it.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.020
 That is all of our facts.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.500
