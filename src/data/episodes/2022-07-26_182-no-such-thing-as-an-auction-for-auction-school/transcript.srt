00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode and no such thing as a fish before we begin.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,520
 We just want to let you in on the special guests that we have this week.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,680
 He's called Jason Hazley and he is one of the people behind all the funny

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,080
 things you've probably seen on TV in the last however many years.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,040
 He is behind that Michelin web look as one of the writers for that.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,800
 He also writes for Charlie Brooker's screen wipe.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,320
 He's also the co-writer along with his buddy Joel of the Ladybird books.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,360
 Those adult ones have come out of the hipster and the cat and the hangover in the

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 midlife crisis.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,880
 They've got a whole new batch coming out this October, October the fifth.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,440
 So do get them and he is on because he's a really good buddy of ours and he

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
 constantly sends us facts.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,760
 And we just saw this guy's going to be amazing on the show and he was as you're

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,080
 about to hear. So enjoy this week's app. Here we go.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:01:10,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,480
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,680
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,240
 I am sitting here with Annotch's in Ski, Andrew Hunter Murray and Jason Hazley.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,360
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,160
 Starting with you, Jason.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,840
 My fact is the curator of the British lawnmower museum is allergic to grass.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,360
 So is it his mission to destroy all the grass in the world with lawnmowers?

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
 By mowing it to work. Yeah, exactly.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,760
 Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,440
 So it's suddenly very hateful back museum.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,680
 It's one act of revenge on gigantic scale.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,040
 This is a guy called Brian Radham who runs the British lawnmower museum in Southport.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,080
 He's an ex lawnmower racing champion.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,080
 Oh, to say I mean he sits on lawnmowers.

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,480
 Yes, that's a rather cool race.

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,000
 But he had to give up racing because it was making him sneeze so much.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,680
 Oh, so, so, but he, so he took his love of lawnmowers and turned it into the British lawnmower museum,

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,040
 which is a place to behold. I have to say.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
 Have you been to it? Yeah, I have.

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,240
 Oh, is it actually really good?

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 It's really good because it's one of those odd bits of the British museum

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,480
 that you sometimes get where you just get lots and lots of iterations of the same thing.

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
 Which just makes it so interesting.

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,480
 Yeah. So you're saying it's mainly lawnmowers?

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,000
 It is mainly lawnmowers, yeah.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,600
 They do have what he calls grass cutters, which are lawnmowers he doesn't like.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,080
 Like the flymo, for instance, because the flymo doesn't have the helical blade that cuts the grass.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
 It has a thing that spins around and just wax at it.

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
 So he leaves a very unsatisfactory cut.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,120
 So those are grass cutters, according to him, not lawnmowers.

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
 Right. So this, I, so I know that you've been there

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,160
 because I've read a book that you wrote called "Bollocks to Alt and Towers."

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
 Yes. And that's a chapter in it, right?

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,720
 It is. Yeah.

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
 So you did this as part of a big research mission.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,760
 It was, yeah, it was the mission of the books to try and find places to go for a day out

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,760
 that were unexpected, unusual, esoteric, uncommercial.

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,640
 That sort of thing.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,600
 And there's lots and lots of little museums all over Britain.

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,160
 You know, there's a pencil museum in Kessik famously.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,960
 I've been there.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
 Which is great.

59
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,320
 It is great.

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,120
 But they had a terrible time.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
 They were really badly flooded out.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
 Now, Kessik does flood, doesn't it?

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
 Yeah, and I think it was last, yeah.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
 I think they might have only just reopened after this terrible, terrible flooding that they had.

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 That sounds like to can survive flooding, can't they?

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
 You can, because a pen museum, that would have been a problem.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,480
 Oh, terrible.

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,040
 But you can lash the pencils together into a massive raft.

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
 To escape a stride.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
 Now, if it was a blotting paper museum, it would be really good, wouldn't it?

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
 Yeah, disaster.

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
 Did you see at the Lorma Museum, the celebrity Lorma?

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
 Certainly did.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,600
 There is Brian May's Qualcast.

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,760
 They asked Nicholas Parsons for a donation of a Lorma.

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
 And he agreed.

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,760
 And then, unfortunately, his shed was broken into.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 And his Lorma was stolen.

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
 So he gave them a pair of secateurs instead.

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,760
 But the crowning bit of the celebrity department is Joe Pascuali's strimmer.

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,280
 What's so great about that?

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,040
 Well, because I think just those three words,

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
 marking out as being possibly the finest museum exhibit in the country, don't they?

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,720
 What I find really weird is that apparently they've got Albert Pierre points

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,520
 while the really famous hangman who hanged over 400 people,

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,160
 which is kind of a more bid thing to have in the museum.

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
 And someone on Pinterest pointed out when they went to the museum

88
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
 that it's actually hanging by a noose.

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
 No, is it?

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
 So that's quite nice.

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
 That is in TV's taste.

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
 Oh, I just saw it.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,960
 He just said the least.

94
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,680
 He didn't know any of the condemned people to death.

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
 Nor did he hang any Lormos.

96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
 You're right, that's been misrepresented.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,480
 I forgot to mention the other significant thing about the Lorma Museum is that it's upstairs.

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
 So all those Lormos must feel fairly...

99
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
 We're in an alien habitat, you know, we're so funny.

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
 We're so far from the thing that we wish to cut.

101
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
 The Dalek Museum being upstairs.

102
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
 Yeah, it's great.

103
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,880
 They've got a couple of other quirky things there as well.

104
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
 They've got a two-inch Lormoa,

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
 which is a Lormoa that cuts a two-inch strip through the grass.

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,040
 Oh, wow.

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,760
 And Brian Radham, when he came across this,

108
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,000
 thought what on earth could this possibly have been for?

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
 So he rang the manufacturer and said,

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
 "Why did you make a two-inch Lormoa?"

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
 And they said, "We deny ever making a two-inch Lormoa."

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
 So no one knows what this thing was for.

113
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
 Oh, wow.

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
 Do you know about Finnish postmen and Lormos?

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
 So postmen in Finland have started in the last year,

116
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
 mowing their customers' lawns for a small fee,

117
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
 because they're trying to find extra things to do,

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
 because it doesn't take them all their time.

119
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
 And maybe I think post is declining a little bit

120
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,400
 in terms of the amount of post we've done.

121
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,040
 So on their quietest day, which is Tuesday,

122
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,600
 you can pay them, I think, about 60 quid a month,

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,640
 and they'll mow your lawn.

124
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,120
 Wow.

125
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
 But you have to provide the Lormoa.

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
 The very insistent about that.

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,760
 That's like in just on the postman, the lack of mail.

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,560
 In New Zealand now, there's one particular city

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
 that delivers KFC, as well as your mail.

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
 Wrap it around the bucket with an elastic band.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
 Yeah, there's doing a thing in France

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,040
 where you can get postmen to go and check on your elderly relatives

133
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,560
 if you don't want to, I presume.

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
 You can pay, and it's called, "Watch over my parents."

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
 Well, and you can order them to call in

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
 and just check, no, just to check.

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,480
 They're all right, either two, four or six times a week.

138
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,640
 So in pre-Lormoa days, when people used to have to mow the lawn

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,800
 by hand, by size, there would be tailor-made size,

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,240
 which would stay the same length.

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,480
 And if you wanted to cut your grass different lengths

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,560
 in like the 17th, 13th centuries,

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
 then you added wooden blocks to your shoes or took them off.

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,760
 So if you had a lawn that you needed to be a bit longer,

145
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
 rather than changing the length of the size,

146
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,680
 or I guess the position where you held it,

147
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
 then you put some wooden planks under your shoes.

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,320
 Well, what if you were really short?

149
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,840
 And the size came in the same size.

150
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,480
 Wouldn't you end up just hacking into the earth?

151
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,360
 No, you just had to put very large wooden blocks under your shoes.

152
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
 I said, I understand.

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
 Your mowing stilts.

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
 I don't know the size of that long.

155
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
 Were they an accessory that you bought with them?

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,400
 I'm not sure if they came as a package.

157
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
 I'm sure they did a two-for-one deal.

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
 But you'd have to have all your gardeners

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
 would have to have different size blocks,

160
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
 wouldn't they, depending on their height?

161
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
 Yeah.

162
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
 And it's probably an amusing mix-up where two of the gardeners

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,040
 got the wrong block saw, and then, you know,

164
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,400
 one bit of lawn was uneven.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,640
 Yeah, that was comedy sketches in the 18th century.

166
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,200
 We're all about incorrectly mowing grass.

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,600
 It was a better show.

168
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,880
 Unless you had a very strict height policy when hiring gardeners.

169
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
 Yes.

170
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,760
 For the other thing, like, you know,

171
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
 you must be this high to go on this ride.

172
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,920
 Yes.

173
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,520
 To be one of those.

174
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,360
 I was trying to find other people who were, so,

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,600
 lawnbower man, allergic to grass.

176
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,440
 I managed to find a journalist

177
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,880
 who's allergic to newspaper.

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,600
 Yeah, it's really unfortunate.

179
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
 He has to go, right, he still does his job,

180
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,000
 but he has to wear gloves now whenever he's at the office.

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
 And it's to do with the ink that they use

182
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
 inside his name's Michael Dresser.

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,600
 He's been with the paper 38 years,

184
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,080
 so he's had this allergy for a really long time.

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
 And it's the pine resin that they use in the newspaper ink.

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
 So, yeah, so he can't touch the newspaper.

187
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
 So he's allergic to that.

188
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,600
 Found a marathon runner who's allergic to exercise.

189
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,480
 You can be allergic to exercise.

190
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,200
 In what way?

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,240
 So, as soon as she started running

192
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
 and doing any kind of exercise,

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,880
 she would just come out with puffiness and rashes and all sorts.

194
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
 Does she still run marathons?

195
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,280
 Yeah, she does.

196
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,920
 Yeah.

197
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,840
 On other allergies, I think,

198
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,960
 isn't Lisa Stansfield allergic to her own saliva?

199
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,640
 Whoa!

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
 How do you...

201
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
 Pretty sure I've read that somewhere.

202
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
 I don't know.

203
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
 Or she's a singer.

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,560
 How do you deal with that?

205
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,400
 I guess, get yourself a job which involves having your mouth open

206
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,000
 a lot of the time, like she did.

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,280
 Oh, yeah.

208
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
 Wouldn't that provoke more saliva production?

209
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,960
 Good question.

210
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,920
 I haven't thought this through.

211
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
 Maybe she had one of those dentist things in her mouth the whole time.

212
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
 You know, when you're having any work done, they have that suction.

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
 Well, that would have showed up on her singles, though, wouldn't it?

214
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
 Yeah, but you might have mistaken that for that sort of Madonna-style microphone.

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
 Oh, that's true, yeah.

216
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,120
 She's the ones that goes into the mouth.

217
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
 There's a constant background harm on all of her singles.

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
 The dentist suction thing.

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
 That's incredible.

220
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,680
 Yeah.

221
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,960
 The other thing from the Lormo Museum is they've got...

222
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,360
 There was a prototype of a robot Lormo there, called it,

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
 made by Husqvarna, I think I've pronounced that right,

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
 which cost something like a million pounds to develop

225
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
 and had a retail price of £2,000.

226
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
 I'm so expensive that obviously it didn't sell very well,

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
 which is a shame because it's got a brilliant anti-theft device built into it.

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,040
 If it detects its being stolen, it starts screaming.

229
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
 So, Husqvarna developed a screaming robot Lormo.

230
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,600
 If only Nicholas Parsons had had one.

231
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:16,320
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Chuzanski.

232
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
 My effect this week is that Jimmy Carter once gave a speech in Poland

233
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,840
 where he accidentally announced he wanted to have sex with all Polish people.

234
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,600
 So, when he said we never fired a bullet,

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,520
 was he just talking about sexual frustration?

236
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,160
 This was his first trip abroad as president.

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,120
 It was in 1977, and he had this translator called Stephen Seymour,

238
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,560
 and he was a good translator, but Polish was his fourth language.

239
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
 And he was having to translate into Polish, and usually,

240
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
 a translator's translating from the language into English,

241
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
 if they all translate it.

242
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,960
 But Jimmy Carter asked him to translate his speech into Polish

243
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,600
 with Polish people, and he translated the phrase "I want to get to know the Polish people better"

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
 as "I want to have sex with the Polish."

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,520
 Or "I want to have carnal sexual knowledge of the Polish people."

246
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,520
 So, that's what he did, and he made all these other mistakes in this speech as well.

247
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,680
 For instance, he opened it by trying to say,

248
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,480
 "I left the US just this morning to come here,"

249
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
 and he ended up saying, "I left the US never to return."

250
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,320
 He was moving to Poland. That would be a major league defection,

251
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
 coup, for the Soviets.

252
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,880
 I read that another of the reasons was that Seymour,

253
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
 the original translator, was a really good translator of written Polish,

254
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,960
 but it wasn't quite so good at simultaneous spoken translation.

255
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,880
 I see. So maybe that was something to do with the tour.

256
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,840
 Okay, yeah.

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,320
 So he should have been writing it down on a big screen behind people, yeah.

258
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,840
 So my favourite Jimmy Carter mis-translation in one of his speeches

259
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
 is that we've all got one.

260
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,160
 He's got a greatest hits list.

261
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,680
 He was in Japan, and he was giving a speech,

262
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
 and this is post him being president.

263
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
 When he started the speech with a joke,

264
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
 and halfway through, he realised, "Oh no, this is not going to translate."

265
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,200
 I'm telling a joke, and the punchline's just going to come out all wrong

266
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,840
 through translation of this Japanese translator.

267
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,480
 So I'm just going to get this weird, confused silence.

268
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,640
 But he's like, "I'm halfway through. I've got to do it."

269
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,160
 So he delivers the joke, and then the Japanese translator,

270
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,000
 translate, and it gets this massive laugh, humongous laugh.

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
 And so afterwards, he went up to the guy and said,

272
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,400
 "That is incredible that you managed to translate that joke.

273
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,160
 You must be an incredible translator."

274
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,840
 And the translator said, "Oh, no, what I did actually was say,

275
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,080
 President Carter just told a joke. Everyone must laugh."

276
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,680
 That resulted in just trying all of his laugh.

277
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
 What a dude.

278
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,240
 Is that translator still working?

279
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
 And does he do stat-up gigs in the UK, please?

280
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,800
 So did you know that Jimmy Carter set up a hotline

281
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,400
 that you could ring to report people for being too cool?

282
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,920
 This is true.

283
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,560
 He was a big environmentalist, Jimmy Carter,

284
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
 who set up the Department of the Environment in the States,

285
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
 and he put solar panels on the roof of the White House.

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
 And one of the things he did was that he, at some point,

287
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
 he passed a law saying that air conditioning in government buildings and businesses

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,280
 couldn't go any lower than 26.7 degrees Celsius, which is 80 Fahrenheit.

289
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,640
 That is quite hard.

290
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,360
 It is quite hard, isn't it?

291
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,880
 And this effective 55 million people

292
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
 who had a very sweaty time.

293
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,120
 But he set up a hotline so that you could ring and report people

294
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
 if they turned their aircon lower than that.

295
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,800
 And they could be given a $10,000 fine.

296
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,080
 No, of course, Reagan took the solar panel straight off, didn't he?

297
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,480
 When he went to the White House, what was that in the face?

298
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
 He said they were a joke.

299
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,680
 Jimmy Carter has won three Grammys.

300
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
 I see.

301
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,000
 Yeah, for what?

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,720
 Spoken word, so all the spoken word of his books that he keeps pumping out.

303
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,000
 He's written a lot of books, and he's won three Grammys,

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
 but he's been nominated a lot more times.

305
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,520
 I think he, looking through the list of spoken word Grammys,

306
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,600
 he has been nominated more than anyone else.

307
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,240
 Really?

308
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,880
 Yeah.

309
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,680
 He lost in 1999 to Christopher E.

310
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,840
 He lost in 2002 to Quincy Jones.

311
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 In 2008, he lost to Obama, but he was up against Obama as was Bill Clinton.

312
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,040
 So three of the nominees were presidents of the United States of America, the Grammys.

313
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,520
 That was the big presidential race of 2008, wasn't it?

314
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,360
 That was the one I was watching.

315
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,080
 Yeah.

316
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,160
 Then he lost in 2010 to Michael J. Fox.

317
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
 Then he lost in 2015 to Joan Rivers.

318
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
 But then he won in 2016.

319
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
 That feels like a pissy win.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
 After all that effort, that feels like he's gone, just give it to him.

321
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,560
 I'll go away.

322
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
 I love Jimmy Carter.

323
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,720
 Do you?

324
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,920
 He's just the best guy.

325
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,400
 He's just the most principled moral guy.

326
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 So he's the only president who doesn't really take speaking fees,

327
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,560
 and any speaking fee has ever taken, which is always minimal goes to charity.

328
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,280
 Do you think he stopped taking them because he keeps making such massive gaps?

329
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,320
 It's automatically audience by accident by a translation.

330
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,960
 Always just coming on to whoever's listening.

331
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,880
 He still gives, I was listening to a podcast, which is really good.

332
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,760
 It's the Washington Post presidential podcast, and they did about an hour on every president.

333
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,200
 So it followed Jimmy Carter.

334
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
 From start to finish.

335
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,120
 That's how, you've got quite esoteric tastes.

336
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,400
 An hour without 45 now.

337
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,600
 I mean, I haven't, I haven't listened to, like, rather, for B. Hayes or anything yet.

338
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
 I don't know how I'd fare there.

339
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,120
 But he still gives Sunday school classes, and people come all over the world to listen.

340
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,760
 But, you know, he's really, he's an evangelical born again, Christian.

341
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,760
 So he just gives religious lessons at Sunday school every week.

342
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,200
 He's just such a decent guy.

343
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,960
 I'm still a senior UFO, hasn't he?

344
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,000
 Yeah, he's also a bit weird.

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,480
 It's a very famous incident of Jimmy Carter claiming to have seen a UFO.

346
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
 One of the promises he made in his presidential campaign was that

347
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,080
 he would investigate all extraterrestrial experiences or something, I think.

348
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,400
 And then when he got into power, he said he couldn't, because it was all too secret or something.

349
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,920
 He's too busy now to go around.

350
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,640
 Yeah.

351
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,480
 Turns out he's a counter-photo-class.

352
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,400
 He builds houses, doesn't he, as well?

353
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
 Yeah, and fun, amazing furniture.

354
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,120
 Does he?

355
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,800
 Yeah, come on, how good is the furniture?

356
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,200
 It sells for, I think I might have mentioned this before, but if I haven't,

357
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,240
 yeah, he builds, like, beds and Tests and Royals.

358
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
 And do you say it sells for a lot of money?

359
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,880
 Yeah, thousands.

360
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
 But how much would it sell for if you sold it under a pseudonym?

361
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
 [LAUGHTER]

362
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,840
 It wouldn't necessarily be an eccentric thing to do.

363
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,200
 Yeah, he sent his first text three years ago, Jimmy Carter.

364
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
 Oh, well done, Jimmy.

365
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,120
 Yeah.

366
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,160
 And his second text, this was the message of his second text.

367
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,440
 It was, I did not mean to send that first text about wanting to have sex with you.

368
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,080
 I'm sorry.

369
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,280
 [LAUGHTER]

370
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,240
 I'm still using Seymour to translate all my stuff.

371
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,960
 Yeah, no, his second text was, that was my first text message.

372
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,120
 Yeah, he was his first text.

373
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
 This is my first text, too.

374
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
 [LAUGHTER]

375
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,080
 That was his second text.

376
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,360
 Has it gone on like that, too?

377
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,320
 [LAUGHTER]

378
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,920
 Yeah, no, it was to his grandson.

379
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,040
 And it was, did you see, Colbert last night, P?

380
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,280
 He ends up with P, which I think he's just referred to as Papa.

381
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,200
 But his grandson is on Twitter, so he did a screen grab of it.

382
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,000
 It might be president.

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
 [LAUGHTER]

384
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
 It might just be a real ask about it.

385
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
 Yeah.

386
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,840
 Did you know Patti O'Furnich will make her?

387
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,040
 [LAUGHTER]

388
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

389
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,520
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

390
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
 And that is my fact.

391
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,440
 My fact this week is that narcissists don't like looking at themselves.

392
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,640
 [BUZZER]

393
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,280
 It's not weird.

394
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
 So this is a new study that's come out of Austria

395
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
 from the University of Gratz.

396
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
 And the idea is that they took a pool of around 600 people

397
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,560
 and surveyed them to see whether or not they were narcissistic.

398
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,640
 And so out of that, they found 43 people that they selected 21

399
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
 who scored really highly as being narcissistic

400
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
 and 22 with lower scores.

401
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
 And they were shown pictures of themselves

402
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,280
 and close family friends and so on.

403
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
 And their brain activity, which was monitored every time

404
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
 they saw the picture of themselves.

405
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
 When their eyes locked onto themselves,

406
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,240
 it registered as not enjoying it.

407
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,360
 Yeah, which is--

408
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,560
 And that was not enjoying it more so than non-asicists.

409
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,800
 Or maybe just enjoying it the same amount or--

410
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,160
 Not having this in a special surge of enjoyment, I guess.

411
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,640
 Yeah.

412
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,520
 Yeah, which is--

413
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
 I've just realised because obviously narcissists in the myth

414
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
 does like looking at himself.

415
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,040
 You've just got this fact.

416
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,840
 Yeah.

417
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,400
 That says he likes it a lot to his detriment.

418
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
 It turns out--

419
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
 This is he die.

420
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
 He doesn't die, but he gets turned into a flower.

421
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
 I would say that is a kind of death.

422
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,120
 That is a plot twist.

423
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,000
 I did not see coming.

424
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
 [LAUGHTER]

425
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,480
 It's a daffodil.

426
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
 Isn't it that he was turned into?

427
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,680
 Well, we think it's a narcissist.

428
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,560
 It's like it always--

429
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,000
 There's flower called narcissists, which is yeah.

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,320
 And they sort of droop over the riverbank, Daniel,

431
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
 and they look like they're looking at themselves

432
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,840
 with their little trumpets.

433
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,640
 So that's why he was turned into one of those either gods.

434
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,440
 But I think he starved to death first

435
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,760
 because he was so captivated by his reflection.

436
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,800
 And I should just say for the pedants out there,

437
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,560
 when you're on his watch, QI, that we don't know

438
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,280
 that the etymology of narcissists, the flower,

439
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,240
 comes from narcissists, the person.

440
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,360
 To me, it seems so obvious that it definitely does.

441
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,880
 It's a flower that he was turned into,

442
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,240
 and it drapes over lakes.

443
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,120
 But some people say it's related to a word that means to poison

444
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,880
 or something.

445
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,800
 They're OK.

446
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,840
 They might be totally unrelated to each other.

447
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,000
 Do you know how to tell us someone's a narcissist?

448
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,720
 You just ask them.

449
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
 Because they don't care.

450
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,840
 They'll say, yeah, I'm a narcissist.

451
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,760
 That's true, yeah.

452
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,640
 The psychologists have developed a one-question test

453
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
 for narcissism.

454
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,360
 Wow.

455
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,840
 And it's a pretty good one.

456
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,080
 And then there's a more advanced one, which

457
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,040
 is a 40-question test.

458
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
 But it replicates pretty closely the one-question test.

459
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
 Do you guys know about the Anna-Face Facial Beauty Analysis?

460
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 No.

461
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,800
 This is the thing you can do.

462
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,920
 I thought, OK, well, let's do something

463
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,080
 about looking at yourself.

464
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,120
 So I went on this website, and it takes a photo of your face,

465
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
 and then it analyzes you, and it gives you

466
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,320
 your facial beauty analysis.

467
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,960
 So that's what the kind of thing a narcissist would do?

468
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,520
 It does, doesn't it?

469
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,200
 Yeah.

470
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,000
 So I was roleplaying.

471
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,960
 So this is how my facial beauty analysis reads.

472
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,880
 Your nose is too long for your ears.

473
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,840
 Your inner ocular distance is too big for your eyes.

474
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,160
 Your nose is too wide for your face with.

475
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,720
 Your face is too narrow.

476
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,440
 Your nose is too wide for your mouth.

477
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
 Wow.

478
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,840
 Look, only some of that is true.

479
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,680
 Pretty brutal, isn't it?

480
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,520
 What I got stuck on though is your nose

481
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,600
 is too long for your ears.

482
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
 How do those things correlate?

483
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
 How are you not that your ears are too short for your nose?

484
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,560
 Yeah.

485
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,720
 Why's the nose to blame?

486
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,400
 No, it's done.

487
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,480
 But I don't think you could fit it in your ears, even if you want to.

488
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,920
 No, I don't think so.

489
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
 God knows I've tried.

490
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,360
 Well, it's not that long, then, is it?

491
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,160
 If you can't even fit it in your ears.

492
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,440
 So what was it trying to tell you?

493
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,640
 I think it succeeded in telling me exactly what it wanted

494
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,560
 to tell you.

495
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,240
 It may just be an exercise in--

496
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,760
 I don't know.

497
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,080
 --buse, honesty, no idea.

498
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,360
 What's the URL for that?

499
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,600
 It's ANA face.

500
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,120
 ANA face.

501
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,760
 Definitely doing that.

502
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,320
 I was looking up stuff about looking in mirrors.

503
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,880
 Yeah.

504
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,000
 You know the thing about animals looking in mirrors.

505
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,920
 Which I think we must have mentioned before.

506
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
 Don't they do it?

507
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
 But they do it.

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,880
 And the way to tell if they can tell that they are the animal in the mirror

509
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
 is by painting a dot on them.

510
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,640
 And then if they try and get rid of the dot, that's how they know.

511
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,360
 This was invented by a guy called Gordon Gallup, Jr.

512
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,040
 This was his innovation experiment in the 1970s.

513
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,840
 Although one of the first people to do it

514
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,160
 was Charles Darwin, who in 1838 went to London Zoo

515
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,480
 and entered an orangutan's cage with a mirror to experiment.

516
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 Wow.

517
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,320
 Well, that's been done all this time.

518
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
 Yeah, wow.

519
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
 And the orangutan loved it.

520
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,040
 He said she was astonished beyond measure.

521
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
 But did she know it was her reflection?

522
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
 Don't know.

523
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
 I don't think he did the dot test.

524
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,320
 Did you know about the 17th century fashion

525
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,240
 for having a mirror hanging on the wall of your drawing room?

526
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,800
 And then next to it, an oil painting of exactly the reflection in the mirror.

527
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,600
 What?

528
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
 No.

529
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,560
 Really?

530
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
 Yeah.

531
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
 That's cool.

532
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,560
 I couldn't find out anything more about this.

533
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,160
 I came across this fact and then couldn't get anywhere further with it.

534
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,560
 But it was-- I don't know whether it was in order to show off the artist

535
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,120
 or in order to show off the-- what the mirror can see.

536
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,720
 Yeah.

537
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
 Right.

538
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,560
 What a hassle, because if you ever wanted to redecorate,

539
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,360
 you always have to hang those two next to each other then.

540
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,880
 Yeah.

541
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,160
 And in the same position, actually, obviously, because you can't move the mirror, can you?

542
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,640
 Otherwise, it's not going to reflect the same thing.

543
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,120
 And also, if you walk up to the wrong one, you might think you're a vampire.

544
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,040
 [LAUGHTER]

545
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,600
 There was another weird fashion for the Claude Glass, which was about the same time.

546
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,840
 I think the 18th century, which was a period of time where people decided that

547
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,920
 beautiful views and landscapes actually looked more attractive in mirrors

548
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,200
 than they did in real life, just with the bare eyes.

549
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 And so this Claude Glass was invented, and people would walk up mountains,

550
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
 and they'd take a Claude Glass with them.

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,480
 And the idea was that you got to the top of a mountain, and then you get to take out

552
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 this mirror, and it would be a tinted mirror.

553
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,920
 So it gave it a bit of a ethereal dreamlike quality.

554
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,840
 And you'd get to look at the view in a mirror and then go down again.

555
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
 But you'd have to face away, wouldn't you, from the view?

556
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,560
 Yeah.

557
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,120
 Look into the mirror, see the view behind you.

558
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
 Imagine how bizarre that is.

559
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,560
 So you're facing away from the thing you've come up the thing to see.

560
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:35,880
 Yeah.

561
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,440
 And you can look at it in the mirror, which is exactly like the selfie thing,

562
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,480
 where you get a lot of people facing away from the view.

563
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,240
 Oh, yes.

564
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,280
 For a hell of a friend of yours.

565
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,600
 So that's the original selfie.

566
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,640
 That's it.

567
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
 It's sort of the original selfie.

568
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,920
 Yes.

569
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,640
 Yeah, kind of.

570
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,200
 [LAUGHTER]

571
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,760
 How we all got quite excited about that for a minute was cool.

572
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,760
 So listen, Narcissus then was, because he was in love with his own reflection,

573
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,320
 he might not have liked seeing a picture of himself, because that would have been

574
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,560
 the right way round.

575
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
 Yeah.

576
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
 Oh, yes.

577
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 Absolutely.

578
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
 Yes.

579
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,840
 So that's why people tend to much prefer their reflection to pictures, isn't it?

580
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
 Yeah.

581
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,400
 Because the image you're used to seeing is the one in the mirror, but as soon as you see

582
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,240
 a photo, you think, oh, my face is too big.

583
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,600
 No one knows it's too long for your ears.

584
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
 [LAUGHTER]

585
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
 OK.

586
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
 OK.

587
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:32,080
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

588
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,400
 My fact is that clenching one's buttocks is a technique Christy's auctioneers are taught

589
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
 to stop their hands shaking.

590
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,360
 [LAUGHTER]

591
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,600
 But it doesn't actually say where they're being told to put their hands while they're clenching

592
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
 their buttocks.

593
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 [LAUGHTER]

594
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 Yeah.

595
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,760
 So this is a piece about extraordinary things that Christy's has found out over the years.

596
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,540
 It's by Christy's, and one of them was this amazing fact about how the auctioneers calm

597
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
 themselves down.

598
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
 Wow.

599
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,040
 Are they having them holding priceless bits of art, or is this when they're actually conducting

600
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
 your auctioneer?

601
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,860
 I think when you're conducting an auction because you're standing at the front of the front

602
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,180
 of everyone and you're gesturing, so you have to look in control of the situation, I suppose.

603
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
 Yeah.

604
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
 And so that apparently comes.

605
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,300
 I don't know how, what the mechanism is, whether simply the focusing on another muscle in

606
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,860
 your body removes the tension from your hands.

607
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
 Yeah, I must do.

608
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
 Right?

609
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
 I guess so.

610
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
 I don't know.

611
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
 I'm trying it now, and I think it makes you a bit more shaky.

612
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,220
 But I'm, so I guess the shaking is because they talk about auctioneers as being a sort of

613
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,740
 an acting gig almost.

614
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,700
 You get up on stage and you need to make the audience love you because that's going to

615
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,600
 make an auction successful, and on Christy's site, they were saying, with interviews of various

616
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,300
 auctioneers, the first 10 seconds is where you need to grab them, otherwise you might not

617
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,540
 have a successful auction, which seems bizarre if you're there to buy things.

618
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
 Do you know what I mean?

619
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,180
 Like it's, you're not buying off this guy's credibility.

620
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
 You're buying because there's...

621
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
 But you are.

622
00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:00,480
 I mean, I remember going to a, which is quite similar, what's it called when you go to a charity

623
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
 thing and...

624
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 Raffle.

625
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,620
 No, there's above a raffle where you bid for...

626
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
 Super raffle?

627
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,620
 Yeah.

628
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,300
 One of those things where like you donate a holiday or you donate your mansion for a week.

629
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,860
 Oh, yeah, I've been to loads of things where people who donate to their mansion.

630
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
 Where am I being?

631
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
 Oh.

632
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,860
 We mix in different circles.

633
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,860
 What's it called?

634
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
 It's a charity auction.

635
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,780
 Yeah, so you know when you go to a charity auction, it's...

636
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,100
 You inspire people to buy stuff just by being that charming, I remember going to one recently

637
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,020
 in Clive Anderson was doing the auctioning and people definitely bid on stuff that they

638
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,420
 would absolutely not have had to not kind of cajold them a bit here and persuaded them

639
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
 a bit there.

640
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,660
 I think it makes such a difference because it's in the moment, isn't it?

641
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,940
 That's where it affects you in an auction.

642
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
 That's true.

643
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,180
 I did a gig not too long ago with a Christie's auctioneer and it was a very rowdy room

644
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,620
 and it was a charity night, it was raising money for this new university for brain studies

645
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,180
 and he was given a lot of stuff to auction off and the room was chaotic as you would expect

646
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,740
 it was in the V&A, everyone was just busy on round tables eating so he had to try and maintain

647
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,060
 their attention in order to sell all this stuff and he did this trick.

648
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:13,700
 When he felt like he lost the crowd, he went, he made that noise and every time the crowd

649
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,020
 would silence, look back to him and then he'd continue on with the auction.

650
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,980
 But he did it like 50 times during the night.

651
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,460
 Well they all ponies.

652
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,380
 It was an amazing technique, that's how he shut up an entire row.

653
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,780
 Yeah, one of the things I didn't realise is that auctioneers will keep an eye on each

654
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,100
 other as well.

655
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,060
 So one of them, if they feel that if auctioneer A is up there and he doesn't think he's

656
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,420
 quite got the room, he's not inspiring them and I think he can nod to auctioneer B who

657
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,820
 will come up and take his place and try and raise the temperature of the room and it works

658
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
 the other way round as well.

659
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,860
 auctioneer B can just go up to him and tap him on the shoulder and go, you've lost him

660
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
 mate, I'll do it.

661
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
 Wow.

662
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
 It's like a tag team.

663
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,060
 Imagine if that was true in all performing arts, imagine Andy, if you're bombing one night and Dan

664
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,180
 just comes up behind you taps you on the shoulder and says I'll take it from him.

665
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,180
 What do you mean imagined?

666
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,100
 Remember, I think it's the one you're looking for.

667
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,780
 So in the old days I have to do mock auctions, the auctioneers at Christie's before the

668
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,820
 bosses of the company to just make sure that the skills were good.

669
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,300
 The bosses would just sit around with the drink and then the auctioneers would have to do

670
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
 it.

671
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
 Oh really?

672
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,500
 It's all a bit more professional now so they get voice actors and acting coaches in to

673
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,700
 teach them about engaging the voice and maybe also about posture and engaging the audience

674
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
 I don't know.

675
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,940
 Well Christie's does in house courses, if you want to get into it.

676
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,100
 You spend, you do a workshop with one of them.

677
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
 Yeah.

678
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
 Wolverhampton actually has a two year degree for auctioneering.

679
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
 Right.

680
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,860
 Yeah, they teach you to auctioneer and to value things as well.

681
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
 But yeah.

682
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,340
 How much money do I have over this place on the Yorkshire University auction course?

683
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
 9,000 pounds.

684
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
 9,000 pounds over here.

685
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
 Do I hit ten?

686
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
 Yeah.

687
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
 So did anybody look up butter clenching?

688
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
 No.

689
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,380
 No more than usual.

690
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,940
 So butter clenching, you're all aware of the international penny chuffing competition

691
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
 are you?

692
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
 No.

693
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,660
 In the case annually at the new year in Wedmore in Somerset where the contestants have

694
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:14,300
 to clench three two pence coins in between the cheeks of their butters, then walk, waddle

695
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,740
 or hop, four yards across the pub before depositing the coins in a pint glass.

696
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
 Wow.

697
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
 Oh my god.

698
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,980
 You get one point for every coin you get in the glass and the last report that I could

699
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,620
 find from 2015, three people scored nine points.

700
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
 Is that the full?

701
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,940
 So they're managed three journeys across the pub.

702
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
 Oh wow.

703
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,340
 Do you have to pick them up with your buttocks?

704
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,140
 That isn't indicated.

705
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,140
 OK.

706
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:48,260
 Nor is what happens to the coins afterwards, whether they go into a particular till.

707
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,820
 Is it a full point and do you have to down it once you've finished?

708
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
 No, it's just a pint glass.

709
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
 No, that's a shame.

710
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
 That would make the competition more fun.

711
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
 No, it would, wouldn't it?

712
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
 Yeah.

713
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
 Yeah.

714
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
 That is fantastic.

715
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,340
 I don't like to brag.

716
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,500
 I think I could do that.

717
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,940
 Well, there's only one way to find out.

718
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,220
 So some of that is the other thing of course, right?

719
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,660
 If you put yourself in the room there, that's a lot of bum, isn't it?

720
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,660
 Yes.

721
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,780
 Now, what happens is, apparently, they have, they have some sort of modesty blanket

722
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,380
 that they put around themselves while hopping, waddling or walking four yards across the

723
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,820
 pub with some money up there, ask.

724
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:32,940
 Didn't David Souchet, the pyro actor, he did a lot of butt clenching as well?

725
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
 Did he?

726
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
 Yeah, to get into the role.

727
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
 To get the model, right?

728
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
 Yeah.

729
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,940
 He wanted to be as pert as an auctioneer, didn't he?

730
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
 Yeah.

731
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,100
 Is it called the Souchet Sache?

732
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 No.

733
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
 You made that up?

734
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
 Yeah.

735
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
 Well, treat it.

736
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
 Treat it, treat it.

737
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
 It's not.

738
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,700
 I feel like it's not mine to trademark, I don't think.

739
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:55,740
 But, guys, telegraph headline, David Souchet, I stuck coin in buttocks to walk like pyro.

740
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,220
 And also to win this competition at the new inn in Wedmore.

741
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,980
 No, he was caught in a pub in Somerset with a modesty blanket right?

742
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,820
 Like, this is a money up his ass and he said, "Oh, I was doing it for the role."

743
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,660
 Okay, that's it.

744
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,020
 That is all of our facts.

745
