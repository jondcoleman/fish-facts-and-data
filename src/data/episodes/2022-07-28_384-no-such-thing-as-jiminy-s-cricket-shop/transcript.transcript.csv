00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:20,00:00:22,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber
00:00:24,00:00:26,and I am sitting at a very comfortable distance
00:00:26,00:00:28,"from Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:28,00:00:30,and James Harkin.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:32,00:00:34,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:34,00:00:38,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:41,00:00:43,"- My fact this week is that in 1877,"
00:00:43,00:00:47,all able-bodied men in Nebraska were required by law
00:00:47,00:00:50,to spend up to 12 days killing grasshoppers.
00:00:50,00:00:52,"- Wow, wow."
00:00:52,00:00:54,"Wait a minute, I'm always looking for the loophole"
00:00:54,00:00:55,up to 12 days.
00:00:55,00:00:57,(laughing)
00:00:57,00:01:01,"It was, well, they had to spend two days, definitely."
00:01:01,00:01:03,So you can't get out of a weekend.
00:01:03,00:01:05,"And then if there was further work needed,"
00:01:05,00:01:07,then the government state government could call on you
00:01:07,00:01:08,to spend an extra 10 days.
00:01:08,00:01:09,- So it was up to 12 days
00:01:09,00:01:10,"because some people enjoyed it so much,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,it started to look psychopathic.
00:01:12,00:01:13,"And it's like, all right, we need to cut you off here."
00:01:13,00:01:14,- Oh yeah.
00:01:14,00:01:15,(laughing)
00:01:15,00:01:16,- Or develop something else.
00:01:16,00:01:18,- You can't devote 365 to it.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"- How many grasshoppers can there be that everyone,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"I mean, I know Nebraska even though"
00:01:22,00:01:23,"is quite sparsely populated,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"but that's a lot of grasshoppers to kill, isn't it?"
00:01:26,00:01:28,- Definitely more than one grasshopper per person.
00:01:28,00:01:30,So it was a lot.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"This was the Rocky Mountain Locust,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,which is a grasshopper.
00:01:34,00:01:38,And it was this massive scourge in the 1870s and the 1860s.
00:01:38,00:01:41,"It basically ruined the kind of Great Plains area,"
00:01:41,00:01:44,"so Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, those kind of areas."
00:01:44,00:01:48,"And it destroyed crops, it ruined people's livelihoods."
00:01:48,00:01:51,It drove the population out and they had to do something.
00:01:51,00:01:53,"So the states passed various laws saying,"
00:01:53,00:01:56,"get out and do your duty, murder grasshoppers."
00:01:56,00:01:57,- Wow.
00:01:57,00:01:59,"- It's insane, there's a sighting in 1875,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,"so two years before this law was put into place,"
00:02:02,00:02:06,"where it was estimated that there was 198,000 square miles"
00:02:06,00:02:08,of locusts swarming.
00:02:08,00:02:10,So that's larger than the size of California.
00:02:10,00:02:13,"- In that area of 198,000 square miles,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,which I reckon is just a little bit smaller
00:02:15,00:02:17,"than England and Scotland combined,"
00:02:17,00:02:21,there were 12.5 trillion insects.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"Okay, and to put that into perspective,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,if you imagine taking a normal keyboard
00:02:25,00:02:28,on your computer and covering all of England
00:02:28,00:02:31,"and Scotland in keyboards, so there's no gaps,"
00:02:31,00:02:34,each grasshopper would have one keyboard to sit on
00:02:34,00:02:36,over the whole of England and Scotland.
00:02:36,00:02:38,"- Well, why?"
00:02:38,00:02:40,Why are you putting grasshoppers on keyboards?
00:02:40,00:02:43,- Grasshoppers give an infinite keyboard to eventually.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"- They actually write out the works of Milton, don't they?"
00:02:46,00:02:47,"- They account for extraordinary, aren't they?"
00:02:47,00:02:49,"I mean, even every able-bodied man in Nebraska"
00:02:49,00:02:51,wouldn't have been able to do a huge amount about this.
00:02:51,00:02:54,Because they ate the wool off sheep
00:02:54,00:02:57,"when they were passing by, they're just so discreet."
00:02:57,00:02:59,They ate clothing off people's backs.
00:02:59,00:03:00,- I don't believe that.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"I mean, it's probably true, but like, calm on."
00:03:02,00:03:04,- An unsexy striptease.
00:03:04,00:03:07,"- There was a woman who claimed it, wasn't there?"
00:03:07,00:03:09,Who said that she was wearing a white
00:03:09,00:03:12,and green stripey dress and she was descended on
00:03:12,00:03:14,"by these grasshoppers and they ate all the green stripes,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,at which point I guess all the white stripes fall off.
00:03:17,00:03:17,"But, you know."
00:03:17,00:03:18,- That's where the white stripes
00:03:18,00:03:19,"got the name from, actually."
00:03:19,00:03:21,"The band, they were walking past this woman"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"and were like, what's the rest of her dress?"
00:03:23,00:03:26,There were stories about how trains came to a halt
00:03:26,00:03:27,'cause they were skidding on locusts.
00:03:27,00:03:28,- Oh yeah.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- There were just so many on the ground
00:03:29,00:03:31,"that they were just, yeah, wiping out."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"- Laura Ingalls Wilder, who wrote"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"""The Little House"" on the prairie,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,she was there when this happened.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"And one of her stories on the banks of Plum Creek,"
00:03:39,00:03:42,they talk about this happening to her family.
00:03:42,00:03:45,And she said that her father had to walk 300 miles
00:03:45,00:03:47,to find work on a farm that didn't
00:03:47,00:03:48,have the grasshoppers on it.
00:03:48,00:03:49,- Jesus.
00:03:49,00:03:50,- If you can imagine that.
00:03:50,00:03:51,And that she would walk around
00:03:51,00:03:54,and they would squish under her birth feet
00:03:54,00:03:56,and she would hear the sound of millions of jaws
00:03:56,00:03:57,biting and chewing.
00:03:57,00:03:58,- Oh. - Nice.
00:03:58,00:04:00,- Wow. - Amazing.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"- I mean, if you're faced with that,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,actually what good can it do to spend 12 days?
00:04:04,00:04:05,12 days feels a bit undirect.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"- Yeah, you gotta devote the whole year to it."
00:04:07,00:04:08,"- Wait, how many did you say the word, James?"
00:04:08,00:04:10,12 trillion. - 12.5 trillion.
00:04:10,00:04:12,"- Okay, so then again, if every,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"hang on, 12 trillion."
00:04:14,00:04:16,"- No, if the whole of Nebraska gets a trillion a day."
00:04:16,00:04:17,- Yes.
00:04:17,00:04:19,Then it just needs one guy.
00:04:19,00:04:20,(laughing)
00:04:20,00:04:22,"- If you have a million people in Nebraska say,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,they have to get a million each per day.
00:04:25,00:04:27,- They are small though.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- It's a shame that we didn't just,"
00:04:28,00:04:31,Nebraska didn't just allow this to just continue.
00:04:31,00:04:33,And there's just one spot on earth where humans are living
00:04:33,00:04:36,"just completely covered, naked, covered in locusts."
00:04:36,00:04:37,- What?
00:04:37,00:04:38,- With no food to eat.
00:04:38,00:04:39,- That is a shame.
00:04:39,00:04:40,- We send care packages just as an experiment.
00:04:40,00:04:43,You know how sometimes big experiments happen?
00:04:43,00:04:45,- What are we experimenting on?
00:04:45,00:04:48,- Is there a symbiotic life with locusts
00:04:48,00:04:49,that we're missing out on
00:04:49,00:04:50,that they were trying to introduce us to?
00:04:50,00:04:52,- They actually only eat your clothes off you
00:04:52,00:04:53,so they can become your clothes.
00:04:53,00:04:55,(laughing)
00:04:55,00:04:57,"- Well, some people did suggest that at the time"
00:04:57,00:04:59,a symbiotic relationship with them kind of.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"So Missouri state entomologist who's called Charles Riley,"
00:05:02,00:05:05,he just said that why don't we just eat them?
00:05:05,00:05:07,They could be turned into soup
00:05:07,00:05:11,or prepared John the Baptist style.
00:05:11,00:05:13,And John the Baptist style is where you fry
00:05:13,00:05:14,grasshoppers with honey.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"Because in Matthew first three chapter four in the Bible,"
00:05:18,00:05:21,it says his meat was locusts and wild honey.
00:05:21,00:05:23,John the Baptist when he goes into the desert.
00:05:23,00:05:24,- Not sure it's gonna take off
00:05:24,00:05:26,"as the next hit restaurant concept, is it?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,- No.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"- Wild honey, please."
00:05:29,00:05:30,- Yeah.
00:05:30,00:05:31,- Oh no.
00:05:31,00:05:33,The portions are gonna be massive.
00:05:33,00:05:34,- Have you guys eaten locusts?
00:05:34,00:05:36,"- I haven't, but I do know that in Australia,"
00:05:36,00:05:39,"they rebranded them as sky prawns,"
00:05:39,00:05:40,"you know, to make them a bit more appealing."
00:05:40,00:05:42,- Very high in protein.
00:05:42,00:05:44,Like the North American communities
00:05:44,00:05:46,who lived in that area around the time.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"So for instance, the Shoshone people, they would eat them."
00:05:49,00:05:51,So they would turn them into flour
00:05:51,00:05:54,and they would make bread out of grasshoppers and stuff.
00:05:54,00:05:55,So that's how they dealt with it
00:05:55,00:05:59,before it happened to the Westerners who went over.
00:05:59,00:06:01,Although I don't think they ever had it quite as bad
00:06:01,00:06:02,that we know.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"- No, I mean, eating is not a solution to the 12 trillion,"
00:06:04,00:06:05,is it?
00:06:05,00:06:07,You can't just wander down your field with your mouth open.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Well, problem solved."
00:06:08,00:06:10,My crop's absolutely fine.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"- So the Rocky Mountain locust,"
00:06:12,00:06:15,"which we're talking about, which led to this plague,"
00:06:15,00:06:17,was crazy at the time and we did fight battle with them.
00:06:17,00:06:19,And the battle was won by the humans to the point
00:06:19,00:06:21,that they're now an extinct species.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- Hang on, hang on, hang on."
00:06:23,00:06:25,You're giving us credit for that.
00:06:25,00:06:27,"- No, I'm saying long-term, they are no longer on earth."
00:06:27,00:06:29,- How did we win the battle?
00:06:29,00:06:30,"- Well, in-"
00:06:30,00:06:30,- Why not because of us?
00:06:30,00:06:32,"- No, no, no, I'm just saying history."
00:06:32,00:06:34,They're no longer here on our planet.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- Who writes the history books, Anna?"
00:06:35,00:06:36,- Okay.
00:06:36,00:06:37,- I'll say it's because of us.
00:06:37,00:06:38,"I think you're right, Dan."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"- It was largely because of us, but also as animals."
00:06:40,00:06:43,And it was changing agricultural conditions.
00:06:43,00:06:43,"- It was, yeah."
00:06:43,00:06:45,- Who changes the agricultural conditions.
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- Thank you, James."
00:06:46,00:06:47,- Who brings the animals.
00:06:47,00:06:47,"- Thank you, James."
00:06:47,00:06:48,- Mr. Man.
00:06:48,00:06:49,- There we go.
00:06:49,00:06:50,- But we didn't do it on purpose.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- It was an accident.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"- Yeah, we absolutely didn't want to do it."
00:06:52,00:06:55,And that's horrible to decimate a species to extinction.
00:06:55,00:06:58,"But they can still be found,"
00:06:58,00:07:02,despite being extinct in glaciers around there.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"There's this one place,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,which is called the Grasshopper Glacier.
00:07:05,00:07:07,And it's in Wyoming where all of them
00:07:07,00:07:10,have sort of just been frozen in time inside there.
00:07:10,00:07:11,And you can see them when you look into it
00:07:11,00:07:12,and people ship them out.
00:07:12,00:07:14,- Can they come back like cut in America or?
00:07:14,00:07:15,- There is a theory.
00:07:15,00:07:17,Some scientists think there might be
00:07:17,00:07:19,a few lurking around somewhere.
00:07:19,00:07:20,- Not ready to come back.
00:07:20,00:07:22,Like the glacier melts and suddenly the grasshopper's taken over.
00:07:22,00:07:25,"- Not ready to mount the full counter attack,"
00:07:25,00:07:26,but there are scientists who think
00:07:26,00:07:28,they might still be out there somewhere.
00:07:28,00:07:29,"- Well, I thought, as in not in the glaciers,"
00:07:29,00:07:30,but actually out there.
00:07:30,00:07:31,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:07:31,00:07:32,"- Yeah, because so we don't,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,even though we've said like this agriculture
00:07:34,00:07:36,"or environment or climate change,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"but really we don't know, right?"
00:07:38,00:07:39,It's a massive mystery.
00:07:39,00:07:41,And they just vanished.
00:07:41,00:07:44,"So it was 1877, it was still pretty bad."
00:07:44,00:07:46,"Pretty much by the 1880s, they'd gone."
00:07:46,00:07:49,I think the last spotting was in the like the eight 1901
00:07:49,00:07:50,or something or right at the start
00:07:50,00:07:52,of the 20th century anyway.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"And they vanished, but it could just be"
00:07:54,00:07:56,that they stopped swarming
00:07:56,00:07:59,because locusts just turned back into grasshoppers
00:07:59,00:08:00,when they go out of a swarm.
00:08:00,00:08:03,"And they could just be hiding, as you say in plain sight,"
00:08:03,00:08:04,waiting to regroup.
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- When you say they turn into grasshoppers,"
00:08:06,00:08:07,"they don't change, do they?"
00:08:07,00:08:09,We just change our name for them.
00:08:09,00:08:13,It's like literally one animal is called a grasshopper.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"When it's with all its mates, we call them locusts."
00:08:15,00:08:16,- You're kidding.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- Yeah.
00:08:17,00:08:17,- It's not like Batman and suddenly
00:08:17,00:08:19,it's a whole change of outfit.
00:08:19,00:08:20,"- They kind of, they do change outfit."
00:08:20,00:08:21,They definitely do.
00:08:21,00:08:22,"- Yeah, they change color in it."
00:08:22,00:08:24,"- Because they get stronger, they get darker,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,"they get more mobile, their color changes."
00:08:26,00:08:28,"And in fact, until the 1920s,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,they were assumed to be different species.
00:08:30,00:08:31,It's really weird.
00:08:31,00:08:33,There were two versions of this desert locust.
00:08:33,00:08:36,One is in Hulk mode and one is not.
00:08:36,00:08:37,And then we thought they were completely different.
00:08:37,00:08:39,- How quickly do they change though?
00:08:39,00:08:40,- That feels like that should take a while.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"It's not as soon as they start swarming,"
00:08:42,00:08:43,they just all turn blue.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Kind of is, it's really weird."
00:08:45,00:08:47,So basically they have wild populations
00:08:47,00:08:50,which swell up after rains because there's lots of food.
00:08:50,00:08:52,So plants are growing so they can eat lots.
00:08:52,00:08:53,"But then if the land gets parched,"
00:08:53,00:08:56,they get pushed into a smaller and smaller area.
00:08:56,00:08:58,And then this chemical serotonin kicks in
00:08:58,00:08:59,"in their brain, which we have to,"
00:08:59,00:09:02,"which is associated with happiness for us, I think."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"But anyway, not for them because the serotonin"
00:09:04,00:09:06,basically turns them into Hulk mode.
00:09:06,00:09:07,- We don't know that they're not happy.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"- That's true, they can be thrilled."
00:09:10,00:09:12,And they just set off and they go for it.
00:09:12,00:09:14,And it's very rare for them to switch out of swarm mode
00:09:14,00:09:16,once they're in it because any offspring born
00:09:16,00:09:18,during a swarm are also swarmers.
00:09:18,00:09:19,"- Yes, okay."
00:09:19,00:09:22,- I actually do know how you can turn them into locusts.
00:09:22,00:09:25,So the way you do that is you tickle them
00:09:25,00:09:26,on the back of the legs.
00:09:26,00:09:27,- Is that right?
00:09:27,00:09:29,"- Yeah, and scientists tried this."
00:09:29,00:09:31,They had this theory that what happens is
00:09:31,00:09:33,they are incredibly antisocial.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"Like grasshoppers hate each other, usually."
00:09:35,00:09:36,"But when they get hungry,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,they go to the same bit of food
00:09:38,00:09:39,and they start rubbing up against each other.
00:09:39,00:09:42,And eventually that rubbing stimulates them
00:09:42,00:09:43,to suddenly want to swarm.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Do they become thigmo-tactic?
00:09:44,00:09:47,"- I think they become thigmo-tactic, yeah."
00:09:47,00:09:48,"- Favorite word, fish word."
00:09:48,00:09:49,- It's really the fish word.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- Friend of the podcast.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- Friend of the podcast.
00:09:51,00:09:52,- Friend of the podcast.
00:09:52,00:09:53,- Thigmo-tactic.
00:09:53,00:09:54,- We should have her on.
00:09:54,00:09:54,- That's really cool.
00:09:54,00:09:56,"So that explains the serotonin thing, right?"
00:09:56,00:09:59,Because they become like more loving
00:09:59,00:10:00,to their fellow grasshopper.
00:10:00,00:10:01,- Yes.
00:10:01,00:10:02,- Is that right?
00:10:02,00:10:03,"- Yeah, or at least want to hang out with them."
00:10:03,00:10:04,Although there's also a theory
00:10:04,00:10:05,that the reason they're swarming is
00:10:05,00:10:06,they all want to eat each other.
00:10:06,00:10:07,So I don't know how much love that is.
00:10:07,00:10:07,"- Yeah, I wish they do."
00:10:07,00:10:08,That's when I read that.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"If they fall behind in the swarm,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,whoever's behind will chew them up.
00:10:11,00:10:13,"I mean, that is a terrible."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"- That happens in the Tour de France as well, actually."
00:10:16,00:10:19,So one really important thing of this locust swarm
00:10:19,00:10:23,in the 1870s and 1880s is what did the farmers do?
00:10:23,00:10:25,Because basically all of their crops were taken.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"They had no way of making any money,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,but also they had no food
00:10:29,00:10:31,'cause all the crops had been eaten by locusts.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"And so they asked the state for money,"
00:10:33,00:10:34,but the state couldn't give them enough
00:10:34,00:10:36,because basically everyone was affected.
00:10:36,00:10:39,And so they went to the federal government
00:10:39,00:10:41,and there was a real discussion about that
00:10:41,00:10:43,because basically they thought
00:10:43,00:10:45,that their farmers might be turned soft
00:10:45,00:10:48,"if they gave them any help, any charity, right?"
00:10:48,00:10:50,And so they came up with these tests
00:10:50,00:10:53,to make sure that you were worthy enough to get aid.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"As a farmer, you had to pledge an oath"
00:10:55,00:10:57,that you possessed nothing of value
00:10:57,00:10:58,that could be sold for food or clothing
00:10:58,00:11:01,in order to get any charity at all.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"- Sounds like, is this where Jacob Rees-Mogg"
00:11:02,00:11:03,started his career?
00:11:03,00:11:05,(laughing)
00:11:05,00:11:07,"- But yeah, I mean, in the end though,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,eventually the federal government did step in
00:11:09,00:11:10,and kind of gave aid packages
00:11:10,00:11:12,and food packages to everyone.
00:11:12,00:11:15,And that was the start of what is now the typical response
00:11:15,00:11:17,to disasters in America.
00:11:17,00:11:19,It was also a fire in Chicago a bit earlier
00:11:19,00:11:20,that did a similar thing.
00:11:20,00:11:23,"But yeah, this was a big step for America"
00:11:23,00:11:25,as far as state aid was concerned.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- So they sort of did them a favor?
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Yeah. - A long run.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"- Exactly, good old locusts."
00:11:29,00:11:30,- Good old locusts.
00:11:30,00:11:32,Another coping mechanism they had actually
00:11:32,00:11:34,"before that came in was in Minnesota,"
00:11:34,00:11:37,they had huge vats of boiling water
00:11:37,00:11:38,that they kept in the center
00:11:38,00:11:40,of some of the big cities there.
00:11:40,00:11:43,And there was a bounty of 50 cents a bushel on the locusts
00:11:43,00:11:47,"and apparently 130,000 grasshoppers equals one bushel."
00:11:47,00:11:49,So you've got to get quite a lot to get you 50 cents.
00:11:49,00:11:51,And then you bring them to the city
00:11:51,00:11:53,and you chuck them in this vat of boiling water.
00:11:53,00:11:54,- Right. - Isn't that cool?
00:11:54,00:11:55,Like a cauldron?
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- Yeah, or just to kill them off?"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"- Yeah, yeah. - Not to make a soup."
00:11:58,00:11:59,- No. - No.
00:11:59,00:12:00,Otherwise you just got a big locust lolly.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"When they've tried that in various places around the world,"
00:12:03,00:12:04,what often happens is people just start
00:12:04,00:12:06,"breeding the animal, don't they?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,"- Yes, exactly."
00:12:07,00:12:09,"- Poor guys at Jimmy's cricket shop,"
00:12:09,00:12:12,"which breed crickets, see this cloud on the horizon."
00:12:12,00:12:14,"Well, bang goes business."
00:12:14,00:12:16,- Why is he not calling it Jiminy Crickets?
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Absolutely right.
00:12:17,00:12:22,"- Yeah, well, it did almost bankrupt the state actually."
00:12:22,00:12:24,They had to cancel it almost straight away.
00:12:24,00:12:26,'Cause everyone's bringing in so many locusts.
00:12:26,00:12:27,- The bushel. - The bushel offer.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- Well, it's the 12 day thing, yeah."
00:12:29,00:12:31,'Cause too many businesses. - Wow.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- Yeah, can't afford it."
00:12:32,00:12:34,- If you guys heard of a megacolon.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"- Oh, I thought that was you impersonating one."
00:12:38,00:12:40,"- Yeah, exactly. - Yeah."
00:12:40,00:12:43,- It's not a punctuation that I accomplished earlier.
00:12:43,00:12:45,"- I think I invulnerably made,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,it's like I've been hypnotized to make that noise when I hear.
00:12:48,00:12:49,That's being said.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Very obscure.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Darren Brown never thought that would come up
00:12:51,00:12:52,in your life again.
00:12:52,00:12:55,- A megacolon is you would--
00:12:58,00:13:00,"- Okay, so this thing which I was talking about,"
00:13:00,00:13:04,it's what happens if you get an infection in your colon.
00:13:04,00:13:07,"And there was a mummy from 1,000 years ago"
00:13:07,00:13:09,which had this infection.
00:13:09,00:13:11,And it was scanned with an electron microscope
00:13:11,00:13:14,and what they found is that for the last few months
00:13:14,00:13:17,"of his life, he'd been fed solely on grasshoppers."
00:13:17,00:13:18,So that's all he'd eaten.
00:13:18,00:13:21,And what they'd done is we could tell from the microscope
00:13:21,00:13:24,that they'd taken all the legs off the grasshoppers
00:13:24,00:13:26,"and just, and the heads and just got the bodies"
00:13:26,00:13:28,which is really high in protein
00:13:28,00:13:29,and just kind of squished them together
00:13:29,00:13:31,and given them to this guy.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"And this, as far as we can tell,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,is the earliest example of any kind of nursing
00:13:36,00:13:39,or hospice care in the human race
00:13:39,00:13:41,that we have direct evidence for.
00:13:41,00:13:42,- Wow.
00:13:42,00:13:43,- But he had to prove that he'd sold off
00:13:43,00:13:46,anything he had of value before.
00:13:46,00:13:47,That's awesome.
00:13:47,00:13:48,- A megacolon.
00:13:48,00:13:49,- Mm.
00:13:49,00:13:50,"- Oh, gosh."
00:13:56,00:14:00,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:14:00,00:14:03,"- Okay, my fact this week is that when Henriette Dongeville"
00:14:03,00:14:07,held a reception to celebrate being the first woman
00:14:07,00:14:10,"to climb Mont Blanc, one guest was Maria Paradis"
00:14:10,00:14:15,who had been to the top of the mountain 30 years earlier.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Riddle me that.
00:14:16,00:14:18,(laughing)
00:14:18,00:14:19,- Okay.
00:14:19,00:14:20,- She didn't climb it.
00:14:20,00:14:23,She swam up 'cause it was underwater.
00:14:23,00:14:23,"- Oh, yeah, really?"
00:14:23,00:14:25,"- Oh, yeah, she was dropped on."
00:14:25,00:14:26,"- She, from a plane had a top."
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- First of all, Anna gets half a point"
00:14:28,00:14:31,'cause she didn't climb up allegedly.
00:14:31,00:14:32,- Okay.
00:14:32,00:14:32,"- But she wasn't dropped by a plane,"
00:14:32,00:14:33,so you get minus 10.
00:14:33,00:14:34,- She was pretty hefty.
00:14:34,00:14:36,- She was born there.
00:14:36,00:14:38,She was top of the mountain 30 years earlier.
00:14:38,00:14:39,That's where her mom gave birth to her.
00:14:39,00:14:40,But then her mother would also have had to be there
00:14:40,00:14:42,and so would have then been the first woman at the top.
00:14:42,00:14:44,"- Yeah, except she was dropped from a plane."
00:14:44,00:14:46,(laughing)
00:14:46,00:14:47,"What year was this, James?"
00:14:47,00:14:52,"- So this was 1838 when Dongeville went up,"
00:14:52,00:14:55,but Maria Parody went up in 1808.
00:14:55,00:14:59,"And what happened was she was dragged up, we think."
00:14:59,00:15:01,- Kicking and screaming.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- Well, not really doing anything"
00:15:03,00:15:05,'cause she kind of passed out halfway up the mountain.
00:15:05,00:15:06,- Wow.
00:15:06,00:15:09,- Is that a really fun drunk and night out prank kind of thing?
00:15:09,00:15:10,- Yeah.
00:15:10,00:15:11,- We'll have her wake up at the top of Mont Blanc.
00:15:11,00:15:13,- You'd usually carry someone rather than drag.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"That's very caveman, isn't it?"
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- Yeah, it was."
00:15:15,00:15:19,"So basically what happened was in 1808,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,a few people had already gone at Mont Blanc
00:15:21,00:15:25,and they kind of talked this 18 year old servant
00:15:25,00:15:29,from Chamonix called Maria Parody to go up Mont Blanc.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"And they said, if you do this, you'll become kind of famous"
00:15:31,00:15:33,and you'll be able to make a load of money
00:15:33,00:15:36,and maybe it will help the hotel that you're working in.
00:15:36,00:15:37,It'll give them some publicity.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"And so she's like, yeah, fine."
00:15:38,00:15:40,"I mean, what's the worst that can happen?"
00:15:40,00:15:42,We know about what happened
00:15:42,00:15:45,because she spoke to Alexander Dumas in 1811
00:15:45,00:15:48,"and she told him that as she was almost to the top,"
00:15:48,00:15:51,"she felt her legs go to hell, she said."
00:15:51,00:15:53,And then the people who were going up with her
00:15:53,00:15:55,decided to take her each under one arm
00:15:55,00:15:57,and drag her to the top.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"She was pulled, dragged and carried"
00:15:59,00:16:01,"to the top of the mountain, okay?"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"And then 30 years later,"
00:16:03,00:16:06,this high society woman called Henriette Dongeville
00:16:06,00:16:09,decided that she wanted to be the first person
00:16:09,00:16:12,to really walk up Mont Blanc and she did that.
00:16:12,00:16:14,And then she invited this Maria Parody
00:16:14,00:16:17,to come to her party afterwards.
00:16:17,00:16:19,And there's a little bit of kind of classism
00:16:19,00:16:22,"because first of all, Marie Parody was like,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,I can't believe that a real lady
00:16:24,00:16:25,managed to get all the way up to a mountain.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"I'm a peasant woman, I know the country,"
00:16:27,00:16:28,I should be able to do it.
00:16:28,00:16:29,I can't believe you would.
00:16:29,00:16:32,But then Henriette was kind of dismissive of her
00:16:32,00:16:34,"and she's like, well, at least I went up"
00:16:34,00:16:36,by my own accord and stuff.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"- She almost didn't get up on her own accord, did she?"
00:16:39,00:16:41,She had exactly the same moment.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"Yeah, Henriette, she had the same"
00:16:43,00:16:45,where she suddenly buckled and she was on her back
00:16:45,00:16:48,"and there were questions from the rest of the camp,"
00:16:48,00:16:49,do we carry her up?
00:16:49,00:16:52,And she managed fortunately to sort of get her wits about her
00:16:52,00:16:55,"and she said, no, I can do this, I can do this."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"But yeah, almost carried up as well."
00:16:57,00:16:59,- The person who went up with her
00:16:59,00:17:02,was called Joseph Coutet or Coutet.
00:17:02,00:17:04,And when she kind of got near the top
00:17:04,00:17:06,"and she felt like falling asleep, she felt really woozy,"
00:17:06,00:17:10,"Coutet said, look at her, asleep again."
00:17:10,00:17:12,This is the last lady I take up Mont Blanc.
00:17:12,00:17:14,(laughing)
00:17:14,00:17:15,Although that does sound like a euphemism
00:17:15,00:17:17,"when I read it, doesn't it?"
00:17:17,00:17:18,"- Oh, I took her up Mont Blanc."
00:17:18,00:17:21,"- Oh, what if this whole fact is a euphemism?"
00:17:21,00:17:23,It's a really raunchy night.
00:17:23,00:17:24,- Oh my God.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"It wasn't quite raunchy because Henriette Dongeville,"
00:17:26,00:17:30,"when she climbed up, she was wearing a boa."
00:17:30,00:17:31,She was wearing a--
00:17:31,00:17:32,- Constrictor or feather?
00:17:32,00:17:33,"- Feather or fur, possibly."
00:17:33,00:17:37,But because obviously climbing gear for women
00:17:37,00:17:38,did not exist at the time
00:17:38,00:17:42,"because only mad aristocratic ladies who were starting it,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,she was wearing a petticoat over men's trousers
00:17:44,00:17:46,and then a bonnet with a veil and then a boa.
00:17:46,00:17:48,The whole thing weighed about six kilos.
00:17:48,00:17:51,So it was really heavy to be climbing out.
00:17:51,00:17:53,- She basically had to wear the men's clothes
00:17:53,00:17:57,because obviously that's the convenient way to get to the top
00:17:57,00:17:58,but she still felt like she had to wear
00:17:58,00:18:00,the women's stuff over the top.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"- Yeah, and there is this amazing picture of her"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"going over a crevasse with a ladder,"
00:18:06,00:18:07,which I actually didn't realize was the thing
00:18:07,00:18:09,that you did in climbing and it looks absolutely terrifying
00:18:09,00:18:13,when she's doing it because it's this massive drop
00:18:13,00:18:13,in the middle of it.
00:18:13,00:18:17,The ladder's just going between these two cliff edges
00:18:17,00:18:19,and she's there with these extremely heavy skirts
00:18:19,00:18:21,which she would have sort of scrambling over
00:18:21,00:18:22,which she would have thought
00:18:22,00:18:23,is gonna tip you over any minute.
00:18:23,00:18:24,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:24,00:18:27,- And one of the reasons that she went up supposedly
00:18:27,00:18:30,is that she was quite jealous of other well-known women
00:18:30,00:18:33,that were kind of talking about going up Mont Blanc.
00:18:33,00:18:37,"So the writer, Georges Sond, who you all know, I'm sure,"
00:18:37,00:18:39,who's kind of mostly famous for wearing men's clothes
00:18:39,00:18:42,but she was kind of a really famous writer
00:18:42,00:18:43,who at the time was bigger than Victor Hugo
00:18:43,00:18:46,and Bolzac and people like that.
00:18:46,00:18:49,But she was kind of doing a lot of walking
00:18:49,00:18:50,in the foothills of Mont Blanc
00:18:50,00:18:53,and she was talking about how she might soon go up
00:18:53,00:18:55,"and Henriette Doncheville decided no,"
00:18:55,00:18:56,she was gonna do it first.
00:18:56,00:18:57,- That's great.
00:18:57,00:18:58,- It was not a prank.
00:18:58,00:19:00,That's what I would do if I was trying to trick someone
00:19:00,00:19:02,into going up Mont Blanc.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"- Oh, I might go tomorrow morning."
00:19:03,00:19:06,"I know the weather looks a bit dodgy, but yeah."
00:19:06,00:19:08,"- The clothing, I mean, it is mad"
00:19:08,00:19:10,that women were made to wear dresses
00:19:10,00:19:12,"and there were sort of, you know, there were a few women"
00:19:12,00:19:15,who were supposedly threatened with legal cases
00:19:15,00:19:17,for the fact that they were wearing men's trousers.
00:19:17,00:19:19,It was so controversial at the time
00:19:19,00:19:22,and there were systems where they did try to cheat it.
00:19:22,00:19:26,"So I read about Aubrey Leblond who climbed Rotorne,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,"which is a mountain about 2,000 meters high."
00:19:28,00:19:30,And so there was a sort of compromise
00:19:30,00:19:32,which is that you would leave where you were staying.
00:19:32,00:19:35,Let's say you're staying in a hotel wearing the dress
00:19:35,00:19:37,or the skirt that you had with the trousers on
00:19:37,00:19:38,and then you would take it off
00:19:38,00:19:40,while you were doing the actual mountain climbing
00:19:40,00:19:42,and maybe no one would tell each other.
00:19:42,00:19:43,But so she made it to the top
00:19:43,00:19:45,"and then on the way down,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,realized she'd left her skirt up there.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"So had to backtrack, go back up,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,re-ascend this giant mountain together.
00:19:51,00:19:53,- So she had to carry her skirt to the top after drop.
00:19:53,00:19:55,She didn't just leave it in a bush or something
00:19:55,00:19:56,where she took it off.
00:19:56,00:19:57,She carried it that way up with her.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"- You would leave it somewhere safe,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,like if you're going swimming or whatever.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"- Yeah, you don't swim holding your clothes"
00:20:02,00:20:03,up above the water if you do.
00:20:03,00:20:07,- My sister once was climbing up a hill
00:20:07,00:20:09,in the lake district and then went to the top.
00:20:09,00:20:10,"And when she got to the bottom,"
00:20:10,00:20:12,she realized she'd left her phone at the top.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"And that's how all the way back up,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,then it looked good to get her phone down.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"- Hey, have you all heard of Annie Smith Peck?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,Annie Smith Peck is a mountaineer.
00:20:21,00:20:24,She climbed the Matterhorn in 1850.
00:20:24,00:20:26,And it's just so interesting
00:20:26,00:20:28,'cause she had to do it with total hatred
00:20:28,00:20:31,from all the male companions who were taking on again
00:20:31,00:20:32,'cause they just didn't want women doing it.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"She wore trousers, they hated that scandalous."
00:20:35,00:20:36,"So when she went up,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,"one thing that happened was they would constantly,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,"like the guys were just always having temper tantrums,"
00:20:40,00:20:41,there would be strikes.
00:20:41,00:20:42,"But at one point,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,'cause they kind of just wanted to get rid of her
00:20:44,00:20:45,"as part of the party,"
00:20:45,00:20:48,"they said that, well, it said that"
00:20:48,00:20:50,"when she was going across a crevasse field,"
00:20:50,00:20:52,"when she went out of view, they cut the rope,"
00:20:52,00:20:53,the support rope.
00:20:53,00:20:54,"- No, I was looking after her."
00:20:54,00:20:57,- Went back to camp and then she had to make her way back
00:20:57,00:20:58,and found them all sitting there.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"And they were like, ""Oh, you're still here."""
00:21:00,00:21:01,"- No, did that actually happen?"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"- That's according to the accounts, yeah."
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And I think her accounts, that's what happened."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"I mean, she was really impressive."
00:21:07,00:21:08,She once hung a votes for women sign
00:21:08,00:21:11,"off the peak of a mountain in Peru, just to make a point."
00:21:11,00:21:12,- Who's gonna see that?
00:21:12,00:21:14,"- I mean, good point."
00:21:14,00:21:16,- No one after her companions cut the ropes from the sign.
00:21:16,00:21:18,- You wanna do it in the middle of Trafalgar Square
00:21:18,00:21:20,or somewhere where people walk past all the day?
00:21:20,00:21:22,- That's a really good point.
00:21:22,00:21:23,"Yep, can't fault you on that."
00:21:23,00:21:26,"And then another time,"
00:21:26,00:21:27,"she climbed another mountain in Peru,"
00:21:27,00:21:29,"the North Peak of Huascaran, okay?"
00:21:29,00:21:31,With some Swiss guides.
00:21:31,00:21:33,And it was renamed in her honor.
00:21:33,00:21:34,It was renamed Cumbre Ana Peck.
00:21:34,00:21:38,"But at that point, the record,"
00:21:38,00:21:39,"I think the highest altitude,"
00:21:39,00:21:41,"maybe for a woman or maybe for that peak,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,but it was held by another lady mountaineer
00:21:43,00:21:44,called Fanny Workman.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"- Oh yeah, legend."
00:21:46,00:21:47,"- Well, another legend,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,but there was beef between them
00:21:49,00:21:52,because Workman was so annoyed
00:21:52,00:21:53,that Peck was claiming this record
00:21:53,00:21:55,that she paid for engineers
00:21:55,00:21:58,to go and recalculate the altitude of the mountain
00:21:58,00:22:01,and establish that she had actually climbed 600 meters
00:22:01,00:22:04,"less than she had claimed to, than Peck had claimed."
00:22:04,00:22:07,"- 600 meters, that's a big recalculation."
00:22:07,00:22:09,- It is a pretty big recalculation.
00:22:09,00:22:11,So the Workman would still have the record.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"- That's pretty, yeah."
00:22:13,00:22:14,- So just while you're saying Annie Smith Peck
00:22:14,00:22:16,"having something named after her,"
00:22:16,00:22:20,"the Matterhorn, not long after she went up that,"
00:22:20,00:22:21,there was another explorer
00:22:21,00:22:22,who had a bit of it named after her.
00:22:22,00:22:25,So this was a mountaineer called Felicite Carol.
00:22:25,00:22:29,And she unfortunately didn't make it to the summit
00:22:29,00:22:29,when she was going.
00:22:29,00:22:30,She was with her father
00:22:30,00:22:33,and it's because she was wearing a skirt
00:22:33,00:22:35,and the skirt ballooned in the wind
00:22:35,00:22:36,and they thought this is too dangerous.
00:22:36,00:22:37,You can't go any higher.
00:22:37,00:22:39,Your skirt's gonna get in the way.
00:22:39,00:22:40,So the spot where that happened
00:22:40,00:22:43,is named the Matterhorn's Coal of Felicite.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"And yeah, after her,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,but she never got to make it to the top as a result.
00:22:47,00:22:48,- 'Cause it could have blown her up there
00:22:48,00:22:51,"like Mary Brown in Office, that's true."
00:22:51,00:22:53,- Did you bring an umbrella as well?
00:22:53,00:22:55,- Have you heard of the book Mountaineering in Scotland?
00:22:55,00:22:56,- No.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"- This is by an author called W.H. Murray,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,William Hutchison Murray.
00:22:59,00:22:59,- Any relation?
00:22:59,00:23:01,"- No, not as far as I know."
00:23:01,00:23:04,I wish because this is an amazing sounding book.
00:23:04,00:23:08,It was written on sheets of toilet paper
00:23:08,00:23:11,in prisoner of war camps in Germany during the war.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"So Murray had been sent by his mother,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,the complete works of Shakespeare in the post.
00:23:16,00:23:17,And that was an earlier time of the war
00:23:17,00:23:19,when the Red Cross parcels were still getting through
00:23:19,00:23:21,and you could receive post and things like that.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"- It's a lot of postage that, isn't it?"
00:23:23,00:23:24,"- It's a lot of postage, yeah."
00:23:24,00:23:26,But he noticed that the paper was lovely and soft
00:23:26,00:23:28,and it was actually a lot better than the stuff
00:23:28,00:23:30,that they were being given as toilet paper.
00:23:30,00:23:32,- So it sounds like he used the complete works
00:23:32,00:23:35,of Shakespeare as loo roll and he saved his loo roll
00:23:35,00:23:37,and wrote his own book about Mountaineering
00:23:37,00:23:38,on the loo paper.
00:23:38,00:23:39,- Oh my God.
00:23:39,00:23:41,"- I know, but the worst thing was then he was moved,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"he wrote for a year, presumably getting along quite well"
00:23:43,00:23:44,with his first draft.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"- What kind of, what was he writing with?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,Do we know?
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- No, I don't know actually."
00:23:48,00:23:49,I don't know how he got a pencil.
00:23:49,00:23:50,"Or a pencil, yeah."
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Was it 2B or not 2B?
00:23:51,00:23:52,- Oh my God.
00:23:52,00:23:54,Oh my God.
00:23:54,00:23:55,- He walked straight into that one.
00:23:55,00:23:58,- But then he was moved.
00:23:58,00:24:02,He was moved to another camp called Offlag 8F
00:24:02,00:24:04,and it was a much stricter prison camp.
00:24:04,00:24:06,"I mean, I don't know how lenient the previous one was,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,but basically the Gestapo searched everyone
00:24:08,00:24:09,very carefully on the way in
00:24:09,00:24:12,and his stash of toilet paper with a book on it
00:24:12,00:24:14,was found and taken off him.
00:24:14,00:24:15,And he had to write an entire second draft
00:24:15,00:24:17,on more toilet paper.
00:24:17,00:24:17,- No.
00:24:17,00:24:18,- Yeah.
00:24:18,00:24:19,- Oh my God.
00:24:19,00:24:20,- I know.
00:24:20,00:24:21,He claimed that the Gestapo had done him a favor
00:24:21,00:24:23,"because his first draft was a bit flabby,"
00:24:23,00:24:24,he needs a bit of time.
00:24:24,00:24:25,- Yeah.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- The most generous prisoner of war you've ever,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,I actually kind of liked the Gestapo.
00:24:29,00:24:32,- Do you think that when he only had the toilet paper left
00:24:32,00:24:36,that he kind of would hold it in so that he didn't use it?
00:24:36,00:24:38,"By the end, he would have had a mega-coal on it, I reckon."
00:24:38,00:24:38,- Oh my God.
00:24:38,00:24:39,- Oh my God.
00:24:39,00:24:41,(laughs)
00:24:41,00:24:44,(upbeat music)
00:24:44,00:24:49,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:24:49,00:24:51,and that is Andy.
00:24:51,00:24:53,- The fact is that the queen in her garden
00:24:53,00:24:56,has a collection of fake rocks.
00:24:56,00:24:57,- She has a lot of gardens.
00:24:57,00:24:57,- Do we have a specific one?
00:24:57,00:24:58,- She has a lot of gardens.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"She has gardens at Buckingham Palace, though, specifically."
00:25:01,00:25:02,- How's this in the main garden?
00:25:02,00:25:04,"- Her main garden, I would say."
00:25:04,00:25:07,There is a fake rock called Pullermite
00:25:07,00:25:09,and she's got a lot of it.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"- Is it, sorry, is that specific rock called,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,did she name it Pullermite?
00:25:13,00:25:14,"Like, cause she's got Dave sitting next to it,"
00:25:14,00:25:15,it's a real rock.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:25:16,00:25:19,"Yeah, this is a kind of rock invented by,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,it's so weird that you can invent a rock.
00:25:20,00:25:22,There was a gardener called James Pullum
00:25:22,00:25:26,and he invented this rock and it became a craze.
00:25:26,00:25:28,Can you explain to us how you invent a rock?
00:25:28,00:25:31,"- Yeah, so he was a gardener"
00:25:31,00:25:35,and he noticed that there was a bit of a trend going on
00:25:35,00:25:37,for when people have been traveling
00:25:37,00:25:39,and they might bring plants back with them
00:25:39,00:25:42,and this relates to the Victorian fern craze as well.
00:25:42,00:25:45,This was a big craze for having ferns and collecting ferns.
00:25:45,00:25:48,So the problem is that ferns don't like growing on lawns.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"You know, most gardens at the time"
00:25:50,00:25:52,"were, you know, nice flat lawns of grass."
00:25:52,00:25:55,And he was a gardener and also he knew a bit about engineering
00:25:55,00:25:59,and he started offering people their own personal ravines
00:25:59,00:26:02,to put their alpine plants and ferns in
00:26:02,00:26:05,and he made this material from his own recipe
00:26:05,00:26:06,and he took the recipe to his grave.
00:26:06,00:26:10,And so he started offering people their own personal rocks
00:26:10,00:26:12,that you could shape and build and mold
00:26:12,00:26:14,into the exactly shapes that you wanted.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"And this became a craze, people,"
00:26:16,00:26:19,lots and lots of gardens had these fake rocks in.
00:26:19,00:26:20,- It's environmentally friendly
00:26:20,00:26:22,'cause you don't have to go and dig it out of a mountain
00:26:22,00:26:23,or something.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- Yeah, I guess so."
00:26:24,00:26:25,"It takes a lot less transportation, yeah."
00:26:25,00:26:27,- And it was 'cause it does sound like a thing
00:26:27,00:26:30,"that would be shunted by the rich as something, you know,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,we just want natural stuff.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"But as you say, you know, the queen has it"
00:26:34,00:26:37,"in Buckingham Palace, many famous family, the Rothschilds"
00:26:37,00:26:39,"and so on, we're all really keen on it."
00:26:39,00:26:42,"So this was, yeah, it was a big deal."
00:26:42,00:26:43,- It was a big deal.
00:26:43,00:26:44,- It's everywhere.
00:26:44,00:26:45,I no longer trust any rocks I see.
00:26:45,00:26:47,What if this is puller made?
00:26:47,00:26:48,"- There's a big list online, isn't there?"
00:26:48,00:26:51,"Of all the places you can find it, including Las Vegas."
00:26:51,00:26:52,- Really?
00:26:52,00:26:54,"- Yeah, the Bellagio, there's like,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,I think there's a fountain that's made out of it.
00:26:56,00:26:56,- Wow.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"- Well, the first time that we properly,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,"I think outside of a show, saw each other"
00:27:00,00:27:03,during the sort of first lockdown having ended
00:27:03,00:27:04,"was we were at St. James's Park,"
00:27:04,00:27:05,"weren't we, we were sitting there"
00:27:05,00:27:08,and the rocks by the Duck Island Cottage
00:27:08,00:27:10,are also those kind of rocks.
00:27:10,00:27:10,- Are they?
00:27:10,00:27:11,- Right next to it.
00:27:11,00:27:14,"- Exactly, no rock is safe from puller."
00:27:14,00:27:15,It's really insane.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"Even seaside towns like Folkestone, Ramsgate,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,they went nuts for it.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"They actually, I think quite badly damaged"
00:27:20,00:27:22,the council finances by spending all their money
00:27:22,00:27:24,on pullermite because they wanted extra rocks
00:27:24,00:27:26,for the sea to make it more rocky.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- Oh, why?"
00:27:27,00:27:28,- This isn't rocky enough.
00:27:28,00:27:29,- That just makes swimming in the sea
00:27:29,00:27:30,more and more unpleasant.
00:27:30,00:27:31,- I think it's not inside the sea.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"So for example, Folkestone got paths and tunnels"
00:27:33,00:27:34,to get people down from the cliffs.
00:27:34,00:27:38,They wanted a gorgeous natural way to show people down.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"And so next time you see a rock, check."
00:27:40,00:27:41,"- Yeah, check."
00:27:41,00:27:42,- So how can you check?
00:27:42,00:27:43,Can you give it a knock in its hollow?
00:27:43,00:27:45,"It's not right, it's a rock."
00:27:45,00:27:47,- Most of the rocks you see day to day will be rocks.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- Oh, sure, absolutely."
00:27:48,00:27:50,"Yeah, but that's just law of averages."
00:27:50,00:27:52,But do take a photo and send them to Andy.
00:27:52,00:27:54,"Anytime you see a rock, I'll go through that."
00:27:54,00:27:55,"I'll tell you, if your rock is--"
00:27:55,00:27:56,"- They're a bit lighter, aren't they?"
00:27:56,00:27:58,They're lighter than normal rocks.
00:27:58,00:28:00,And they'll just look faker.
00:28:00,00:28:01,- They'll look a little bit like
00:28:01,00:28:03,"when you're queuing at a theme park, you know,"
00:28:03,00:28:04,the rockeries that you have.
00:28:04,00:28:05,Not quite as plastic as that.
00:28:05,00:28:06,- Not as plastic.
00:28:06,00:28:09,"- No, it's more realistic version of that."
00:28:09,00:28:09,You're right.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"- They were incredibly successful, weren't they?"
00:28:11,00:28:12,James Pullham.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"He set up this company, which is James Pullham and Son."
00:28:14,00:28:16,And it was a company that just went on and on.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"So when he retired, he handed it over to his son, James Pullham."
00:28:20,00:28:21,"And then when he retired,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"he handed it over to his son, James Pullham."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"And then when he retired,"
00:28:25,00:28:27,"he handed it over to his son, James Pullham."
00:28:27,00:28:29,- I think it was the second James Pullham
00:28:29,00:28:30,"who invented Pullhamite, wasn't it?"
00:28:30,00:28:31,As opposed to the first one.
00:28:31,00:28:32,- I think you're right.
00:28:32,00:28:33,- I think.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"- So, okay, minus one of the James Pullhams"
00:28:35,00:28:35,from that list there.
00:28:35,00:28:37,- He was helped by two of the other
00:28:37,00:28:39,"James Pullhams later in life,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,but also helped by another brother
00:28:41,00:28:43,called Michelangelo Pullham.
00:28:43,00:28:44,What a name.
00:28:44,00:28:47,"- He's not living up to that name, it's a fake rock."
00:28:47,00:28:49,- Everyone else in the family's called James
00:28:49,00:28:50,and he's called Michelangelo.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"- But it's two names, isn't it?"
00:28:52,00:28:54,He's Michelangelo Pullham.
00:28:54,00:28:56,They've divided Michelangelo in two.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"He's, you know, to the untrained eye,"
00:28:58,00:29:01,"he's Michel Pullham, real name Angelo."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- But he did all of the designing, didn't he, as well?"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"Yeah, so if you ever needed a rock,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"but it needs to be in a certain shape,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,you gave it to Michelangelo Pullham
00:29:09,00:29:10,and he did the shaping for it.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- That's brilliant.
00:29:11,00:29:14,- If you ever want a cherub to be emerging from your rock.
00:29:14,00:29:16,- We should give a shout out to the book about this
00:29:16,00:29:17,by Claude Hitching.
00:29:17,00:29:18,"- Ah, Claude Hitching."
00:29:18,00:29:19,What a man.
00:29:19,00:29:21,- He is the man on Pullamite.
00:29:21,00:29:24,So he's written a book called The Pullam Legacy
00:29:24,00:29:26,"and I mean, he has spent, I think, decades"
00:29:26,00:29:28,tracking down bits of Pullamite
00:29:28,00:29:29,because we still don't know where it all is.
00:29:29,00:29:30,That's why I'm saying you've got to check.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:32,00:29:34,"- It's all over the country, but there weren't, you know,"
00:29:34,00:29:37,accurate records kept everywhere this company worked.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"- I mean, it's not as urgent as like landmines and stuff, is it?"
00:29:40,00:29:43,Nothing's gonna happen if we don't find it.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"- When he started looking into it,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,he discovered that five of his direct ancestors
00:29:47,00:29:50,all had worked for the Pullam company at some point.
00:29:50,00:29:50,"- Oh, wow, really?"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"- And so he had a personal connection, yeah."
00:29:52,00:29:54,"And so basically he has, as Andy says,"
00:29:54,00:29:57,spent so long trying to track down
00:29:57,00:29:59,where bits of missing Pullamite have gone.
00:29:59,00:30:03,Sort of historically important bits in the Pullamite world.
00:30:03,00:30:04,Where have they gone?
00:30:04,00:30:06,"Where Pullamite fans are like, ""Oh, I can't believe we lost this."""
00:30:06,00:30:09,"And some of them have turned up in places like,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"he found there was the Q Fountain,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,which was made for the International Exhibition in 1862.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- Really?
00:30:15,00:30:15,- It had disappeared.
00:30:15,00:30:16,And where is it now?
00:30:16,00:30:19,"That's where James said earlier, Las Vegas."
00:30:19,00:30:20,It found its way there.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"- Oh, that's the one at the Bellagio?"
00:30:21,00:30:22,- Exactly.
00:30:22,00:30:23,- Wow.
00:30:23,00:30:25,- That was a famous one in the UK.
00:30:25,00:30:28,Pullamite fans distressed that they couldn't find it anymore.
00:30:28,00:30:28,It disappeared.
00:30:28,00:30:30,- That's incredible.
00:30:30,00:30:31,- One amazing Pullam legacy.
00:30:31,00:30:35,One of the biggest projects of James Pullam number three
00:30:35,00:30:38,is the Landscape Garden at Friar Park.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"Which is, yeah, and you don't know about this."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"It's near Henley, and you'll see why Dunn knows about this."
00:30:43,00:30:45,"It's maintained by a woman called Olivia Harrison,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,who is George Harrison's widow.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"And they bought it, but it sounds incredible."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"So originally it was sort of designed by its owner,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,"who's called Frank Crisp,"
00:30:55,00:30:58,"this really eccentric guy who basically,"
00:30:58,00:30:59,why are you looking at me so?
00:30:59,00:31:00,- It's a funny name.
00:31:00,00:31:01,- It's just a nice name.
00:31:01,00:31:01,- It's a funny name.
00:31:01,00:31:02,- He's a Frank Crisp.
00:31:02,00:31:03,- Crisp by name.
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Crisp by nature.
00:31:04,00:31:09,- He was a crispy eccentric man who designed his garden
00:31:09,00:31:12,"to look like an Alpine landscape, basically."
00:31:12,00:31:15,So full of these fake rocks that he got done by Pullam.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- And sorry, just with the Alpine thing,"
00:31:16,00:31:20,he actually had a model of the Matterhorn made.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- Yes. - Out of rocks.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- Not actual size.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"- Not actual size, different scale, yeah."
00:31:25,00:31:26,"But yeah, the Matterhorn is there."
00:31:26,00:31:27,- That's incredible.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"- Yeah, amazing."
00:31:28,00:31:30,"So it takes up like lots of acres,"
00:31:30,00:31:31,"that Matterhorn is pretty big,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"and that's not Pullam, that was someone else."
00:31:33,00:31:34,But basically it got really overgrown.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"I think some nuns moved into it for a while,"
00:31:36,00:31:37,and it got dilapidated.
00:31:37,00:31:40,And then George Harrison bought it
00:31:40,00:31:42,"and said, ""I'm gonna take this over."""
00:31:42,00:31:44,"And they cleared it, and they found all this stuff."
00:31:44,00:31:46,Like the Matterhorn was just sort of sticking out
00:31:46,00:31:47,of a bunch of rubble.
00:31:47,00:31:48,They barely even knew it was there.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"And it sounds like he had this incredible moment, George."
00:31:51,00:31:54,There's some sort of fake lakes built there.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"And at one point, he lowered himself on a rope"
00:31:57,00:31:59,into this cavern that was below this lake.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"So I guess this lake's on a, yeah,"
00:32:00,00:32:02,there's like a cave below this lake.
00:32:02,00:32:02,"- Sorry, the Cavern Club?"
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Or yeah, what?"
00:32:03,00:32:04,- What?
00:32:04,00:32:06,- The Cavern Club where the Beatles played in Liverpool.
00:32:06,00:32:07,- I should know that.
00:32:07,00:32:08,- Even I know that.
00:32:08,00:32:09,- Yeah.
00:32:09,00:32:10,(laughing)
00:32:10,00:32:11,- Actual Beatles hater.
00:32:11,00:32:13,(laughing)
00:32:13,00:32:15,- Maybe that's what drew him to it.
00:32:15,00:32:16,That's how he knew.
00:32:16,00:32:17,'Cause he lowered himself into this cavern
00:32:17,00:32:20,and underneath was this whole grotto.
00:32:20,00:32:24,So like pulomite grotto with these sparkling kind of courts
00:32:24,00:32:25,and stuff on the walls.
00:32:25,00:32:27,This like crazy magical landscape.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- Wow.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"- And yeah, and now you can kind of row through it"
00:32:30,00:32:31,and look at all these diamonds glistening
00:32:31,00:32:33,on the walls and stuff.
00:32:33,00:32:34,"And yeah, it sounds incredible."
00:32:34,00:32:36,- They do keep discovering these places.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"So even recently in 2000,"
00:32:38,00:32:40,"there was a couple who moved into a house,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,Dewstow house it was called.
00:32:42,00:32:46,And they started to notice all these weird rocks
00:32:46,00:32:47,sticking out of the ground.
00:32:47,00:32:48,- Okay.
00:32:48,00:32:49,- And they then started digging.
00:32:49,00:32:54,And they discovered this huge labyrinthine underground
00:32:54,00:32:56,"environment, this massive rock garden,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,"magical caverns, water flowing from one to another,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"tunnel systems, fountains, fake stalactites."
00:33:01,00:33:05,The whole thing was this enormous mad pulomite project
00:33:05,00:33:08,which a man called Henry Oakley had commissioned.
00:33:08,00:33:11,He was a railway director and he spent years
00:33:11,00:33:13,having this incredible environment built for himself
00:33:13,00:33:14,which just got buried.
00:33:14,00:33:17,It got buried under the M4 as it were
00:33:17,00:33:18,because there were all these mounds of earth
00:33:18,00:33:20,that were excavated to build the M4
00:33:20,00:33:21,and they just got dumped on top of it.
00:33:21,00:33:22,- Okay.
00:33:22,00:33:23,- And the owners started to notice
00:33:23,00:33:25,and they started excavating it.
00:33:25,00:33:29,And then a few years after that it won the award.
00:33:29,00:33:32,Alan Titchmarsh did a series on Britain's best back gardens
00:33:32,00:33:33,and it came in at number eight.
00:33:33,00:33:35,"- Oh, what a renaissance."
00:33:35,00:33:36,- Yeah.
00:33:36,00:33:37,- That little bit of land.
00:33:37,00:33:38,- Number eight.
00:33:38,00:33:41,"- Yeah, number eight, yeah, not the top seven."
00:33:41,00:33:43,"- Not top five, yeah."
00:33:43,00:33:44,- Imagine how exciting it is.
00:33:44,00:33:46,I honestly think that all our listeners
00:33:46,00:33:49,should go home now and dig up their entire gardens
00:33:49,00:33:51,in case there's a pulomite grotto under them.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"- Yes, that's a good idea."
00:33:53,00:33:56,"- You know, pulomite obviously wasn't the first fake rock"
00:33:56,00:34:00,and the sort of the only successful fake rock
00:34:00,00:34:03,in the first of the 1700s was code stone.
00:34:03,00:34:08,"So this was the 1770s, it was basically invented"
00:34:08,00:34:11,and it was the fake rock to have.
00:34:11,00:34:12,"And there were lots of startups,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,lots of fake rock startups that tried to make their own.
00:34:14,00:34:16,Nothing came anywhere close to code stone.
00:34:16,00:34:18,And it was this business that was run for 50 years
00:34:18,00:34:20,"by this amazing woman, Eleanor Code,"
00:34:20,00:34:24,"who just decided, I think it was 1771,"
00:34:24,00:34:26,she met this guy who made some fake stone
00:34:26,00:34:28,and she bought up this massive factory
00:34:28,00:34:30,"and said, okay, start making it."
00:34:30,00:34:32,And she fired him almost immediately
00:34:32,00:34:33,'cause decided he wasn't good enough
00:34:33,00:34:36,and brought on someone better at making fake rock.
00:34:36,00:34:38,And she was amazing business woman.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"So 50 years, she made this stone,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,"which if you've seen the lion on the South Bank,"
00:34:43,00:34:46,"that big lion, that's made of code stone."
00:34:46,00:34:50,"And that is hollow, so you can tell by knocking on it."
00:34:50,00:34:52,"And if you look inside code stone,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,"which usually you can't 'cause it's like a statue,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,"if you drill inside, you can see the fingerprints"
00:34:56,00:34:58,of the people who pushed it
00:34:58,00:35:00,into the plaster molds on the inside.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- Oh, that is cool."
00:35:01,00:35:03,"- Code sounds awesome, Eleanor Code,"
00:35:03,00:35:06,"'cause she worked with her mom for decades,"
00:35:06,00:35:07,"also called Eleanor Code,"
00:35:07,00:35:11,and there's a lot of confusion about which code was which.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"- Yeah, and have you heard about her grandma?"
00:35:13,00:35:14,"- No, Eleanor Code."
00:35:14,00:35:16,"- Her grandma, I actually don't know"
00:35:16,00:35:16,first name of her grandma.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"- Is there a thing about having,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,being a person who makes rocks
00:35:19,00:35:22,and having no imagination for names?
00:35:22,00:35:23,(all laughing)
00:35:23,00:35:26,"- And it's very much kept in the family, the rock thing."
00:35:26,00:35:27,"Yeah, Eleanor Code's grandmother"
00:35:27,00:35:29,obviously had the business mindset as well.
00:35:29,00:35:31,"She ran a textile business in Tiviton,"
00:35:31,00:35:34,"and she sent spies to Norwich,"
00:35:34,00:35:35,"which was very good on textiles,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,"who would then steal all of their tricks,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,then come back and be successful.
00:35:39,00:35:41,And she did things like she got carried around Tiviton
00:35:41,00:35:43,in a sedan chair all the time.
00:35:43,00:35:43,(all laughing)
00:35:43,00:35:45,She was a good character.
00:35:45,00:35:46,- Wow. - She sounds awesome.
00:35:46,00:35:47,- Yeah. - Have you guys heard
00:35:47,00:35:49,"of gunite? - No, gunite."
00:35:49,00:35:50,- It's another fake rock.
00:35:50,00:35:52,Can you guess how you make gunite?
00:35:52,00:35:53,- Fire it from a gun?
00:35:53,00:35:54,- Correct.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- Oh, no. - Yes."
00:35:55,00:35:58,"- You get a gun, it's not like a small gun,"
00:35:58,00:36:01,"it's like a big sort of hosepipe gun,"
00:36:01,00:36:05,"and you fire out this dry sort of concretey material,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,and then you have a little bit of water
00:36:07,00:36:08,"at the nozzle of the gun,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,"which kind of goes into the concrete as it comes out,"
00:36:11,00:36:14,and then you can fire it wherever you want to put a rock.
00:36:14,00:36:16,- So cool. - It's almost like
00:36:16,00:36:19,a 3D printer for rocks.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"- And it's used on bridges, isn't it?"
00:36:20,00:36:22,"If you ever see a bridge, really, or a tunnel,"
00:36:22,00:36:25,then it's probably gunite or shotcrete.
00:36:25,00:36:27,It also gets called the dry and wet versions.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"- Shotcrete gets used in taxidermy, I think."
00:36:29,00:36:32,"- Yeah, does it? - Yeah."
00:36:32,00:36:34,- It's because it's quite easy to shape.
00:36:34,00:36:37,"- Yeah, exactly, and so is it, God, I've forgotten,"
00:36:37,00:36:38,is it you're shaping and then you're putting the scale
00:36:38,00:36:39,on top of it?
00:36:39,00:36:41,"- Well, what you can do with concrete"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"is you can make the shape of something out of iron,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,"and you can fire the concrete onto it,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,"and it'll, yeah, like a mold, and it'll go on that."
00:36:47,00:36:48,- Yeah. - That kind of thing.
00:36:48,00:36:49,"- You don't have to make a mold for it,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"you can't fire it, 'cause what's it landing on?"
00:36:51,00:36:52,"You can't just fire it into mid-air,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"and it's like a spark plug. - Of course, of course, of course."
00:36:55,00:36:57,"- That makes sense, that's awesome."
00:36:57,00:37:00,- Ugly rocks are sort of venerated in China.
00:37:00,00:37:03,"I didn't really know about this thing, scholars rocks,"
00:37:03,00:37:06,"but you'd recognize them, and since the eighth century,"
00:37:06,00:37:09,"Confucians have, Confucian academics have basically said,"
00:37:09,00:37:13,"ugly, jagged rocks are great for contemplation,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,"and the idea is that they represent Confucianism,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,they're uncompromising.
00:37:17,00:37:20,"So from the eighth century, there's been a trend"
00:37:20,00:37:22,"for getting the ugliest rock you can find,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,"or the most jagged, or pitted, or misshapen,"
00:37:24,00:37:26,"putting it in your garden, and watching it."
00:37:26,00:37:29,(both laughing)
00:37:29,00:37:31,- That's really awesome. - To see what happens.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"- Wow, I know Anna, I think I know this about you,"
00:37:33,00:37:34,"'cause I know it about me,"
00:37:34,00:37:37,"you used to collect rocks when you were a kid, right?"
00:37:37,00:37:38,"- Yeah, of that I found in my gravel, yeah."
00:37:38,00:37:40,"- Yeah, yeah, did you like look for the ugly ones,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,or for the attractive ones?
00:37:42,00:37:44,"- I was very shallow, I wasn't a philosopher,"
00:37:44,00:37:45,"I just went for the fit ones, yeah."
00:37:45,00:37:47,Something pink and sparkly.
00:37:47,00:37:49,"- Wow, are there competitions?"
00:37:49,00:37:50,"- There actually should be, what they are."
00:37:50,00:37:52,- Ugly rock of the year.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"- There must be, 'cause they're judged"
00:37:54,00:37:55,"on certain qualities, so it must be,"
00:37:55,00:37:58,"for the sake of something, there are four categories,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,and these were determined by a guy called Mifu
00:38:00,00:38:03,"in the 12th century, who used to,"
00:38:03,00:38:05,- He was in charge of the Mifu movement.
00:38:05,00:38:08,(both laughing)
00:38:08,00:38:13,"- Yeah, he was a great campaigner for his day,"
00:38:13,00:38:16,"and he used to bow to rocks, so when he met royalty,"
00:38:16,00:38:19,"he'd walk in and bow to the rock instead of the emperor,"
00:38:19,00:38:20,and people got annoyed.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- Instead of the emperor?
00:38:21,00:38:21,- Yeah.
00:38:21,00:38:24,- Probably absolutely had to his own life.
00:38:24,00:38:26,"- Maybe he was just short-sighted, we don't know."
00:38:26,00:38:29,"- I met the queen a couple of years ago,"
00:38:29,00:38:31,but I only really talked to the Pelomite rocks
00:38:31,00:38:33,in the fucking palace.
00:38:33,00:38:36,(both laughing)
00:38:36,00:38:37,"- Anyway, they're judged, just to finish that,"
00:38:37,00:38:40,"they are judged on their thinness, their openness,"
00:38:40,00:38:42,"their holes, and their wrinkles."
00:38:42,00:38:43,You want to max out on all of that?
00:38:43,00:38:44,- Can't we all?
00:38:44,00:38:45,- Yes.
00:38:45,00:38:47,(upbeat music)
00:38:51,00:38:53,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:38:53,00:38:54,and that is my fact.
00:38:54,00:38:57,My fact this week is that following a theory
00:38:57,00:38:59,"that they wouldn't burn up on re-entry,"
00:38:59,00:39:02,Japanese scientists once planned to fly paper airplanes
00:39:02,00:39:06,from the International Space Station back onto Earth.
00:39:06,00:39:07,- Okay. - Very cool.
00:39:07,00:39:09,"- Now, why does that mean therefore you'd do it?"
00:39:09,00:39:11,'Cause I understand that maybe you wouldn't burn up
00:39:11,00:39:14,"because you're not going that fast, but even so,"
00:39:14,00:39:15,is it instead of something?
00:39:15,00:39:18,"- Well, I guess we are always trying to work out"
00:39:18,00:39:21,"different ways of doing space travel,"
00:39:21,00:39:26,constantly seeing who knows how important space paper.
00:39:26,00:39:28,- Lightweight vehicles for re-entry
00:39:28,00:39:30,would be immensely useful to have.
00:39:30,00:39:31,So if you can start--
00:39:31,00:39:33,"- You're not gonna sit on that paper aeroplane, are you?"
00:39:33,00:39:37,"- Well, no, but you might sit inside a big paper aeroplane,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"which are all treated card or something,"
00:39:39,00:39:41,or there are chemical compounds--
00:39:41,00:39:42,"- Oh, so is that what I was testing?"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"- They were, I mean, that's what they said"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"the justification was, was lighter vehicles for re-entry."
00:39:46,00:39:48,"- You don't need a reason for science, Hannah."
00:39:48,00:39:50,You can do science for science's sake.
00:39:50,00:39:51,- Good point. - All right.
00:39:51,00:39:54,- It discovers its own discoveries.
00:39:54,00:39:55,"Is that what that's what scientists say, isn't it?"
00:39:55,00:39:59,"- Yeah, that's the line, that's the official line in Latin."
00:39:59,00:40:01,- So how come they never did these happen?
00:40:01,00:40:03,"- Well, it's a really hard thing to do."
00:40:03,00:40:04,It was a really nice idea.
00:40:04,00:40:07,So this was in 2008 and there were researchers
00:40:07,00:40:09,at the University of Tokyo who teamed up
00:40:09,00:40:12,with Japan's Origami Airplane Association.
00:40:12,00:40:15,So this was gonna be origami paper planes
00:40:15,00:40:17,that were put together and put through.
00:40:17,00:40:19,And so they did all these tests in wind tunnels
00:40:19,00:40:21,at the University and they managed to show
00:40:21,00:40:24,that this plane could actually hold its own
00:40:24,00:40:26,at huge speeds of wind passing through it.
00:40:26,00:40:28,So it all looked like it could possibly work.
00:40:28,00:40:31,"The problem is, is that if they did try it"
00:40:31,00:40:32,"and it came back into the earth,"
00:40:32,00:40:34,"it's so tiny without any GPS device on it,"
00:40:34,00:40:35,we would just know nothing.
00:40:35,00:40:37,It would be impossible to tell in 2008.
00:40:37,00:40:39,"- I think another problem is,"
00:40:39,00:40:41,I would say at least two thirds of the paper aeroplanes
00:40:41,00:40:44,that I ever make either kind of go straight up
00:40:44,00:40:46,and stall and land where I threw them
00:40:46,00:40:48,or go straight down and crash into the ground.
00:40:48,00:40:50,So you need to train your astronauts
00:40:50,00:40:52,"to be proper paper aeroplane makers, don't you?"
00:40:52,00:40:53,- That's true.
00:40:53,00:40:54,- And they've already got a lot on their plates.
00:40:54,00:40:55,- They've got a lot of training today.
00:40:55,00:40:58,"- Well, origami is useful in space in other ways, isn't it?"
00:40:58,00:41:00,So I guess I can see where they're coming from.
00:41:00,00:41:03,I think it's been used by Japan on solar panels.
00:41:03,00:41:06,"And in fact, by NASA more recently,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,"they certainly had a plan to, and they use mirror folds."
00:41:09,00:41:10,"And I think, is that how you pronounce it?"
00:41:10,00:41:12,We've done it on QI.
00:41:12,00:41:14,"- Mirror folds are basically how you fold maps, for instance,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,"you know, when they fold up really small and flat"
00:41:16,00:41:18,and then you can spring them out with
00:41:18,00:41:19,so that they're really big.
00:41:19,00:41:21,- It's almost like an accordion.
00:41:21,00:41:24,"Like you, they're in a really small little square"
00:41:24,00:41:26,and then you pull them out and then you push them back in
00:41:26,00:41:28,and pull them out and push them back in.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"And then like a normal map,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,you're always trying to find the folds and stuff.
00:41:31,00:41:33,But these just kind of go back where they should do.
00:41:33,00:41:34,- That's really cool.
00:41:34,00:41:35,- 'Cause it'd be so annoying if an accordion
00:41:35,00:41:37,"was like a normal map where every time you pushed it in,"
00:41:37,00:41:40,you had to fold it and it's up the right way.
00:41:40,00:41:43,- What do you think is the world record
00:41:43,00:41:46,"for folding 1,000 origami cranes?"
00:41:46,00:41:47,"- 1,000."
00:41:47,00:41:49,(laughing)
00:41:49,00:41:50,- Damn it.
00:41:50,00:41:53,"What time, how long do you think it took the person?"
00:41:53,00:41:55,So do you remember I did this a few years ago?
00:41:55,00:41:56,- Yes.
00:41:56,00:41:58,- It took me about two months.
00:41:58,00:41:58,- Okay.
00:41:58,00:42:00,"- Yeah, you did it in the office as well"
00:42:00,00:42:01,"'cause you're hiding it from your,"
00:42:01,00:42:02,it was a present for your wife.
00:42:02,00:42:03,"And yeah, so."
00:42:03,00:42:04,- I wasn't hiding it from my wife.
00:42:04,00:42:06,"- Yeah, it was a present for her."
00:42:06,00:42:07,So you were building it.
00:42:07,00:42:09,- I was really embarrassed and I didn't want to tell her.
00:42:09,00:42:10,"No, it was a gift."
00:42:10,00:42:13,"But yeah, how long do you reckon it takes to do 1,000?"
00:42:13,00:42:14,- Eight hours.
00:42:14,00:42:16,"- Eight hours, that's a bit less than one a minute."
00:42:16,00:42:18,"- But this is gonna be the record, right?"
00:42:18,00:42:21,"So this is someone who's, I'm gonna say,"
00:42:21,00:42:23,I'm gonna go as low as like two hours.
00:42:23,00:42:23,- What?
00:42:23,00:42:24,- Just for this?
00:42:24,00:42:25,"- 1,000."
00:42:25,00:42:26,"- Yeah, just because like."
00:42:26,00:42:28,- But how many seconds are there in an hour?
00:42:28,00:42:29,- It's not gonna take a second to do a crane.
00:42:29,00:42:31,"Surely a minute to do a crane, a bit less maybe."
00:42:31,00:42:33,- I think it'll take a couple of minutes.
00:42:33,00:42:36,"I don't know, I think a couple of days."
00:42:36,00:42:38,"- Couple of days, thank you, Andy, because these two."
00:42:38,00:42:39,(laughing)
00:42:39,00:42:40,"- Sorry, Jay."
00:42:40,00:42:42,"- Poor Evelyn Chia of Colchester, England."
00:42:42,00:42:43,(laughing)
00:42:43,00:42:45,- Henceforth known as the slacker.
00:42:45,00:42:47,What did she do then?
00:42:47,00:42:49,- She is a teenager from Colchester
00:42:49,00:42:52,and she did it in nine hours and 31 minutes.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"- Well, that's much more impressive"
00:42:53,00:42:55,"than I would have thought, Dan and Anna."
00:42:55,00:42:56,(laughing)
00:42:56,00:42:57,- I think.
00:42:57,00:42:58,- Two hours.
00:42:58,00:42:59,- How good do they have to be?
00:42:59,00:43:00,"I mean, can I just scrunch up lots of bits of paper"
00:43:00,00:43:01,and claim their cranes?
00:43:01,00:43:04,"- I'll be honest, when I did it towards the end of the 1,000,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,they got less and less looking like cranes.
00:43:06,00:43:08,- Did you hide those cranes at the back of the crowd?
00:43:08,00:43:10,"- I really do, yeah."
00:43:10,00:43:13,But she did it as a fundraiser for NHS charities.
00:43:13,00:43:14,- Nice.
00:43:14,00:43:15,"- And in fact, I gave her some money for it"
00:43:15,00:43:16,'cause I was so impressed
00:43:16,00:43:18,'cause it did take me literally two months to do it.
00:43:18,00:43:19,- That's very cool.
00:43:19,00:43:20,- But yeah.
00:43:20,00:43:21,"- Oh, that's lovely."
00:43:21,00:43:23,- I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica article
00:43:23,00:43:25,on origami and the origins of it.
00:43:25,00:43:29,And it's the first unequivocal document
00:43:29,00:43:34,"that talks about origami is a poem by Ihara Saikaku,"
00:43:34,00:43:38,"which was written in 1680, which talks about these butterflies"
00:43:38,00:43:39,made from paper.
00:43:39,00:43:42,"But this guy, Ihara Saikaku,"
00:43:42,00:43:47,"he once composed 23,500 verses in a single day."
00:43:47,00:43:51,- Jesus.
00:43:51,00:43:52,- Wow.
00:43:52,00:43:53,- Yeah.
00:43:53,00:43:54,- Does it have a chorus?
00:43:54,00:43:55,Is it a cheek?
00:43:55,00:43:56,Half of them are the same.
00:43:56,00:43:59,- I think they're on different subjects.
00:43:59,00:44:01,- Are there even that many subjects?
00:44:01,00:44:02,- I already saw.
00:44:02,00:44:05,"And apparently in the 20th century,"
00:44:05,00:44:07,origami was helped by the fact that it was used a lot
00:44:07,00:44:10,"in Rudolf Steiner's schools,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"which Dan, you went to one of those."
00:44:12,00:44:14,"- I was a Steiner, yeah, I'm a Steiner kid."
00:44:14,00:44:16,- Did you learn how to make origami?
00:44:16,00:44:18,"- Yeah, we did, but we did do Japanese classes."
00:44:18,00:44:20,So I don't know if it was integrated.
00:44:20,00:44:22,We didn't have separate origami.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"- Okay, 'cause apparently, according to the article,"
00:44:25,00:44:28,they emphasize kind of hands-on learning for kids
00:44:28,00:44:29,as opposed to rote learning.
00:44:29,00:44:31,"And so, yeah, origami was very popular,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,especially in the German Steiner schools.
00:44:33,00:44:35,"- Okay, yeah, I mean, we definitely did origami at school."
00:44:35,00:44:38,"- That's very interesting, 'cause I think Germany"
00:44:38,00:44:41,kind of brought advanced origami to Japan
00:44:41,00:44:42,via kindergarten. - Really?
00:44:42,00:44:45,- The kindergarten movement obviously started in Germany.
00:44:45,00:44:46,It's a German word.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"And this is the 1830s, and this guy, Friedrich Frohbill,"
00:44:49,00:44:50,decided that origami would be a great way
00:44:50,00:44:53,"of educating children in both maths and art,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"'cause it's very mathematical and logical,"
00:44:55,00:44:57,"and like very difficult spatial reasoning,"
00:44:57,00:44:59,but also quite artistic.
00:44:59,00:45:01,And he exported this around the world
00:45:01,00:45:02,"with this kindergarten movement,"
00:45:02,00:45:04,"and it was really taken up in Japan,"
00:45:04,00:45:05,where they were already doing quite a lot
00:45:05,00:45:07,"of slightly simpler origami,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,but then they started making pigs and houses
00:45:09,00:45:11,and sofas and stuff like that.
00:45:11,00:45:13,"- Cool, so Germany exported origami to Japan,"
00:45:13,00:45:14,is what you're saying?
00:45:14,00:45:17,"- I'm saying Japan had a kind of origami,"
00:45:17,00:45:19,and then Germany exported a more advanced kind.
00:45:19,00:45:22,- We think probably invented in China origami
00:45:22,00:45:25,because paper was invented in China.
00:45:25,00:45:29,"So, yeah, probably the first people to fold paper"
00:45:29,00:45:31,were the first people to invent it.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"But then went to Japan and became big bear,"
00:45:33,00:45:35,"then came over, picked up by Germany,"
00:45:35,00:45:38,"improved, sent back over to Japan again."
00:45:38,00:45:40,"- And if there are, for German, Japanese, Chinese listeners,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,we are not denigrating any origami
00:45:42,00:45:45,"or treatments of any countries, okay?"
00:45:45,00:45:45,Please don't write in.
00:45:45,00:45:47,"- And if you do, please don't fold it"
00:45:47,00:45:49,in such a way that we can't read the letters.
00:45:49,00:45:50,(laughing)
00:45:50,00:45:53,- The person who popularized origami in the West
00:45:53,00:45:56,"is a guy called Gershon Legman, and he--"
00:45:56,00:45:57,(laughing)
00:45:57,00:45:58,- Was he a breast man or a Legman?
00:45:58,00:46:00,(laughing)
00:46:00,00:46:02,"- Well, it's funny you should ask."
00:46:02,00:46:04,He did a bunch of other things.
00:46:04,00:46:05,"So, the way he popularized it was,"
00:46:05,00:46:09,"he found this origami prodigy called Akira Yoshizawa,"
00:46:09,00:46:12,"and he put on exhibitions of his work and stuff,"
00:46:12,00:46:13,and it all spread.
00:46:13,00:46:15,"But the other things he tried,"
00:46:15,00:46:16,"he tried lots of stuff, Gershon Legman."
00:46:16,00:46:18,"He collected vulgar limericks,"
00:46:18,00:46:21,so he had a massive collection of scene limericks.
00:46:21,00:46:23,"- He wrote the book, ""The Rationale of a Dirty Joe."""
00:46:23,00:46:23,- Yes.
00:46:23,00:46:25,- It's a seminal set of books.
00:46:25,00:46:26,- And it's by someone called Legman.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"- Well, it's also called by, what's his first name?"
00:46:28,00:46:29,- Gershon.
00:46:29,00:46:30,But he uses G.
00:46:30,00:46:33,"So, G spot Legman."
00:46:33,00:46:34,- Wow.
00:46:34,00:46:35,"- Sorry, G dot."
00:46:35,00:46:38,"- Yeah, so G spot Legman was the name for his--"
00:46:38,00:46:40,"- That's a stretch, so don't, you don't call it a spot."
00:46:40,00:46:42,"You don't say, can you put a spot"
00:46:42,00:46:44,"at the end of that sentence, please?"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"- Yeah, that was his little gag."
00:46:46,00:46:47,- Wow.
00:46:47,00:46:47,- Cool.
00:46:47,00:46:49,- This is so weird seeing the interests
00:46:49,00:46:51,of Dan intersect with what we're talking about.
00:46:51,00:46:52,(laughing)
00:46:52,00:46:53,"Not dirty jokes, that doesn't mean jokes in general."
00:46:53,00:46:56,"- I just know, yeah, these books are like cult classics."
00:46:56,00:46:56,- Yeah.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"- He said, ""No ideas."""
00:46:57,00:46:59,"- Well, Andy wrote, yeah, 'cause he wrote stuff"
00:46:59,00:47:01,"about how to give good oral sex, I think,"
00:47:01,00:47:04,"like the best oral sex in gratification,"
00:47:04,00:47:05,maybe that's where you know from.
00:47:05,00:47:07,"- I'm not saying I have that copy,"
00:47:07,00:47:09,"but yeah, I've definitely got the joke books."
00:47:09,00:47:11,- He invented the vibrating dildo.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"- Got that, got that."
00:47:12,00:47:14,(laughing)
00:47:14,00:47:17,"- Okay, well, you can have a spin off Gershon Legman podcast,"
00:47:17,00:47:19,"but yeah, cool guy."
00:47:19,00:47:20,- Wow.
00:47:20,00:47:22,"The prodigy you just mentioned, Akira Yoshioaza,"
00:47:22,00:47:24,he does sound very interesting.
00:47:24,00:47:27,He pioneered wet folding.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"Before that, I'm not sure wet folding was a technique."
00:47:29,00:47:31,- And can you explain what wet folding is?
00:47:31,00:47:34,"- Absolutely, wet folding is the main, I'd say,"
00:47:34,00:47:37,division in the origami world.
00:47:37,00:47:39,Wet folders dampen the paper
00:47:39,00:47:40,so they can get the curves just right.
00:47:40,00:47:43,"Dry folders, I don't need to explain."
00:47:43,00:47:46,Don't do the wetting.
00:47:46,00:47:49,"And yeah, so Yoshioaza was the guy who--"
00:47:49,00:47:50,- Really?
00:47:50,00:47:51,"- He worked as an origami man from 1937 onwards,"
00:47:51,00:47:52,I think when he was very young.
00:47:52,00:47:53,- Right.
00:47:53,00:47:57,"- Yeah, and he eliminated cutting from the procedure."
00:47:57,00:47:59,"So you used to cut the paper, I think,"
00:47:59,00:47:59,before you were folding it.
00:47:59,00:48:00,- Okay.
00:48:00,00:48:02,"- And that's another, again,"
00:48:02,00:48:04,"you know, Fosbury Flop moment in the development of origami"
00:48:04,00:48:05,"where, you know, you're not cutting things"
00:48:05,00:48:06,'cause that's like making a snowflake
00:48:06,00:48:08,"when you're a kid, you know, you fold it up"
00:48:08,00:48:09,"and you can't-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:09,00:48:11,- That feels like the anti-Fosbury Flop moment.
00:48:11,00:48:12,That's like you've banned the Fosbury Flop
00:48:12,00:48:14,and you're back stuck with a scissor kick again.
00:48:14,00:48:15,(laughing)
00:48:15,00:48:16,I run it because you're not allowed to scissor it.
00:48:16,00:48:18,- It's a reverse Fosbury.
00:48:18,00:48:18,(laughing)
00:48:18,00:48:20,- It's a reverse Fosbury.
00:48:20,00:48:22,- Another very cool origami figure
00:48:22,00:48:25,was this guy called Robert Lang.
00:48:25,00:48:26,Did you guys read by him?
00:48:26,00:48:27,- How do you say he's an origami figure?
00:48:27,00:48:30,Is that a human in the origami world
00:48:30,00:48:31,or was he made of paper?
00:48:31,00:48:34,"- He's not made of paper, he is just into paper."
00:48:34,00:48:35,- Got it.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"- And a bit like this guy, Andy, he was a physicist."
00:48:38,00:48:41,He worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab
00:48:41,00:48:44,and then he decided he preferred folding paper
00:48:44,00:48:46,and he was this mass prodigy
00:48:46,00:48:47,who was doing very well in physics
00:48:47,00:48:50,"and it was 2001, he finally decided to give it all up"
00:48:50,00:48:52,'cause it was taking up so much of his time
00:48:52,00:48:53,folding paper things.
00:48:53,00:48:55,And he's been very useful with his origami.
00:48:55,00:48:58,"So for instance, airbags made based"
00:48:58,00:49:00,on origami principles now.
00:49:00,00:49:02,And that's because they went to Robert Lang
00:49:02,00:49:04,"and they said, look, we really like the way"
00:49:04,00:49:05,that you can fold something really small
00:49:05,00:49:07,and then it can expand really big.
00:49:07,00:49:09,Like he was able to do that.
00:49:09,00:49:11,"- On that note, in 2013, there was a company"
00:49:11,00:49:13,which announced it was inventing an origami condom
00:49:13,00:49:15,for Bill Gates.
00:49:15,00:49:16,- For Bill Gates?
00:49:16,00:49:18,(laughing)
00:49:18,00:49:20,"- As he got such an unusually shaped penis,"
00:49:20,00:49:22,he has to have a special condom made.
00:49:22,00:49:25,- Bill and Bill Gates Foundation is what I mean.
00:49:25,00:49:28,I was using it on his shorthand and I'm sorry.
00:49:28,00:49:29,"I'm sorry, please don't sue."
00:49:29,00:49:31,(laughing)
00:49:31,00:49:32,There was a designer called Danny Resnick
00:49:32,00:49:35,and he had worked out an origami condom
00:49:35,00:49:38,"which apparently was much more comfortable to put on,"
00:49:38,00:49:43,fit on more easily and it opened up like an accordion.
00:49:43,00:49:44,- I can play the accordion a little bit.
00:49:44,00:49:48,"And when you first open it up, it makes quite a weird noise."
00:49:48,00:49:51,- I don't know if it wheezed as it was opened up.
00:49:51,00:49:53,"Anyway, it never happened because Resnick himself"
00:49:53,00:49:55,was accused of fraud the next year
00:49:55,00:49:57,and had to pay back the public fancy being granted.
00:49:57,00:49:59,So the world is still waiting for the origami condom.
00:49:59,00:50:03,- It would be great if it did play a tune as he wanted it.
00:50:03,00:50:04,- You can't get that little keyboard
00:50:04,00:50:06,"onto something that size, I don't think."
00:50:06,00:50:07,"- It's good it's gonna sound,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,"every time you have sex, it's gonna sound like a sea shanty."
00:50:09,00:50:11,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:50:11,00:50:13,- Soon will the weather bag come.
00:50:13,00:50:14,(laughing)
00:50:14,00:50:15,"- Well, I hope it is soon."
00:50:15,00:50:18,(upbeat music)
00:50:21,00:50:22,"Okay, that's it."
00:50:22,00:50:23,That is all of our facts.
