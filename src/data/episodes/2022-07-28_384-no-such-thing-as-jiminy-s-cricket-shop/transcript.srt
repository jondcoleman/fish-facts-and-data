1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,020
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,460
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,300
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,980
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,180
 My name is Dan Schreiber

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,380
 and I am sitting at a very comfortable distance

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,940
 from Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,180
 and James Harkin.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,140
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,860
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,020
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,100
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,780
 - My fact this week is that in 1877,

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,740
 all able-bodied men in Nebraska were required by law

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,940
 to spend up to 12 days killing grasshoppers.

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,420
 - Wow, wow.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,540
 Wait a minute, I'm always looking for the loophole

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,820
 up to 12 days.

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,100
 (laughing)

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,300
 It was, well, they had to spend two days, definitely.

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,060
 So you can't get out of a weekend.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,420
 And then if there was further work needed,

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,180
 then the government state government could call on you

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,020
 to spend an extra 10 days.

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,060
 - So it was up to 12 days

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,980
 because some people enjoyed it so much,

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,260
 it started to look psychopathic.

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,980
 And it's like, all right, we need to cut you off here.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,820
 - Oh yeah.

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,660
 (laughing)

32
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,500
 - Or develop something else.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,460
 - You can't devote 365 to it.

34
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,740
 - How many grasshoppers can there be that everyone,

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,500
 I mean, I know Nebraska even though

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,820
 is quite sparsely populated,

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,580
 but that's a lot of grasshoppers to kill, isn't it?

38
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,980
 - Definitely more than one grasshopper per person.

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,300
 So it was a lot.

40
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,580
 This was the Rocky Mountain Locust,

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,140
 which is a grasshopper.

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,780
 And it was this massive scourge in the 1870s and the 1860s.

43
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,500
 It basically ruined the kind of Great Plains area,

44
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,860
 so Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, those kind of areas.

45
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,060
 And it destroyed crops, it ruined people's livelihoods.

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,060
 It drove the population out and they had to do something.

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
 So the states passed various laws saying,

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,180
 get out and do your duty, murder grasshoppers.

49
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,020
 - Wow.

50
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,580
 - It's insane, there's a sighting in 1875,

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,060
 so two years before this law was put into place,

52
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,540
 where it was estimated that there was 198,000 square miles

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,300
 of locusts swarming.

54
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,660
 So that's larger than the size of California.

55
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,540
 - In that area of 198,000 square miles,

56
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,700
 which I reckon is just a little bit smaller

57
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,820
 than England and Scotland combined,

58
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,300
 there were 12.5 trillion insects.

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,740
 Okay, and to put that into perspective,

60
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,860
 if you imagine taking a normal keyboard

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,540
 on your computer and covering all of England

62
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,460
 and Scotland in keyboards, so there's no gaps,

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,540
 each grasshopper would have one keyboard to sit on

64
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,700
 over the whole of England and Scotland.

65
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,060
 - Well, why?

66
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,460
 Why are you putting grasshoppers on keyboards?

67
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,380
 - Grasshoppers give an infinite keyboard to eventually.

68
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,020
 - They actually write out the works of Milton, don't they?

69
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,460
 - They account for extraordinary, aren't they?

70
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,780
 I mean, even every able-bodied man in Nebraska

71
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,620
 wouldn't have been able to do a huge amount about this.

72
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,820
 Because they ate the wool off sheep

73
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,380
 when they were passing by, they're just so discreet.

74
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,620
 They ate clothing off people's backs.

75
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,460
 - I don't believe that.

76
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,980
 I mean, it's probably true, but like, calm on.

77
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,500
 - An unsexy striptease.

78
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 - There was a woman who claimed it, wasn't there?

79
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
 Who said that she was wearing a white

80
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,020
 and green stripey dress and she was descended on

81
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,780
 by these grasshoppers and they ate all the green stripes,

82
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,060
 at which point I guess all the white stripes fall off.

83
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,900
 But, you know.

84
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
 - That's where the white stripes

85
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
 got the name from, actually.

86
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,780
 The band, they were walking past this woman

87
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,900
 and were like, what's the rest of her dress?

88
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,300
 There were stories about how trains came to a halt

89
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,860
 'cause they were skidding on locusts.

90
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,700
 - Oh yeah.

91
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,940
 - There were just so many on the ground

92
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,820
 that they were just, yeah, wiping out.

93
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,660
 - Laura Ingalls Wilder, who wrote

94
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,300
 "The Little House" on the prairie,

95
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,220
 she was there when this happened.

96
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,900
 And one of her stories on the banks of Plum Creek,

97
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,740
 they talk about this happening to her family.

98
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,500
 And she said that her father had to walk 300 miles

99
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,140
 to find work on a farm that didn't

100
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,660
 have the grasshoppers on it.

101
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,500
 - Jesus.

102
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,460
 - If you can imagine that.

103
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,780
 And that she would walk around

104
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,100
 and they would squish under her birth feet

105
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,420
 and she would hear the sound of millions of jaws

106
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,700
 biting and chewing.

107
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
 - Oh. - Nice.

108
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,340
 - Wow. - Amazing.

109
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,380
 - I mean, if you're faced with that,

110
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,260
 actually what good can it do to spend 12 days?

111
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,820
 12 days feels a bit undirect.

112
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,380
 - Yeah, you gotta devote the whole year to it.

113
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,820
 - Wait, how many did you say the word, James?

114
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,420
 12 trillion. - 12.5 trillion.

115
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,580
 - Okay, so then again, if every,

116
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,140
 hang on, 12 trillion.

117
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,980
 - No, if the whole of Nebraska gets a trillion a day.

118
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,820
 - Yes.

119
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,300
 Then it just needs one guy.

120
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
 (laughing)

121
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,900
 - If you have a million people in Nebraska say,

122
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,740
 they have to get a million each per day.

123
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,020
 - They are small though.

124
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,780
 - It's a shame that we didn't just,

125
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,140
 Nebraska didn't just allow this to just continue.

126
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,380
 And there's just one spot on earth where humans are living

127
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,340
 just completely covered, naked, covered in locusts.

128
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,180
 - What?

129
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,020
 - With no food to eat.

130
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,060
 - That is a shame.

131
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,940
 - We send care packages just as an experiment.

132
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,380
 You know how sometimes big experiments happen?

133
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,340
 - What are we experimenting on?

134
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,100
 - Is there a symbiotic life with locusts

135
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,060
 that we're missing out on

136
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,580
 that they were trying to introduce us to?

137
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,100
 - They actually only eat your clothes off you

138
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,540
 so they can become your clothes.

139
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,100
 (laughing)

140
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,420
 - Well, some people did suggest that at the time

141
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,580
 a symbiotic relationship with them kind of.

142
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,980
 So Missouri state entomologist who's called Charles Riley,

143
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,420
 he just said that why don't we just eat them?

144
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,900
 They could be turned into soup

145
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,140
 or prepared John the Baptist style.

146
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
 And John the Baptist style is where you fry

147
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,500
 grasshoppers with honey.

148
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,140
 Because in Matthew first three chapter four in the Bible,

149
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,500
 it says his meat was locusts and wild honey.

150
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,340
 John the Baptist when he goes into the desert.

151
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,580
 - Not sure it's gonna take off

152
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,500
 as the next hit restaurant concept, is it?

153
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,340
 - No.

154
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,620
 - Wild honey, please.

155
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,460
 - Yeah.

156
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,300
 - Oh no.

157
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,020
 The portions are gonna be massive.

158
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,500
 - Have you guys eaten locusts?

159
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,580
 - I haven't, but I do know that in Australia,

160
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,060
 they rebranded them as sky prawns,

161
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,780
 you know, to make them a bit more appealing.

162
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,260
 - Very high in protein.

163
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,380
 Like the North American communities

164
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,300
 who lived in that area around the time.

165
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,460
 So for instance, the Shoshone people, they would eat them.

166
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,260
 So they would turn them into flour

167
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,140
 and they would make bread out of grasshoppers and stuff.

168
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,540
 So that's how they dealt with it

169
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,660
 before it happened to the Westerners who went over.

170
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,620
 Although I don't think they ever had it quite as bad

171
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,460
 that we know.

172
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,580
 - No, I mean, eating is not a solution to the 12 trillion,

173
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,420
 is it?

174
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,860
 You can't just wander down your field with your mouth open.

175
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,980
 Well, problem solved.

176
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,580
 My crop's absolutely fine.

177
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,780
 - So the Rocky Mountain locust,

178
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,100
 which we're talking about, which led to this plague,

179
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,300
 was crazy at the time and we did fight battle with them.

180
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,940
 And the battle was won by the humans to the point

181
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,900
 that they're now an extinct species.

182
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,620
 - Hang on, hang on, hang on.

183
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,380
 You're giving us credit for that.

184
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,820
 - No, I'm saying long-term, they are no longer on earth.

185
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,180
 - How did we win the battle?

186
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,020
 - Well, in-

187
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,860
 - Why not because of us?

188
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,860
 - No, no, no, I'm just saying history.

189
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,180
 They're no longer here on our planet.

190
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,340
 - Who writes the history books, Anna?

191
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,180
 - Okay.

192
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,220
 - I'll say it's because of us.

193
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,060
 I think you're right, Dan.

194
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,140
 - It was largely because of us, but also as animals.

195
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,100
 And it was changing agricultural conditions.

196
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,940
 - It was, yeah.

197
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,260
 - Who changes the agricultural conditions.

198
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,100
 - Thank you, James.

199
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,020
 - Who brings the animals.

200
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,860
 - Thank you, James.

201
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,700
 - Mr. Man.

202
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,540
 - There we go.

203
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,500
 - But we didn't do it on purpose.

204
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,340
 - It was an accident.

205
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,940
 - Yeah, we absolutely didn't want to do it.

206
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,900
 And that's horrible to decimate a species to extinction.

207
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,460
 But they can still be found,

208
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,420
 despite being extinct in glaciers around there.

209
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,300
 There's this one place,

210
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,740
 which is called the Grasshopper Glacier.

211
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
 And it's in Wyoming where all of them

212
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,380
 have sort of just been frozen in time inside there.

213
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,940
 And you can see them when you look into it

214
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,780
 and people ship them out.

215
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
 - Can they come back like cut in America or?

216
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,620
 - There is a theory.

217
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,140
 Some scientists think there might be

218
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,220
 a few lurking around somewhere.

219
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,660
 - Not ready to come back.

220
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,980
 Like the glacier melts and suddenly the grasshopper's taken over.

221
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,340
 - Not ready to mount the full counter attack,

222
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,300
 but there are scientists who think

223
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,060
 they might still be out there somewhere.

224
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,860
 - Well, I thought, as in not in the glaciers,

225
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,700
 but actually out there.

226
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,540
 - Yeah, exactly.

227
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,860
 - Yeah, because so we don't,

228
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,980
 even though we've said like this agriculture

229
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,420
 or environment or climate change,

230
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,100
 but really we don't know, right?

231
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,820
 It's a massive mystery.

232
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,180
 And they just vanished.

233
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,020
 So it was 1877, it was still pretty bad.

234
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,660
 Pretty much by the 1880s, they'd gone.

235
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,780
 I think the last spotting was in the like the eight 1901

236
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,980
 or something or right at the start

237
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,700
 of the 20th century anyway.

238
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,940
 And they vanished, but it could just be

239
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,340
 that they stopped swarming

240
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,580
 because locusts just turned back into grasshoppers

241
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,620
 when they go out of a swarm.

242
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,380
 And they could just be hiding, as you say in plain sight,

243
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,460
 waiting to regroup.

244
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,780
 - When you say they turn into grasshoppers,

245
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,860
 they don't change, do they?

246
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,620
 We just change our name for them.

247
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,140
 It's like literally one animal is called a grasshopper.

248
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,340
 When it's with all its mates, we call them locusts.

249
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,180
 - You're kidding.

250
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,020
 - Yeah.

251
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,980
 - It's not like Batman and suddenly

252
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,300
 it's a whole change of outfit.

253
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,980
 - They kind of, they do change outfit.

254
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,820
 They definitely do.

255
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,660
 - Yeah, they change color in it.

256
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,100
 - Because they get stronger, they get darker,

257
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,180
 they get more mobile, their color changes.

258
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,100
 And in fact, until the 1920s,

259
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,460
 they were assumed to be different species.

260
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,300
 It's really weird.

261
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,940
 There were two versions of this desert locust.

262
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,220
 One is in Hulk mode and one is not.

263
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,940
 And then we thought they were completely different.

264
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,420
 - How quickly do they change though?

265
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,940
 - That feels like that should take a while.

266
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,620
 It's not as soon as they start swarming,

267
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,820
 they just all turn blue.

268
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,500
 - Kind of is, it's really weird.

269
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,660
 So basically they have wild populations

270
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,260
 which swell up after rains because there's lots of food.

271
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,060
 So plants are growing so they can eat lots.

272
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,900
 But then if the land gets parched,

273
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,140
 they get pushed into a smaller and smaller area.

274
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,300
 And then this chemical serotonin kicks in

275
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,900
 in their brain, which we have to,

276
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,500
 which is associated with happiness for us, I think.

277
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,860
 But anyway, not for them because the serotonin

278
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,380
 basically turns them into Hulk mode.

279
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,820
 - We don't know that they're not happy.

280
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,460
 - That's true, they can be thrilled.

281
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,100
 And they just set off and they go for it.

282
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,260
 And it's very rare for them to switch out of swarm mode

283
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,700
 once they're in it because any offspring born

284
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,580
 during a swarm are also swarmers.

285
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,900
 - Yes, okay.

286
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,780
 - I actually do know how you can turn them into locusts.

287
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,020
 So the way you do that is you tickle them

288
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,140
 on the back of the legs.

289
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,420
 - Is that right?

290
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,500
 - Yeah, and scientists tried this.

291
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,620
 They had this theory that what happens is

292
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,220
 they are incredibly antisocial.

293
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,580
 Like grasshoppers hate each other, usually.

294
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,700
 But when they get hungry,

295
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,060
 they go to the same bit of food

296
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,740
 and they start rubbing up against each other.

297
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,220
 And eventually that rubbing stimulates them

298
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,260
 to suddenly want to swarm.

299
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,780
 - Do they become thigmo-tactic?

300
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,460
 - I think they become thigmo-tactic, yeah.

301
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,780
 - Favorite word, fish word.

302
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,940
 - It's really the fish word.

303
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,780
 - Friend of the podcast.

304
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,620
 - Friend of the podcast.

305
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,460
 - Friend of the podcast.

306
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,300
 - Thigmo-tactic.

307
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
 - We should have her on.

308
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,980
 - That's really cool.

309
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,820
 So that explains the serotonin thing, right?

310
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
 Because they become like more loving

311
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,820
 to their fellow grasshopper.

312
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,660
 - Yes.

313
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
 - Is that right?

314
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,340
 - Yeah, or at least want to hang out with them.

315
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,180
 Although there's also a theory

316
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,020
 that the reason they're swarming is

317
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,180
 they all want to eat each other.

318
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,020
 So I don't know how much love that is.

319
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,860
 - Yeah, I wish they do.

320
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,700
 That's when I read that.

321
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,860
 If they fall behind in the swarm,

322
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,740
 whoever's behind will chew them up.

323
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,380
 I mean, that is a terrible.

324
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,260
 - That happens in the Tour de France as well, actually.

325
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,580
 So one really important thing of this locust swarm

326
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,580
 in the 1870s and 1880s is what did the farmers do?

327
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,940
 Because basically all of their crops were taken.

328
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,820
 They had no way of making any money,

329
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,140
 but also they had no food

330
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,300
 'cause all the crops had been eaten by locusts.

331
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,500
 And so they asked the state for money,

332
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,940
 but the state couldn't give them enough

333
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,900
 because basically everyone was affected.

334
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,500
 And so they went to the federal government

335
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,980
 and there was a real discussion about that

336
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,900
 because basically they thought

337
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,700
 that their farmers might be turned soft

338
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,940
 if they gave them any help, any charity, right?

339
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,940
 And so they came up with these tests

340
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,580
 to make sure that you were worthy enough to get aid.

341
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,300
 As a farmer, you had to pledge an oath

342
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,020
 that you possessed nothing of value

343
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,940
 that could be sold for food or clothing

344
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,180
 in order to get any charity at all.

345
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,540
 - Sounds like, is this where Jacob Rees-Mogg

346
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,380
 started his career?

347
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,140
 (laughing)

348
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,300
 - But yeah, I mean, in the end though,

349
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,420
 eventually the federal government did step in

350
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,980
 and kind of gave aid packages

351
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,460
 and food packages to everyone.

352
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,300
 And that was the start of what is now the typical response

353
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,540
 to disasters in America.

354
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,460
 It was also a fire in Chicago a bit earlier

355
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,540
 that did a similar thing.

356
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,220
 But yeah, this was a big step for America

357
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,060
 as far as state aid was concerned.

358
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,780
 - So they sort of did them a favor?

359
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,940
 - Yeah. - A long run.

360
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,660
 - Exactly, good old locusts.

361
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,620
 - Good old locusts.

362
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,620
 Another coping mechanism they had actually

363
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,780
 before that came in was in Minnesota,

364
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,300
 they had huge vats of boiling water

365
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,580
 that they kept in the center

366
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,180
 of some of the big cities there.

367
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,940
 And there was a bounty of 50 cents a bushel on the locusts

368
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,500
 and apparently 130,000 grasshoppers equals one bushel.

369
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,860
 So you've got to get quite a lot to get you 50 cents.

370
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,460
 And then you bring them to the city

371
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,460
 and you chuck them in this vat of boiling water.

372
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,300
 - Right. - Isn't that cool?

373
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,140
 Like a cauldron?

374
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,500
 - Yeah, or just to kill them off?

375
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,140
 - Yeah, yeah. - Not to make a soup.

376
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,060
 - No. - No.

377
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,900
 Otherwise you just got a big locust lolly.

378
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,180
 When they've tried that in various places around the world,

379
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,780
 what often happens is people just start

380
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,100
 breeding the animal, don't they?

381
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,420
 - Yes, exactly.

382
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,580
 - Poor guys at Jimmy's cricket shop,

383
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,220
 which breed crickets, see this cloud on the horizon.

384
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,140
 Well, bang goes business.

385
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,580
 - Why is he not calling it Jiminy Crickets?

386
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,740
 - Absolutely right.

387
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,500
 - Yeah, well, it did almost bankrupt the state actually.

388
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,300
 They had to cancel it almost straight away.

389
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
 'Cause everyone's bringing in so many locusts.

390
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,860
 - The bushel. - The bushel offer.

391
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,260
 - Well, it's the 12 day thing, yeah.

392
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,180
 'Cause too many businesses. - Wow.

393
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,620
 - Yeah, can't afford it.

394
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,740
 - If you guys heard of a megacolon.

395
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,780
 - Oh, I thought that was you impersonating one.

396
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,700
 - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah.

397
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,980
 - It's not a punctuation that I accomplished earlier.

398
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,220
 - I think I invulnerably made,

399
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,140
 it's like I've been hypnotized to make that noise when I hear.

400
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,340
 That's being said.

401
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,180
 - Very obscure.

402
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,340
 Darren Brown never thought that would come up

403
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
 in your life again.

404
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,500
 - A megacolon is you would--

405
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,900
 - Okay, so this thing which I was talking about,

406
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,060
 it's what happens if you get an infection in your colon.

407
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,660
 And there was a mummy from 1,000 years ago

408
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,620
 which had this infection.

409
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,740
 And it was scanned with an electron microscope

410
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,180
 and what they found is that for the last few months

411
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,540
 of his life, he'd been fed solely on grasshoppers.

412
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,940
 So that's all he'd eaten.

413
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,460
 And what they'd done is we could tell from the microscope

414
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,100
 that they'd taken all the legs off the grasshoppers

415
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,300
 and just, and the heads and just got the bodies

416
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,180
 which is really high in protein

417
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,660
 and just kind of squished them together

418
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,260
 and given them to this guy.

419
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,140
 And this, as far as we can tell,

420
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,420
 is the earliest example of any kind of nursing

421
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,220
 or hospice care in the human race

422
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,260
 that we have direct evidence for.

423
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,100
 - Wow.

424
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,260
 - But he had to prove that he'd sold off

425
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,060
 anything he had of value before.

426
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,100
 That's awesome.

427
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,420
 - A megacolon.

428
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,260
 - Mm.

429
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,100
 - Oh, gosh.

430
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,260
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

431
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,900
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when Henriette Dongeville

432
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,100
 held a reception to celebrate being the first woman

433
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,940
 to climb Mont Blanc, one guest was Maria Paradis

434
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,620
 who had been to the top of the mountain 30 years earlier.

435
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,780
 Riddle me that.

436
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,380
 (laughing)

437
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,360
 - Okay.

438
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,660
 - She didn't climb it.

439
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,060
 She swam up 'cause it was underwater.

440
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,900
 - Oh, yeah, really?

441
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,300
 - Oh, yeah, she was dropped on.

442
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,820
 - She, from a plane had a top.

443
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,580
 - First of all, Anna gets half a point

444
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,260
 'cause she didn't climb up allegedly.

445
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,100
 - Okay.

446
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,940
 - But she wasn't dropped by a plane,

447
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,780
 so you get minus 10.

448
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,860
 - She was pretty hefty.

449
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,020
 - She was born there.

450
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,100
 She was top of the mountain 30 years earlier.

451
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,260
 That's where her mom gave birth to her.

452
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,980
 But then her mother would also have had to be there

453
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
 and so would have then been the first woman at the top.

454
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,540
 - Yeah, except she was dropped from a plane.

455
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,140
 (laughing)

456
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,740
 What year was this, James?

457
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,380
 - So this was 1838 when Dongeville went up,

458
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,820
 but Maria Parody went up in 1808.

459
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,660
 And what happened was she was dragged up, we think.

460
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,540
 - Kicking and screaming.

461
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,220
 - Well, not really doing anything

462
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,980
 'cause she kind of passed out halfway up the mountain.

463
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,820
 - Wow.

464
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,340
 - Is that a really fun drunk and night out prank kind of thing?

465
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,180
 - Yeah.

466
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,460
 - We'll have her wake up at the top of Mont Blanc.

467
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,180
 - You'd usually carry someone rather than drag.

468
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,380
 That's very caveman, isn't it?

469
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,980
 - Yeah, it was.

470
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,860
 So basically what happened was in 1808,

471
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,900
 a few people had already gone at Mont Blanc

472
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,220
 and they kind of talked this 18 year old servant

473
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,060
 from Chamonix called Maria Parody to go up Mont Blanc.

474
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,780
 And they said, if you do this, you'll become kind of famous

475
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,140
 and you'll be able to make a load of money

476
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,100
 and maybe it will help the hotel that you're working in.

477
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,540
 It'll give them some publicity.

478
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,860
 And so she's like, yeah, fine.

479
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,900
 I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

480
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,020
 We know about what happened

481
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,380
 because she spoke to Alexander Dumas in 1811

482
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,380
 and she told him that as she was almost to the top,

483
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,180
 she felt her legs go to hell, she said.

484
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,220
 And then the people who were going up with her

485
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,740
 decided to take her each under one arm

486
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,180
 and drag her to the top.

487
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,220
 She was pulled, dragged and carried

488
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,860
 to the top of the mountain, okay?

489
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,740
 And then 30 years later,

490
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,940
 this high society woman called Henriette Dongeville

491
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,140
 decided that she wanted to be the first person

492
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,460
 to really walk up Mont Blanc and she did that.

493
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,940
 And then she invited this Maria Parody

494
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,220
 to come to her party afterwards.

495
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,700
 And there's a little bit of kind of classism

496
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,780
 because first of all, Marie Parody was like,

497
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,220
 I can't believe that a real lady

498
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,980
 managed to get all the way up to a mountain.

499
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,540
 I'm a peasant woman, I know the country,

500
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,380
 I should be able to do it.

501
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,620
 I can't believe you would.

502
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,580
 But then Henriette was kind of dismissive of her

503
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,620
 and she's like, well, at least I went up

504
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,740
 by my own accord and stuff.

505
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,580
 - She almost didn't get up on her own accord, did she?

506
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,740
 She had exactly the same moment.

507
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,540
 Yeah, Henriette, she had the same

508
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,980
 where she suddenly buckled and she was on her back

509
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,540
 and there were questions from the rest of the camp,

510
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,700
 do we carry her up?

511
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,900
 And she managed fortunately to sort of get her wits about her

512
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,500
 and she said, no, I can do this, I can do this.

513
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,420
 But yeah, almost carried up as well.

514
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,260
 - The person who went up with her

515
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,300
 was called Joseph Coutet or Coutet.

516
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,100
 And when she kind of got near the top

517
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,980
 and she felt like falling asleep, she felt really woozy,

518
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,020
 Coutet said, look at her, asleep again.

519
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,820
 This is the last lady I take up Mont Blanc.

520
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,060
 (laughing)

521
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,700
 Although that does sound like a euphemism

522
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,020
 when I read it, doesn't it?

523
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,940
 - Oh, I took her up Mont Blanc.

524
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,020
 - Oh, what if this whole fact is a euphemism?

525
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,060
 It's a really raunchy night.

526
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,380
 - Oh my God.

527
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,700
 It wasn't quite raunchy because Henriette Dongeville,

528
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,340
 when she climbed up, she was wearing a boa.

529
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,180
 She was wearing a--

530
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,260
 - Constrictor or feather?

531
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,940
 - Feather or fur, possibly.

532
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,300
 But because obviously climbing gear for women

533
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,540
 did not exist at the time

534
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,220
 because only mad aristocratic ladies who were starting it,

535
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,540
 she was wearing a petticoat over men's trousers

536
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,620
 and then a bonnet with a veil and then a boa.

537
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,520
 The whole thing weighed about six kilos.

538
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,740
 So it was really heavy to be climbing out.

539
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,940
 - She basically had to wear the men's clothes

540
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,300
 because obviously that's the convenient way to get to the top

541
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,820
 but she still felt like she had to wear

542
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,220
 the women's stuff over the top.

543
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,380
 - Yeah, and there is this amazing picture of her

544
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 going over a crevasse with a ladder,

545
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,780
 which I actually didn't realize was the thing

546
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,940
 that you did in climbing and it looks absolutely terrifying

547
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,100
 when she's doing it because it's this massive drop

548
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,940
 in the middle of it.

549
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,140
 The ladder's just going between these two cliff edges

550
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,140
 and she's there with these extremely heavy skirts

551
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,220
 which she would have sort of scrambling over

552
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,180
 which she would have thought

553
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,860
 is gonna tip you over any minute.

554
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,700
 - Yeah, yeah.

555
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,260
 - And one of the reasons that she went up supposedly

556
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,500
 is that she was quite jealous of other well-known women

557
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,620
 that were kind of talking about going up Mont Blanc.

558
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,220
 So the writer, Georges Sond, who you all know, I'm sure,

559
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,860
 who's kind of mostly famous for wearing men's clothes

560
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,020
 but she was kind of a really famous writer

561
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,980
 who at the time was bigger than Victor Hugo

562
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,580
 and Bolzac and people like that.

563
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,060
 But she was kind of doing a lot of walking

564
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,380
 in the foothills of Mont Blanc

565
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,020
 and she was talking about how she might soon go up

566
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,260
 and Henriette Doncheville decided no,

567
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,740
 she was gonna do it first.

568
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,580
 - That's great.

569
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,420
 - It was not a prank.

570
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,300
 That's what I would do if I was trying to trick someone

571
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
 into going up Mont Blanc.

572
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,820
 - Oh, I might go tomorrow morning.

573
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,940
 I know the weather looks a bit dodgy, but yeah.

574
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,780
 - The clothing, I mean, it is mad

575
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,740
 that women were made to wear dresses

576
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,980
 and there were sort of, you know, there were a few women

577
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,860
 who were supposedly threatened with legal cases

578
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,660
 for the fact that they were wearing men's trousers.

579
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,780
 It was so controversial at the time

580
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,380
 and there were systems where they did try to cheat it.

581
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,140
 So I read about Aubrey Leblond who climbed Rotorne,

582
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,900
 which is a mountain about 2,000 meters high.

583
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,660
 And so there was a sort of compromise

584
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,700
 which is that you would leave where you were staying.

585
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,300
 Let's say you're staying in a hotel wearing the dress

586
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,220
 or the skirt that you had with the trousers on

587
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,660
 and then you would take it off

588
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,820
 while you were doing the actual mountain climbing

589
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,460
 and maybe no one would tell each other.

590
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,940
 But so she made it to the top

591
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,180
 and then on the way down,

592
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,260
 realized she'd left her skirt up there.

593
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,300
 So had to backtrack, go back up,

594
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,740
 re-ascend this giant mountain together.

595
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,900
 - So she had to carry her skirt to the top after drop.

596
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,220
 She didn't just leave it in a bush or something

597
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,060
 where she took it off.

598
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,060
 She carried it that way up with her.

599
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,340
 - You would leave it somewhere safe,

600
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,420
 like if you're going swimming or whatever.

601
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,300
 - Yeah, you don't swim holding your clothes

602
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
 up above the water if you do.

603
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,020
 - My sister once was climbing up a hill

604
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,180
 in the lake district and then went to the top.

605
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,260
 And when she got to the bottom,

606
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,500
 she realized she'd left her phone at the top.

607
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,460
 And that's how all the way back up,

608
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,380
 then it looked good to get her phone down.

609
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,740
 - Hey, have you all heard of Annie Smith Peck?

610
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,860
 Annie Smith Peck is a mountaineer.

611
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,740
 She climbed the Matterhorn in 1850.

612
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,100
 And it's just so interesting

613
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,420
 'cause she had to do it with total hatred

614
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,060
 from all the male companions who were taking on again

615
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,460
 'cause they just didn't want women doing it.

616
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,500
 She wore trousers, they hated that scandalous.

617
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,460
 So when she went up,

618
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,260
 one thing that happened was they would constantly,

619
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,420
 like the guys were just always having temper tantrums,

620
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,780
 there would be strikes.

621
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,700
 But at one point,

622
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,140
 'cause they kind of just wanted to get rid of her

623
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,460
 as part of the party,

624
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,140
 they said that, well, it said that

625
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,260
 when she was going across a crevasse field,

626
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,460
 when she went out of view, they cut the rope,

627
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,300
 the support rope.

628
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,820
 - No, I was looking after her.

629
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,500
 - Went back to camp and then she had to make her way back

630
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 and found them all sitting there.

631
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,340
 And they were like, "Oh, you're still here."

632
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,580
 - No, did that actually happen?

633
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,260
 - That's according to the accounts, yeah.

634
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,500
 And I think her accounts, that's what happened.

635
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,060
 I mean, she was really impressive.

636
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,780
 She once hung a votes for women sign

637
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,820
 off the peak of a mountain in Peru, just to make a point.

638
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,860
 - Who's gonna see that?

639
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,580
 - I mean, good point.

640
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,900
 - No one after her companions cut the ropes from the sign.

641
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,660
 - You wanna do it in the middle of Trafalgar Square

642
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,500
 or somewhere where people walk past all the day?

643
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,260
 - That's a really good point.

644
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,460
 Yep, can't fault you on that.

645
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,580
 And then another time,

646
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,700
 she climbed another mountain in Peru,

647
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,780
 the North Peak of Huascaran, okay?

648
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,420
 With some Swiss guides.

649
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,180
 And it was renamed in her honor.

650
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,980
 It was renamed Cumbre Ana Peck.

651
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,300
 But at that point, the record,

652
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,900
 I think the highest altitude,

653
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,340
 maybe for a woman or maybe for that peak,

654
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,260
 but it was held by another lady mountaineer

655
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,860
 called Fanny Workman.

656
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,300
 - Oh yeah, legend.

657
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,620
 - Well, another legend,

658
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,540
 but there was beef between them

659
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,020
 because Workman was so annoyed

660
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,900
 that Peck was claiming this record

661
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,980
 that she paid for engineers

662
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,540
 to go and recalculate the altitude of the mountain

663
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,860
 and establish that she had actually climbed 600 meters

664
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,620
 less than she had claimed to, than Peck had claimed.

665
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,420
 - 600 meters, that's a big recalculation.

666
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,660
 - It is a pretty big recalculation.

667
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,900
 So the Workman would still have the record.

668
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,380
 - That's pretty, yeah.

669
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,980
 - So just while you're saying Annie Smith Peck

670
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,460
 having something named after her,

671
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,060
 the Matterhorn, not long after she went up that,

672
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,260
 there was another explorer

673
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,660
 who had a bit of it named after her.

674
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,860
 So this was a mountaineer called Felicite Carol.

675
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,100
 And she unfortunately didn't make it to the summit

676
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,940
 when she was going.

677
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
 She was with her father

678
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,020
 and it's because she was wearing a skirt

679
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,380
 and the skirt ballooned in the wind

680
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,780
 and they thought this is too dangerous.

681
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,700
 You can't go any higher.

682
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,180
 Your skirt's gonna get in the way.

683
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,820
 So the spot where that happened

684
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,980
 is named the Matterhorn's Coal of Felicite.

685
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,980
 And yeah, after her,

686
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,740
 but she never got to make it to the top as a result.

687
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,780
 - 'Cause it could have blown her up there

688
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,620
 like Mary Brown in Office, that's true.

689
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,900
 - Did you bring an umbrella as well?

690
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,740
 - Have you heard of the book Mountaineering in Scotland?

691
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,580
 - No.

692
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,820
 - This is by an author called W.H. Murray,

693
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,100
 William Hutchison Murray.

694
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
 - Any relation?

695
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,220
 - No, not as far as I know.

696
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,580
 I wish because this is an amazing sounding book.

697
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,060
 It was written on sheets of toilet paper

698
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,860
 in prisoner of war camps in Germany during the war.

699
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,700
 So Murray had been sent by his mother,

700
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,780
 the complete works of Shakespeare in the post.

701
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,940
 And that was an earlier time of the war

702
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,980
 when the Red Cross parcels were still getting through

703
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,700
 and you could receive post and things like that.

704
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,180
 - It's a lot of postage that, isn't it?

705
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,660
 - It's a lot of postage, yeah.

706
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,940
 But he noticed that the paper was lovely and soft

707
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,140
 and it was actually a lot better than the stuff

708
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,300
 that they were being given as toilet paper.

709
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,660
 - So it sounds like he used the complete works

710
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,220
 of Shakespeare as loo roll and he saved his loo roll

711
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,300
 and wrote his own book about Mountaineering

712
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,660
 on the loo paper.

713
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,500
 - Oh my God.

714
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,300
 - I know, but the worst thing was then he was moved,

715
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,820
 he wrote for a year, presumably getting along quite well

716
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,860
 with his first draft.

717
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,460
 - What kind of, what was he writing with?

718
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,300
 Do we know?

719
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,340
 - No, I don't know actually.

720
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,300
 I don't know how he got a pencil.

721
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,140
 Or a pencil, yeah.

722
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,500
 - Was it 2B or not 2B?

723
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,980
 - Oh my God.

724
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,300
 Oh my God.

725
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,940
 - He walked straight into that one.

726
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,780
 - But then he was moved.

727
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,260
 He was moved to another camp called Offlag 8F

728
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,540
 and it was a much stricter prison camp.

729
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,460
 I mean, I don't know how lenient the previous one was,

730
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,100
 but basically the Gestapo searched everyone

731
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,540
 very carefully on the way in

732
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,020
 and his stash of toilet paper with a book on it

733
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,060
 was found and taken off him.

734
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,980
 And he had to write an entire second draft

735
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,020
 on more toilet paper.

736
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,860
 - No.

737
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,700
 - Yeah.

738
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,520
 - Oh my God.

739
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,360
 - I know.

740
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,500
 He claimed that the Gestapo had done him a favor

741
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,380
 because his first draft was a bit flabby,

742
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,420
 he needs a bit of time.

743
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,260
 - Yeah.

744
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,420
 - The most generous prisoner of war you've ever,

745
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,740
 I actually kind of liked the Gestapo.

746
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,980
 - Do you think that when he only had the toilet paper left

747
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,060
 that he kind of would hold it in so that he didn't use it?

748
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,100
 By the end, he would have had a mega-coal on it, I reckon.

749
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,940
 - Oh my God.

750
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,760
 - Oh my God.

751
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,840
 (laughs)

752
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,420
 (upbeat music)

753
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,540
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

754
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,220
 and that is Andy.

755
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,700
 - The fact is that the queen in her garden

756
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,060
 has a collection of fake rocks.

757
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,020
 - She has a lot of gardens.

758
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,860
 - Do we have a specific one?

759
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,680
 - She has a lot of gardens.

760
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,100
 She has gardens at Buckingham Palace, though, specifically.

761
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,140
 - How's this in the main garden?

762
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,500
 - Her main garden, I would say.

763
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,620
 There is a fake rock called Pullermite

764
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,860
 and she's got a lot of it.

765
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,820
 - Is it, sorry, is that specific rock called,

766
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,020
 did she name it Pullermite?

767
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,860
 Like, cause she's got Dave sitting next to it,

768
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
 it's a real rock.

769
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

770
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,140
 Yeah, this is a kind of rock invented by,

771
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,700
 it's so weird that you can invent a rock.

772
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
 There was a gardener called James Pullum

773
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,700
 and he invented this rock and it became a craze.

774
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,920
 Can you explain to us how you invent a rock?

775
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,940
 - Yeah, so he was a gardener

776
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,780
 and he noticed that there was a bit of a trend going on

777
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,760
 for when people have been traveling

778
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,660
 and they might bring plants back with them

779
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,460
 and this relates to the Victorian fern craze as well.

780
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,060
 This was a big craze for having ferns and collecting ferns.

781
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,580
 So the problem is that ferns don't like growing on lawns.

782
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,260
 You know, most gardens at the time

783
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,760
 were, you know, nice flat lawns of grass.

784
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,940
 And he was a gardener and also he knew a bit about engineering

785
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,140
 and he started offering people their own personal ravines

786
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,540
 to put their alpine plants and ferns in

787
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,100
 and he made this material from his own recipe

788
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,480
 and he took the recipe to his grave.

789
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,060
 And so he started offering people their own personal rocks

790
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,300
 that you could shape and build and mold

791
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,900
 into the exactly shapes that you wanted.

792
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,460
 And this became a craze, people,

793
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,100
 lots and lots of gardens had these fake rocks in.

794
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,260
 - It's environmentally friendly

795
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,380
 'cause you don't have to go and dig it out of a mountain

796
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
 or something.

797
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,060
 - Yeah, I guess so.

798
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,780
 It takes a lot less transportation, yeah.

799
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,220
 - And it was 'cause it does sound like a thing

800
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,780
 that would be shunted by the rich as something, you know,

801
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,380
 we just want natural stuff.

802
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,220
 But as you say, you know, the queen has it

803
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,700
 in Buckingham Palace, many famous family, the Rothschilds

804
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,620
 and so on, we're all really keen on it.

805
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,340
 So this was, yeah, it was a big deal.

806
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,180
 - It was a big deal.

807
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
 - It's everywhere.

808
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,860
 I no longer trust any rocks I see.

809
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,020
 What if this is puller made?

810
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,580
 - There's a big list online, isn't there?

811
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,660
 Of all the places you can find it, including Las Vegas.

812
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,500
 - Really?

813
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,380
 - Yeah, the Bellagio, there's like,

814
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,020
 I think there's a fountain that's made out of it.

815
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,860
 - Wow.

816
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,660
 - Well, the first time that we properly,

817
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,700
 I think outside of a show, saw each other

818
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,300
 during the sort of first lockdown having ended

819
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,900
 was we were at St. James's Park,

820
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,940
 weren't we, we were sitting there

821
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,540
 and the rocks by the Duck Island Cottage

822
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,140
 are also those kind of rocks.

823
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,980
 - Are they?

824
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,820
 - Right next to it.

825
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,060
 - Exactly, no rock is safe from puller.

826
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,340
 It's really insane.

827
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,820
 Even seaside towns like Folkestone, Ramsgate,

828
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,940
 they went nuts for it.

829
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,540
 They actually, I think quite badly damaged

830
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,260
 the council finances by spending all their money

831
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,780
 on pullermite because they wanted extra rocks

832
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,500
 for the sea to make it more rocky.

833
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,340
 - Oh, why?

834
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,180
 - This isn't rocky enough.

835
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,140
 - That just makes swimming in the sea

836
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,260
 more and more unpleasant.

837
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,300
 - I think it's not inside the sea.

838
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,460
 So for example, Folkestone got paths and tunnels

839
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,940
 to get people down from the cliffs.

840
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,500
 They wanted a gorgeous natural way to show people down.

841
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,620
 And so next time you see a rock, check.

842
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
 - Yeah, check.

843
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
 - So how can you check?

844
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,940
 Can you give it a knock in its hollow?

845
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,060
 It's not right, it's a rock.

846
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,580
 - Most of the rocks you see day to day will be rocks.

847
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,820
 - Oh, sure, absolutely.

848
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,660
 Yeah, but that's just law of averages.

849
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,580
 But do take a photo and send them to Andy.

850
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,380
 Anytime you see a rock, I'll go through that.

851
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,220
 I'll tell you, if your rock is--

852
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,860
 - They're a bit lighter, aren't they?

853
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,660
 They're lighter than normal rocks.

854
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,780
 And they'll just look faker.

855
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
 - They'll look a little bit like

856
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,380
 when you're queuing at a theme park, you know,

857
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,540
 the rockeries that you have.

858
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
 Not quite as plastic as that.

859
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,380
 - Not as plastic.

860
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,020
 - No, it's more realistic version of that.

861
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
 You're right.

862
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,220
 - They were incredibly successful, weren't they?

863
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,060
 James Pullham.

864
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,300
 He set up this company, which is James Pullham and Son.

865
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,660
 And it was a company that just went on and on.

866
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,420
 So when he retired, he handed it over to his son, James Pullham.

867
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,700
 And then when he retired,

868
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,100
 he handed it over to his son, James Pullham.

869
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,140
 And then when he retired,

870
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,060
 he handed it over to his son, James Pullham.

871
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,180
 - I think it was the second James Pullham

872
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,940
 who invented Pullhamite, wasn't it?

873
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
 As opposed to the first one.

874
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
 - I think you're right.

875
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,620
 - I think.

876
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,020
 - So, okay, minus one of the James Pullhams

877
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,860
 from that list there.

878
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,540
 - He was helped by two of the other

879
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,220
 James Pullhams later in life,

880
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,420
 but also helped by another brother

881
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,740
 called Michelangelo Pullham.

882
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,940
 What a name.

883
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,540
 - He's not living up to that name, it's a fake rock.

884
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,380
 - Everyone else in the family's called James

885
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,740
 and he's called Michelangelo.

886
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,340
 - But it's two names, isn't it?

887
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,860
 He's Michelangelo Pullham.

888
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,460
 They've divided Michelangelo in two.

889
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,900
 He's, you know, to the untrained eye,

890
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,460
 he's Michel Pullham, real name Angelo.

891
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,980
 - But he did all of the designing, didn't he, as well?

892
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,700
 Yeah, so if you ever needed a rock,

893
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,460
 but it needs to be in a certain shape,

894
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,060
 you gave it to Michelangelo Pullham

895
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,340
 and he did the shaping for it.

896
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,180
 - That's brilliant.

897
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,180
 - If you ever want a cherub to be emerging from your rock.

898
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,660
 - We should give a shout out to the book about this

899
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,700
 by Claude Hitching.

900
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,900
 - Ah, Claude Hitching.

901
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
 What a man.

902
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,980
 - He is the man on Pullamite.

903
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,100
 So he's written a book called The Pullam Legacy

904
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,540
 and I mean, he has spent, I think, decades

905
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,020
 tracking down bits of Pullamite

906
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,620
 because we still don't know where it all is.

907
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,700
 That's why I'm saying you've got to check.

908
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

909
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,180
 - It's all over the country, but there weren't, you know,

910
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,020
 accurate records kept everywhere this company worked.

911
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,380
 - I mean, it's not as urgent as like landmines and stuff, is it?

912
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,220
 Nothing's gonna happen if we don't find it.

913
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,340
 - When he started looking into it,

914
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,260
 he discovered that five of his direct ancestors

915
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,020
 all had worked for the Pullam company at some point.

916
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,860
 - Oh, wow, really?

917
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,180
 - And so he had a personal connection, yeah.

918
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,660
 And so basically he has, as Andy says,

919
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,420
 spent so long trying to track down

920
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,820
 where bits of missing Pullamite have gone.

921
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,340
 Sort of historically important bits in the Pullamite world.

922
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,180
 Where have they gone?

923
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,500
 Where Pullamite fans are like, "Oh, I can't believe we lost this."

924
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,540
 And some of them have turned up in places like,

925
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,460
 he found there was the Q Fountain,

926
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,260
 which was made for the International Exhibition in 1862.

927
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,100
 - Really?

928
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,940
 - It had disappeared.

929
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,780
 And where is it now?

930
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,140
 That's where James said earlier, Las Vegas.

931
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,380
 It found its way there.

932
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,540
 - Oh, that's the one at the Bellagio?

933
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,380
 - Exactly.

934
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,220
 - Wow.

935
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,500
 - That was a famous one in the UK.

936
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,140
 Pullamite fans distressed that they couldn't find it anymore.

937
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,980
 It disappeared.

938
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,140
 - That's incredible.

939
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,980
 - One amazing Pullam legacy.

940
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,300
 One of the biggest projects of James Pullam number three

941
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,940
 is the Landscape Garden at Friar Park.

942
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,900
 Which is, yeah, and you don't know about this.

943
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,220
 It's near Henley, and you'll see why Dunn knows about this.

944
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,020
 It's maintained by a woman called Olivia Harrison,

945
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,020
 who is George Harrison's widow.

946
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,420
 And they bought it, but it sounds incredible.

947
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,500
 So originally it was sort of designed by its owner,

948
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,020
 who's called Frank Crisp,

949
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,340
 this really eccentric guy who basically,

950
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,460
 why are you looking at me so?

951
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,300
 - It's a funny name.

952
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,140
 - It's just a nice name.

953
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,980
 - It's a funny name.

954
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,820
 - He's a Frank Crisp.

955
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,660
 - Crisp by name.

956
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,500
 - Crisp by nature.

957
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,860
 - He was a crispy eccentric man who designed his garden

958
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,340
 to look like an Alpine landscape, basically.

959
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,540
 So full of these fake rocks that he got done by Pullam.

960
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,940
 - And sorry, just with the Alpine thing,

961
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,620
 he actually had a model of the Matterhorn made.

962
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,740
 - Yes. - Out of rocks.

963
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,780
 - Not actual size.

964
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,020
 - Not actual size, different scale, yeah.

965
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,500
 But yeah, the Matterhorn is there.

966
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,340
 - That's incredible.

967
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
 - Yeah, amazing.

968
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,020
 So it takes up like lots of acres,

969
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,340
 that Matterhorn is pretty big,

970
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,220
 and that's not Pullam, that was someone else.

971
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,660
 But basically it got really overgrown.

972
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,540
 I think some nuns moved into it for a while,

973
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
 and it got dilapidated.

974
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,420
 And then George Harrison bought it

975
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,340
 and said, "I'm gonna take this over."

976
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,820
 And they cleared it, and they found all this stuff.

977
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,540
 Like the Matterhorn was just sort of sticking out

978
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,380
 of a bunch of rubble.

979
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,820
 They barely even knew it was there.

980
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,820
 And it sounds like he had this incredible moment, George.

981
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,100
 There's some sort of fake lakes built there.

982
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,180
 And at one point, he lowered himself on a rope

983
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,380
 into this cavern that was below this lake.

984
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,740
 So I guess this lake's on a, yeah,

985
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,060
 there's like a cave below this lake.

986
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
 - Sorry, the Cavern Club?

987
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,740
 Or yeah, what?

988
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,580
 - What?

989
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,820
 - The Cavern Club where the Beatles played in Liverpool.

990
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,660
 - I should know that.

991
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,500
 - Even I know that.

992
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,340
 - Yeah.

993
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,500
 (laughing)

994
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,900
 - Actual Beatles hater.

995
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,460
 (laughing)

996
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,140
 - Maybe that's what drew him to it.

997
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,220
 That's how he knew.

998
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,740
 'Cause he lowered himself into this cavern

999
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,420
 and underneath was this whole grotto.

1000
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,380
 So like pulomite grotto with these sparkling kind of courts

1001
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
 and stuff on the walls.

1002
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
 This like crazy magical landscape.

1003
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,220
 - Wow.

1004
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,460
 - And yeah, and now you can kind of row through it

1005
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,980
 and look at all these diamonds glistening

1006
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,220
 on the walls and stuff.

1007
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,780
 And yeah, it sounds incredible.

1008
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,340
 - They do keep discovering these places.

1009
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,940
 So even recently in 2000,

1010
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,900
 there was a couple who moved into a house,

1011
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,660
 Dewstow house it was called.

1012
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,700
 And they started to notice all these weird rocks

1013
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
 sticking out of the ground.

1014
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,540
 - Okay.

1015
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,780
 - And they then started digging.

1016
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:54,540
 And they discovered this huge labyrinthine underground

1017
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,700
 environment, this massive rock garden,

1018
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,420
 magical caverns, water flowing from one to another,

1019
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,940
 tunnel systems, fountains, fake stalactites.

1020
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,860
 The whole thing was this enormous mad pulomite project

1021
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,460
 which a man called Henry Oakley had commissioned.

1022
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,100
 He was a railway director and he spent years

1023
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,780
 having this incredible environment built for himself

1024
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,740
 which just got buried.

1025
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,180
 It got buried under the M4 as it were

1026
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,780
 because there were all these mounds of earth

1027
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,100
 that were excavated to build the M4

1028
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,540
 and they just got dumped on top of it.

1029
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,380
 - Okay.

1030
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,980
 - And the owners started to notice

1031
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,740
 and they started excavating it.

1032
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,100
 And then a few years after that it won the award.

1033
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,100
 Alan Titchmarsh did a series on Britain's best back gardens

1034
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,620
 and it came in at number eight.

1035
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,420
 - Oh, what a renaissance.

1036
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,260
 - Yeah.

1037
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,100
 - That little bit of land.

1038
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,540
 - Number eight.

1039
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,380
 - Yeah, number eight, yeah, not the top seven.

1040
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,180
 - Not top five, yeah.

1041
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,740
 - Imagine how exciting it is.

1042
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,100
 I honestly think that all our listeners

1043
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,340
 should go home now and dig up their entire gardens

1044
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,660
 in case there's a pulomite grotto under them.

1045
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
 - Yes, that's a good idea.

1046
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,700
 - You know, pulomite obviously wasn't the first fake rock

1047
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,180
 and the sort of the only successful fake rock

1048
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,740
 in the first of the 1700s was code stone.

1049
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,020
 So this was the 1770s, it was basically invented

1050
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,420
 and it was the fake rock to have.

1051
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,500
 And there were lots of startups,

1052
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,740
 lots of fake rock startups that tried to make their own.

1053
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,660
 Nothing came anywhere close to code stone.

1054
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,740
 And it was this business that was run for 50 years

1055
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,980
 by this amazing woman, Eleanor Code,

1056
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,420
 who just decided, I think it was 1771,

1057
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,540
 she met this guy who made some fake stone

1058
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,740
 and she bought up this massive factory

1059
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,780
 and said, okay, start making it.

1060
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,620
 And she fired him almost immediately

1061
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,900
 'cause decided he wasn't good enough

1062
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,580
 and brought on someone better at making fake rock.

1063
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,620
 And she was amazing business woman.

1064
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,460
 So 50 years, she made this stone,

1065
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,780
 which if you've seen the lion on the South Bank,

1066
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,900
 that big lion, that's made of code stone.

1067
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,460
 And that is hollow, so you can tell by knocking on it.

1068
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,260
 And if you look inside code stone,

1069
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,500
 which usually you can't 'cause it's like a statue,

1070
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,820
 if you drill inside, you can see the fingerprints

1071
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,220
 of the people who pushed it

1072
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,420
 into the plaster molds on the inside.

1073
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,980
 - Oh, that is cool.

1074
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,940
 - Code sounds awesome, Eleanor Code,

1075
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,140
 'cause she worked with her mom for decades,

1076
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,300
 also called Eleanor Code,

1077
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,020
 and there's a lot of confusion about which code was which.

1078
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,260
 - Yeah, and have you heard about her grandma?

1079
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,420
 - No, Eleanor Code.

1080
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,100
 - Her grandma, I actually don't know

1081
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,940
 first name of her grandma.

1082
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,500
 - Is there a thing about having,

1083
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,860
 being a person who makes rocks

1084
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,060
 and having no imagination for names?

1085
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,700
 (all laughing)

1086
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,740
 - And it's very much kept in the family, the rock thing.

1087
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,900
 Yeah, Eleanor Code's grandmother

1088
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,660
 obviously had the business mindset as well.

1089
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,980
 She ran a textile business in Tiviton,

1090
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,660
 and she sent spies to Norwich,

1091
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,980
 which was very good on textiles,

1092
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,740
 who would then steal all of their tricks,

1093
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,100
 then come back and be successful.

1094
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,140
 And she did things like she got carried around Tiviton

1095
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,060
 in a sedan chair all the time.

1096
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,900
 (all laughing)

1097
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,420
 She was a good character.

1098
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,940
 - Wow. - She sounds awesome.

1099
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,820
 - Yeah. - Have you guys heard

1100
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,140
 of gunite? - No, gunite.

1101
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,820
 - It's another fake rock.

1102
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,580
 Can you guess how you make gunite?

1103
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,460
 - Fire it from a gun?

1104
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,300
 - Correct.

1105
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,900
 - Oh, no. - Yes.

1106
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,980
 - You get a gun, it's not like a small gun,

1107
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,700
 it's like a big sort of hosepipe gun,

1108
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,380
 and you fire out this dry sort of concretey material,

1109
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,060
 and then you have a little bit of water

1110
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,180
 at the nozzle of the gun,

1111
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,660
 which kind of goes into the concrete as it comes out,

1112
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,980
 and then you can fire it wherever you want to put a rock.

1113
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,500
 - So cool. - It's almost like

1114
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,460
 a 3D printer for rocks.

1115
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,900
 - And it's used on bridges, isn't it?

1116
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,740
 If you ever see a bridge, really, or a tunnel,

1117
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,180
 then it's probably gunite or shotcrete.

1118
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,980
 It also gets called the dry and wet versions.

1119
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,940
 - Shotcrete gets used in taxidermy, I think.

1120
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,060
 - Yeah, does it? - Yeah.

1121
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,100
 - It's because it's quite easy to shape.

1122
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,140
 - Yeah, exactly, and so is it, God, I've forgotten,

1123
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,780
 is it you're shaping and then you're putting the scale

1124
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,620
 on top of it?

1125
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,540
 - Well, what you can do with concrete

1126
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,700
 is you can make the shape of something out of iron,

1127
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,260
 and you can fire the concrete onto it,

1128
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,340
 and it'll, yeah, like a mold, and it'll go on that.

1129
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,180
 - Yeah. - That kind of thing.

1130
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,020
 - You don't have to make a mold for it,

1131
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
 you can't fire it, 'cause what's it landing on?

1132
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,300
 You can't just fire it into mid-air,

1133
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,380
 and it's like a spark plug. - Of course, of course, of course.

1134
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,140
 - That makes sense, that's awesome.

1135
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,980
 - Ugly rocks are sort of venerated in China.

1136
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,660
 I didn't really know about this thing, scholars rocks,

1137
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,220
 but you'd recognize them, and since the eighth century,

1138
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,260
 Confucians have, Confucian academics have basically said,

1139
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,780
 ugly, jagged rocks are great for contemplation,

1140
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,980
 and the idea is that they represent Confucianism,

1141
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,540
 they're uncompromising.

1142
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,060
 So from the eighth century, there's been a trend

1143
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,020
 for getting the ugliest rock you can find,

1144
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,540
 or the most jagged, or pitted, or misshapen,

1145
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,900
 putting it in your garden, and watching it.

1146
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,420
 (both laughing)

1147
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,100
 - That's really awesome. - To see what happens.

1148
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,740
 - Wow, I know Anna, I think I know this about you,

1149
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
 'cause I know it about me,

1150
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,060
 you used to collect rocks when you were a kid, right?

1151
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,580
 - Yeah, of that I found in my gravel, yeah.

1152
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,860
 - Yeah, yeah, did you like look for the ugly ones,

1153
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,420
 or for the attractive ones?

1154
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,100
 - I was very shallow, I wasn't a philosopher,

1155
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,820
 I just went for the fit ones, yeah.

1156
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,300
 Something pink and sparkly.

1157
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
 - Wow, are there competitions?

1158
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,420
 - There actually should be, what they are.

1159
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,140
 - Ugly rock of the year.

1160
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,300
 - There must be, 'cause they're judged

1161
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,740
 on certain qualities, so it must be,

1162
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,100
 for the sake of something, there are four categories,

1163
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,660
 and these were determined by a guy called Mifu

1164
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,180
 in the 12th century, who used to,

1165
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,540
 - He was in charge of the Mifu movement.

1166
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,300
 (both laughing)

1167
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,620
 - Yeah, he was a great campaigner for his day,

1168
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,620
 and he used to bow to rocks, so when he met royalty,

1169
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,220
 he'd walk in and bow to the rock instead of the emperor,

1170
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,060
 and people got annoyed.

1171
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
 - Instead of the emperor?

1172
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,900
 - Yeah.

1173
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,220
 - Probably absolutely had to his own life.

1174
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,900
 - Maybe he was just short-sighted, we don't know.

1175
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,500
 - I met the queen a couple of years ago,

1176
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,740
 but I only really talked to the Pelomite rocks

1177
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,060
 in the fucking palace.

1178
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,180
 (both laughing)

1179
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,820
 - Anyway, they're judged, just to finish that,

1180
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,500
 they are judged on their thinness, their openness,

1181
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,100
 their holes, and their wrinkles.

1182
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,420
 You want to max out on all of that?

1183
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,260
 - Can't we all?

1184
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,100
 - Yes.

1185
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,680
 (upbeat music)

1186
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,660
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1187
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,700
 and that is my fact.

1188
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
 My fact this week is that following a theory

1189
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,060
 that they wouldn't burn up on re-entry,

1190
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,500
 Japanese scientists once planned to fly paper airplanes

1191
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,340
 from the International Space Station back onto Earth.

1192
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,580
 - Okay. - Very cool.

1193
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,780
 - Now, why does that mean therefore you'd do it?

1194
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,660
 'Cause I understand that maybe you wouldn't burn up

1195
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,220
 because you're not going that fast, but even so,

1196
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,580
 is it instead of something?

1197
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,740
 - Well, I guess we are always trying to work out

1198
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,660
 different ways of doing space travel,

1199
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,400
 constantly seeing who knows how important space paper.

1200
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,180
 - Lightweight vehicles for re-entry

1201
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,140
 would be immensely useful to have.

1202
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
 So if you can start--

1203
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,820
 - You're not gonna sit on that paper aeroplane, are you?

1204
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,660
 - Well, no, but you might sit inside a big paper aeroplane,

1205
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,980
 which are all treated card or something,

1206
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,300
 or there are chemical compounds--

1207
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,220
 - Oh, so is that what I was testing?

1208
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,260
 - They were, I mean, that's what they said

1209
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,780
 the justification was, was lighter vehicles for re-entry.

1210
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,820
 - You don't need a reason for science, Hannah.

1211
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,700
 You can do science for science's sake.

1212
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,660
 - Good point. - All right.

1213
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,100
 - It discovers its own discoveries.

1214
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,860
 Is that what that's what scientists say, isn't it?

1215
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,860
 - Yeah, that's the line, that's the official line in Latin.

1216
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,580
 - So how come they never did these happen?

1217
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,180
 - Well, it's a really hard thing to do.

1218
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,260
 It was a really nice idea.

1219
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,380
 So this was in 2008 and there were researchers

1220
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,500
 at the University of Tokyo who teamed up

1221
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,220
 with Japan's Origami Airplane Association.

1222
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,100
 So this was gonna be origami paper planes

1223
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,020
 that were put together and put through.

1224
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,500
 And so they did all these tests in wind tunnels

1225
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,780
 at the University and they managed to show

1226
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,060
 that this plane could actually hold its own

1227
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,580
 at huge speeds of wind passing through it.

1228
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,660
 So it all looked like it could possibly work.

1229
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,180
 The problem is, is that if they did try it

1230
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,220
 and it came back into the earth,

1231
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,620
 it's so tiny without any GPS device on it,

1232
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,580
 we would just know nothing.

1233
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,980
 It would be impossible to tell in 2008.

1234
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,380
 - I think another problem is,

1235
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,620
 I would say at least two thirds of the paper aeroplanes

1236
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,340
 that I ever make either kind of go straight up

1237
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,340
 and stall and land where I threw them

1238
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,380
 or go straight down and crash into the ground.

1239
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,340
 So you need to train your astronauts

1240
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,700
 to be proper paper aeroplane makers, don't you?

1241
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,540
 - That's true.

1242
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
 - And they've already got a lot on their plates.

1243
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,980
 - They've got a lot of training today.

1244
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,460
 - Well, origami is useful in space in other ways, isn't it?

1245
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,620
 So I guess I can see where they're coming from.

1246
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,940
 I think it's been used by Japan on solar panels.

1247
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,140
 And in fact, by NASA more recently,

1248
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,420
 they certainly had a plan to, and they use mirror folds.

1249
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,940
 And I think, is that how you pronounce it?

1250
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,260
 We've done it on QI.

1251
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,980
 - Mirror folds are basically how you fold maps, for instance,

1252
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,980
 you know, when they fold up really small and flat

1253
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,940
 and then you can spring them out with

1254
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,780
 so that they're really big.

1255
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,700
 - It's almost like an accordion.

1256
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,740
 Like you, they're in a really small little square

1257
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,920
 and then you pull them out and then you push them back in

1258
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,140
 and pull them out and push them back in.

1259
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,900
 And then like a normal map,

1260
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,780
 you're always trying to find the folds and stuff.

1261
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,740
 But these just kind of go back where they should do.

1262
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,580
 - That's really cool.

1263
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,820
 - 'Cause it'd be so annoying if an accordion

1264
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,940
 was like a normal map where every time you pushed it in,

1265
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,900
 you had to fold it and it's up the right way.

1266
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,020
 - What do you think is the world record

1267
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,460
 for folding 1,000 origami cranes?

1268
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,780
 - 1,000.

1269
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,700
 (laughing)

1270
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,660
 - Damn it.

1271
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,620
 What time, how long do you think it took the person?

1272
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,860
 So do you remember I did this a few years ago?

1273
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,700
 - Yes.

1274
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,020
 - It took me about two months.

1275
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,860
 - Okay.

1276
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,260
 - Yeah, you did it in the office as well

1277
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,660
 'cause you're hiding it from your,

1278
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,580
 it was a present for your wife.

1279
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,420
 And yeah, so.

1280
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,980
 - I wasn't hiding it from my wife.

1281
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,220
 - Yeah, it was a present for her.

1282
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,060
 So you were building it.

1283
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,300
 - I was really embarrassed and I didn't want to tell her.

1284
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,260
 No, it was a gift.

1285
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,540
 But yeah, how long do you reckon it takes to do 1,000?

1286
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,940
 - Eight hours.

1287
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,980
 - Eight hours, that's a bit less than one a minute.

1288
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,220
 - But this is gonna be the record, right?

1289
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,380
 So this is someone who's, I'm gonna say,

1290
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,100
 I'm gonna go as low as like two hours.

1291
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,940
 - What?

1292
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,780
 - Just for this?

1293
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,620
 - 1,000.

1294
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,460
 - Yeah, just because like.

1295
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,500
 - But how many seconds are there in an hour?

1296
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,780
 - It's not gonna take a second to do a crane.

1297
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,940
 Surely a minute to do a crane, a bit less maybe.

1298
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,700
 - I think it'll take a couple of minutes.

1299
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,020
 I don't know, I think a couple of days.

1300
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,500
 - Couple of days, thank you, Andy, because these two.

1301
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,340
 (laughing)

1302
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,180
 - Sorry, Jay.

1303
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,740
 - Poor Evelyn Chia of Colchester, England.

1304
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,940
 (laughing)

1305
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,820
 - Henceforth known as the slacker.

1306
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,220
 What did she do then?

1307
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,420
 - She is a teenager from Colchester

1308
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,420
 and she did it in nine hours and 31 minutes.

1309
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,540
 - Well, that's much more impressive

1310
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,620
 than I would have thought, Dan and Anna.

1311
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,500
 (laughing)

1312
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,340
 - I think.

1313
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,180
 - Two hours.

1314
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,140
 - How good do they have to be?

1315
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,940
 I mean, can I just scrunch up lots of bits of paper

1316
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,780
 and claim their cranes?

1317
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,580
 - I'll be honest, when I did it towards the end of the 1,000,

1318
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,660
 they got less and less looking like cranes.

1319
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,420
 - Did you hide those cranes at the back of the crowd?

1320
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,260
 - I really do, yeah.

1321
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,900
 But she did it as a fundraiser for NHS charities.

1322
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,740
 - Nice.

1323
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,580
 - And in fact, I gave her some money for it

1324
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,500
 'cause I was so impressed

1325
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
 'cause it did take me literally two months to do it.

1326
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,660
 - That's very cool.

1327
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,500
 - But yeah.

1328
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,340
 - Oh, that's lovely.

1329
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,620
 - I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica article

1330
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,980
 on origami and the origins of it.

1331
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,620
 And it's the first unequivocal document

1332
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,020
 that talks about origami is a poem by Ihara Saikaku,

1333
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,580
 which was written in 1680, which talks about these butterflies

1334
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,980
 made from paper.

1335
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,180
 But this guy, Ihara Saikaku,

1336
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,180
 he once composed 23,500 verses in a single day.

1337
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,620
 - Jesus.

1338
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,460
 - Wow.

1339
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,300
 - Yeah.

1340
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,140
 - Does it have a chorus?

1341
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,700
 Is it a cheek?

1342
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,820
 Half of them are the same.

1343
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,300
 - I think they're on different subjects.

1344
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,180
 - Are there even that many subjects?

1345
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,580
 - I already saw.

1346
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,020
 And apparently in the 20th century,

1347
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,540
 origami was helped by the fact that it was used a lot

1348
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,100
 in Rudolf Steiner's schools,

1349
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,740
 which Dan, you went to one of those.

1350
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,300
 - I was a Steiner, yeah, I'm a Steiner kid.

1351
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,100
 - Did you learn how to make origami?

1352
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,060
 - Yeah, we did, but we did do Japanese classes.

1353
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,580
 So I don't know if it was integrated.

1354
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,660
 We didn't have separate origami.

1355
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,060
 - Okay, 'cause apparently, according to the article,

1356
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,020
 they emphasize kind of hands-on learning for kids

1357
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,420
 as opposed to rote learning.

1358
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,540
 And so, yeah, origami was very popular,

1359
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,220
 especially in the German Steiner schools.

1360
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,940
 - Okay, yeah, I mean, we definitely did origami at school.

1361
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,580
 - That's very interesting, 'cause I think Germany

1362
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,260
 kind of brought advanced origami to Japan

1363
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,900
 via kindergarten. - Really?

1364
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,260
 - The kindergarten movement obviously started in Germany.

1365
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,260
 It's a German word.

1366
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,300
 And this is the 1830s, and this guy, Friedrich Frohbill,

1367
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,940
 decided that origami would be a great way

1368
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,180
 of educating children in both maths and art,

1369
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,260
 'cause it's very mathematical and logical,

1370
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,780
 and like very difficult spatial reasoning,

1371
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,420
 but also quite artistic.

1372
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,460
 And he exported this around the world

1373
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,580
 with this kindergarten movement,

1374
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,300
 and it was really taken up in Japan,

1375
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,860
 where they were already doing quite a lot

1376
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,420
 of slightly simpler origami,

1377
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,340
 but then they started making pigs and houses

1378
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,020
 and sofas and stuff like that.

1379
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,940
 - Cool, so Germany exported origami to Japan,

1380
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,900
 is what you're saying?

1381
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,140
 - I'm saying Japan had a kind of origami,

1382
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,700
 and then Germany exported a more advanced kind.

1383
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,860
 - We think probably invented in China origami

1384
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,900
 because paper was invented in China.

1385
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,740
 So, yeah, probably the first people to fold paper

1386
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,140
 were the first people to invent it.

1387
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,300
 But then went to Japan and became big bear,

1388
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,980
 then came over, picked up by Germany,

1389
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,300
 improved, sent back over to Japan again.

1390
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,900
 - And if there are, for German, Japanese, Chinese listeners,

1391
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,580
 we are not denigrating any origami

1392
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,060
 or treatments of any countries, okay?

1393
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,900
 Please don't write in.

1394
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,460
 - And if you do, please don't fold it

1395
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,520
 in such a way that we can't read the letters.

1396
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,700
 (laughing)

1397
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,300
 - The person who popularized origami in the West

1398
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,500
 is a guy called Gershon Legman, and he--

1399
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,340
 (laughing)

1400
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,940
 - Was he a breast man or a Legman?

1401
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,780
 (laughing)

1402
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,460
 - Well, it's funny you should ask.

1403
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,220
 He did a bunch of other things.

1404
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,580
 So, the way he popularized it was,

1405
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,500
 he found this origami prodigy called Akira Yoshizawa,

1406
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,180
 and he put on exhibitions of his work and stuff,

1407
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,620
 and it all spread.

1408
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,140
 But the other things he tried,

1409
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,860
 he tried lots of stuff, Gershon Legman.

1410
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,540
 He collected vulgar limericks,

1411
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,300
 so he had a massive collection of scene limericks.

1412
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,060
 - He wrote the book, "The Rationale of a Dirty Joe."

1413
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,900
 - Yes.

1414
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,140
 - It's a seminal set of books.

1415
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,300
 - And it's by someone called Legman.

1416
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,220
 - Well, it's also called by, what's his first name?

1417
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,060
 - Gershon.

1418
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,780
 But he uses G.

1419
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,260
 So, G spot Legman.

1420
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,100
 - Wow.

1421
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,660
 - Sorry, G dot.

1422
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,580
 - Yeah, so G spot Legman was the name for his--

1423
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,500
 - That's a stretch, so don't, you don't call it a spot.

1424
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,460
 You don't say, can you put a spot

1425
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,100
 at the end of that sentence, please?

1426
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,220
 - Yeah, that was his little gag.

1427
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,140
 - Wow.

1428
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:47,980
 - Cool.

1429
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,260
 - This is so weird seeing the interests

1430
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,220
 of Dan intersect with what we're talking about.

1431
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,060
 (laughing)

1432
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,740
 Not dirty jokes, that doesn't mean jokes in general.

1433
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,100
 - I just know, yeah, these books are like cult classics.

1434
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,940
 - Yeah.

1435
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,780
 - He said, "No ideas."

1436
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,580
 - Well, Andy wrote, yeah, 'cause he wrote stuff

1437
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,980
 about how to give good oral sex, I think,

1438
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,620
 like the best oral sex in gratification,

1439
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,460
 maybe that's where you know from.

1440
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,300
 - I'm not saying I have that copy,

1441
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,260
 but yeah, I've definitely got the joke books.

1442
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,180
 - He invented the vibrating dildo.

1443
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,100
 - Got that, got that.

1444
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,300
 (laughing)

1445
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,540
 - Okay, well, you can have a spin off Gershon Legman podcast,

1446
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,460
 but yeah, cool guy.

1447
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,300
 - Wow.

1448
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
 The prodigy you just mentioned, Akira Yoshioaza,

1449
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,980
 he does sound very interesting.

1450
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,540
 He pioneered wet folding.

1451
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,700
 Before that, I'm not sure wet folding was a technique.

1452
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,340
 - And can you explain what wet folding is?

1453
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,660
 - Absolutely, wet folding is the main, I'd say,

1454
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,140
 division in the origami world.

1455
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,060
 Wet folders dampen the paper

1456
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,740
 so they can get the curves just right.

1457
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,540
 Dry folders, I don't need to explain.

1458
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,740
 Don't do the wetting.

1459
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,300
 And yeah, so Yoshioaza was the guy who--

1460
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,140
 - Really?

1461
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,780
 - He worked as an origami man from 1937 onwards,

1462
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,940
 I think when he was very young.

1463
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,780
 - Right.

1464
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,460
 - Yeah, and he eliminated cutting from the procedure.

1465
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,060
 So you used to cut the paper, I think,

1466
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,900
 before you were folding it.

1467
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,740
 - Okay.

1468
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,060
 - And that's another, again,

1469
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,220
 you know, Fosbury Flop moment in the development of origami

1470
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,500
 where, you know, you're not cutting things

1471
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,820
 'cause that's like making a snowflake

1472
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,420
 when you're a kid, you know, you fold it up

1473
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,460
 and you can't-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1474
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,260
 - That feels like the anti-Fosbury Flop moment.

1475
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,780
 That's like you've banned the Fosbury Flop

1476
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,540
 and you're back stuck with a scissor kick again.

1477
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,380
 (laughing)

1478
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,700
 I run it because you're not allowed to scissor it.

1479
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,020
 - It's a reverse Fosbury.

1480
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,860
 (laughing)

1481
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,540
 - It's a reverse Fosbury.

1482
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,780
 - Another very cool origami figure

1483
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,420
 was this guy called Robert Lang.

1484
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,260
 Did you guys read by him?

1485
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,860
 - How do you say he's an origami figure?

1486
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,220
 Is that a human in the origami world

1487
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,820
 or was he made of paper?

1488
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,700
 - He's not made of paper, he is just into paper.

1489
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,540
 - Got it.

1490
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,580
 - And a bit like this guy, Andy, he was a physicist.

1491
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,660
 He worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab

1492
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,740
 and then he decided he preferred folding paper

1493
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,380
 and he was this mass prodigy

1494
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,700
 who was doing very well in physics

1495
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,580
 and it was 2001, he finally decided to give it all up

1496
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,060
 'cause it was taking up so much of his time

1497
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,380
 folding paper things.

1498
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,620
 And he's been very useful with his origami.

1499
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,540
 So for instance, airbags made based

1500
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,580
 on origami principles now.

1501
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,300
 And that's because they went to Robert Lang

1502
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,080
 and they said, look, we really like the way

1503
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,700
 that you can fold something really small

1504
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,580
 and then it can expand really big.

1505
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,260
 Like he was able to do that.

1506
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,660
 - On that note, in 2013, there was a company

1507
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,940
 which announced it was inventing an origami condom

1508
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,300
 for Bill Gates.

1509
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,620
 - For Bill Gates?

1510
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,060
 (laughing)

1511
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,940
 - As he got such an unusually shaped penis,

1512
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,820
 he has to have a special condom made.

1513
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,780
 - Bill and Bill Gates Foundation is what I mean.

1514
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,020
 I was using it on his shorthand and I'm sorry.

1515
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,700
 I'm sorry, please don't sue.

1516
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,380
 (laughing)

1517
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,740
 There was a designer called Danny Resnick

1518
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,460
 and he had worked out an origami condom

1519
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,700
 which apparently was much more comfortable to put on,

1520
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,140
 fit on more easily and it opened up like an accordion.

1521
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,580
 - I can play the accordion a little bit.

1522
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,020
 And when you first open it up, it makes quite a weird noise.

1523
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,340
 - I don't know if it wheezed as it was opened up.

1524
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,620
 Anyway, it never happened because Resnick himself

1525
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,220
 was accused of fraud the next year

1526
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,180
 and had to pay back the public fancy being granted.

1527
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,660
 So the world is still waiting for the origami condom.

1528
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,300
 - It would be great if it did play a tune as he wanted it.

1529
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,660
 - You can't get that little keyboard

1530
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,460
 onto something that size, I don't think.

1531
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,340
 - It's good it's gonna sound,

1532
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,540
 every time you have sex, it's gonna sound like a sea shanty.

1533
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,340
 - Yeah, exactly.

1534
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,260
 - Soon will the weather bag come.

1535
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,100
 (laughing)

1536
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,660
 - Well, I hope it is soon.

1537
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,240
 (upbeat music)

1538
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,300
 Okay, that's it.

1539
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,300
 That is all of our facts.

1540
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,620
