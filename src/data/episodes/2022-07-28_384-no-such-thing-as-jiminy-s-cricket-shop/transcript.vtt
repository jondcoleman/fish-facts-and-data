00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.020
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.460
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.300
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 My name is Dan Schreiber

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.380
 and I am sitting at a very comfortable distance

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.940
 from Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.180
 and James Harkin.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.140
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.020
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.780
 - My fact this week is that in 1877,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.740
 all able-bodied men in Nebraska were required by law

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.940
 to spend up to 12 days killing grasshoppers.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.420
 - Wow, wow.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.540
 Wait a minute, I'm always looking for the loophole

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.820
 up to 12 days.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.100
 (laughing)

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.300
 It was, well, they had to spend two days, definitely.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.060
 So you can't get out of a weekend.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.420
 And then if there was further work needed,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.180
 then the government state government could call on you

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.020
 to spend an extra 10 days.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.060
 - So it was up to 12 days

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.980
 because some people enjoyed it so much,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.260
 it started to look psychopathic.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.980
 And it's like, all right, we need to cut you off here.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.820
 - Oh yeah.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.660
 (laughing)

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.500
 - Or develop something else.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.460
 - You can't devote 365 to it.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.740
 - How many grasshoppers can there be that everyone,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 I mean, I know Nebraska even though

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 is quite sparsely populated,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.580
 but that's a lot of grasshoppers to kill, isn't it?

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.980
 - Definitely more than one grasshopper per person.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.300
 So it was a lot.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.580
 This was the Rocky Mountain Locust,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.140
 which is a grasshopper.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.780
 And it was this massive scourge in the 1870s and the 1860s.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.500
 It basically ruined the kind of Great Plains area,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.860
 so Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, those kind of areas.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.060
 And it destroyed crops, it ruined people's livelihoods.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.060
 It drove the population out and they had to do something.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 So the states passed various laws saying,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.180
 get out and do your duty, murder grasshoppers.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.020
 - Wow.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 - It's insane, there's a sighting in 1875,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.060
 so two years before this law was put into place,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.540
 where it was estimated that there was 198,000 square miles

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300
 of locusts swarming.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.660
 So that's larger than the size of California.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.540
 - In that area of 198,000 square miles,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.700
 which I reckon is just a little bit smaller

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.820
 than England and Scotland combined,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.300
 there were 12.5 trillion insects.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.740
 Okay, and to put that into perspective,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.860
 if you imagine taking a normal keyboard

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.540
 on your computer and covering all of England

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.460
 and Scotland in keyboards, so there's no gaps,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.540
 each grasshopper would have one keyboard to sit on

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.700
 over the whole of England and Scotland.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.060
 - Well, why?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.460
 Why are you putting grasshoppers on keyboards?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.380
 - Grasshoppers give an infinite keyboard to eventually.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.020
 - They actually write out the works of Milton, don't they?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.460
 - They account for extraordinary, aren't they?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.780
 I mean, even every able-bodied man in Nebraska

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.620
 wouldn't have been able to do a huge amount about this.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.820
 Because they ate the wool off sheep

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.380
 when they were passing by, they're just so discreet.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.620
 They ate clothing off people's backs.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.460
 - I don't believe that.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.980
 I mean, it's probably true, but like, calm on.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.500
 - An unsexy striptease.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 - There was a woman who claimed it, wasn't there?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.300
 Who said that she was wearing a white

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.020
 and green stripey dress and she was descended on

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.780
 by these grasshoppers and they ate all the green stripes,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.060
 at which point I guess all the white stripes fall off.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 But, you know.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.900
 - That's where the white stripes

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.900
 got the name from, actually.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.780
 The band, they were walking past this woman

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.900
 and were like, what's the rest of her dress?

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.300
 There were stories about how trains came to a halt

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.860
 'cause they were skidding on locusts.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.700
 - Oh yeah.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.940
 - There were just so many on the ground

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.820
 that they were just, yeah, wiping out.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.660
 - Laura Ingalls Wilder, who wrote

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300
 "The Little House" on the prairie,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.220
 she was there when this happened.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.900
 And one of her stories on the banks of Plum Creek,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.740
 they talk about this happening to her family.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.500
 And she said that her father had to walk 300 miles

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.140
 to find work on a farm that didn't

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.660
 have the grasshoppers on it.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.500
 - Jesus.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.460
 - If you can imagine that.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.780
 And that she would walk around

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.100
 and they would squish under her birth feet

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.420
 and she would hear the sound of millions of jaws

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.700
 biting and chewing.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700
 - Oh. - Nice.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.340
 - Wow. - Amazing.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.380
 - I mean, if you're faced with that,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.260
 actually what good can it do to spend 12 days?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.820
 12 days feels a bit undirect.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.380
 - Yeah, you gotta devote the whole year to it.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.820
 - Wait, how many did you say the word, James?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.420
 12 trillion. - 12.5 trillion.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.580
 - Okay, so then again, if every,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.140
 hang on, 12 trillion.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.980
 - No, if the whole of Nebraska gets a trillion a day.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.820
 - Yes.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.300
 Then it just needs one guy.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300
 (laughing)

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.900
 - If you have a million people in Nebraska say,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.740
 they have to get a million each per day.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.020
 - They are small though.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.780
 - It's a shame that we didn't just,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.140
 Nebraska didn't just allow this to just continue.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.380
 And there's just one spot on earth where humans are living

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.340
 just completely covered, naked, covered in locusts.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.180
 - What?

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.020
 - With no food to eat.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.060
 - That is a shame.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.940
 - We send care packages just as an experiment.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.380
 You know how sometimes big experiments happen?

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.340
 - What are we experimenting on?

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.100
 - Is there a symbiotic life with locusts

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.060
 that we're missing out on

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.580
 that they were trying to introduce us to?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.100
 - They actually only eat your clothes off you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.540
 so they can become your clothes.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.100
 (laughing)

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.420
 - Well, some people did suggest that at the time

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.580
 a symbiotic relationship with them kind of.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.980
 So Missouri state entomologist who's called Charles Riley,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.420
 he just said that why don't we just eat them?

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.900
 They could be turned into soup

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.140
 or prepared John the Baptist style.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.140
 And John the Baptist style is where you fry

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.500
 grasshoppers with honey.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.140
 Because in Matthew first three chapter four in the Bible,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.500
 it says his meat was locusts and wild honey.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.340
 John the Baptist when he goes into the desert.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.580
 - Not sure it's gonna take off

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.500
 as the next hit restaurant concept, is it?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.340
 - No.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.620
 - Wild honey, please.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.460
 - Yeah.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.300
 - Oh no.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.020
 The portions are gonna be massive.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.500
 - Have you guys eaten locusts?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.580
 - I haven't, but I do know that in Australia,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.060
 they rebranded them as sky prawns,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.780
 you know, to make them a bit more appealing.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.260
 - Very high in protein.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.380
 Like the North American communities

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.300
 who lived in that area around the time.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.460
 So for instance, the Shoshone people, they would eat them.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.260
 So they would turn them into flour

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.140
 and they would make bread out of grasshoppers and stuff.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.540
 So that's how they dealt with it

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.660
 before it happened to the Westerners who went over.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.620
 Although I don't think they ever had it quite as bad

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.460
 that we know.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.580
 - No, I mean, eating is not a solution to the 12 trillion,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.420
 is it?

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.860
 You can't just wander down your field with your mouth open.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.980
 Well, problem solved.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.580
 My crop's absolutely fine.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.780
 - So the Rocky Mountain locust,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.100
 which we're talking about, which led to this plague,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.300
 was crazy at the time and we did fight battle with them.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.940
 And the battle was won by the humans to the point

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.900
 that they're now an extinct species.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.620
 - Hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.380
 You're giving us credit for that.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.820
 - No, I'm saying long-term, they are no longer on earth.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.180
 - How did we win the battle?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.020
 - Well, in-

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.860
 - Why not because of us?

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.860
 - No, no, no, I'm just saying history.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.180
 They're no longer here on our planet.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.340
 - Who writes the history books, Anna?

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.180
 - Okay.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.220
 - I'll say it's because of us.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.060
 I think you're right, Dan.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.140
 - It was largely because of us, but also as animals.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.100
 And it was changing agricultural conditions.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.940
 - It was, yeah.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.260
 - Who changes the agricultural conditions.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.100
 - Thank you, James.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.020
 - Who brings the animals.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.860
 - Thank you, James.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.700
 - Mr. Man.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.540
 - There we go.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.500
 - But we didn't do it on purpose.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.340
 - It was an accident.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.940
 - Yeah, we absolutely didn't want to do it.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.900
 And that's horrible to decimate a species to extinction.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.460
 But they can still be found,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.420
 despite being extinct in glaciers around there.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.300
 There's this one place,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.740
 which is called the Grasshopper Glacier.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.740
 And it's in Wyoming where all of them

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.380
 have sort of just been frozen in time inside there.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.940
 And you can see them when you look into it

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.780
 and people ship them out.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.780
 - Can they come back like cut in America or?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.620
 - There is a theory.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.140
 Some scientists think there might be

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.220
 a few lurking around somewhere.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.660
 - Not ready to come back.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.980
 Like the glacier melts and suddenly the grasshopper's taken over.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.340
 - Not ready to mount the full counter attack,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.300
 but there are scientists who think

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.060
 they might still be out there somewhere.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.860
 - Well, I thought, as in not in the glaciers,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.700
 but actually out there.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.540
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.860
 - Yeah, because so we don't,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.980
 even though we've said like this agriculture

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.420
 or environment or climate change,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.100
 but really we don't know, right?

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.820
 It's a massive mystery.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.180
 And they just vanished.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.020
 So it was 1877, it was still pretty bad.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.660
 Pretty much by the 1880s, they'd gone.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.780
 I think the last spotting was in the like the eight 1901

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.980
 or something or right at the start

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.700
 of the 20th century anyway.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.940
 And they vanished, but it could just be

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.340
 that they stopped swarming

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.580
 because locusts just turned back into grasshoppers

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.620
 when they go out of a swarm.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.380
 And they could just be hiding, as you say in plain sight,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.460
 waiting to regroup.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.780
 - When you say they turn into grasshoppers,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.860
 they don't change, do they?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.620
 We just change our name for them.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.140
 It's like literally one animal is called a grasshopper.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.340
 When it's with all its mates, we call them locusts.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.180
 - You're kidding.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.020
 - Yeah.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.980
 - It's not like Batman and suddenly

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.300
 it's a whole change of outfit.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.980
 - They kind of, they do change outfit.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.820
 They definitely do.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.660
 - Yeah, they change color in it.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.100
 - Because they get stronger, they get darker,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.180
 they get more mobile, their color changes.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.100
 And in fact, until the 1920s,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.460
 they were assumed to be different species.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.300
 It's really weird.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.940
 There were two versions of this desert locust.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.220
 One is in Hulk mode and one is not.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.940
 And then we thought they were completely different.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.420
 - How quickly do they change though?

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.940
 - That feels like that should take a while.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.620
 It's not as soon as they start swarming,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.820
 they just all turn blue.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.500
 - Kind of is, it's really weird.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.660
 So basically they have wild populations

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.260
 which swell up after rains because there's lots of food.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.060
 So plants are growing so they can eat lots.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.900
 But then if the land gets parched,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.140
 they get pushed into a smaller and smaller area.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.300
 And then this chemical serotonin kicks in

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.900
 in their brain, which we have to,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.500
 which is associated with happiness for us, I think.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.860
 But anyway, not for them because the serotonin

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.380
 basically turns them into Hulk mode.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.820
 - We don't know that they're not happy.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.460
 - That's true, they can be thrilled.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.100
 And they just set off and they go for it.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.260
 And it's very rare for them to switch out of swarm mode

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.700
 once they're in it because any offspring born

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.580
 during a swarm are also swarmers.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.900
 - Yes, okay.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.780
 - I actually do know how you can turn them into locusts.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.020
 So the way you do that is you tickle them

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.140
 on the back of the legs.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.420
 - Is that right?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.500
 - Yeah, and scientists tried this.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.620
 They had this theory that what happens is

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.220
 they are incredibly antisocial.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.580
 Like grasshoppers hate each other, usually.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.700
 But when they get hungry,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.060
 they go to the same bit of food

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.740
 and they start rubbing up against each other.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.220
 And eventually that rubbing stimulates them

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.260
 to suddenly want to swarm.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.780
 - Do they become thigmo-tactic?

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.460
 - I think they become thigmo-tactic, yeah.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.780
 - Favorite word, fish word.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.940
 - It's really the fish word.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.780
 - Friend of the podcast.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.620
 - Friend of the podcast.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.460
 - Friend of the podcast.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.300
 - Thigmo-tactic.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.140
 - We should have her on.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.980
 - That's really cool.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.820
 So that explains the serotonin thing, right?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.220
 Because they become like more loving

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.820
 to their fellow grasshopper.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.660
 - Yes.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.500
 - Is that right?

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.340
 - Yeah, or at least want to hang out with them.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.180
 Although there's also a theory

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.020
 that the reason they're swarming is

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.180
 they all want to eat each other.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.020
 So I don't know how much love that is.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.860
 - Yeah, I wish they do.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.700
 That's when I read that.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.860
 If they fall behind in the swarm,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.740
 whoever's behind will chew them up.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.380
 I mean, that is a terrible.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.260
 - That happens in the Tour de France as well, actually.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.580
 So one really important thing of this locust swarm

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.580
 in the 1870s and 1880s is what did the farmers do?

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.940
 Because basically all of their crops were taken.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.820
 They had no way of making any money,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.140
 but also they had no food

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.300
 'cause all the crops had been eaten by locusts.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.500
 And so they asked the state for money,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.940
 but the state couldn't give them enough

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.900
 because basically everyone was affected.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.500
 And so they went to the federal government

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.980
 and there was a real discussion about that

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.900
 because basically they thought

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.700
 that their farmers might be turned soft

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.940
 if they gave them any help, any charity, right?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.940
 And so they came up with these tests

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.580
 to make sure that you were worthy enough to get aid.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.300
 As a farmer, you had to pledge an oath

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.020
 that you possessed nothing of value

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.940
 that could be sold for food or clothing

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.180
 in order to get any charity at all.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.540
 - Sounds like, is this where Jacob Rees-Mogg

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.380
 started his career?

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.140
 (laughing)

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.300
 - But yeah, I mean, in the end though,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.420
 eventually the federal government did step in

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.980
 and kind of gave aid packages

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.460
 and food packages to everyone.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.300
 And that was the start of what is now the typical response

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.540
 to disasters in America.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.460
 It was also a fire in Chicago a bit earlier

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.540
 that did a similar thing.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.220
 But yeah, this was a big step for America

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.060
 as far as state aid was concerned.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.780
 - So they sort of did them a favor?

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.940
 - Yeah. - A long run.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.660
 - Exactly, good old locusts.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.620
 - Good old locusts.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.620
 Another coping mechanism they had actually

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.780
 before that came in was in Minnesota,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.300
 they had huge vats of boiling water

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.580
 that they kept in the center

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.180
 of some of the big cities there.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.940
 And there was a bounty of 50 cents a bushel on the locusts

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.500
 and apparently 130,000 grasshoppers equals one bushel.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.860
 So you've got to get quite a lot to get you 50 cents.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.460
 And then you bring them to the city

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.460
 and you chuck them in this vat of boiling water.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.300
 - Right. - Isn't that cool?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.140
 Like a cauldron?

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.500
 - Yeah, or just to kill them off?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.140
 - Yeah, yeah. - Not to make a soup.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.060
 - No. - No.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.900
 Otherwise you just got a big locust lolly.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.180
 When they've tried that in various places around the world,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.780
 what often happens is people just start

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.100
 breeding the animal, don't they?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.420
 - Yes, exactly.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.580
 - Poor guys at Jimmy's cricket shop,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.220
 which breed crickets, see this cloud on the horizon.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.140
 Well, bang goes business.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.580
 - Why is he not calling it Jiminy Crickets?

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.740
 - Absolutely right.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.500
 - Yeah, well, it did almost bankrupt the state actually.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.300
 They had to cancel it almost straight away.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.300
 'Cause everyone's bringing in so many locusts.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.860
 - The bushel. - The bushel offer.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.260
 - Well, it's the 12 day thing, yeah.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.180
 'Cause too many businesses. - Wow.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.620
 - Yeah, can't afford it.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.740
 - If you guys heard of a megacolon.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.780
 - Oh, I thought that was you impersonating one.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.700
 - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.980
 - It's not a punctuation that I accomplished earlier.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.220
 - I think I invulnerably made,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.140
 it's like I've been hypnotized to make that noise when I hear.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.340
 That's being said.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.180
 - Very obscure.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.340
 Darren Brown never thought that would come up

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.340
 in your life again.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.500
 - A megacolon is you would--

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.900
 - Okay, so this thing which I was talking about,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.060
 it's what happens if you get an infection in your colon.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.660
 And there was a mummy from 1,000 years ago

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.620
 which had this infection.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.740
 And it was scanned with an electron microscope

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.180
 and what they found is that for the last few months

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.540
 of his life, he'd been fed solely on grasshoppers.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.940
 So that's all he'd eaten.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.460
 And what they'd done is we could tell from the microscope

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.100
 that they'd taken all the legs off the grasshoppers

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.300
 and just, and the heads and just got the bodies

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.180
 which is really high in protein

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.660
 and just kind of squished them together

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.260
 and given them to this guy.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.140
 And this, as far as we can tell,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.420
 is the earliest example of any kind of nursing

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.220
 or hospice care in the human race

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.260
 that we have direct evidence for.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.100
 - Wow.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.260
 - But he had to prove that he'd sold off

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.060
 anything he had of value before.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.100
 That's awesome.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.420
 - A megacolon.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.260
 - Mm.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.100
 - Oh, gosh.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.260
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.900
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when Henriette Dongeville

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.100
 held a reception to celebrate being the first woman

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.940
 to climb Mont Blanc, one guest was Maria Paradis

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.620
 who had been to the top of the mountain 30 years earlier.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.780
 Riddle me that.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.380
 (laughing)

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.360
 - Okay.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.660
 - She didn't climb it.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.060
 She swam up 'cause it was underwater.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.900
 - Oh, yeah, really?

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.300
 - Oh, yeah, she was dropped on.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.820
 - She, from a plane had a top.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.580
 - First of all, Anna gets half a point

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.260
 'cause she didn't climb up allegedly.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.100
 - Okay.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.940
 - But she wasn't dropped by a plane,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.780
 so you get minus 10.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.860
 - She was pretty hefty.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.020
 - She was born there.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.100
 She was top of the mountain 30 years earlier.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.260
 That's where her mom gave birth to her.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.980
 But then her mother would also have had to be there

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 and so would have then been the first woman at the top.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.540
 - Yeah, except she was dropped from a plane.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.140
 (laughing)

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.740
 What year was this, James?

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.380
 - So this was 1838 when Dongeville went up,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.820
 but Maria Parody went up in 1808.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.660
 And what happened was she was dragged up, we think.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.540
 - Kicking and screaming.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.220
 - Well, not really doing anything

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.980
 'cause she kind of passed out halfway up the mountain.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.820
 - Wow.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.340
 - Is that a really fun drunk and night out prank kind of thing?

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.180
 - Yeah.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.460
 - We'll have her wake up at the top of Mont Blanc.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.180
 - You'd usually carry someone rather than drag.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.380
 That's very caveman, isn't it?

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.980
 - Yeah, it was.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.860
 So basically what happened was in 1808,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.900
 a few people had already gone at Mont Blanc

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.220
 and they kind of talked this 18 year old servant

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.060
 from Chamonix called Maria Parody to go up Mont Blanc.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.780
 And they said, if you do this, you'll become kind of famous

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.140
 and you'll be able to make a load of money

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.100
 and maybe it will help the hotel that you're working in.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.540
 It'll give them some publicity.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.860
 And so she's like, yeah, fine.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.900
 I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.020
 We know about what happened

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.380
 because she spoke to Alexander Dumas in 1811

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.380
 and she told him that as she was almost to the top,

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.180
 she felt her legs go to hell, she said.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.220
 And then the people who were going up with her

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.740
 decided to take her each under one arm

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.180
 and drag her to the top.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.220
 She was pulled, dragged and carried

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.860
 to the top of the mountain, okay?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.740
 And then 30 years later,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.940
 this high society woman called Henriette Dongeville

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.140
 decided that she wanted to be the first person

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.460
 to really walk up Mont Blanc and she did that.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.940
 And then she invited this Maria Parody

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.220
 to come to her party afterwards.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.700
 And there's a little bit of kind of classism

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.780
 because first of all, Marie Parody was like,

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.220
 I can't believe that a real lady

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.980
 managed to get all the way up to a mountain.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.540
 I'm a peasant woman, I know the country,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.380
 I should be able to do it.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.620
 I can't believe you would.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.580
 But then Henriette was kind of dismissive of her

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.620
 and she's like, well, at least I went up

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.740
 by my own accord and stuff.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.580
 - She almost didn't get up on her own accord, did she?

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.740
 She had exactly the same moment.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.540
 Yeah, Henriette, she had the same

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.980
 where she suddenly buckled and she was on her back

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.540
 and there were questions from the rest of the camp,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.700
 do we carry her up?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.900
 And she managed fortunately to sort of get her wits about her

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.500
 and she said, no, I can do this, I can do this.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.420
 But yeah, almost carried up as well.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.260
 - The person who went up with her

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.300
 was called Joseph Coutet or Coutet.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.100
 And when she kind of got near the top

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.980
 and she felt like falling asleep, she felt really woozy,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.020
 Coutet said, look at her, asleep again.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.820
 This is the last lady I take up Mont Blanc.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.060
 (laughing)

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.700
 Although that does sound like a euphemism

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.020
 when I read it, doesn't it?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.940
 - Oh, I took her up Mont Blanc.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.020
 - Oh, what if this whole fact is a euphemism?

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.060
 It's a really raunchy night.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.380
 - Oh my God.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.700
 It wasn't quite raunchy because Henriette Dongeville,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.340
 when she climbed up, she was wearing a boa.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.180
 She was wearing a--

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.260
 - Constrictor or feather?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.940
 - Feather or fur, possibly.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.300
 But because obviously climbing gear for women

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.540
 did not exist at the time

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.220
 because only mad aristocratic ladies who were starting it,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.540
 she was wearing a petticoat over men's trousers

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.620
 and then a bonnet with a veil and then a boa.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.520
 The whole thing weighed about six kilos.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.740
 So it was really heavy to be climbing out.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.940
 - She basically had to wear the men's clothes

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.300
 because obviously that's the convenient way to get to the top

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.820
 but she still felt like she had to wear

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.220
 the women's stuff over the top.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.380
 - Yeah, and there is this amazing picture of her

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.380
 going over a crevasse with a ladder,

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.780
 which I actually didn't realize was the thing

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.940
 that you did in climbing and it looks absolutely terrifying

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.100
 when she's doing it because it's this massive drop

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.940
 in the middle of it.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.140
 The ladder's just going between these two cliff edges

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.140
 and she's there with these extremely heavy skirts

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.220
 which she would have sort of scrambling over

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.180
 which she would have thought

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.860
 is gonna tip you over any minute.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.700
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.260
 - And one of the reasons that she went up supposedly

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.500
 is that she was quite jealous of other well-known women

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.620
 that were kind of talking about going up Mont Blanc.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.220
 So the writer, Georges Sond, who you all know, I'm sure,

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.860
 who's kind of mostly famous for wearing men's clothes

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.020
 but she was kind of a really famous writer

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.980
 who at the time was bigger than Victor Hugo

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.580
 and Bolzac and people like that.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.060
 But she was kind of doing a lot of walking

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.380
 in the foothills of Mont Blanc

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.020
 and she was talking about how she might soon go up

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.260
 and Henriette Doncheville decided no,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.740
 she was gonna do it first.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.580
 - That's great.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.420
 - It was not a prank.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.300
 That's what I would do if I was trying to trick someone

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.300
 into going up Mont Blanc.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.820
 - Oh, I might go tomorrow morning.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.940
 I know the weather looks a bit dodgy, but yeah.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.780
 - The clothing, I mean, it is mad

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.740
 that women were made to wear dresses

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.980
 and there were sort of, you know, there were a few women

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.860
 who were supposedly threatened with legal cases

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.660
 for the fact that they were wearing men's trousers.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.780
 It was so controversial at the time

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.380
 and there were systems where they did try to cheat it.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.140
 So I read about Aubrey Leblond who climbed Rotorne,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.900
 which is a mountain about 2,000 meters high.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.660
 And so there was a sort of compromise

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.700
 which is that you would leave where you were staying.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.300
 Let's say you're staying in a hotel wearing the dress

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.220
 or the skirt that you had with the trousers on

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.660
 and then you would take it off

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.820
 while you were doing the actual mountain climbing

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.460
 and maybe no one would tell each other.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.940
 But so she made it to the top

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.180
 and then on the way down,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.260
 realized she'd left her skirt up there.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.300
 So had to backtrack, go back up,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.740
 re-ascend this giant mountain together.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.900
 - So she had to carry her skirt to the top after drop.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.220
 She didn't just leave it in a bush or something

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.060
 where she took it off.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.060
 She carried it that way up with her.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.340
 - You would leave it somewhere safe,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.420
 like if you're going swimming or whatever.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.300
 - Yeah, you don't swim holding your clothes

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.700
 up above the water if you do.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.020
 - My sister once was climbing up a hill

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.180
 in the lake district and then went to the top.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.260
 And when she got to the bottom,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.500
 she realized she'd left her phone at the top.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.460
 And that's how all the way back up,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.380
 then it looked good to get her phone down.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.740
 - Hey, have you all heard of Annie Smith Peck?

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.860
 Annie Smith Peck is a mountaineer.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.740
 She climbed the Matterhorn in 1850.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.100
 And it's just so interesting

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.420
 'cause she had to do it with total hatred

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.060
 from all the male companions who were taking on again

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.460
 'cause they just didn't want women doing it.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.500
 She wore trousers, they hated that scandalous.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.460
 So when she went up,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.260
 one thing that happened was they would constantly,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.420
 like the guys were just always having temper tantrums,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.780
 there would be strikes.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.700
 But at one point,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.140
 'cause they kind of just wanted to get rid of her

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.460
 as part of the party,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.140
 they said that, well, it said that

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.260
 when she was going across a crevasse field,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.460
 when she went out of view, they cut the rope,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.300
 the support rope.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.820
 - No, I was looking after her.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.500
 - Went back to camp and then she had to make her way back

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500
 and found them all sitting there.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.340
 And they were like, "Oh, you're still here."

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.580
 - No, did that actually happen?

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.260
 - That's according to the accounts, yeah.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.500
 And I think her accounts, that's what happened.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.060
 I mean, she was really impressive.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.780
 She once hung a votes for women sign

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.820
 off the peak of a mountain in Peru, just to make a point.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.860
 - Who's gonna see that?

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.580
 - I mean, good point.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.900
 - No one after her companions cut the ropes from the sign.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.660
 - You wanna do it in the middle of Trafalgar Square

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.500
 or somewhere where people walk past all the day?

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.260
 - That's a really good point.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.460
 Yep, can't fault you on that.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.580
 And then another time,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.700
 she climbed another mountain in Peru,

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.780
 the North Peak of Huascaran, okay?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.420
 With some Swiss guides.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.180
 And it was renamed in her honor.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.980
 It was renamed Cumbre Ana Peck.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.300
 But at that point, the record,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.900
 I think the highest altitude,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.340
 maybe for a woman or maybe for that peak,

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.260
 but it was held by another lady mountaineer

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.860
 called Fanny Workman.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.300
 - Oh yeah, legend.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.620
 - Well, another legend,

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.540
 but there was beef between them

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.020
 because Workman was so annoyed

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.900
 that Peck was claiming this record

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.980
 that she paid for engineers

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.540
 to go and recalculate the altitude of the mountain

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.860
 and establish that she had actually climbed 600 meters

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.620
 less than she had claimed to, than Peck had claimed.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.420
 - 600 meters, that's a big recalculation.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.660
 - It is a pretty big recalculation.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.900
 So the Workman would still have the record.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.380
 - That's pretty, yeah.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.980
 - So just while you're saying Annie Smith Peck

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.460
 having something named after her,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.060
 the Matterhorn, not long after she went up that,

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.260
 there was another explorer

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.660
 who had a bit of it named after her.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.860
 So this was a mountaineer called Felicite Carol.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.100
 And she unfortunately didn't make it to the summit

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.940
 when she was going.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.780
 She was with her father

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.020
 and it's because she was wearing a skirt

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.380
 and the skirt ballooned in the wind

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.780
 and they thought this is too dangerous.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.700
 You can't go any higher.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.180
 Your skirt's gonna get in the way.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.820
 So the spot where that happened

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.980
 is named the Matterhorn's Coal of Felicite.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.980
 And yeah, after her,

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.740
 but she never got to make it to the top as a result.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.780
 - 'Cause it could have blown her up there

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.620
 like Mary Brown in Office, that's true.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.900
 - Did you bring an umbrella as well?

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.740
 - Have you heard of the book Mountaineering in Scotland?

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.580
 - No.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.820
 - This is by an author called W.H. Murray,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.100
 William Hutchison Murray.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.940
 - Any relation?

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.220
 - No, not as far as I know.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.580
 I wish because this is an amazing sounding book.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.060
 It was written on sheets of toilet paper

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.860
 in prisoner of war camps in Germany during the war.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.700
 So Murray had been sent by his mother,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.780
 the complete works of Shakespeare in the post.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.940
 And that was an earlier time of the war

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.980
 when the Red Cross parcels were still getting through

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.700
 and you could receive post and things like that.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.180
 - It's a lot of postage that, isn't it?

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.660
 - It's a lot of postage, yeah.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.940
 But he noticed that the paper was lovely and soft

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.140
 and it was actually a lot better than the stuff

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.300
 that they were being given as toilet paper.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.660
 - So it sounds like he used the complete works

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.220
 of Shakespeare as loo roll and he saved his loo roll

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.300
 and wrote his own book about Mountaineering

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.660
 on the loo paper.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.500
 - Oh my God.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.300
 - I know, but the worst thing was then he was moved,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.820
 he wrote for a year, presumably getting along quite well

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.860
 with his first draft.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.460
 - What kind of, what was he writing with?

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.300
 Do we know?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.340
 - No, I don't know actually.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.300
 I don't know how he got a pencil.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.140
 Or a pencil, yeah.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.500
 - Was it 2B or not 2B?

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.980
 - Oh my God.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.300
 Oh my God.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.940
 - He walked straight into that one.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.780
 - But then he was moved.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.260
 He was moved to another camp called Offlag 8F

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.540
 and it was a much stricter prison camp.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.460
 I mean, I don't know how lenient the previous one was,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.100
 but basically the Gestapo searched everyone

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.540
 very carefully on the way in

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.020
 and his stash of toilet paper with a book on it

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.060
 was found and taken off him.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.980
 And he had to write an entire second draft

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.020
 on more toilet paper.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.860
 - No.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.700
 - Yeah.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.520
 - Oh my God.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.360
 - I know.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.500
 He claimed that the Gestapo had done him a favor

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.380
 because his first draft was a bit flabby,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.420
 he needs a bit of time.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.260
 - Yeah.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.420
 - The most generous prisoner of war you've ever,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.740
 I actually kind of liked the Gestapo.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.980
 - Do you think that when he only had the toilet paper left

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.060
 that he kind of would hold it in so that he didn't use it?

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.100
 By the end, he would have had a mega-coal on it, I reckon.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.940
 - Oh my God.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.760
 - Oh my God.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.840
 (laughs)

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.420
 (upbeat music)

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.540
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.220
 and that is Andy.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.700
 - The fact is that the queen in her garden

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.060
 has a collection of fake rocks.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.020
 - She has a lot of gardens.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.860
 - Do we have a specific one?

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.680
 - She has a lot of gardens.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.100
 She has gardens at Buckingham Palace, though, specifically.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.140
 - How's this in the main garden?

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.500
 - Her main garden, I would say.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.620
 There is a fake rock called Pullermite

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.860
 and she's got a lot of it.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.820
 - Is it, sorry, is that specific rock called,

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.020
 did she name it Pullermite?

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.860
 Like, cause she's got Dave sitting next to it,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.700
 it's a real rock.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.540
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.140
 Yeah, this is a kind of rock invented by,

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.700
 it's so weird that you can invent a rock.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.700
 There was a gardener called James Pullum

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.700
 and he invented this rock and it became a craze.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.920
 Can you explain to us how you invent a rock?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.940
 - Yeah, so he was a gardener

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.780
 and he noticed that there was a bit of a trend going on

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.760
 for when people have been traveling

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.660
 and they might bring plants back with them

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.460
 and this relates to the Victorian fern craze as well.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.060
 This was a big craze for having ferns and collecting ferns.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.580
 So the problem is that ferns don't like growing on lawns.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.260
 You know, most gardens at the time

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.760
 were, you know, nice flat lawns of grass.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.940
 And he was a gardener and also he knew a bit about engineering

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.140
 and he started offering people their own personal ravines

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.540
 to put their alpine plants and ferns in

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.100
 and he made this material from his own recipe

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.480
 and he took the recipe to his grave.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.060
 And so he started offering people their own personal rocks

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.300
 that you could shape and build and mold

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.900
 into the exactly shapes that you wanted.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.460
 And this became a craze, people,

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.100
 lots and lots of gardens had these fake rocks in.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.260
 - It's environmentally friendly

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.380
 'cause you don't have to go and dig it out of a mountain

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.220
 or something.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.060
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.780
 It takes a lot less transportation, yeah.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.220
 - And it was 'cause it does sound like a thing

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.780
 that would be shunted by the rich as something, you know,

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.380
 we just want natural stuff.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.220
 But as you say, you know, the queen has it

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.700
 in Buckingham Palace, many famous family, the Rothschilds

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.620
 and so on, we're all really keen on it.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.340
 So this was, yeah, it was a big deal.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.180
 - It was a big deal.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.020
 - It's everywhere.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.860
 I no longer trust any rocks I see.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.020
 What if this is puller made?

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.580
 - There's a big list online, isn't there?

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.660
 Of all the places you can find it, including Las Vegas.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.500
 - Really?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.380
 - Yeah, the Bellagio, there's like,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.020
 I think there's a fountain that's made out of it.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.860
 - Wow.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.660
 - Well, the first time that we properly,

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.700
 I think outside of a show, saw each other

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.300
 during the sort of first lockdown having ended

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.900
 was we were at St. James's Park,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:05.940
 weren't we, we were sitting there

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.540
 and the rocks by the Duck Island Cottage

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.140
 are also those kind of rocks.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.980
 - Are they?

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.820
 - Right next to it.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.060
 - Exactly, no rock is safe from puller.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.340
 It's really insane.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.820
 Even seaside towns like Folkestone, Ramsgate,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.940
 they went nuts for it.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.540
 They actually, I think quite badly damaged

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.260
 the council finances by spending all their money

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.780
 on pullermite because they wanted extra rocks

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.500
 for the sea to make it more rocky.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.340
 - Oh, why?

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.180
 - This isn't rocky enough.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.140
 - That just makes swimming in the sea

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.260
 more and more unpleasant.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.300
 - I think it's not inside the sea.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.460
 So for example, Folkestone got paths and tunnels

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.940
 to get people down from the cliffs.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.500
 They wanted a gorgeous natural way to show people down.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.620
 And so next time you see a rock, check.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.620
 - Yeah, check.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.620
 - So how can you check?

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.940
 Can you give it a knock in its hollow?

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.060
 It's not right, it's a rock.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.580
 - Most of the rocks you see day to day will be rocks.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.820
 - Oh, sure, absolutely.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.660
 Yeah, but that's just law of averages.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.580
 But do take a photo and send them to Andy.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.380
 Anytime you see a rock, I'll go through that.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.220
 I'll tell you, if your rock is--

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.860
 - They're a bit lighter, aren't they?

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.660
 They're lighter than normal rocks.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.780
 And they'll just look faker.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.780
 - They'll look a little bit like

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.380
 when you're queuing at a theme park, you know,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.540
 the rockeries that you have.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.540
 Not quite as plastic as that.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.380
 - Not as plastic.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.020
 - No, it's more realistic version of that.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.860
 You're right.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.220
 - They were incredibly successful, weren't they?

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.060
 James Pullham.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.300
 He set up this company, which is James Pullham and Son.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.660
 And it was a company that just went on and on.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.420
 So when he retired, he handed it over to his son, James Pullham.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.700
 And then when he retired,

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.100
 he handed it over to his son, James Pullham.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.140
 And then when he retired,

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.060
 he handed it over to his son, James Pullham.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.180
 - I think it was the second James Pullham

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.940
 who invented Pullhamite, wasn't it?

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.940
 As opposed to the first one.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.780
 - I think you're right.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.620
 - I think.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.020
 - So, okay, minus one of the James Pullhams

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.860
 from that list there.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.540
 - He was helped by two of the other

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.220
 James Pullhams later in life,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.420
 but also helped by another brother

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.740
 called Michelangelo Pullham.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.940
 What a name.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.540
 - He's not living up to that name, it's a fake rock.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.380
 - Everyone else in the family's called James

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.740
 and he's called Michelangelo.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.340
 - But it's two names, isn't it?

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.860
 He's Michelangelo Pullham.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.460
 They've divided Michelangelo in two.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.900
 He's, you know, to the untrained eye,

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.460
 he's Michel Pullham, real name Angelo.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.980
 - But he did all of the designing, didn't he, as well?

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.700
 Yeah, so if you ever needed a rock,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.460
 but it needs to be in a certain shape,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.060
 you gave it to Michelangelo Pullham

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.340
 and he did the shaping for it.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.180
 - That's brilliant.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.180
 - If you ever want a cherub to be emerging from your rock.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.660
 - We should give a shout out to the book about this

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.700
 by Claude Hitching.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.900
 - Ah, Claude Hitching.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.740
 What a man.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.980
 - He is the man on Pullamite.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.100
 So he's written a book called The Pullam Legacy

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.540
 and I mean, he has spent, I think, decades

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.020
 tracking down bits of Pullamite

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.620
 because we still don't know where it all is.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.700
 That's why I'm saying you've got to check.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.180
 - It's all over the country, but there weren't, you know,

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.020
 accurate records kept everywhere this company worked.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.380
 - I mean, it's not as urgent as like landmines and stuff, is it?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.220
 Nothing's gonna happen if we don't find it.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.340
 - When he started looking into it,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.260
 he discovered that five of his direct ancestors

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.020
 all had worked for the Pullam company at some point.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.860
 - Oh, wow, really?

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.180
 - And so he had a personal connection, yeah.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.660
 And so basically he has, as Andy says,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.420
 spent so long trying to track down

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.820
 where bits of missing Pullamite have gone.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.340
 Sort of historically important bits in the Pullamite world.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.180
 Where have they gone?

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.500
 Where Pullamite fans are like, "Oh, I can't believe we lost this."

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.540
 And some of them have turned up in places like,

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.460
 he found there was the Q Fountain,

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.260
 which was made for the International Exhibition in 1862.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.100
 - Really?

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.940
 - It had disappeared.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.780
 And where is it now?

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.140
 That's where James said earlier, Las Vegas.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.380
 It found its way there.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.540
 - Oh, that's the one at the Bellagio?

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.380
 - Exactly.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.220
 - Wow.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.500
 - That was a famous one in the UK.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.140
 Pullamite fans distressed that they couldn't find it anymore.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.980
 It disappeared.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.140
 - That's incredible.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.980
 - One amazing Pullam legacy.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.300
 One of the biggest projects of James Pullam number three

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.940
 is the Landscape Garden at Friar Park.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.900
 Which is, yeah, and you don't know about this.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.220
 It's near Henley, and you'll see why Dunn knows about this.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.020
 It's maintained by a woman called Olivia Harrison,

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.020
 who is George Harrison's widow.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.420
 And they bought it, but it sounds incredible.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.500
 So originally it was sort of designed by its owner,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.020
 who's called Frank Crisp,

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.340
 this really eccentric guy who basically,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.460
 why are you looking at me so?

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.300
 - It's a funny name.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.140
 - It's just a nice name.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.980
 - It's a funny name.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.820
 - He's a Frank Crisp.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.660
 - Crisp by name.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.500
 - Crisp by nature.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.860
 - He was a crispy eccentric man who designed his garden

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.340
 to look like an Alpine landscape, basically.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.540
 So full of these fake rocks that he got done by Pullam.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.940
 - And sorry, just with the Alpine thing,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.620
 he actually had a model of the Matterhorn made.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.740
 - Yes. - Out of rocks.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.780
 - Not actual size.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.020
 - Not actual size, different scale, yeah.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.500
 But yeah, the Matterhorn is there.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.340
 - That's incredible.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.340
 - Yeah, amazing.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.020
 So it takes up like lots of acres,

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.340
 that Matterhorn is pretty big,

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.220
 and that's not Pullam, that was someone else.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.660
 But basically it got really overgrown.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.540
 I think some nuns moved into it for a while,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.540
 and it got dilapidated.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.420
 And then George Harrison bought it

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.340
 and said, "I'm gonna take this over."

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.820
 And they cleared it, and they found all this stuff.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.540
 Like the Matterhorn was just sort of sticking out

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.380
 of a bunch of rubble.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.820
 They barely even knew it was there.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.820
 And it sounds like he had this incredible moment, George.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.100
 There's some sort of fake lakes built there.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.180
 And at one point, he lowered himself on a rope

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.380
 into this cavern that was below this lake.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.740
 So I guess this lake's on a, yeah,

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.060
 there's like a cave below this lake.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.900
 - Sorry, the Cavern Club?

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.740
 Or yeah, what?

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.580
 - What?

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.820
 - The Cavern Club where the Beatles played in Liverpool.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.660
 - I should know that.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.500
 - Even I know that.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.340
 - Yeah.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.500
 (laughing)

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.900
 - Actual Beatles hater.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.460
 (laughing)

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.140
 - Maybe that's what drew him to it.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.220
 That's how he knew.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.740
 'Cause he lowered himself into this cavern

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.420
 and underneath was this whole grotto.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.380
 So like pulomite grotto with these sparkling kind of courts

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.380
 and stuff on the walls.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.380
 This like crazy magical landscape.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.220
 - Wow.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.460
 - And yeah, and now you can kind of row through it

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.980
 and look at all these diamonds glistening

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.220
 on the walls and stuff.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.780
 And yeah, it sounds incredible.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.340
 - They do keep discovering these places.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.940
 So even recently in 2000,

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.900
 there was a couple who moved into a house,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.660
 Dewstow house it was called.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.700
 And they started to notice all these weird rocks

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.700
 sticking out of the ground.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.540
 - Okay.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.780
 - And they then started digging.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.540
 And they discovered this huge labyrinthine underground

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.700
 environment, this massive rock garden,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.420
 magical caverns, water flowing from one to another,

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.940
 tunnel systems, fountains, fake stalactites.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.860
 The whole thing was this enormous mad pulomite project

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.460
 which a man called Henry Oakley had commissioned.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.100
 He was a railway director and he spent years

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.780
 having this incredible environment built for himself

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.740
 which just got buried.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.180
 It got buried under the M4 as it were

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.780
 because there were all these mounds of earth

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.100
 that were excavated to build the M4

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.540
 and they just got dumped on top of it.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.380
 - Okay.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.980
 - And the owners started to notice

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.740
 and they started excavating it.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.100
 And then a few years after that it won the award.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.100
 Alan Titchmarsh did a series on Britain's best back gardens

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.620
 and it came in at number eight.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.420
 - Oh, what a renaissance.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.260
 - Yeah.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.100
 - That little bit of land.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.540
 - Number eight.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.380
 - Yeah, number eight, yeah, not the top seven.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.180
 - Not top five, yeah.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.740
 - Imagine how exciting it is.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.100
 I honestly think that all our listeners

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.340
 should go home now and dig up their entire gardens

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.660
 in case there's a pulomite grotto under them.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.660
 - Yes, that's a good idea.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.700
 - You know, pulomite obviously wasn't the first fake rock

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.180
 and the sort of the only successful fake rock

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.740
 in the first of the 1700s was code stone.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.020
 So this was the 1770s, it was basically invented

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.420
 and it was the fake rock to have.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.500
 And there were lots of startups,

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.740
 lots of fake rock startups that tried to make their own.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.660
 Nothing came anywhere close to code stone.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.740
 And it was this business that was run for 50 years

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.980
 by this amazing woman, Eleanor Code,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.420
 who just decided, I think it was 1771,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.540
 she met this guy who made some fake stone

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.740
 and she bought up this massive factory

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.780
 and said, okay, start making it.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.620
 And she fired him almost immediately

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.900
 'cause decided he wasn't good enough

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.580
 and brought on someone better at making fake rock.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.620
 And she was amazing business woman.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.460
 So 50 years, she made this stone,

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.780
 which if you've seen the lion on the South Bank,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.900
 that big lion, that's made of code stone.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.460
 And that is hollow, so you can tell by knocking on it.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.260
 And if you look inside code stone,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.500
 which usually you can't 'cause it's like a statue,

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.820
 if you drill inside, you can see the fingerprints

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.220
 of the people who pushed it

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.420
 into the plaster molds on the inside.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.980
 - Oh, that is cool.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.940
 - Code sounds awesome, Eleanor Code,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.140
 'cause she worked with her mom for decades,

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.300
 also called Eleanor Code,

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.020
 and there's a lot of confusion about which code was which.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.260
 - Yeah, and have you heard about her grandma?

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.420
 - No, Eleanor Code.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.100
 - Her grandma, I actually don't know

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:16.940
 first name of her grandma.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.500
 - Is there a thing about having,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.860
 being a person who makes rocks

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.060
 and having no imagination for names?

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.700
 (all laughing)

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.740
 - And it's very much kept in the family, the rock thing.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.900
 Yeah, Eleanor Code's grandmother

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.660
 obviously had the business mindset as well.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.980
 She ran a textile business in Tiviton,

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.660
 and she sent spies to Norwich,

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.980
 which was very good on textiles,

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.740
 who would then steal all of their tricks,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.100
 then come back and be successful.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.140
 And she did things like she got carried around Tiviton

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.060
 in a sedan chair all the time.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.900
 (all laughing)

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.420
 She was a good character.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.940
 - Wow. - She sounds awesome.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.820
 - Yeah. - Have you guys heard

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.140
 of gunite? - No, gunite.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.820
 - It's another fake rock.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.580
 Can you guess how you make gunite?

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.460
 - Fire it from a gun?

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.300
 - Correct.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.900
 - Oh, no. - Yes.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.980
 - You get a gun, it's not like a small gun,

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.700
 it's like a big sort of hosepipe gun,

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.380
 and you fire out this dry sort of concretey material,

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.060
 and then you have a little bit of water

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.180
 at the nozzle of the gun,

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.660
 which kind of goes into the concrete as it comes out,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.980
 and then you can fire it wherever you want to put a rock.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.500
 - So cool. - It's almost like

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.460
 a 3D printer for rocks.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.900
 - And it's used on bridges, isn't it?

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.740
 If you ever see a bridge, really, or a tunnel,

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.180
 then it's probably gunite or shotcrete.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.980
 It also gets called the dry and wet versions.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.940
 - Shotcrete gets used in taxidermy, I think.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.060
 - Yeah, does it? - Yeah.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.100
 - It's because it's quite easy to shape.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.140
 - Yeah, exactly, and so is it, God, I've forgotten,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.780
 is it you're shaping and then you're putting the scale

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.620
 on top of it?

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.540
 - Well, what you can do with concrete

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.700
 is you can make the shape of something out of iron,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.260
 and you can fire the concrete onto it,

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.340
 and it'll, yeah, like a mold, and it'll go on that.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.180
 - Yeah. - That kind of thing.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.020
 - You don't have to make a mold for it,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.020
 you can't fire it, 'cause what's it landing on?

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.300
 You can't just fire it into mid-air,

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.380
 and it's like a spark plug. - Of course, of course, of course.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.140
 - That makes sense, that's awesome.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.980
 - Ugly rocks are sort of venerated in China.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.660
 I didn't really know about this thing, scholars rocks,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.220
 but you'd recognize them, and since the eighth century,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.260
 Confucians have, Confucian academics have basically said,

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.780
 ugly, jagged rocks are great for contemplation,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.980
 and the idea is that they represent Confucianism,

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.540
 they're uncompromising.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.060
 So from the eighth century, there's been a trend

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.020
 for getting the ugliest rock you can find,

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.540
 or the most jagged, or pitted, or misshapen,

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.900
 putting it in your garden, and watching it.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.420
 (both laughing)

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.100
 - That's really awesome. - To see what happens.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.740
 - Wow, I know Anna, I think I know this about you,

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.740
 'cause I know it about me,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.060
 you used to collect rocks when you were a kid, right?

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.580
 - Yeah, of that I found in my gravel, yeah.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.860
 - Yeah, yeah, did you like look for the ugly ones,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.420
 or for the attractive ones?

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.100
 - I was very shallow, I wasn't a philosopher,

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.820
 I just went for the fit ones, yeah.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.300
 Something pink and sparkly.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.100
 - Wow, are there competitions?

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.420
 - There actually should be, what they are.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.140
 - Ugly rock of the year.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.300
 - There must be, 'cause they're judged

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.740
 on certain qualities, so it must be,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.100
 for the sake of something, there are four categories,

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.660
 and these were determined by a guy called Mifu

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.180
 in the 12th century, who used to,

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.540
 - He was in charge of the Mifu movement.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.300
 (both laughing)

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.620
 - Yeah, he was a great campaigner for his day,

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.620
 and he used to bow to rocks, so when he met royalty,

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.220
 he'd walk in and bow to the rock instead of the emperor,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.060
 and people got annoyed.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.060
 - Instead of the emperor?

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:21.900
 - Yeah.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.220
 - Probably absolutely had to his own life.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.900
 - Maybe he was just short-sighted, we don't know.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.500
 - I met the queen a couple of years ago,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.740
 but I only really talked to the Pelomite rocks

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.060
 in the fucking palace.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.180
 (both laughing)

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.820
 - Anyway, they're judged, just to finish that,

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.500
 they are judged on their thinness, their openness,

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.100
 their holes, and their wrinkles.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.420
 You want to max out on all of that?

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.260
 - Can't we all?

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.100
 - Yes.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.680
 (upbeat music)

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.660
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.700
 and that is my fact.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.100
 My fact this week is that following a theory

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.060
 that they wouldn't burn up on re-entry,

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.500
 Japanese scientists once planned to fly paper airplanes

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.340
 from the International Space Station back onto Earth.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.580
 - Okay. - Very cool.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.780
 - Now, why does that mean therefore you'd do it?

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.660
 'Cause I understand that maybe you wouldn't burn up

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.220
 because you're not going that fast, but even so,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.580
 is it instead of something?

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.740
 - Well, I guess we are always trying to work out

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.660
 different ways of doing space travel,

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.400
 constantly seeing who knows how important space paper.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.180
 - Lightweight vehicles for re-entry

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.140
 would be immensely useful to have.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.140
 So if you can start--

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.820
 - You're not gonna sit on that paper aeroplane, are you?

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.660
 - Well, no, but you might sit inside a big paper aeroplane,

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.980
 which are all treated card or something,

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.300
 or there are chemical compounds--

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.220
 - Oh, so is that what I was testing?

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.260
 - They were, I mean, that's what they said

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.780
 the justification was, was lighter vehicles for re-entry.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.820
 - You don't need a reason for science, Hannah.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.700
 You can do science for science's sake.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.660
 - Good point. - All right.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.100
 - It discovers its own discoveries.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.860
 Is that what that's what scientists say, isn't it?

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.860
 - Yeah, that's the line, that's the official line in Latin.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.580
 - So how come they never did these happen?

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.180
 - Well, it's a really hard thing to do.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.260
 It was a really nice idea.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.380
 So this was in 2008 and there were researchers

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.500
 at the University of Tokyo who teamed up

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.220
 with Japan's Origami Airplane Association.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.100
 So this was gonna be origami paper planes

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.020
 that were put together and put through.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.500
 And so they did all these tests in wind tunnels

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.780
 at the University and they managed to show

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.060
 that this plane could actually hold its own

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.580
 at huge speeds of wind passing through it.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.660
 So it all looked like it could possibly work.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.180
 The problem is, is that if they did try it

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.220
 and it came back into the earth,

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.620
 it's so tiny without any GPS device on it,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.580
 we would just know nothing.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.980
 It would be impossible to tell in 2008.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.380
 - I think another problem is,

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.620
 I would say at least two thirds of the paper aeroplanes

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.340
 that I ever make either kind of go straight up

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.340
 and stall and land where I threw them

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.380
 or go straight down and crash into the ground.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.340
 So you need to train your astronauts

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.700
 to be proper paper aeroplane makers, don't you?

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.540
 - That's true.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.540
 - And they've already got a lot on their plates.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.980
 - They've got a lot of training today.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.460
 - Well, origami is useful in space in other ways, isn't it?

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.620
 So I guess I can see where they're coming from.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.940
 I think it's been used by Japan on solar panels.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.140
 And in fact, by NASA more recently,

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.420
 they certainly had a plan to, and they use mirror folds.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.940
 And I think, is that how you pronounce it?

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.260
 We've done it on QI.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.980
 - Mirror folds are basically how you fold maps, for instance,

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.980
 you know, when they fold up really small and flat

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.940
 and then you can spring them out with

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.780
 so that they're really big.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.700
 - It's almost like an accordion.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.740
 Like you, they're in a really small little square

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.920
 and then you pull them out and then you push them back in

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.140
 and pull them out and push them back in.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.900
 And then like a normal map,

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.780
 you're always trying to find the folds and stuff.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.740
 But these just kind of go back where they should do.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.580
 - That's really cool.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.820
 - 'Cause it'd be so annoying if an accordion

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.940
 was like a normal map where every time you pushed it in,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.900
 you had to fold it and it's up the right way.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.020
 - What do you think is the world record

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.460
 for folding 1,000 origami cranes?

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.780
 - 1,000.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.700
 (laughing)

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.660
 - Damn it.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.620
 What time, how long do you think it took the person?

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.860
 So do you remember I did this a few years ago?

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.700
 - Yes.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.020
 - It took me about two months.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.860
 - Okay.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.260
 - Yeah, you did it in the office as well

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.660
 'cause you're hiding it from your,

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.580
 it was a present for your wife.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.420
 And yeah, so.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.980
 - I wasn't hiding it from my wife.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.220
 - Yeah, it was a present for her.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.060
 So you were building it.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.300
 - I was really embarrassed and I didn't want to tell her.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.260
 No, it was a gift.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.540
 But yeah, how long do you reckon it takes to do 1,000?

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.940
 - Eight hours.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.980
 - Eight hours, that's a bit less than one a minute.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.220
 - But this is gonna be the record, right?

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.380
 So this is someone who's, I'm gonna say,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.100
 I'm gonna go as low as like two hours.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.940
 - What?

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.780
 - Just for this?

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.620
 - 1,000.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.460
 - Yeah, just because like.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.500
 - But how many seconds are there in an hour?

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.780
 - It's not gonna take a second to do a crane.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.940
 Surely a minute to do a crane, a bit less maybe.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.700
 - I think it'll take a couple of minutes.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.020
 I don't know, I think a couple of days.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.500
 - Couple of days, thank you, Andy, because these two.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.340
 (laughing)

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.180
 - Sorry, Jay.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.740
 - Poor Evelyn Chia of Colchester, England.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.940
 (laughing)

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.820
 - Henceforth known as the slacker.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.220
 What did she do then?

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.420
 - She is a teenager from Colchester

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.420
 and she did it in nine hours and 31 minutes.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.540
 - Well, that's much more impressive

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.620
 than I would have thought, Dan and Anna.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.500
 (laughing)

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.340
 - I think.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.180
 - Two hours.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.140
 - How good do they have to be?

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.940
 I mean, can I just scrunch up lots of bits of paper

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:01.780
 and claim their cranes?

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.580
 - I'll be honest, when I did it towards the end of the 1,000,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.660
 they got less and less looking like cranes.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.420
 - Did you hide those cranes at the back of the crowd?

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.260
 - I really do, yeah.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.900
 But she did it as a fundraiser for NHS charities.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.740
 - Nice.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.580
 - And in fact, I gave her some money for it

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.500
 'cause I was so impressed

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.500
 'cause it did take me literally two months to do it.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.660
 - That's very cool.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.500
 - But yeah.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.340
 - Oh, that's lovely.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.620
 - I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica article

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.980
 on origami and the origins of it.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.620
 And it's the first unequivocal document

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:34.020
 that talks about origami is a poem by Ihara Saikaku,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.580
 which was written in 1680, which talks about these butterflies

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.980
 made from paper.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.180
 But this guy, Ihara Saikaku,

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.180
 he once composed 23,500 verses in a single day.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.620
 - Jesus.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.460
 - Wow.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.300
 - Yeah.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.140
 - Does it have a chorus?

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.700
 Is it a cheek?

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.820
 Half of them are the same.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.300
 - I think they're on different subjects.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.180
 - Are there even that many subjects?

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.580
 - I already saw.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.020
 And apparently in the 20th century,

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.540
 origami was helped by the fact that it was used a lot

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.100
 in Rudolf Steiner's schools,

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.740
 which Dan, you went to one of those.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.300
 - I was a Steiner, yeah, I'm a Steiner kid.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.100
 - Did you learn how to make origami?

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.060
 - Yeah, we did, but we did do Japanese classes.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.580
 So I don't know if it was integrated.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.660
 We didn't have separate origami.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.060
 - Okay, 'cause apparently, according to the article,

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.020
 they emphasize kind of hands-on learning for kids

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.420
 as opposed to rote learning.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.540
 And so, yeah, origami was very popular,

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.220
 especially in the German Steiner schools.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.940
 - Okay, yeah, I mean, we definitely did origami at school.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.580
 - That's very interesting, 'cause I think Germany

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.260
 kind of brought advanced origami to Japan

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.900
 via kindergarten. - Really?

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.260
 - The kindergarten movement obviously started in Germany.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.260
 It's a German word.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.300
 And this is the 1830s, and this guy, Friedrich Frohbill,

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.940
 decided that origami would be a great way

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.180
 of educating children in both maths and art,

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.260
 'cause it's very mathematical and logical,

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.780
 and like very difficult spatial reasoning,

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.420
 but also quite artistic.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.460
 And he exported this around the world

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.580
 with this kindergarten movement,

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.300
 and it was really taken up in Japan,

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.860
 where they were already doing quite a lot

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.420
 of slightly simpler origami,

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.340
 but then they started making pigs and houses

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.020
 and sofas and stuff like that.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.940
 - Cool, so Germany exported origami to Japan,

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:14.900
 is what you're saying?

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.140
 - I'm saying Japan had a kind of origami,

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.700
 and then Germany exported a more advanced kind.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.860
 - We think probably invented in China origami

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.900
 because paper was invented in China.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.740
 So, yeah, probably the first people to fold paper

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.140
 were the first people to invent it.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.300
 But then went to Japan and became big bear,

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.980
 then came over, picked up by Germany,

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.300
 improved, sent back over to Japan again.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.900
 - And if there are, for German, Japanese, Chinese listeners,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.580
 we are not denigrating any origami

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.060
 or treatments of any countries, okay?

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.900
 Please don't write in.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.460
 - And if you do, please don't fold it

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.520
 in such a way that we can't read the letters.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.700
 (laughing)

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.300
 - The person who popularized origami in the West

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.500
 is a guy called Gershon Legman, and he--

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.340
 (laughing)

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.940
 - Was he a breast man or a Legman?

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.780
 (laughing)

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.460
 - Well, it's funny you should ask.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.220
 He did a bunch of other things.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.580
 So, the way he popularized it was,

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.500
 he found this origami prodigy called Akira Yoshizawa,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.180
 and he put on exhibitions of his work and stuff,

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.620
 and it all spread.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.140
 But the other things he tried,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.860
 he tried lots of stuff, Gershon Legman.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.540
 He collected vulgar limericks,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.300
 so he had a massive collection of scene limericks.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.060
 - He wrote the book, "The Rationale of a Dirty Joe."

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:23.900
 - Yes.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.140
 - It's a seminal set of books.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.300
 - And it's by someone called Legman.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.220
 - Well, it's also called by, what's his first name?

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.060
 - Gershon.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.780
 But he uses G.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.260
 So, G spot Legman.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.100
 - Wow.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.660
 - Sorry, G dot.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.580
 - Yeah, so G spot Legman was the name for his--

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.500
 - That's a stretch, so don't, you don't call it a spot.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.460
 You don't say, can you put a spot

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.100
 at the end of that sentence, please?

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.220
 - Yeah, that was his little gag.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.140
 - Wow.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:47.980
 - Cool.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.260
 - This is so weird seeing the interests

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.220
 of Dan intersect with what we're talking about.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.060
 (laughing)

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.740
 Not dirty jokes, that doesn't mean jokes in general.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.100
 - I just know, yeah, these books are like cult classics.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:56.940
 - Yeah.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.780
 - He said, "No ideas."

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.580
 - Well, Andy wrote, yeah, 'cause he wrote stuff

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.980
 about how to give good oral sex, I think,

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.620
 like the best oral sex in gratification,

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.460
 maybe that's where you know from.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.300
 - I'm not saying I have that copy,

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.260
 but yeah, I've definitely got the joke books.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.180
 - He invented the vibrating dildo.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.100
 - Got that, got that.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.300
 (laughing)

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.540
 - Okay, well, you can have a spin off Gershon Legman podcast,

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.460
 but yeah, cool guy.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.300
 - Wow.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.700
 The prodigy you just mentioned, Akira Yoshioaza,

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.980
 he does sound very interesting.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.540
 He pioneered wet folding.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.700
 Before that, I'm not sure wet folding was a technique.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.340
 - And can you explain what wet folding is?

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.660
 - Absolutely, wet folding is the main, I'd say,

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.140
 division in the origami world.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.060
 Wet folders dampen the paper

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.740
 so they can get the curves just right.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.540
 Dry folders, I don't need to explain.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.740
 Don't do the wetting.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.300
 And yeah, so Yoshioaza was the guy who--

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.140
 - Really?

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.780
 - He worked as an origami man from 1937 onwards,

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.940
 I think when he was very young.

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:53.780
 - Right.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.460
 - Yeah, and he eliminated cutting from the procedure.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.060
 So you used to cut the paper, I think,

00:47:59.060 --> 00:47:59.900
 before you were folding it.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.740
 - Okay.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.060
 - And that's another, again,

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.220
 you know, Fosbury Flop moment in the development of origami

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.500
 where, you know, you're not cutting things

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.820
 'cause that's like making a snowflake

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.420
 when you're a kid, you know, you fold it up

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.460
 and you can't-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.260
 - That feels like the anti-Fosbury Flop moment.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.780
 That's like you've banned the Fosbury Flop

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.540
 and you're back stuck with a scissor kick again.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.380
 (laughing)

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.700
 I run it because you're not allowed to scissor it.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.020
 - It's a reverse Fosbury.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:18.860
 (laughing)

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.540
 - It's a reverse Fosbury.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.780
 - Another very cool origami figure

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.420
 was this guy called Robert Lang.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.260
 Did you guys read by him?

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.860
 - How do you say he's an origami figure?

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.220
 Is that a human in the origami world

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.820
 or was he made of paper?

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.700
 - He's not made of paper, he is just into paper.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.540
 - Got it.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.580
 - And a bit like this guy, Andy, he was a physicist.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.660
 He worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.740
 and then he decided he preferred folding paper

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.380
 and he was this mass prodigy

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.700
 who was doing very well in physics

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.580
 and it was 2001, he finally decided to give it all up

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.060
 'cause it was taking up so much of his time

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.380
 folding paper things.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.620
 And he's been very useful with his origami.

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.540
 So for instance, airbags made based

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.580
 on origami principles now.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.300
 And that's because they went to Robert Lang

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.080
 and they said, look, we really like the way

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.700
 that you can fold something really small

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.580
 and then it can expand really big.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.260
 Like he was able to do that.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.660
 - On that note, in 2013, there was a company

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.940
 which announced it was inventing an origami condom

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.300
 for Bill Gates.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.620
 - For Bill Gates?

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.060
 (laughing)

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.940
 - As he got such an unusually shaped penis,

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.820
 he has to have a special condom made.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.780
 - Bill and Bill Gates Foundation is what I mean.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.020
 I was using it on his shorthand and I'm sorry.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.700
 I'm sorry, please don't sue.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.380
 (laughing)

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.740
 There was a designer called Danny Resnick

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.460
 and he had worked out an origami condom

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.700
 which apparently was much more comfortable to put on,

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.140
 fit on more easily and it opened up like an accordion.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.580
 - I can play the accordion a little bit.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.020
 And when you first open it up, it makes quite a weird noise.

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.340
 - I don't know if it wheezed as it was opened up.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.620
 Anyway, it never happened because Resnick himself

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.220
 was accused of fraud the next year

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.180
 and had to pay back the public fancy being granted.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.660
 So the world is still waiting for the origami condom.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.300
 - It would be great if it did play a tune as he wanted it.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.660
 - You can't get that little keyboard

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.460
 onto something that size, I don't think.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.340
 - It's good it's gonna sound,

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.540
 every time you have sex, it's gonna sound like a sea shanty.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.340
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.260
 - Soon will the weather bag come.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.100
 (laughing)

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.660
 - Well, I hope it is soon.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.240
 (upbeat music)

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.300
 Okay, that's it.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.300
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.620

 We'll see you then.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.060
 Goodbye.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.640
 (upbeat music)

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.220
 (upbeat music)

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.800
 (upbeat music)
