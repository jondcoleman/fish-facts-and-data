00:00:02,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, Fred Dan, Shriver is away today,"
00:00:05,00:00:07,but we have an absolutely cracking guest for you.
00:00:07,00:00:09,It's someone that I've wanted to get on the show
00:00:09,00:00:11,for ages and ages.
00:00:11,00:00:13,"Definitely one of the wittiest, funniest people"
00:00:13,00:00:15,working in Britain today.
00:00:15,00:00:16,"And in fact, for the last 20 years,"
00:00:16,00:00:19,it is the fantastic Miles Jupp.
00:00:19,00:00:20,We had such a great time with him.
00:00:20,00:00:22,So I hope you like the show.
00:00:22,00:00:24,And he has just done the first hint of a tour
00:00:24,00:00:27,"with his live show On Eye Bang,"
00:00:27,00:00:28,which was brilliantly reviewed.
00:00:28,00:00:30,"And for those of you listening in America,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"get excited, he's coming to you."
00:00:33,00:00:35,He will be going to New York in November.
00:00:35,00:00:37,Do look up the dates that he's playing there.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"You can go to his website, milesjupp.co.uk,"
00:00:40,00:00:41,or just look it up.
00:00:41,00:00:43,It's at the Soho Playhouse in New York.
00:00:43,00:00:45,And I'm pretty sure more live dates
00:00:45,00:00:47,"are very soon to be announced,"
00:00:47,00:00:49,both in the UK and America.
00:00:49,00:00:50,So keep your eyes peeled.
00:00:50,00:00:51,You definitely won't regret it.
00:00:51,00:00:53,"He is so, so funny."
00:00:53,00:00:56,And hope you enjoy this show as much as we did.
00:00:56,00:00:58,(upbeat music)
00:00:58,00:01:02,(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:09,00:01:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:01:14,00:01:16,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:16,00:01:19,from the QI offices in a whole boron.
00:01:19,00:01:21,"My name is Anna Toshinsky,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"and I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and Miles Jupp."
00:01:26,00:01:29,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:29,00:01:32,with our four favorite facts in the last seven days.
00:01:32,00:01:34,"In no particular order, here we go."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"Miles, what's your favorite fact?"
00:01:36,00:01:39,- My favorite fact from the last seven days is
00:01:39,00:01:42,people who get really lost usually don't travel
00:01:42,00:01:45,"more than a hundred meters from their starting point,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,regardless of how long they walk for.
00:01:48,00:01:49,- That is insane.
00:01:49,00:01:52,Is that stupid?
00:01:52,00:01:55,- It's partly an element of humans have a tendency
00:01:55,00:01:57,to walk in circles.
00:01:57,00:01:58,And there was a theory it was literally
00:01:58,00:02:00,because one leg is always slightly shorter than the other.
00:02:00,00:02:01,- That's what I thought it was.
00:02:01,00:02:02,"- That sort of would happen,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,"like an enormous, perfect circle."
00:02:04,00:02:05,"- Is that really what you thought, Andrew?"
00:02:05,00:02:07,'Cause I think that sounds ridiculous.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- I did think that, and I was told this when I was at school"
00:02:09,00:02:11,that if you ever get lost in the wilderness
00:02:11,00:02:14,to walk for five minutes in a straight line
00:02:14,00:02:16,and then turn around and walk backwards
00:02:16,00:02:18,for five minutes in a straight line
00:02:18,00:02:21,so that your one dodgy leg is on a different side of each way.
00:02:21,00:02:24,"- Oh, so literally, sorry, walk backwards,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,you're not backwards where you started.
00:02:26,00:02:29,- That's what I thought you meant.
00:02:29,00:02:31,"- No, walk backwards."
00:02:31,00:02:31,- That's good.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"- I went to quite a posh school,"
00:02:33,00:02:34,but we didn't have our own wilderness.
00:02:34,00:02:38,It sounds very extraordinary facility.
00:02:38,00:02:40,- That's what they call the graffiti covered
00:02:40,00:02:41,bit of tarmac up back.
00:02:41,00:02:44,- But it's not that.
00:02:44,00:02:45,"- It's not that, but it doesn't seem like people"
00:02:45,00:02:46,we really know.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"I mean, is there an idea that it might be evolutionary"
00:02:49,00:02:51,because it's safer to end up back where you started
00:02:51,00:02:54,"and, you know, it's a good homing instinct to have."
00:02:54,00:02:56,"- Yeah, that you would end up in the way that a drone now,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"if the battery fails, it gives itself just enough time,"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"doesn't it, to work back to where it was to launch from."
00:03:02,00:03:03,"It should do, I think,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,but occasionally you find old ones in rivers
00:03:05,00:03:07,"where, for instance, that technology sadly fails."
00:03:07,00:03:09,"- In the rivers near where I grew up,"
00:03:09,00:03:10,"you get shopping trolleys, not drones."
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- Oh yeah, shopping trolleys can't find their way back"
00:03:12,00:03:14,to where they're from.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- They do go around in circles, though."
00:03:16,00:03:19,"This is people who, I think they were blindfolded,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"weren't they, in this particular study."
00:03:21,00:03:23,"I mean, people have been documented to walk around"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"in circles so many times, but yeah,"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"this guy did this study in 2009, blindfolded them,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"and literally, they didn't travel any distance at all,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"not more than 100 meters, regardless."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"- In this experiment, were they on rough terrain,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,"or, as in, if I was blindfolded and in the woods,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"I probably wouldn't go more than 100 meters,"
00:03:39,00:03:41,"as in, I would feel my way quite carefully"
00:03:41,00:03:43,for the duration of the experiment.
00:03:43,00:03:44,"- What if it was a day long, and no,"
00:03:44,00:03:45,"it's not to do with terrain,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,the worst place is to be on a massive open field
00:03:47,00:03:50,"with no landmarks whatsoever. - That's really, yeah."
00:03:50,00:03:52,- And no sun to look at and no moon.
00:03:52,00:03:53,'Cause landmarks are such an important part
00:03:53,00:03:56,"in how we navigate, and in the same way"
00:03:56,00:03:59,"as how we tell time, you know, you're able to remember"
00:03:59,00:04:01,when things happen because you've got little signposts
00:04:01,00:04:02,"that, oh, the milk comes on Tuesday,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"and I know it was a day after that,"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"that I got my new trousers, or whatever it might be,"
00:04:07,00:04:08,but the same-- - The milkman had
00:04:08,00:04:10,"a terrible little rest of the day, didn't he?"
00:04:10,00:04:11,- The trouser man has been.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- Yeah, you leave out the old trousers, don't you?"
00:04:13,00:04:14,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:14,00:04:16,But you'd need those sort of landmarks.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"I read a very good book about wayfaring by a man called,"
00:04:19,00:04:22,"he's called Michael Bond, but he's not that Michael Bond,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,but it was that thing where things look so similar
00:04:25,00:04:27,that you can get lost incredibly easily
00:04:27,00:04:29,"because there's nothing to tell it apart,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,"and there were incidents in that,"
00:04:31,00:04:32,"so people at the Appalachian Trail,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,"they wander off the path to go and have a piss,"
00:04:34,00:04:37,"and then take your rucksack off, you know,"
00:04:37,00:04:38,presumably if you wear a heavy rucksack every day
00:04:38,00:04:40,"and you take it off, you've got an absolutely set way"
00:04:40,00:04:41,"of doing it, but if you're sort of quite new to it,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"or whatever, you can't remember that I turned left"
00:04:43,00:04:45,"as I took it off, and then when you go to put it back on,"
00:04:45,00:04:47,"you think, is it facing towards the path, is it not?"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"And people are found dead, you know,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"just tens of yards away from where they left the park,"
00:04:52,00:04:53,"because they cannot find the way,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,"but I think the distance thing is about panic as well,"
00:04:55,00:04:58,"if you're feeling lost, and you don't find where you need"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"to get to within a hundred meters,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"and already you were uncertain where you were, for instance,"
00:05:02,00:05:05,"and I imagine you think I'd better go back to where I was,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,so I think there's a fear element to it.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"You've got to be very foolhardy to go,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,I'm just going to keep going in that way.
00:05:10,00:05:12,- But I think we really can't walk straight.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"I mean, that's, it's just really impossible"
00:05:14,00:05:16,"for humans to walk straight without landmarks,"
00:05:16,00:05:19,"but I think you're right, the panic thing which sets in"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"means that we also over adjust,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"so you think you're walking straight,"
00:05:23,00:05:24,"but I think instinctively you think,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"oh, I must have wobbled a bit there,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,because your brain is constantly making little mistakes
00:05:28,00:05:31,"of perception, it thinks you just wobbled a bit,"
00:05:31,00:05:31,you better rewobble.
00:05:31,00:05:33,- And then you sit down to measure your legs
00:05:33,00:05:35,before you do it. (laughing)
00:05:35,00:05:37,- There's an interesting thing about this
00:05:37,00:05:38,with virtual reality.
00:05:38,00:05:42,"So because we can't really walk in a straight line,"
00:05:42,00:05:45,"if you're in a VR situation, so you've got your goggles on,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"and you're walking towards something,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,the VR can slightly change the horizon
00:05:50,00:05:52,and change the things around you
00:05:52,00:05:54,that manipulates you into walking in a circle
00:05:54,00:05:56,when you think you're walking in a straight line.
00:05:56,00:05:59,And what they can do is they can get someone in a VR
00:05:59,00:06:01,who thinks they're walking in a straight line forever
00:06:01,00:06:03,"for miles and miles and miles and miles,"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"but you can do that in a room that's just 44 meters wide,"
00:06:07,00:06:11,"because it manipulates you to go into a 44 meter circle,"
00:06:11,00:06:13,where you think you're going straight the whole time.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"- That must be frightening, because you know,"
00:06:14,00:06:15,you've seen before they put the headset on
00:06:15,00:06:18,that you're in a small room that's only 44 meters wide.
00:06:18,00:06:21,"- Yeah, you've both of them before they go in the room."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"You say, ""Right, we're about to go onto the Savannah."""
00:06:23,00:06:25,"So good luck out there, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:25,00:06:26,- But it is really interesting.
00:06:26,00:06:27,- It's amazing.
00:06:27,00:06:30,- And it just means that for now you can have video games
00:06:30,00:06:33,"where the whole area goes on forever,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,but you don't need a forever room.
00:06:35,00:06:37,"- That's useful, we'll save costs."
00:06:37,00:06:38,"- So because of the realness,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"if I don't have one, but a friend of mine has a VR headset,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"and I insisted that he bought a cricket game for it,"
00:06:44,00:06:47,"and then I was just, money well spent, his money,"
00:06:47,00:06:48,but nevertheless well spent.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"And although you've just gone into the city,"
00:06:50,00:06:50,"and you know where everything is,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,"within a while you're just in this different world,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,"and it's not even very realistic,"
00:06:54,00:06:57,"because the visual cues, and you've got the ones in your ears,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,you're so immersed in it that within seven minutes
00:06:59,00:07:01,you have sort of collided with a radiator
00:07:01,00:07:02,"or whatever it might be,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,"because it's hard to imagine that you're not where you are,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,"and to hold in your head those things that, you know,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"you might signpost them before you put the goggles on,"
00:07:10,00:07:11,"but that's gone, that information."
00:07:11,00:07:13,"- But we've played that, haven't we, Anna?"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"- Oh yeah, we did play a remote game."
00:07:15,00:07:16,- Was that the oval?
00:07:16,00:07:17,- Yes.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"- Well, what, you think it was oval?"
00:07:18,00:07:20,"Actually, it was a 44 meter circle."
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- Yeah, in the savannah."
00:07:22,00:07:24,(laughing)
00:07:24,00:07:26,- Have you guys heard of Tristan Goole?
00:07:26,00:07:27,- Nope.
00:07:27,00:07:27,- Sounds fun.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- I don't remember that name, I think."
00:07:29,00:07:30,- He's terrific.
00:07:30,00:07:34,So he's the only living person to have both solo flown
00:07:34,00:07:36,and solo sailed across the Atlantic.
00:07:36,00:07:40,"So he's a very good explorer and adventurer and navigator,"
00:07:40,00:07:41,but he writes a lot of books
00:07:41,00:07:43,"about how you can tell your surroundings from,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,you just look at your surroundings
00:07:45,00:07:46,and you can tell where you are.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"But he has these amazing tips, which I just,"
00:07:48,00:07:51,if you're out in the wilderness listening to this podcast
00:07:51,00:07:55,"and you're lost, snails need lots of calcium carbonate"
00:07:55,00:07:56,to build their shells.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"So if you see any away from a pond,"
00:07:59,00:08:02,that's a sign that you're on a chalky landscape.
00:08:02,00:08:03,- Is that helpful?
00:08:03,00:08:04,- I might have just saved someone's life.
00:08:04,00:08:07,- Did they not also need moisture snails?
00:08:07,00:08:08,- Yeah.
00:08:08,00:08:09,- So why are they going so far away from this pond?
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- Oh, maybe some water's gathered in a leaf."
00:08:11,00:08:13,I don't know all the other...
00:08:13,00:08:15,- You've got to sort of have a geological map
00:08:15,00:08:17,"in your head, haven't you, for the chalky bits."
00:08:17,00:08:19,- You do have to remember which bits of the country
00:08:19,00:08:20,"are chalky. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:20,00:08:23,"I don't know where I am, but gosh, it's chalky."
00:08:23,00:08:25,Is that the same as we've found?
00:08:25,00:08:27,"- Yeah, it's doors that have a lot of chalky."
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- Hello, something emergency services."
00:08:29,00:08:30,"I couldn't tell you where it is,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,but it is undoubtedly chalky.
00:08:33,00:08:34,I know because there are snails.
00:08:34,00:08:36,Thank you.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"Yes, I'll hold."
00:08:37,00:08:39,(laughing)
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- Okay, fair point."
00:08:41,00:08:43,"Well, he can identify a bonfire"
00:08:43,00:08:44,if there was a bonfire somewhere years ago
00:08:44,00:08:47,based only on the foliage that's grown around it since then.
00:08:47,00:08:48,- Again.
00:08:48,00:08:49,- Okay.
00:08:49,00:08:50,(laughing)
00:08:50,00:08:53,- That's the whole country every Guy Fawkes day.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- I think he's terrific, I love him."
00:08:55,00:08:57,"- On going in circles, Mark Twain had a nice story"
00:08:57,00:09:00,"in his, he wrote a travel log called Roughing It."
00:09:00,00:09:03,"And he had a nice story of how he went,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,they headed out in a snowstorm.
00:09:05,00:09:06,They had to get somewhere.
00:09:06,00:09:07,And there was one man in their crew
00:09:07,00:09:09,who was a real cocky guy called Olandorf
00:09:09,00:09:12,who bragged about how he had natural navigation skills.
00:09:12,00:09:13,They didn't need a map.
00:09:13,00:09:15,He had inbuilt sense of direction.
00:09:15,00:09:16,And they were all on horseback
00:09:16,00:09:19,and they wandered for about almost an hour on horseback.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"And then they found some fresh tracks and thought,"
00:09:21,00:09:24,"brilliant, well, they'll be headed towards the,"
00:09:24,00:09:26,the place we're headed or follow them.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"And then they kept,"
00:09:27,00:09:28,they kept meeting more and more people
00:09:28,00:09:31,joining the party of fresh tracks every half an hour.
00:09:31,00:09:33,And they wanted for two or three hours
00:09:33,00:09:34,"before someone said,"
00:09:34,00:09:39,"""You are so Olandorf, these are our bloody footprints."""
00:09:39,00:09:42,- If you've been walking in the savannah for a long time
00:09:42,00:09:43,"and it's sunny,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,then you can tell which way you're going
00:09:45,00:09:46,by which side your sunburn's on.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"Oh, that's, yeah."
00:09:48,00:09:49,"In the Northern Hemisphere,"
00:09:49,00:09:52,if you're more sunburn on the left side of your face
00:09:52,00:09:55,"or your left arms, you're probably going westward"
00:09:55,00:09:57,"because the sun's in the,"
00:09:57,00:09:58,"- Oh, in the south."
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:01,- That's useful.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- You can also look at where the sun is, right?"
00:10:02,00:10:04,"- You can't look at the sun, of course."
00:10:04,00:10:05,- You shouldn't go blind.
00:10:05,00:10:06,"- Of course, don't look at the sun."
00:10:06,00:10:08,But I think that's how we instinctively--
00:10:08,00:10:09,- So which side your blind are on?
00:10:09,00:10:10,(all laughing)
00:10:10,00:10:13,"You know, you feel sort of coming at it from an angle."
00:10:13,00:10:14,- Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"- But it's daytime, so you can't use the North Star."
00:10:16,00:10:17,- That's true.
00:10:17,00:10:20,- I didn't realise why the North Star is the North Star.
00:10:20,00:10:23,As in why it's useful for navigation.
00:10:23,00:10:24,Should it come out earliest?
00:10:24,00:10:26,"It's just, it's a fixed star."
00:10:26,00:10:27,So all the other stars revolve around it.
00:10:27,00:10:28,And that's because it's sort of
00:10:28,00:10:30,above the North Pole as it were.
00:10:30,00:10:32,"So it moves a tiny fraction in the sky,"
00:10:32,00:10:32,but really it doesn't.
00:10:32,00:10:33,I just didn't know that.
00:10:33,00:10:34,I never did my D.O.E.V.
00:10:34,00:10:36,So it's aligned with the Earth's axis.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"So over the course of the night, it stays still,"
00:10:38,00:10:39,which is very helpful.
00:10:39,00:10:41,- Do you know who else uses the stars to navigate?
00:10:41,00:10:43,Dung Beetles.
00:10:43,00:10:44,- Oh yeah.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:48,And they found this out by taking them to a planetarium.
00:10:48,00:10:50,(all laughing)
00:10:50,00:10:53,This was scientists at Lund University.
00:10:53,00:10:55,They took some dung beetles to a planetarium
00:10:55,00:10:57,and showed them the Milky Way
00:10:57,00:10:59,and saw which way they went.
00:10:59,00:11:01,And then they covered up the Milky Way
00:11:01,00:11:03,and saw they went in different wild directions.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"And when the planetarium turned into Madam's Swords,"
00:11:05,00:11:09,presumably they were completely lost.
00:11:09,00:11:10,I thought I was going home.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"Now I'm heading towards sort of Dr. Crippin,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,"or Prince William, or--"
00:11:13,00:11:14,- Or Lord of Medehasenborough.
00:11:14,00:11:15,- Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:17,(all laughing)
00:11:17,00:11:19,- Did you guys know you can all echolocate?
00:11:19,00:11:20,Almost certainly.
00:11:20,00:11:22,Most of our listeners can echolocate.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"I mean, like bats can."
00:11:23,00:11:26,- That's how I get here from the tube every time we record.
00:11:26,00:11:26,- Yeah.
00:11:26,00:11:28,- Possibly blindfold on and start screaming.
00:11:28,00:11:29,(laughing)
00:11:29,00:11:31,So you're listening for the echo
00:11:31,00:11:32,and that tells you how to move.
00:11:32,00:11:36,- It tells you how to navigate and where you are.
00:11:36,00:11:38,And there have been a few studies into this.
00:11:38,00:11:40,But I think the first one was in the 1940s
00:11:40,00:11:43,and it blindfolded a few people
00:11:43,00:11:45,and it told them to walk towards a wall
00:11:45,00:11:46,and stop just before the wall.
00:11:46,00:11:47,And they did it.
00:11:47,00:11:51,But then when they carpeted the floor
00:11:51,00:11:52,and then they walked
00:11:52,00:11:54,"and they weren't making footstep noises anymore,"
00:11:54,00:11:56,they all walked into the wall.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"And so it turns out we just,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,and naturally I've tried this myself
00:11:59,00:12:02,and I think I do need a few minutes more practice.
00:12:02,00:12:03,"- Come on, let's clear the furniture."
00:12:03,00:12:06,"Let's see how this goes, yeah."
00:12:06,00:12:06,- But isn't that amazing?
00:12:06,00:12:07,And we can all do it.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"And humans can actually be taught to be quite good,"
00:12:09,00:12:09,quite fast.
00:12:09,00:12:10,- What do you hear?
00:12:10,00:12:12,Are you hearing things or are you sensing air pressure?
00:12:12,00:12:13,- You're hearing things.
00:12:13,00:12:16,So you're hearing the slight difference in sound echoes.
00:12:16,00:12:18,You're hearing the sound bouncing back
00:12:18,00:12:19,from your footsteps off the wall.
00:12:19,00:12:20,And we can tell amazing things.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"Like in studies, they found that people can tell the shape"
00:12:23,00:12:24,of something they're going towards.
00:12:24,00:12:26,So they'll put a triangle in front of them
00:12:26,00:12:29,"and they'll say, you know, this is, yeah."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"- If you imagine yourself at one end, say, of a subway"
00:12:31,00:12:34,and you're spun around and you've got a blindfold on.
00:12:34,00:12:36,So already it's quite terrifying.
00:12:36,00:12:39,"But don't worry, it's an experiment you're part of."
00:12:39,00:12:41,But you mentioned in a situation like that
00:12:41,00:12:42,"where you've got hard, concrete walls or whatever,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"you would back yourself, wouldn't you?"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"To work out, right, left to your own devices."
00:12:46,00:12:48,Which direction is the other end of the subway in?
00:12:48,00:12:49,Where are the walls and whatever?
00:12:49,00:12:51,"Because you'd be able to hear the, you know, the echoes"
00:12:51,00:12:53,and where things were bouncing back from.
00:12:53,00:12:54,I'm sure you'd back yourself.
00:12:54,00:12:56,- Would you not press your back yourself?
00:12:56,00:12:58,"I mean, we should be backing ourselves."
00:12:58,00:12:59,- I'm not sure.
00:12:59,00:13:00,It depends on the stakes really.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"- But the difference, but if you've got walled,"
00:13:03,00:13:04,say two feet either side of you
00:13:04,00:13:05,and then the other wall isn't there
00:13:05,00:13:07,for sort of another 40 meters.
00:13:07,00:13:08,- Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- But then it's also just the ears, like the eyes"
00:13:10,00:13:11,"and the nostrils, isn't it?"
00:13:11,00:13:13,We're using the input from each of those
00:13:13,00:13:16,to sort of work out the information.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"Like our vision isn't real, is it?"
00:13:18,00:13:19,That sounds mad.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"What I mean is what we see, the image that we see"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"is that's constructed in our brain, isn't it?"
00:13:23,00:13:25,From the information from the two different eyes
00:13:25,00:13:26,"and the same way with nostrils,"
00:13:26,00:13:28,you could view a following smell
00:13:28,00:13:30,and you could think that's more of that.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"- Yeah, triangulation, things like that."
00:13:31,00:13:33,- Yeah.
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Can I tell you one more thing about getting lost?
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Yeah, go for it, yes."
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- This is in 2011, a computer scientist"
00:13:37,00:13:41,"called Ben Kerman invented Get Lost Bot, okay?"
00:13:41,00:13:42,And this was a technology
00:13:42,00:13:45,which tracks your movements every day.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"And if you are too predictable,"
00:13:47,00:13:48,it sends you somewhere new.
00:13:48,00:13:52,"So if you have the same lunch at the same cafe every day,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,it will direct you to a different cafe.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- That's clever.
00:13:55,00:13:58,I read that like if someone had your mobile phone
00:13:58,00:13:59,"and got all the data off it,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,they'd be able to tell where you are
00:14:01,00:14:05,and any time of any day to within like a 90% accuracy.
00:14:05,00:14:06,- 'Cause we're doing the same routes.
00:14:06,00:14:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- So exactly, and this thing was not popular, by the way."
00:14:09,00:14:11,"- No, not probably with office bosses."
00:14:11,00:14:14,"It's going, ""Where have all my staff gone?"""
00:14:14,00:14:15,"- When you say if someone gets hold of your phone,"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"I mean, they haven't got hold of our phones."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- Yeah, no, absolutely."
00:14:19,00:14:22,- They know where we are and what we're doing now or whatever.
00:14:22,00:14:23,- It didn't work very well Get Lost Bot
00:14:23,00:14:24,"because one user found the app,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,had noticed him going to church every Sunday
00:14:26,00:14:28,and told him to visit a nearby mosque instead.
00:14:28,00:14:29,(laughing)
00:14:29,00:14:30,- That's very clever.
00:14:30,00:14:32,- It's going to be open on a Sunday.
00:14:32,00:14:33,And other issues.
00:14:33,00:14:35,(laughing)
00:14:35,00:14:38,(upbeat music)
00:14:38,00:14:43,"- All right, there's time for fact number two"
00:14:43,00:14:45,and that is Andy's fact.
00:14:45,00:14:48,- My fact is that one of the fiercest critics
00:14:48,00:14:50,of poet Alexander Pope was a writer
00:14:50,00:14:52,called Esdras Barnivilt.
00:14:52,00:14:53,This was a secret identity
00:14:53,00:14:56,and the real person criticising Alexander Pope
00:14:56,00:14:59,was Alexander Pope.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- Wow, what a twist."
00:15:00,00:15:02,- The last person you'd expect.
00:15:02,00:15:03,- Yeah.
00:15:03,00:15:06,- He wrote a full thing slacking off his major work.
00:15:06,00:15:08,- Was he doing it so why?
00:15:08,00:15:09,Was he like being self-hating
00:15:09,00:15:12,or was he trying to get ahead of his critics maybe?
00:15:12,00:15:13,- I don't think he was.
00:15:13,00:15:16,I think a lot of this stuff was done for fun
00:15:16,00:15:18,and loads of stuff was anonymous at the time.
00:15:18,00:15:21,So it wasn't mad to have a lot of stuff coming out.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"So it was literally on the day that his epic poem,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,"which is called The Rape of the Lock,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,is about a society woman who has a lock of her hair grabbed.
00:15:28,00:15:32,"So it's based on the Iliad and the Odyssey, but it's fun."
00:15:32,00:15:34,(all laughing)
00:15:34,00:15:35,- More fun.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"- More fun, yeah, yeah."
00:15:36,00:15:38,"But he wrote, on the day it was published,"
00:15:38,00:15:42,"he brought out a key to the lock under this fake name,"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"Esdras Barnivilt, and he wrote to Pope."
00:15:45,00:15:47,He addressed Pope directly himself
00:15:47,00:15:49,and said he's writing an antidote against the poison
00:15:49,00:15:52,which has been so artfully distilled through your quill.
00:15:52,00:15:53,- So what did he do?
00:15:53,00:15:54,Like say this bit's shit?
00:15:54,00:15:56,How hard did he say it would have been better
00:15:56,00:15:57,if you'd done it this way?
00:15:57,00:15:59,- I think he was advising a bit about the meaning of it
00:15:59,00:16:01,and maybe throwing in some other games
00:16:01,00:16:02,and things along the way.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"I mean, it was just a fun thing to do."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"And he did this a second time, actually."
00:16:06,00:16:09,"So in 1735, there was a publisher who'd brought out"
00:16:09,00:16:11,an edition of Pope's letters.
00:16:11,00:16:13,Apparently his unauthorized letters were being published.
00:16:13,00:16:16,Imagine just someone publishing your WhatsApps
00:16:16,00:16:18,"like full, just nightmare."
00:16:18,00:16:22,"And this publisher was called Edmund Curle, with two L's."
00:16:22,00:16:23,- How many are?
00:16:23,00:16:25,(all laughing)
00:16:25,00:16:29,- It's so weird that you stress the R and not the L.
00:16:29,00:16:30,(all laughing)
00:16:30,00:16:32,- But this was not true.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Pope had collected his own letters.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"He'd edited them very carefully,"
00:16:35,00:16:38,then arranged for Curle to get hold of them.
00:16:38,00:16:39,But he had instigated it.
00:16:39,00:16:40,And then he had them seized.
00:16:40,00:16:42,They were actually fake letters.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Then two years later, he releases his actual letters."
00:16:44,00:16:46,All sorts of just horse play going on.
00:16:46,00:16:47,- So they're confusing games.
00:16:47,00:16:48,What's he playing out there?
00:16:48,00:16:50,And wasn't this thing there that he had a plan
00:16:50,00:16:52,that some of those letters contained
00:16:52,00:16:54,some correspondence with various members of parliament
00:16:54,00:16:57,or the nobility where it was actually legal
00:16:57,00:17:00,to expose them 'cause they're of a certain status.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"So he thought, oh, good Curle will be seized"
00:17:02,00:17:05,"by the authorities, which he sort of was."
00:17:05,00:17:06,But then no one cared.
00:17:06,00:17:07,- But then he fell out with Curle
00:17:07,00:17:10,"'cause Curle had now thought, oh, now this is cool."
00:17:10,00:17:11,I can just do all the letters I want.
00:17:11,00:17:13,So he got a load of other letters.
00:17:13,00:17:17,Ones that he didn't want anyone to see and publish those.
00:17:17,00:17:19,"And so Pope met him at a pub, the Swantaband,"
00:17:19,00:17:22,and gave him an emetic to cause him
00:17:22,00:17:24,to go into convulsions of vomiting.
00:17:24,00:17:27,- And that's why the toilet's still blocked in that.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"- And then Pope wrote some pamphlets about that,"
00:17:30,00:17:31,about his vomiting.
00:17:31,00:17:33,And so they really fell out those two.
00:17:33,00:17:36,- But is it done for fun or is it sinister?
00:17:36,00:17:37,- I think it's for fun.
00:17:37,00:17:40,- But it depends whether your Edmund Curle
00:17:40,00:17:42,will be giving an emetic in the pub.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:43,00:17:45,Having a spasm in a pub toilet turns.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"You think, this has gone beyond banter."
00:17:47,00:17:47,- Yes.
00:17:48,00:17:50,- This is perfectly harmless.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Just lashing lads, didn't you do that?"
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:53,I don't know.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"I mean, he was a really, really funny guy."
00:17:55,00:17:56,He was strange.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"He was called the wasp of Twickenham, was his nickname."
00:17:59,00:18:00,- I think he was quite cruel.
00:18:00,00:18:02,- He had to just turn up a pic next to him.
00:18:02,00:18:06,"- But yeah, even people who liked him."
00:18:06,00:18:09,"I think Virginia Woolf's dad, Leslie,"
00:18:09,00:18:10,wrote a biography of him.
00:18:10,00:18:13,"And even he said, look, I like his writing."
00:18:13,00:18:13,It's very funny.
00:18:13,00:18:14,It's very clever.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"And mostly, by the way, we should say he was famous"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"for his translation, his serious translations"
00:18:18,00:18:21,of the Iliad and the Odyssey at the time.
00:18:21,00:18:21,"He said, I like his writing,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"but still, morally, it's a bit indefensible"
00:18:23,00:18:26,to like this guy 'cause he's so horrible about everyone.
00:18:26,00:18:30,He called him a monkey pouring boiling oil on his victims.
00:18:30,00:18:32,- That's a good reason for him to criticise himself
00:18:32,00:18:34,"first, essentially, isn't it?"
00:18:34,00:18:37,So he's one of the people who are in the sights
00:18:37,00:18:38,of this sort of mystery critic.
00:18:38,00:18:39,"And then he goes, well, it can't be me."
00:18:39,00:18:40,He's had a go at me.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"And then he can really, you know, go at people."
00:18:42,00:18:44,So I suppose that's the mistake.
00:18:44,00:18:47,Is it that more contemporaneous sock puppets have made
00:18:47,00:18:50,is to not turn the gun on themselves first?
00:18:50,00:18:52,- He didn't do all his other criticism.
00:18:52,00:18:54,The mistake he actually made was not criticising everyone
00:18:54,00:18:57,"under the pseudonym, sadly, which would have been safer."
00:18:57,00:18:59,- All of his other criticism was under his own name.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"- Was under his name, I like the sound of both."
00:19:01,00:19:03,It's very confusing because there was a big thing
00:19:03,00:19:05,between Protestants and Catholics at the time.
00:19:05,00:19:08,So this is the end of the 18th century.
00:19:08,00:19:09,William and Mary had come in.
00:19:09,00:19:10,They'd swept the Catholics away.
00:19:10,00:19:12,Pope was a Catholic.
00:19:12,00:19:13,And so there was a lot of criticism of his work
00:19:13,00:19:15,for being too popish.
00:19:15,00:19:17,But that is quite confusing.
00:19:17,00:19:21,- He wasn't allowed to go to university.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"- No, no."
00:19:22,00:19:23,- No positions of trust or power.
00:19:23,00:19:24,So what do you do?
00:19:24,00:19:25,"- The term wasp then that would be not,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,he wouldn't refer to himself as that.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"Nowadays you might label yourself waspish, wouldn't you?"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- Yeah, I reckon he would have labelled himself."
00:19:32,00:19:33,I think he quite loves things.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- But I think it was that other people called him that
00:19:34,00:19:37,because he had an illness called Pots disease.
00:19:37,00:19:40,He was only four foot six.
00:19:40,00:19:43,And he found it very difficult to do anything basically.
00:19:43,00:19:45,And I think that probably is what slightly made him
00:19:45,00:19:46,an angry little man.
00:19:46,00:19:48,- He was four foot six which made it difficult for him
00:19:48,00:19:49,to do anything or he was four foot six.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"- No, he was also, yeah, like he had lung problems,"
00:19:52,00:19:53,heart problems.
00:19:53,00:19:56,He had problems walking and standing up for long periods
00:19:56,00:19:57,and stuff like that.
00:19:57,00:19:59,- There was a theory that his growth was restricted
00:19:59,00:20:01,because of his nurse's milk.
00:20:01,00:20:02,- I believe that is true.
00:20:02,00:20:06,'Cause it contained a bacteria called myobacterium tuberculosis.
00:20:06,00:20:08,- It doesn't sound good.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"- No, it doesn't."
00:20:09,00:20:11,(laughing)
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- Yeah, and it causes this thing."
00:20:13,00:20:15,And he was worried about it.
00:20:15,00:20:18,And he wrote to Lady Mary Wartley Montague
00:20:18,00:20:21,who was someone who he really fancied for most of his life
00:20:21,00:20:24,saying that he imagined a place where women best like
00:20:24,00:20:26,the ugliest fellows and look upon deformities
00:20:26,00:20:29,as a signature as a divine favor.
00:20:29,00:20:30,"So he was like really,"
00:20:30,00:20:33,he knew that he was not an attractive man.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"- Yeah, be hard not to know 'cause you clearly aren't."
00:20:35,00:20:38,"And then everyone's telling you you're hideous as well, so."
00:20:38,00:20:39,- But you're also slacking them off in print.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"- Yeah, and you're slacking yourself off in print."
00:20:42,00:20:43,"And it's very, and it's often should be limited,"
00:20:43,00:20:45,nowadays you could join an app that was specifically
00:20:45,00:20:47,sort of dating app for people who are short
00:20:47,00:20:51,and have had odd milk and he would be besieged
00:20:51,00:20:53,with offers and opportunities.
00:20:53,00:20:57,"- You do wonder if he might actually in this day and age be,"
00:20:57,00:21:00,"this is a kind of my facile thing people say on radio,"
00:21:00,00:21:02,"isn't it, be a meninist, what are they?"
00:21:02,00:21:03,You know. - In cell?
00:21:03,00:21:05,"- An incel, yes."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"Well, he's small, he's got some confidence issues"
00:21:07,00:21:08,and he hates everyone.
00:21:08,00:21:09,His podcast would have been terrific.
00:21:09,00:21:10,We do know that.
00:21:10,00:21:11,"- Very good, wouldn't it?"
00:21:11,00:21:12,"- Oh, yeah."
00:21:12,00:21:13,- Slacking everyone off.
00:21:13,00:21:15,- The podcast is really good.
00:21:15,00:21:17,He would never have called himself a wasp
00:21:17,00:21:20,because that means white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"- Yes. - Oh, of course, yes, yes."
00:21:22,00:21:24,- He was white Anglo-Saxon Catholic.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:21:25,00:21:28,"- The nickname unpickable, can you already forgotten it,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"the nickname, the name he gave himself"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"for writing criticism. - Oh, Esdras Barnveld."
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- Oh, yeah."
00:21:33,00:21:34,- Esdras Barnveld.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"- Stupid idea, I haven't looked up."
00:21:35,00:21:36,- I don't know if it's an acronym or a--
00:21:36,00:21:37,- Clues or anything about it.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"- Well, Esdras looks like cod latin, doesn't it?"
00:21:40,00:21:41,Do you know what I mean?
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- It does a bit. - It's like, yeah."
00:21:42,00:21:44,- But it doesn't quite work.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"- Thanks, Miles, I'm gonna spend the rest of this fact."
00:21:45,00:21:48,Just reel in the message over and over and over.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"- No, you're right, I should have--"
00:21:49,00:21:51,- Could be an anagram or something.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"- I'm just gonna write out the,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,I'm just gonna write a little spider map of the letters now.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"- Just while you two are doing that,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,I was gonna mention just to Jane something about it.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"- Boris Dippelman, I think it's, yeah."
00:22:00,00:22:01,- You think that I'm not getting involved
00:22:01,00:22:03,with this anagram or stuff?
00:22:03,00:22:04,- Sick. - You've known me
00:22:04,00:22:05,for 12 years and-- - I'm not gonna get
00:22:05,00:22:06,"involved in it, you can talk to me."
00:22:06,00:22:09,"- Thank you, I really appreciate that."
00:22:09,00:22:12,"This lady, Mary Montague, he fancied her."
00:22:12,00:22:13,She didn't fancy him.
00:22:13,00:22:16,Quite an awkward moment where he made
00:22:16,00:22:17,"very, very passionate love to her"
00:22:17,00:22:20,"in the old fashioned sense, he didn't, you know--"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"- Was it wooing? - Wooing, yes."
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- Propositioning, yeah."
00:22:23,00:22:28,- And she said that it was like a very awkward moment.
00:22:28,00:22:31,He'd chosen a socially stupid moment to do it.
00:22:31,00:22:32,And-- - She was basically convulsing
00:22:32,00:22:35,in her pet toilet. (both laughing)
00:22:35,00:22:37,- Yes.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- She said that he did it so passionately
00:22:38,00:22:40,that in spite of her utmost endeavors to be angry
00:22:40,00:22:43,"and look grave, she had an immediate fit of laughter."
00:22:43,00:22:45,"So she burst out laughing in his face,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,so then they became sworn enemies
00:22:47,00:22:49,'cause he was quite upset.
00:22:49,00:22:50,But the amazing thing about her is
00:22:50,00:22:52,she invented the smallpox vaccine.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"And I think, I'm surprised we ever mentioned her before,"
00:22:54,00:22:54,actually. - Yeah.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"She was part of that, wasn't she?"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- A few people would claim,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,Jenna was there as well at the time in the area.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"She was the one who first, she went to Turkey"
00:23:03,00:23:05,'cause her husband was an ambassador.
00:23:05,00:23:08,And she noticed that the locals in Turkey
00:23:08,00:23:11,visited this lady who injected them
00:23:11,00:23:13,with little bits of smallpox
00:23:13,00:23:14,and the children seemed not to get it.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"And so she was the first person who said,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"""Right, I'm gonna get my kid exposed"
00:23:18,00:23:20,"""to these weird smallpox rubbings."""
00:23:20,00:23:21,- The really fun thing about that
00:23:21,00:23:26,is that he then started writing horrible poems about her
00:23:26,00:23:29,"and saying, like, making jokes about smallpox"
00:23:29,00:23:31,and the other kind of pox like venereal disease
00:23:31,00:23:34,"and saying that she, you know, she had syphilis or whatever."
00:23:34,00:23:35,- Who did he?
00:23:35,00:23:37,- And she got really upset about it.
00:23:37,00:23:38,And so what did she do?
00:23:38,00:23:41,"She went to Sir Robert Walpole, the prime minister,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,and asked him to have a word.
00:23:43,00:23:44,- Terrific.
00:23:44,00:23:46,- We can all do that with our enemies.
00:23:46,00:23:47,- I know.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"But yeah, he really fancied Lady Murray."
00:23:49,00:23:50,- Yes.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"- Whenever he was with her,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,he would start talking in over elaborate puns.
00:23:54,00:23:56,"- Oh, oh, Alexander."
00:23:56,00:23:59,You're already fighting some considerable disadvantages
00:23:59,00:24:00,in the romance game.
00:24:00,00:24:02,Don't do the elaborate puns.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- I think it might work for some women.
00:24:03,00:24:06,"- James, you're..."
00:24:06,00:24:08,"- James, you married you in spite of that."
00:24:08,00:24:10,(laughing)
00:24:10,00:24:14,(upbeat music)
00:24:14,00:24:18,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,and that's my fact.
00:24:20,00:24:22,My fact this week is that the first person
00:24:22,00:24:24,to map the functions of the brain
00:24:24,00:24:26,did so by literally sticking labels
00:24:26,00:24:29,to different bits of it on a living person.
00:24:29,00:24:31,- Sticky labels?
00:24:31,00:24:32,"- Yeah, they look like little post-its."
00:24:32,00:24:34,And I read the study and I couldn't find out
00:24:34,00:24:35,exactly what they were made of.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"- It doesn't feel like, 'cause they must have glue on them."
00:24:37,00:24:38,"- Yeah, I think that..."
00:24:38,00:24:39,- Doesn't feel very healthy for a brain.
00:24:39,00:24:42,- And also to have had a large chunk of their skull...
00:24:42,00:24:43,- Oh yeah.
00:24:43,00:24:44,"- Yes, no, also."
00:24:44,00:24:45,"- I mean, that struck me first."
00:24:45,00:24:47,- Awesome.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"- It's temporary, isn't it?"
00:24:48,00:24:48,- Yeah.
00:24:48,00:24:49,- Temporal.
00:24:49,00:24:50,- It grows back.
00:24:50,00:24:52,(laughing)
00:24:52,00:24:53,- It's like earthworms.
00:24:53,00:24:56,You just wear a cap for the rest of your life.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"This was a Canadian neurosurgeon called Wilder Penfield,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,and he was the first person to do that thing
00:25:01,00:25:03,"that you might have seen in Hannibal,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"but also in brain surgery,"
00:25:05,00:25:06,"which is safe if you do it right,"
00:25:06,00:25:10,where you can remove someone's scalp while they're awake
00:25:10,00:25:11,and perform brain surgery on them.
00:25:11,00:25:14,And he was trying to remove bits of brain
00:25:14,00:25:16,that caused epileptic seizures
00:25:16,00:25:18,"on people who couldn't be cured any other way,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,but without damaging any other bits of the brain.
00:25:20,00:25:22,"And so he got a little electrode,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"stimulates lots of bits of the brain,"
00:25:24,00:25:26,and then writes down exactly what those bits do.
00:25:26,00:25:28,"So he, you know, poke a bit,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,"and then he'd write something like,"
00:25:30,00:25:31,"""Twitching of the left arm,"""
00:25:31,00:25:34,"or, ""Hmm, numbness of right side of the tongue,"""
00:25:34,00:25:35,and he can ask them.
00:25:35,00:25:36,- Evacuation of the bells.
00:25:36,00:25:38,(laughing)
00:25:38,00:25:39,- Repeated cries of help.
00:25:39,00:25:41,(laughing)
00:25:41,00:25:43,- And so he'd put numbered labels
00:25:43,00:25:44,"and lettered labels on each bit,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"and he was basically the person who created the map,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,"the thing that mapped the brain onto the body,"
00:25:49,00:25:50,the homunculus.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"So he drew, in his study,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,"once he performed all these experiments,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"a picture that you've probably seen,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"or seen variations of,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,"where you have the brain,"
00:26:00,00:26:02,"but then you draw sort of following the line of the brain,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,"you draw the size of bits of the body,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,depending on how much brain is allotted to them.
00:26:07,00:26:10,"So, you know, each section of this strip of brain,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,"he found that controlled all of our movement,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,"there was a section devoted to each finger and the thumb,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,"and lots of big sections devoted to the face,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"the eyes, the nose, the ears,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"but then, you know, you've got a tiny torso,"
00:26:20,00:26:21,because what does the brain need to do with this?
00:26:21,00:26:24,"- So it's like a very monstrous figure with a big head,"
00:26:24,00:26:27,"big hands, big genitals."
00:26:27,00:26:27,- Exactly.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"- The male homunculus has big genitals,"
00:26:29,00:26:33,"because men devote more of their brain to, you know,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,"you're conscious,"
00:26:34,00:26:37,"but the female doesn't have any genitals at all,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,and that might be because his sample size was very small
00:26:39,00:26:40,"of the women he was asking about this,"
00:26:40,00:26:42,"an experiment, I think it was 2009."
00:26:42,00:26:44,- 'Cause it certainly isn't that women
00:26:44,00:26:45,don't have a single bit of their brain
00:26:45,00:26:47,"devoted to their genitals,"
00:26:47,00:26:48,so they've got everything else.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"But yes, we don't really know why he missed the women off,"
00:26:50,00:26:51,but I think it was actually a woman
00:26:51,00:26:53,"who drew the homunculus for him,"
00:26:53,00:26:55,"called Mrs. Hortense Cantley,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,and I think some people have suggested
00:26:56,00:26:57,she was a bit too prudish.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"- She said, ""I'm not drawing that."""
00:26:59,00:27:00,(laughing)
00:27:00,00:27:01,Certainly not at the size you suggest.
00:27:01,00:27:03,(laughing)
00:27:03,00:27:05,Make sure you look as if I think of nothing else.
00:27:05,00:27:08,(laughing)
00:27:08,00:27:09,- Exactly.
00:27:09,00:27:11,"- This thing, this method he invented"
00:27:11,00:27:11,"that you're describing,"
00:27:11,00:27:14,"the, you know, your brain is exposed,"
00:27:14,00:27:17,"don't being operated on, but you are awake,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,"is called, I just love this,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,the Montreal Procedure.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"And it sounds very spy-film-y, doesn't it?"
00:27:23,00:27:26,"You know, like, the Ottawa Protocolls."
00:27:26,00:27:29,"You know, there's just a sort of, it's quite cool."
00:27:29,00:27:30,But if you see people playing a musical instrument
00:27:30,00:27:33,"during their surgery, that's the thing,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,because they need to work out
00:27:35,00:27:36,how to not damage your brain
00:27:36,00:27:39,and the bit of you that's doing fine motor movements.
00:27:39,00:27:42,"So if you play the violin, that's really useful to them."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"If you can't play the violin, it's very bad."
00:27:44,00:27:46,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:46,00:27:47,And it's got to be an instrument
00:27:47,00:27:48,that's sort of bearable as well
00:27:48,00:27:50,within the slightly stressful environment
00:27:50,00:27:50,of an operating theatre.
00:27:50,00:27:52,"- Oh yeah, you don't want bike bikes."
00:27:52,00:27:53,"- Yeah, exactly that."
00:27:53,00:27:54,- There was last year.
00:27:54,00:27:56,- Not many space for a harmonium in here.
00:27:56,00:27:57,(laughing)
00:27:57,00:27:59,"There was someone last year in Wisconsin,"
00:27:59,00:28:00,he developed really shaking hands
00:28:00,00:28:01,"and he couldn't, it got to the point,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,he couldn't pick up his granddaughter
00:28:03,00:28:05,"and he really wanted to sort that out, obviously."
00:28:05,00:28:07,And he was operated on for deep brain stimulation.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"And they said, well, do you play an instrument at all?"
00:28:10,00:28:11,And he played the trombone.
00:28:11,00:28:13,(laughing)
00:28:15,00:28:18,"- Well, he didn't, in the end, he didn't play it."
00:28:18,00:28:19,"He did the fingering movements,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"but it turns out that when you play the trombone,"
00:28:21,00:28:22,"you know, it causes high pressure."
00:28:22,00:28:23,"- You know, when you just said,"
00:28:23,00:28:25,when you do the fingering movements
00:28:25,00:28:26,"and then you mined fingering,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,do you know how to play a trombone?
00:28:28,00:28:30,(laughing)
00:28:30,00:28:31,"- Not, you will play the clarinet there."
00:28:31,00:28:32,"- Yeah, I'll play it."
00:28:32,00:28:34,"- That's a, yeah, alto sax."
00:28:34,00:28:35,- Yes.
00:28:35,00:28:36,- That's why my big band failed.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"It would have caused too much pressure inside its head,"
00:28:38,00:28:39,which might have killed him.
00:28:39,00:28:40,"So, yeah."
00:28:40,00:28:41,- That's the last thing you want
00:28:41,00:28:43,when you're doing brain surgery on someone.
00:28:43,00:28:44,- It's very clear.
00:28:44,00:28:45,This is brain surgery.
00:28:45,00:28:48,I had brain surgery in 2021.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"And I, so, I then, I found myself sort of fascinated"
00:28:50,00:28:53,"by that, you try not to think about it too much beforehand,"
00:28:53,00:28:54,"but then afterwards, you think, gosh,"
00:28:54,00:28:56,I'd have to know how that worked.
00:28:56,00:28:58,I'm not saying I'd like to sort of witness it happening.
00:28:58,00:28:59,I remember having knee surgery once
00:28:59,00:29:00,"and saying to a friend, is it a physio?"
00:29:00,00:29:01,"It sounds fascinating, the operation."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"It's a shame it's not a local anesthetic,"
00:29:03,00:29:04,'cause I quite like to watch it.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"And she said, you would absolutely not."
00:29:06,00:29:07,(laughing)
00:29:07,00:29:08,"I see a lot of these, no, you would really,"
00:29:08,00:29:09,you would really struggle.
00:29:09,00:29:10,"- Oh, really?"
00:29:10,00:29:12,"- But the actual brain aspect of it, I mean, it's so,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,"you know, in terms of there's a heavy machinery"
00:29:14,00:29:15,that is required.
00:29:15,00:29:16,And then there's sort of a very sensitive work
00:29:16,00:29:18,"that's done once that bit's done, you know."
00:29:18,00:29:19,- Yes.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- It's absolutely, you know."
00:29:20,00:29:20,- Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:21,- Contrast of skills.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"- Yeah, well, that's the best."
00:29:22,00:29:24,Then you get a thing like an old fashioned sort of 1970s
00:29:24,00:29:26,ashtray basically plonked on top of your head
00:29:26,00:29:28,so they can sort of lead instruments on it or whatever.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"So you sort of turn you into a kind of giant fondue,"
00:29:31,00:29:32,I suppose.
00:29:32,00:29:32,- Is that what it is?
00:29:32,00:29:33,"- Yeah, so I've got some dents in my head,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,"which are like, what's that bit from?"
00:29:35,00:29:37,"They go, oh, that's just where the thing was attached."
00:29:37,00:29:39,"You know, this tray is, they'd attach to people's car doors"
00:29:39,00:29:40,for their burgers and things that drive through.
00:29:40,00:29:42,So sort of clip on.
00:29:42,00:29:44,- The clip on the equipment shelf onto your brain.
00:29:44,00:29:46,- Do you not kind of wish they left it there?
00:29:46,00:29:47,It could be useful.
00:29:47,00:29:48,- For just for storage.
00:29:48,00:29:48,- Yeah.
00:29:48,00:29:49,- Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:29:51,00:29:53,- I feel like we've got a house with quite a few
00:29:53,00:29:55,sort of low door frames and things like that.
00:29:55,00:29:56,How can I see it?
00:29:56,00:29:57,How can I see it beginning to impact other members
00:29:57,00:29:58,of the household as well?
00:29:58,00:30:00,"On my own, of course, I don't see it, I love it, you know."
00:30:00,00:30:03,"- So they sort of had to open and then,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,"yeah, they sort of went around the side of the back for me."
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- I find it strange thinking of,"
00:30:07,00:30:08,'cause what Wilder Penfield was doing
00:30:08,00:30:10,was operating on the surface.
00:30:10,00:30:11,- Yeah.
00:30:11,00:30:12,"- But not the, I don't know if he got into"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"the very deep tissues of the brain and how that's,"
00:30:15,00:30:18,I can't understand how they get through
00:30:18,00:30:20,one bit of the brain to get to the rest of it.
00:30:20,00:30:22,I think that's extraordinary.
00:30:22,00:30:25,"- Well, now they can use a sort of laser knife, I think."
00:30:25,00:30:26,"So you're doing, that's basically,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,"you're targeting something specifically,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,"not just in a sort of two-dimensional way,"
00:30:30,00:30:31,but in a three-dimensional way.
00:30:31,00:30:33,Goodness knows how the science of that works.
00:30:33,00:30:34,- Is that what they did?
00:30:34,00:30:35,Do they use a laser on you?
00:30:35,00:30:35,"- For me, no."
00:30:35,00:30:38,"What I had was a fairly, within this particular field,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,quite a straightforward view.
00:30:39,00:30:40,- Just a spoon.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"- Just a spoon, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:41,00:30:43,"- Dessert spoon, please."
00:30:43,00:30:45,Do you wish you'd been awake during it?
00:30:45,00:30:49,"- No, I, no, I don't, I really don't."
00:30:49,00:30:52,"But I am sort of fascinated by the, I just,"
00:30:52,00:30:53,"I didn't used to be sort of fascinated by it,"
00:30:53,00:30:56,"I just sort of slightly take it for granted, I suppose."
00:30:56,00:30:58,But the idea of then doing something so extreme
00:30:58,00:31:01,and the sheer usefulness that that is now
00:31:01,00:31:03,in terms of what symptoms that can be related
00:31:03,00:31:05,"to an aspect of the brain and therefore you could have no,"
00:31:05,00:31:06,you don't have to go in at all.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"You could just go, ""Oh no, this is textbook."""
00:31:07,00:31:08,"If that's happening, it's because"
00:31:08,00:31:11,there's a specific issue and it can be got to
00:31:11,00:31:12,without us even going inside you.
00:31:12,00:31:13,- Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"- You know, a sort of piece of laser equipment"
00:31:14,00:31:15,can handle that.
00:31:15,00:31:17,"That's, I mean, it's completely remarkable."
00:31:17,00:31:17,- It is mad.
00:31:17,00:31:19,- And I feel like we always owe such a big thank you
00:31:19,00:31:21,to Epileptics over the last 100 years for it
00:31:21,00:31:23,'cause it's basically them who are always
00:31:23,00:31:25,being experimented on.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"Like hundreds of times, if you've got epilepsy,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,they're fascinated because you have an excuse
00:31:28,00:31:30,"to open the brain, so they say, ""While we're here,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,do you mind if we do lots of twiddling around
00:31:32,00:31:33,"to find out how the brain works?"""
00:31:33,00:31:35,"- That's what Penfield was doing quite a lot, wasn't it?"
00:31:35,00:31:37,"- That's what Penfield was doing, yes."
00:31:37,00:31:38,- I find him so interesting.
00:31:38,00:31:40,He had a really amazing life.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"He's a classic friend of the podcast, I'd say,"
00:31:42,00:31:45,in that served in the First World War.
00:31:45,00:31:49,His ship was torpedoed and sank.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"His obituary was printed,"
00:31:50,00:31:52,despite him not being dead when that happened.
00:31:52,00:31:53,He was a road scholar at Oxford.
00:31:53,00:31:57,He was a football coach before that in his homeland.
00:31:57,00:32:00,He was a medical ambassador after all these big discoveries.
00:32:00,00:32:05,His sister had a terrible brain cancer
00:32:05,00:32:08,and he operated on her to try and save her life.
00:32:08,00:32:11,Really complicated surgery and very dangerous.
00:32:11,00:32:14,He had to remove an eighth of her brain in the process.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"He wasn't able to save her life in the end,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,but he did grant her years more of life
00:32:18,00:32:19,that she wouldn't have had otherwise.
00:32:19,00:32:23,But he was really pioneering.
00:32:23,00:32:25,He was just discovering new things all the time
00:32:25,00:32:28,and then having to do the most difficult thing imaginable.
00:32:28,00:32:30,I imagine operating on a member of your family
00:32:30,00:32:32,"to try and save their life, just extraordinary."
00:32:32,00:32:35,- I think there's a time after which
00:32:35,00:32:36,it does count as saving your life.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"If someone's lived an extra five years,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,"plus I'd be saved their life, you can claim that."
00:32:41,00:32:44,- It's a terrifying area in which to be a pioneer in.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"I remember some builders saying to us when we lived in Peckham,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,we talked to them about loft extensions.
00:32:48,00:32:48,"So we haven't done one before,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,"but of course you have to do a first one, don't you?"
00:32:50,00:32:54,"And we thought, ""Nah, sorry, guys."""
00:32:54,00:32:55,The idea of having that conversation
00:32:55,00:32:57,in a sort of neurology war.
00:32:57,00:33:00,Terrifying.
00:33:00,00:33:04,- Can I do something quickly about how the brain evolved?
00:33:04,00:33:05,"'Cause it's kind of mental, right?"
00:33:05,00:33:08,So you go back to the start of animals.
00:33:08,00:33:11,"You have something called coano-flagellates,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,and they're the relatives of all animals.
00:33:13,00:33:15,And they are the first ones
00:33:15,00:33:16,where the cells can talk to each other.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"So that's kind of where brain cells begin,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,because you've got lots of cells talking to each other.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"And they have been described as a sperm wearing a skirt,"
00:33:24,00:33:26,'cause that's what they look like.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"Basically, they're very, very simple animals."
00:33:28,00:33:29,- Sounds like the sort of thing
00:33:29,00:33:30,Pope would call someone that he had got.
00:33:30,00:33:32,(all laughing)
00:33:32,00:33:34,"- And then you got neurons, okay?"
00:33:34,00:33:36,So these are actual brain cells.
00:33:36,00:33:40,And they started in something called an herbilitarian.
00:33:40,00:33:42,"Oh, he said, ""hypothetical animal."""
00:33:42,00:33:44,But it's definitely a common ancestor
00:33:44,00:33:46,of all the animals that are split in two.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"So like, basically all mammals"
00:33:48,00:33:50,and lots of other animals as well.
00:33:50,00:33:52,They had the first tiny brain.
00:33:52,00:33:55,They also had the first eyes and the first anuses.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"And people usually draw them like a little slug, okay?"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"- Okay, their pioneers, seriously."
00:34:01,00:34:03,"And socially, they must have been very popular, you know?"
00:34:03,00:34:05,They're cut above the neighbors.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"- Yeah, yeah. - They've got eyes,"
00:34:06,00:34:07,"they've got, what was it?"
00:34:07,00:34:09,- An anus. - An anus and a brain.
00:34:09,00:34:11,- People must have been terribly bunged up till then.
00:34:11,00:34:13,- Please. (all laughing)
00:34:13,00:34:14,Very uncomfortable.
00:34:14,00:34:17,- Often things would come out of the same way as the mouth.
00:34:17,00:34:19,"- Oh, dear."
00:34:19,00:34:24,- Very much an Alexander Pope and Mr. Curl situation.
00:34:24,00:34:26,- Pope toilets were ruined across the world.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"- And then it's really difficult for brains to evolve, right?"
00:34:28,00:34:31,- Because you kind of need them to work all the time.
00:34:31,00:34:33,So you can't just keep trying things
00:34:33,00:34:35,"because if you try something,"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"probably that animal will struggle to live, right?"
00:34:38,00:34:40,"- Sort of mutations. - To mutate, right?"
00:34:40,00:34:43,"So sometime around 500 million years ago,"
00:34:43,00:34:44,two organisms had sex
00:34:44,00:34:47,"and their entire genome was duplicated, okay?"
00:34:47,00:34:50,And these are relatives of all the future mammals
00:34:50,00:34:51,and all the future kind of this.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"And when you had two lots of the genome,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,that meant that one half of the genome
00:34:55,00:34:57,could start practicing and start trying things out.
00:34:57,00:34:59,And then you get loads more mutations there.
00:34:59,00:35:00,And you might have an extra arm here
00:35:00,00:35:03,or an extra bigger brain or whatever.
00:35:03,00:35:07,And that's really important for brains to develop.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"And then we now think, and this is really recent,"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"we think that that happened a second time,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,"about 100 million years ago,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,where the entire genome got duplicated.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"And that's when the brains got much, much bigger."
00:35:18,00:35:19,"And we're not sure about that,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,but it's called the Ono Hypothesis.
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Hypothesis?
00:35:22,00:35:25,"- After Japanese geneticists, Sumo Ono."
00:35:25,00:35:26,(all laughing)
00:35:26,00:35:26,- Very good.
00:35:26,00:35:30,- So there's no exclamation mark.
00:35:30,00:35:31,- There's no exclamation mark.
00:35:31,00:35:33,"- Not only one, that's perfect."
00:35:33,00:35:34,- And then you get the brain.
00:35:34,00:35:35,There's a few other steps.
00:35:35,00:35:36,(all laughing)
00:35:36,00:35:37,- But now you've got it to the punch line.
00:35:37,00:35:39,(all laughing)
00:35:39,00:35:40,- I just found this funny name
00:35:40,00:35:42,"and I thought, how am I gonna get to it?"
00:35:42,00:35:44,- Long and winding road.
00:35:44,00:35:47,(upbeat music)
00:35:47,00:35:54,"- Okay, it is time for fact number four and that's James."
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- Okay, my fact this week"
00:35:55,00:36:00,"is that in 1885, a Samoan king plotted to kill a rival"
00:36:00,00:36:05,by disguising his army as a 200 man cricket team.
00:36:05,00:36:08,(all laughing)
00:36:08,00:36:09,- Was he caught out?
00:36:09,00:36:11,"- Oh, yeah, very good."
00:36:11,00:36:12,- Was he caught out?
00:36:12,00:36:13,- When he slipped.
00:36:13,00:36:14,- Yeah.
00:36:14,00:36:15,"- Yeah, let's get those out of the way."
00:36:15,00:36:17,- Is it a bit sledgehammer to crack or not?
00:36:17,00:36:20,Getting a 200 man team to kill one rival.
00:36:20,00:36:22,"- Oh, well, the rival would have had an opposition army."
00:36:22,00:36:23,"- Oh, he had his own men coming."
00:36:23,00:36:25,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:25,00:36:26,- 400 ping pong players.
00:36:26,00:36:28,(all laughing)
00:36:28,00:36:31,- So this is 19th century Samoa.
00:36:31,00:36:35,Cricket had been brought over by the British
00:36:35,00:36:37,and they kind of had their own version
00:36:37,00:36:40,that had lots and lots and lots of players in a team.
00:36:40,00:36:42,We might get to a specific cricket in a minute
00:36:42,00:36:44,and how that's different than normal cricket.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"But he was in Apia, the capital of Samoa"
00:36:47,00:36:50,and he'd heard that his rival was gonna come over
00:36:50,00:36:51,and try and take over
00:36:51,00:36:53,and he decided he was gonna get in there first.
00:36:53,00:36:56,So he sent like a Trojan horse of cricketers
00:36:56,00:36:58,'cause you might have a really big cricket team
00:36:58,00:36:59,in those days.
00:36:59,00:37:01,They had like the cricket bats and the cricket balls
00:37:01,00:37:03,in these boats when they're going from one island
00:37:03,00:37:06,"to another, but underneath were guns"
00:37:06,00:37:09,and grenades and stuff like that.
00:37:09,00:37:11,- So they weren't just gonna use the ball to the back
00:37:11,00:37:14,'cause this was the days before Bodyline was banned.
00:37:14,00:37:15,So you could really just kill people.
00:37:15,00:37:16,- That's true.
00:37:16,00:37:18,- Just like sharpened stumps and things like that.
00:37:18,00:37:20,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:37:20,00:37:21,- But the coup was foiled in the end
00:37:21,00:37:22,thanks to the indiscretion
00:37:22,00:37:24,of one of the players.
00:37:24,00:37:27,"- Oh, she must have, that's a very poor team member."
00:37:27,00:37:29,- Yes.
00:37:29,00:37:31,- That's like Kevin Peterson texting the opposition.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"I mean, what's going on?"
00:37:32,00:37:36,"That's a very nice reference, but what specific cricket"
00:37:36,00:37:37,then if you can have?
00:37:37,00:37:38,"'Cause obviously to us like 200, that would be like"
00:37:38,00:37:40,that's half the playing staff of the county championship.
00:37:40,00:37:44,"It would sort of stick out like a sore thumb, wouldn't it?"
00:37:44,00:37:45,But you could have the specific cricket
00:37:45,00:37:46,has complete different rules.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"- Yeah, definitely."
00:37:47,00:37:51,So Samoa wasn't really into cricket for ages
00:37:51,00:37:53,and then it turned out that the British brought cricket
00:37:53,00:37:57,to Tonga and Tonga got really into it.
00:37:57,00:37:59,"And they would, the Tongans would go over to Samoa"
00:37:59,00:38:02,"and say, ""Oh, you guys can't play cricket, you idiots."""
00:38:02,00:38:03,And so the Samoans decided
00:38:03,00:38:05,that they were going to get into it as well.
00:38:05,00:38:07,"- They're very childish aren't they, the Samoans?"
00:38:07,00:38:09,"Yeah, you're probably not supposed to say it."
00:38:09,00:38:11,"- It comes across that way, doesn't it?"
00:38:11,00:38:13,But then it just kind of evolves that way.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"You know, like village against village."
00:38:15,00:38:18,"Even in those times, soccer and rugby and stuff"
00:38:18,00:38:22,was quite often much bigger teams like village against village.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"But in Samoa, yeah, it kind of evolved that way."
00:38:24,00:38:27,And it's known as kilikitty.
00:38:27,00:38:28,"It's actually pronounced cricket,"
00:38:28,00:38:30,but it's spelled kilikitty.
00:38:30,00:38:32,So most people would say kilikitty.
00:38:32,00:38:33,- It's really fun.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- Yeah, and you might have,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,"instead of one batsman at each side,"
00:38:37,00:38:40,you might have three batsmen at each side
00:38:40,00:38:42,and you would have no sixes and fours.
00:38:42,00:38:43,You would just whack the ball
00:38:43,00:38:44,and then just keep running and running.
00:38:44,00:38:45,- Run as many as you can.
00:38:45,00:38:46,"- Quite often you would have runners,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,which you don't really get in cricket these days so much.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"So if you were overweight,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,you would just get a young person
00:38:52,00:38:54,in to do all the running for you and stuff.
00:38:54,00:38:56,- Is this kilikitty?
00:38:56,00:38:57,I'm gonna say that.
00:38:57,00:38:58,"- Let's say kilikitty, yeah."
00:38:58,00:38:59,- The Samoan version.
00:38:59,00:39:02,"It was so much fun that when in the year 1900,"
00:39:02,00:39:05,"Britain ceded control of Samoa to Germany,"
00:39:05,00:39:07,the Germans banned it.
00:39:07,00:39:09,'Cause it was taking up so much people's time.
00:39:09,00:39:10,"And in Tonga, in fact,"
00:39:10,00:39:11,they had to pass a law
00:39:11,00:39:13,that you're only allowed to play it one day a week.
00:39:13,00:39:14,'Cause everyone was just bunking off the whole time
00:39:14,00:39:16,to go and play cricket.
00:39:16,00:39:17,"'Cause also, if you're that many people playing,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,"presumably, you could be perhaps not very active"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"in the game, but be quite happily absorbed."
00:39:21,00:39:23,"If you've got 200 people on each team,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"then there's quite a few passengers, aren't there?"
00:39:25,00:39:25,- Absolutely.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"- The level of which I play,"
00:39:26,00:39:27,you can have sort of two or three people.
00:39:27,00:39:28,"I could sort of, you know,"
00:39:28,00:39:29,I pulled a muscle the other week
00:39:29,00:39:31,and I couldn't really move and that was fine.
00:39:31,00:39:33,- Doesn't make any difference.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"- If you've got 200 people,"
00:39:34,00:39:35,"you really could turn up going,"
00:39:35,00:39:35,where's the sort of quieter?
00:39:35,00:39:37,The ball doesn't seem to be going anywhere much.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"- Yeah, you're so right."
00:39:39,00:39:40,"- They did ban it,"
00:39:40,00:39:41,but actually no one paid any attention to it.
00:39:41,00:39:43,They carried on playing anyway.
00:39:43,00:39:44,But there was a civil servant there
00:39:44,00:39:46,called Philip Snow.
00:39:46,00:39:48,This was just before it was ceded to Germany.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"And he said that work,"
00:39:49,00:39:53,Wesleyism and women were all suffering
00:39:53,00:39:54,"due to cricket, basically."
00:39:54,00:39:57,"He was saying, because people were so into cricket,"
00:39:57,00:39:58,they just were doing nothing else.
00:39:58,00:39:59,They weren't going to church.
00:39:59,00:40:00,They weren't looking after the family
00:40:00,00:40:01,and they weren't doing any work.
00:40:01,00:40:03,"- I mean, cricket's more fun than all those things."
00:40:03,00:40:07,"So, he was CP Snow's brother."
00:40:07,00:40:09,For anyone who likes to read CP Snow.
00:40:09,00:40:11,"Philip Snow, this chap who went out"
00:40:11,00:40:12,and yelled at cricket.
00:40:12,00:40:14,- And CP Snow was?
00:40:14,00:40:16,- And CP Snow was a writer.
00:40:16,00:40:17,I've actually never read any CP Snow.
00:40:17,00:40:19,- I've read the two cultures.
00:40:19,00:40:20,- Is he good?
00:40:20,00:40:21,- It's terrific.
00:40:21,00:40:23,It's about the world of arts and the world of science
00:40:23,00:40:25,and how...
00:40:25,00:40:26,"- Anyway, back to cricket."
00:40:26,00:40:29,(laughing)
00:40:29,00:40:31,"- It's basically saying, I'll just say it,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"if you say, I don't know what an atom is,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"no one looks down on you in a social setting, right?"
00:40:35,00:40:38,"Whereas if you say, I've never heard of Mozart."
00:40:38,00:40:39,- I've never read CP Snow.
00:40:39,00:40:41,(laughing)
00:40:41,00:40:42,- That people will think you're a complete
00:40:42,00:40:43,irretrievable idiot.
00:40:43,00:40:44,"And he was saying, this is not really a reasonable thing"
00:40:44,00:40:46,because actually atoms are arguably
00:40:46,00:40:48,even more important than Mozart.
00:40:48,00:40:49,And you shouldn't have this huge divide
00:40:49,00:40:51,between the two cultures.
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Mozart was made of atoms in many ways.
00:40:52,00:40:53,- Exactly.
00:40:53,00:40:54,(laughing)
00:40:54,00:40:57,"- And so, it's mad that the absolute granular,"
00:40:57,00:41:00,"like the most basic floor level entry thing of science,"
00:41:00,00:41:02,"for example, knowing what an atom is."
00:41:02,00:41:03,- We're not expected to know.
00:41:03,00:41:04,- We should be expected to know that.
00:41:04,00:41:05,You know?
00:41:05,00:41:06,"Anyway, it's a terrific essay."
00:41:06,00:41:08,"It's an essay, it's not even a book, it's short."
00:41:08,00:41:10,"- Anyway, cricket, you're talking about cricket?"
00:41:10,00:41:11,"- Yeah, sorry."
00:41:11,00:41:13,"- When I'm killer kitty, the bowling is all throwing."
00:41:13,00:41:16,"So, you know in cricket, you're not allowed to throw the ball."
00:41:16,00:41:16,You're not allowed to chuck.
00:41:16,00:41:19,"- I've seen it, I've seen it, I'm telling you."
00:41:19,00:41:22,- You had to keep a straight arm the whole time
00:41:22,00:41:24,and sort of go over the top of your head
00:41:24,00:41:25,and throw the ball like that.
00:41:25,00:41:26,"But you're not allowed to,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"if you were to throw a snowball, for instance,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"you would bend your elbow, wouldn't you?"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"- Yes, I would."
00:41:32,00:41:33,- We've already said in the past
00:41:33,00:41:35,that you're not great at throwing things.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"- No, and this is taking me right back"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"to a cricket ball throwing competition,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,which I lost as a boy.
00:41:41,00:41:42,We don't need to get into it back.
00:41:42,00:41:44,Mental snake pit.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"- But it was too a nine-year-old, isn't it?"
00:41:46,00:41:47,- It was too a seven-year-old.
00:41:47,00:41:47,"- So sorry, seven."
00:41:47,00:41:48,- And you were at what age?
00:41:48,00:41:49,- 14.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"- Okay, did they have particularly long arms?"
00:41:51,00:41:52,She did not.
00:41:52,00:41:54,(all laughing)
00:41:54,00:41:56,But she was German and I think that gave her
00:41:56,00:41:58,"a sudden athleticism, which meant that I, yeah, anyway,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,"look, when I actually grew up in sort of Soviet era,"
00:42:00,00:42:01,she'd been one of these people
00:42:01,00:42:02,who had been sent to a throwing college
00:42:02,00:42:03,from the age of three.
00:42:03,00:42:04,(all laughing)
00:42:04,00:42:06,She heavily drugged.
00:42:06,00:42:08,She's clearly never seen a cricket ball
00:42:08,00:42:09,before in her life being German.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"- Roided up to the max, yeah."
00:42:11,00:42:12,"Anyway, look, we're not here to,"
00:42:12,00:42:14,"if I could have one bit of my brain removed,"
00:42:14,00:42:16,I think it might actually be that memory.
00:42:16,00:42:17,(all laughing)
00:42:17,00:42:22,"- So this is according to a writer called C.H.B. Pridham,"
00:42:22,00:42:25,who said about the bowling as all throwing.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"He also said, ""There is no idea of defensive play."""
00:42:28,00:42:30,"So in cricket, if someone bowls to you,"
00:42:30,00:42:32,a lot of the time you're just trying to stop them
00:42:32,00:42:33,from getting you out.
00:42:33,00:42:35,"You're not trying to score runs, but there was none of that."
00:42:35,00:42:39,"And he also said, ""Barracking is not in the Australian model,"
00:42:39,00:42:42,"but consists of pious invocations of the deity."""
00:42:42,00:42:46,"So you wouldn't say, you know, why are you so fat?"
00:42:46,00:42:48,"'Cause every time your wife shags me,"
00:42:48,00:42:50,she gives me a biscuit or whatever.
00:42:50,00:42:51,You would say--
00:42:51,00:42:51,- As we would say.
00:42:51,00:42:53,(all laughing)
00:42:53,00:42:54,"- As Shane Moore famously said,"
00:42:54,00:42:58,"but you would say instead, God's gonna get you."
00:42:58,00:43:01,- You've been abounding and neglecting your Wesleyanism.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Would you say that?
00:43:02,00:43:02,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:43:02,00:43:04,- But that really hurt in the 19th century.
00:43:04,00:43:07,"And they really, in Calicutty,"
00:43:07,00:43:09,"they really sort of made it official, the Barracking."
00:43:09,00:43:13,"So they had, this was a particularly Calicutty in Samoa,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,"so slightly different between Pacific islands,"
00:43:15,00:43:18,"but they had cheerleaders called Lapé,"
00:43:18,00:43:19,and they would dance and they would sing
00:43:19,00:43:20,to support their--
00:43:20,00:43:20,- The Lapé dancers.
00:43:20,00:43:22,(all laughing)
00:43:22,00:43:26,"No, darling, no, it's not what it sounds like."
00:43:26,00:43:28,(all laughing)
00:43:28,00:43:30,"It just sound like, actually it does sound like it."
00:43:30,00:43:31,(all laughing)
00:43:31,00:43:35,"But actually, it could be that this was all just one man's"
00:43:35,00:43:36,"excuse for something that I've read,"
00:43:36,00:43:39,but apparently the Lapé dancers would sing around
00:43:39,00:43:42,"and the batsmen would get all geed up,"
00:43:42,00:43:43,"and then once their sides bowled out,"
00:43:43,00:43:46,"then they switch over to the other group of Lapés,"
00:43:46,00:43:49,and they're the ones who Barrack and Hurlabue sat
00:43:49,00:43:50,the opposition as their backing.
00:43:50,00:43:52,- This all sounds better than the hundred.
00:43:52,00:43:53,(all laughing)
00:43:53,00:43:55,"As a format, I think."
00:43:55,00:43:57,"- So you play cricket, Miles, don't you?"
00:43:57,00:44:00,"- Yes, and not, I should say, to a very high standard."
00:44:00,00:44:01,- With your county days are behind you.
00:44:01,00:44:04,"- Long behind, and in many ways ahead."
00:44:04,00:44:06,(all laughing)
00:44:06,00:44:07,- Are you a butter or a bowler?
00:44:07,00:44:10,"- I'm bits and pieces, really."
00:44:10,00:44:12,"I'm there, I particularly like the bit afterwards,"
00:44:12,00:44:13,where you sit down in a camping chair
00:44:13,00:44:15,and talk about what's just happened.
00:44:15,00:44:17,"To me, that's what the day is building up to."
00:44:17,00:44:19,- It's very important to happen to this.
00:44:19,00:44:23,"- James, you like going to really unusual places"
00:44:23,00:44:24,"at unusual times, I think that's fair."
00:44:24,00:44:27,Have you ever been to Bramble Bank?
00:44:27,00:44:28,- Give me more?
00:44:28,00:44:29,- I have.
00:44:29,00:44:29,- In the Solent?
00:44:29,00:44:30,"- Yes, I have."
00:44:30,00:44:33,"- Oh, no, I haven't, in fact, if it's in the Solent, no."
00:44:33,00:44:36,"- This is, so we're talking for international listeners,"
00:44:36,00:44:39,"just between Southampton and the Isle of Wight, basically."
00:44:39,00:44:41,"- Yeah, it's sort of in the French channel."
00:44:41,00:44:44,"- Yeah, just La Monche, if you're listening from,"
00:44:44,00:44:45,"no, we have no French listeners,"
00:44:45,00:44:46,we've shaken them all off over the years.
00:44:46,00:44:47,- Why does that happen?
00:44:47,00:44:50,"Are we really delivering policy stuff about cricket,"
00:44:50,00:44:51,"basically, yeah."
00:44:51,00:44:53,"- As a group of people who have played a gig in Paris,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,we could definitely say we have no French listeners.
00:44:55,00:44:57,"- Oh, really?"
00:44:57,00:44:59,"- But basically, there is the sound bar"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"in the middle of the Solent,"
00:45:00,00:45:04,which drains out twice a year for one hour or so.
00:45:04,00:45:05,- Yeah.
00:45:05,00:45:06,- And they try and play a game of cricket on it
00:45:06,00:45:07,as soon as it opens up.
00:45:07,00:45:08,- And you've been there?
00:45:08,00:45:11,"- Yeah, I did a thing with Stuart Broad, the England Cricketer,"
00:45:11,00:45:12,"where it was sort of a promotional thing,"
00:45:12,00:45:15,"but we had to get there very early,"
00:45:15,00:45:16,"quite early in the morning,"
00:45:16,00:45:17,"we've got, I think, a boat called us Rib,"
00:45:17,00:45:20,which is like some sort of speedboat thing
00:45:20,00:45:21,"that they hang quite a lot of people on,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,"and arrive at this, and they just start playing."
00:45:23,00:45:25,"It's very, it's not very big at all."
00:45:25,00:45:27,"It was quite, you know, just as much you get on this can."
00:45:27,00:45:29,"And they do set up some stumps quickly,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,and just play a sort of a game of knock about cricket.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"I was umpiring, Stuart Broad was playing."
00:45:34,00:45:36,"- I'm gonna say, if you just turned it up there"
00:45:36,00:45:39,"with your mates on this sort of sand bank,"
00:45:39,00:45:43,and Stuart Broad turns up on the greatest bowlers
00:45:43,00:45:44,of all time.
00:45:44,00:45:46,"- It was, yeah, I mean, the golf obviously is extraordinary,"
00:45:46,00:45:47,but he was just whacking everything.
00:45:47,00:45:49,"But you have to, you know, you're fielding,"
00:45:49,00:45:50,you have to go and get the ball out of the sea and stuff.
00:45:50,00:45:52,"- Yes, it doesn't land in the water."
00:45:52,00:45:52,"- Well, yeah."
00:45:52,00:45:55,"- Yeah, and it just gets to a point where they go,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,"""Okay, it's up to our ankles, we've got to go."""
00:45:57,00:45:59,The last sort of bit you're playing.
00:45:59,00:46:01,And there was spectators as well.
00:46:01,00:46:02,"Of course, the longer the game goes on,"
00:46:02,00:46:05,the closer the spectators have to stand for the action.
00:46:05,00:46:06,There are people playing the game.
00:46:06,00:46:08,We're further away from the wickets and the spectators.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"- And all the lap dancers as well, that must be a nightmare."
00:46:10,00:46:12,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:46:12,00:46:16,"- The idea of being on the south coast after the game is over,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"like being a part of like the immigration authorities,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"and seeing one of these small inflatable boats coming back,"
00:46:20,00:46:22,"and looking at them, thinking,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,"""Is that Miles Jappens, Stuart Broad?"""
00:46:24,00:46:25,(laughing)
00:46:25,00:46:26,- What are they?
00:46:26,00:46:28,- I hope we're not expecting a coup.
00:46:28,00:46:30,(laughing)
00:46:30,00:46:32,- Amazing.
00:46:32,00:46:34,Have you heard of the fellowship
00:46:34,00:46:36,of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club?
00:46:36,00:46:37,- No.
00:46:37,00:46:38,"- So this is a Dutch team,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,"and they only play one game every year,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,but it always has to be somewhere strange.
00:46:42,00:46:44,So the first game they played
00:46:44,00:46:46,was on the borders of Belgium and Netherlands.
00:46:46,00:46:48,"You know, it's a really sort of funky border"
00:46:48,00:46:51,where you can walk from the Belgium into the Netherlands
00:46:51,00:46:54,across the border like 10 times.
00:46:54,00:46:57,The second game was against the Vatican.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"They thought that they were gonna win that easily,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,but they got absolutely battered.
00:47:01,00:47:02,(laughing)
00:47:02,00:47:04,"They thought it was gonna be a load of Cardinals and stuff,"
00:47:04,00:47:07,but it turned out to be a load of theology students.
00:47:07,00:47:08,- Brilliant.
00:47:08,00:47:09,"- Who were all great at cricket, it turned out."
00:47:09,00:47:11,- Should have called themselves the Vatican.
00:47:11,00:47:14,(laughing)
00:47:14,00:47:15,Carry on.
00:47:16,00:47:19,- I'm trying to pull Lady Mary-Wartley-Montague off
00:47:19,00:47:20,and it shows over.
00:47:20,00:47:22,(laughing)
00:47:22,00:47:25,"- Oh, dear."
00:47:25,00:47:28,"It doesn't even feel worth carrying on after that, does it?"
00:47:28,00:47:30,They played Iceland in the Northern Arctic.
00:47:30,00:47:32,- It was more hard to trump the invention of the Anus.
00:47:32,00:47:34,(laughing)
00:47:34,00:47:39,"- They played Andorra and they, in 2017,"
00:47:39,00:47:40,"the last one I could find,"
00:47:40,00:47:43,"they played a place called Hirst Schanger in Munich,"
00:47:43,00:47:44,and they chose that as Fairly Odd
00:47:44,00:47:48,because of the proximity of the Newt Sombavers
00:47:48,00:47:49,in nearby garden.
00:47:49,00:47:50,(laughing)
00:47:50,00:47:51,- Were they sort of a target?
00:47:51,00:47:52,Was it like that's a four?
00:47:52,00:47:53,That's a six?
00:47:53,00:47:55,- Six and out.
00:47:55,00:47:56,- Yeah.
00:47:56,00:47:57,- Wide ball.
00:47:57,00:48:01,"No, it's just the way the lights show falling across it."
00:48:01,00:48:02,- Let me see your googly.
00:48:02,00:48:04,(laughing)
00:48:04,00:48:05,- Crikey.
00:48:05,00:48:06,"- Oh, crikey."
00:48:06,00:48:07,"- Oh, dear."
00:48:07,00:48:10,"- You went on Mastermind years ago, didn't you?"
00:48:10,00:48:11,"- I've done it twice, yeah."
00:48:11,00:48:12,"- Oh, have you?"
00:48:12,00:48:14,"Well, once your specialist subject"
00:48:14,00:48:15,was David Gower.
00:48:15,00:48:16,"- Yeah, that was unsuccessful."
00:48:16,00:48:17,- Is it?
00:48:17,00:48:18,"- Yes, the first time, though,"
00:48:18,00:48:19,it was Mike Latham.
00:48:19,00:48:20,Cricketer Mike Latham.
00:48:20,00:48:21,- Okay.
00:48:21,00:48:22,"- And I had no passes on that one,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,but I didn't really get out on the block
00:48:24,00:48:25,second time.
00:48:25,00:48:27,"- Both times, you picked a cricketer."
00:48:27,00:48:28,"- So it's not broad interest, isn't it?"
00:48:28,00:48:30,"- It's why, because they say, what's your,"
00:48:30,00:48:30,"no, not at all."
00:48:30,00:48:31,- He has got a broad interest.
00:48:31,00:48:33,(laughing)
00:48:33,00:48:35,"- Well, David Gower, do you know,"
00:48:35,00:48:37,"I wonder if there's something that you don't know about him,"
00:48:37,00:48:38,but did he ever tell you?
00:48:38,00:48:39,So did you meet him?
00:48:39,00:48:40,"- Many times, yeah."
00:48:40,00:48:41,"- Okay, you have?"
00:48:41,00:48:42,- Yeah.
00:48:42,00:48:43,- I was reading about him.
00:48:43,00:48:45,"So he's a famous, he was an England cricketer."
00:48:45,00:48:45,- Thank you.
00:48:45,00:48:47,- In the eighties.
00:48:47,00:48:48,"He sounds like quite a fun guy, actually."
00:48:48,00:48:51,"In 1990, he went on holiday to St. Moritz,"
00:48:51,00:48:54,"and he had, there was a frozen lake,"
00:48:54,00:48:57,and he was in a hire car at three in the morning.
00:48:57,00:48:59,"You can only imagine that if he was breathalyzed,"
00:48:59,00:49:00,"it might not have gone well,"
00:49:00,00:49:03,but I'm not saying that I know that for sure.
00:49:03,00:49:04,"It was three in the morning,"
00:49:04,00:49:06,"and he thought, I'll drive around on the lake."
00:49:06,00:49:08,"And he spent an hour zooming around on the lake,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"you know, doing handbrake turns and spins"
00:49:10,00:49:12,and having a great time.
00:49:12,00:49:15,And then he saw a patch of what he knew was thin ice.
00:49:15,00:49:18,"He thought, cool, I'll try and drive towards that"
00:49:18,00:49:19,and brake just before I get to it.
00:49:19,00:49:23,- Just sensible decisions at three a.m.
00:49:23,00:49:24,"You know, is it crooked?"
00:49:24,00:49:25,Isn't exciting enough on this day?
00:49:25,00:49:28,(all laughing)
00:49:28,00:49:32,"- And he misjudged it, and he didn't break in time,"
00:49:32,00:49:34,and the car sort of went through the ice
00:49:34,00:49:37,"and got quite stuck, and he tried to reverse out."
00:49:37,00:49:38,"So it didn't go all, it didn't sink all the way down."
00:49:38,00:49:41,"It just got a bit wedged in the ice, broke through."
00:49:41,00:49:44,"So eventually he had to climb out and walk back to the hotel,"
00:49:44,00:49:46,"went to bed, and the next morning came down"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"and said to the hotel manager,"
00:49:48,00:49:50,would you mind sort of calling your people
00:49:50,00:49:52,and checking if there's still a hire car on the lake?
00:49:52,00:49:54,'Cause I need to go and pick it up.
00:49:54,00:49:57,"And sadly the hotel manager said, no, there's not."
00:49:57,00:50:00,"- No, there's no longer any ice on the lake."
00:50:00,00:50:02,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:50:02,00:50:04,And the hire car was never seen again.
00:50:04,00:50:07,"But that made me think, he sounds like fun."
00:50:07,00:50:09,"- He's Johnny, yeah, well he injured himself."
00:50:09,00:50:10,I think he did the crester run.
00:50:10,00:50:11,- I think he once had to miss some matches
00:50:11,00:50:13,'cause he'd broken himself between the crester run.
00:50:13,00:50:14,- Did he? - What'd I do?
00:50:14,00:50:16,"- Bob sledding. - Yeah, yeah."
00:50:16,00:50:17,- He also did that in the hire car.
00:50:17,00:50:19,(laughing)
00:50:19,00:50:20,"Hurt, yeah, it certainly does."
00:50:20,00:50:22,(laughing)
00:50:22,00:50:25,(upbeat music)
