00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,200
 Hi everyone, Fred Dan, Shriver is away today,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,920
 but we have an absolutely cracking guest for you.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,600
 It's someone that I've wanted to get on the show

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,440
 for ages and ages.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,800
 Definitely one of the wittiest, funniest people

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,040
 working in Britain today.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
 And in fact, for the last 20 years,

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,240
 it is the fantastic Miles Jupp.

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,800
 We had such a great time with him.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,320
 So I hope you like the show.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,520
 And he has just done the first hint of a tour

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,120
 with his live show On Eye Bang,

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,660
 which was brilliantly reviewed.

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,880
 And for those of you listening in America,

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,000
 get excited, he's coming to you.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,440
 He will be going to New York in November.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,240
 Do look up the dates that he's playing there.

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,160
 You can go to his website, milesjupp.co.uk,

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,200
 or just look it up.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,880
 It's at the Soho Playhouse in New York.

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,920
 And I'm pretty sure more live dates

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
 are very soon to be announced,

24
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,480
 both in the UK and America.

25
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,660
 So keep your eyes peeled.

26
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,920
 You definitely won't regret it.

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,800
 He is so, so funny.

28
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,080
 And hope you enjoy this show as much as we did.

29
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,160
 (upbeat music)

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

31
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,660
 (upbeat music)

32
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,240
 (upbeat music)

33
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,820
 (upbeat music)

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,520
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,660
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

36
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,500
 from the QI offices in a whole boron.

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,420
 My name is Anna Toshinsky,

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,600
 and I am sitting here with James Harkin,

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,480
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Miles Jupp.

40
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
 with our four favorite facts in the last seven days.

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,320
 In no particular order, here we go.

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,560
 Miles, what's your favorite fact?

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,400
 - My favorite fact from the last seven days is

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,440
 people who get really lost usually don't travel

46
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,440
 more than a hundred meters from their starting point,

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,120
 regardless of how long they walk for.

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,720
 - That is insane.

49
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,160
 Is that stupid?

50
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,520
 - It's partly an element of humans have a tendency

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,000
 to walk in circles.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
 And there was a theory it was literally

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,840
 because one leg is always slightly shorter than the other.

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,660
 - That's what I thought it was.

55
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,500
 - That sort of would happen,

56
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,480
 like an enormous, perfect circle.

57
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
 - Is that really what you thought, Andrew?

58
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
 'Cause I think that sounds ridiculous.

59
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,920
 - I did think that, and I was told this when I was at school

60
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,880
 that if you ever get lost in the wilderness

61
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,400
 to walk for five minutes in a straight line

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,240
 and then turn around and walk backwards

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
 for five minutes in a straight line

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,640
 so that your one dodgy leg is on a different side of each way.

65
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,560
 - Oh, so literally, sorry, walk backwards,

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
 you're not backwards where you started.

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
 - That's what I thought you meant.

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,000
 - No, walk backwards.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
 - That's good.

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,080
 - I went to quite a posh school,

71
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,880
 but we didn't have our own wilderness.

72
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,360
 It sounds very extraordinary facility.

73
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,080
 - That's what they call the graffiti covered

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,560
 bit of tarmac up back.

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,360
 - But it's not that.

76
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
 - It's not that, but it doesn't seem like people

77
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
 we really know.

78
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,080
 I mean, is there an idea that it might be evolutionary

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,840
 because it's safer to end up back where you started

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,040
 and, you know, it's a good homing instinct to have.

81
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,680
 - Yeah, that you would end up in the way that a drone now,

82
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,200
 if the battery fails, it gives itself just enough time,

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
 doesn't it, to work back to where it was to launch from.

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
 It should do, I think,

85
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
 but occasionally you find old ones in rivers

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
 where, for instance, that technology sadly fails.

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
 - In the rivers near where I grew up,

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,960
 you get shopping trolleys, not drones.

89
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,880
 - Oh yeah, shopping trolleys can't find their way back

90
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,400
 to where they're from.

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
 - They do go around in circles, though.

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,720
 This is people who, I think they were blindfolded,

93
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,400
 weren't they, in this particular study.

94
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,040
 I mean, people have been documented to walk around

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
 in circles so many times, but yeah,

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,680
 this guy did this study in 2009, blindfolded them,

97
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
 and literally, they didn't travel any distance at all,

98
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,280
 not more than 100 meters, regardless.

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,760
 - In this experiment, were they on rough terrain,

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,640
 or, as in, if I was blindfolded and in the woods,

101
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,800
 I probably wouldn't go more than 100 meters,

102
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,640
 as in, I would feel my way quite carefully

103
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,040
 for the duration of the experiment.

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
 - What if it was a day long, and no,

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,520
 it's not to do with terrain,

106
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,960
 the worst place is to be on a massive open field

107
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,200
 with no landmarks whatsoever. - That's really, yeah.

108
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,400
 - And no sun to look at and no moon.

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
 'Cause landmarks are such an important part

110
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,960
 in how we navigate, and in the same way

111
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,200
 as how we tell time, you know, you're able to remember

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 when things happen because you've got little signposts

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
 that, oh, the milk comes on Tuesday,

114
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,240
 and I know it was a day after that,

115
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,280
 that I got my new trousers, or whatever it might be,

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
 but the same-- - The milkman had

117
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,120
 a terrible little rest of the day, didn't he?

118
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,640
 - The trouser man has been.

119
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,680
 - Yeah, you leave out the old trousers, don't you?

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

121
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,600
 But you'd need those sort of landmarks.

122
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,640
 I read a very good book about wayfaring by a man called,

123
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,160
 he's called Michael Bond, but he's not that Michael Bond,

124
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,240
 but it was that thing where things look so similar

125
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,680
 that you can get lost incredibly easily

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
 because there's nothing to tell it apart,

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
 and there were incidents in that,

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,440
 so people at the Appalachian Trail,

129
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,960
 they wander off the path to go and have a piss,

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,320
 and then take your rucksack off, you know,

131
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
 presumably if you wear a heavy rucksack every day

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
 and you take it off, you've got an absolutely set way

133
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,520
 of doing it, but if you're sort of quite new to it,

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,000
 or whatever, you can't remember that I turned left

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,240
 as I took it off, and then when you go to put it back on,

136
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
 you think, is it facing towards the path, is it not?

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
 And people are found dead, you know,

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,360
 just tens of yards away from where they left the park,

139
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,480
 because they cannot find the way,

140
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,760
 but I think the distance thing is about panic as well,

141
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,520
 if you're feeling lost, and you don't find where you need

142
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,800
 to get to within a hundred meters,

143
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
 and already you were uncertain where you were, for instance,

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
 and I imagine you think I'd better go back to where I was,

145
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
 so I think there's a fear element to it.

146
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
 You've got to be very foolhardy to go,

147
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,440
 I'm just going to keep going in that way.

148
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,520
 - But I think we really can't walk straight.

149
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,680
 I mean, that's, it's just really impossible

150
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,600
 for humans to walk straight without landmarks,

151
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,120
 but I think you're right, the panic thing which sets in

152
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 means that we also over adjust,

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,200
 so you think you're walking straight,

154
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 but I think instinctively you think,

155
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 oh, I must have wobbled a bit there,

156
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,280
 because your brain is constantly making little mistakes

157
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,080
 of perception, it thinks you just wobbled a bit,

158
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
 you better rewobble.

159
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,760
 - And then you sit down to measure your legs

160
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,640
 before you do it. (laughing)

161
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,160
 - There's an interesting thing about this

162
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,960
 with virtual reality.

163
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
 So because we can't really walk in a straight line,

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,680
 if you're in a VR situation, so you've got your goggles on,

165
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
 and you're walking towards something,

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,480
 the VR can slightly change the horizon

167
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,040
 and change the things around you

168
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,440
 that manipulates you into walking in a circle

169
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,640
 when you think you're walking in a straight line.

170
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,040
 And what they can do is they can get someone in a VR

171
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,640
 who thinks they're walking in a straight line forever

172
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,720
 for miles and miles and miles and miles,

173
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,480
 but you can do that in a room that's just 44 meters wide,

174
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,400
 because it manipulates you to go into a 44 meter circle,

175
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,360
 where you think you're going straight the whole time.

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,320
 - That must be frightening, because you know,

177
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,840
 you've seen before they put the headset on

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
 that you're in a small room that's only 44 meters wide.

179
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,000
 - Yeah, you've both of them before they go in the room.

180
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You say, "Right, we're about to go onto the Savannah."

181
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,200
 So good luck out there, yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
 - But it is really interesting.

183
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,480
 - It's amazing.

184
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,080
 - And it just means that for now you can have video games

185
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,200
 where the whole area goes on forever,

186
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,040
 but you don't need a forever room.

187
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,240
 - That's useful, we'll save costs.

188
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
 - So because of the realness,

189
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,720
 if I don't have one, but a friend of mine has a VR headset,

190
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,480
 and I insisted that he bought a cricket game for it,

191
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,080
 and then I was just, money well spent, his money,

192
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,600
 but nevertheless well spent.

193
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
 And although you've just gone into the city,

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
 and you know where everything is,

195
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
 within a while you're just in this different world,

196
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,120
 and it's not even very realistic,

197
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,880
 because the visual cues, and you've got the ones in your ears,

198
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,920
 you're so immersed in it that within seven minutes

199
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
 you have sort of collided with a radiator

200
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
 or whatever it might be,

201
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,720
 because it's hard to imagine that you're not where you are,

202
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,200
 and to hold in your head those things that, you know,

203
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
 you might signpost them before you put the goggles on,

204
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,600
 but that's gone, that information.

205
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,160
 - But we've played that, haven't we, Anna?

206
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,240
 - Oh yeah, we did play a remote game.

207
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,640
 - Was that the oval?

208
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,480
 - Yes.

209
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
 - Well, what, you think it was oval?

210
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 Actually, it was a 44 meter circle.

211
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,280
 - Yeah, in the savannah.

212
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,000
 (laughing)

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,280
 - Have you guys heard of Tristan Goole?

214
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,120
 - Nope.

215
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
 - Sounds fun.

216
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,640
 - I don't remember that name, I think.

217
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,480
 - He's terrific.

218
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,040
 So he's the only living person to have both solo flown

219
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,540
 and solo sailed across the Atlantic.

220
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,240
 So he's a very good explorer and adventurer and navigator,

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,280
 but he writes a lot of books

222
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,880
 about how you can tell your surroundings from,

223
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,000
 you just look at your surroundings

224
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
 and you can tell where you are.

225
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,640
 But he has these amazing tips, which I just,

226
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,280
 if you're out in the wilderness listening to this podcast

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
 and you're lost, snails need lots of calcium carbonate

228
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
 to build their shells.

229
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,280
 So if you see any away from a pond,

230
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
 that's a sign that you're on a chalky landscape.

231
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,240
 - Is that helpful?

232
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,680
 - I might have just saved someone's life.

233
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,320
 - Did they not also need moisture snails?

234
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
 - Yeah.

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,920
 - So why are they going so far away from this pond?

236
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,960
 - Oh, maybe some water's gathered in a leaf.

237
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,800
 I don't know all the other...

238
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,760
 - You've got to sort of have a geological map

239
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,800
 in your head, haven't you, for the chalky bits.

240
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,560
 - You do have to remember which bits of the country

241
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
 are chalky. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

242
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,560
 I don't know where I am, but gosh, it's chalky.

243
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,800
 Is that the same as we've found?

244
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,640
 - Yeah, it's doors that have a lot of chalky.

245
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,480
 - Hello, something emergency services.

246
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
 I couldn't tell you where it is,

247
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,240
 but it is undoubtedly chalky.

248
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,680
 I know because there are snails.

249
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,200
 Thank you.

250
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,280
 Yes, I'll hold.

251
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,520
 (laughing)

252
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
 - Okay, fair point.

253
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,080
 Well, he can identify a bonfire

254
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,800
 if there was a bonfire somewhere years ago

255
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 based only on the foliage that's grown around it since then.

256
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
 - Again.

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,480
 - Okay.

258
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
 (laughing)

259
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 - That's the whole country every Guy Fawkes day.

260
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,040
 - I think he's terrific, I love him.

261
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,640
 - On going in circles, Mark Twain had a nice story

262
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,680
 in his, he wrote a travel log called Roughing It.

263
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
 And he had a nice story of how he went,

264
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
 they headed out in a snowstorm.

265
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
 They had to get somewhere.

266
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,880
 And there was one man in their crew

267
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,960
 who was a real cocky guy called Olandorf

268
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,440
 who bragged about how he had natural navigation skills.

269
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
 They didn't need a map.

270
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,080
 He had inbuilt sense of direction.

271
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,480
 And they were all on horseback

272
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
 and they wandered for about almost an hour on horseback.

273
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,880
 And then they found some fresh tracks and thought,

274
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,080
 brilliant, well, they'll be headed towards the,

275
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,320
 the place we're headed or follow them.

276
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
 And then they kept,

277
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,400
 they kept meeting more and more people

278
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,600
 joining the party of fresh tracks every half an hour.

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
 And they wanted for two or three hours

280
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,960
 before someone said,

281
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,040
 "You are so Olandorf, these are our bloody footprints."

282
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,760
 - If you've been walking in the savannah for a long time

283
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
 and it's sunny,

284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
 then you can tell which way you're going

285
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,960
 by which side your sunburn's on.

286
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,200
 Oh, that's, yeah.

287
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
 In the Northern Hemisphere,

288
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,360
 if you're more sunburn on the left side of your face

289
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,400
 or your left arms, you're probably going westward

290
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,480
 because the sun's in the,

291
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
 - Oh, in the south.

292
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
 - Yeah, yeah.

293
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
 - Yeah.

294
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
 - That's useful.

295
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
 - You can also look at where the sun is, right?

296
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
 - You can't look at the sun, of course.

297
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
 - You shouldn't go blind.

298
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
 - Of course, don't look at the sun.

299
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,280
 But I think that's how we instinctively--

300
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,640
 - So which side your blind are on?

301
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,720
 (all laughing)

302
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,600
 You know, you feel sort of coming at it from an angle.

303
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,440
 - Yeah.

304
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,800
 - But it's daytime, so you can't use the North Star.

305
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
 - That's true.

306
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,000
 - I didn't realise why the North Star is the North Star.

307
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 As in why it's useful for navigation.

308
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
 Should it come out earliest?

309
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,080
 It's just, it's a fixed star.

310
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,640
 So all the other stars revolve around it.

311
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,800
 And that's because it's sort of

312
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,360
 above the North Pole as it were.

313
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,120
 So it moves a tiny fraction in the sky,

314
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
 but really it doesn't.

315
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
 I just didn't know that.

316
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,640
 I never did my D.O.E.V.

317
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
 So it's aligned with the Earth's axis.

318
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
 So over the course of the night, it stays still,

319
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
 which is very helpful.

320
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,840
 - Do you know who else uses the stars to navigate?

321
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,400
 Dung Beetles.

322
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,240
 - Oh yeah.

323
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
 - Yeah.

324
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,280
 And they found this out by taking them to a planetarium.

325
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,840
 (all laughing)

326
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,000
 This was scientists at Lund University.

327
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,720
 They took some dung beetles to a planetarium

328
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
 and showed them the Milky Way

329
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,680
 and saw which way they went.

330
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,080
 And then they covered up the Milky Way

331
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,440
 and saw they went in different wild directions.

332
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,720
 And when the planetarium turned into Madam's Swords,

333
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 presumably they were completely lost.

334
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,560
 I thought I was going home.

335
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,040
 Now I'm heading towards sort of Dr. Crippin,

336
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,760
 or Prince William, or--

337
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 - Or Lord of Medehasenborough.

338
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
 - Yeah.

339
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,280
 (all laughing)

340
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,800
 - Did you guys know you can all echolocate?

341
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,720
 Almost certainly.

342
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
 Most of our listeners can echolocate.

343
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,880
 I mean, like bats can.

344
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,040
 - That's how I get here from the tube every time we record.

345
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
 - Yeah.

346
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
 - Possibly blindfold on and start screaming.

347
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,960
 (laughing)

348
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,240
 So you're listening for the echo

349
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,960
 and that tells you how to move.

350
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,440
 - It tells you how to navigate and where you are.

351
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,600
 And there have been a few studies into this.

352
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,560
 But I think the first one was in the 1940s

353
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,080
 and it blindfolded a few people

354
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,040
 and it told them to walk towards a wall

355
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
 and stop just before the wall.

356
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
 And they did it.

357
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,440
 But then when they carpeted the floor

358
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
 and then they walked

359
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,620
 and they weren't making footstep noises anymore,

360
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,280
 they all walked into the wall.

361
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,760
 And so it turns out we just,

362
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
 and naturally I've tried this myself

363
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
 and I think I do need a few minutes more practice.

364
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
 - Come on, let's clear the furniture.

365
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,060
 Let's see how this goes, yeah.

366
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,900
 - But isn't that amazing?

367
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,740
 And we can all do it.

368
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,080
 And humans can actually be taught to be quite good,

369
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,920
 quite fast.

370
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,760
 - What do you hear?

371
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,800
 Are you hearing things or are you sensing air pressure?

372
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
 - You're hearing things.

373
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,560
 So you're hearing the slight difference in sound echoes.

374
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
 You're hearing the sound bouncing back

375
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
 from your footsteps off the wall.

376
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,760
 And we can tell amazing things.

377
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,600
 Like in studies, they found that people can tell the shape

378
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,680
 of something they're going towards.

379
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,840
 So they'll put a triangle in front of them

380
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,000
 and they'll say, you know, this is, yeah.

381
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,480
 - If you imagine yourself at one end, say, of a subway

382
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,680
 and you're spun around and you've got a blindfold on.

383
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,720
 So already it's quite terrifying.

384
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
 But don't worry, it's an experiment you're part of.

385
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,320
 But you mentioned in a situation like that

386
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,680
 where you've got hard, concrete walls or whatever,

387
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,140
 you would back yourself, wouldn't you?

388
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,000
 To work out, right, left to your own devices.

389
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,680
 Which direction is the other end of the subway in?

390
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,600
 Where are the walls and whatever?

391
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,960
 Because you'd be able to hear the, you know, the echoes

392
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,760
 and where things were bouncing back from.

393
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
 I'm sure you'd back yourself.

394
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,520
 - Would you not press your back yourself?

395
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
 I mean, we should be backing ourselves.

396
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
 - I'm not sure.

397
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,600
 It depends on the stakes really.

398
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,160
 - But the difference, but if you've got walled,

399
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,720
 say two feet either side of you

400
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,960
 and then the other wall isn't there

401
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,640
 for sort of another 40 meters.

402
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,480
 - Yeah.

403
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,760
 - But then it's also just the ears, like the eyes

404
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,600
 and the nostrils, isn't it?

405
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,880
 We're using the input from each of those

406
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,080
 to sort of work out the information.

407
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 Like our vision isn't real, is it?

408
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,400
 That sounds mad.

409
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
 What I mean is what we see, the image that we see

410
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,640
 is that's constructed in our brain, isn't it?

411
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,240
 From the information from the two different eyes

412
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,760
 and the same way with nostrils,

413
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,280
 you could view a following smell

414
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,040
 and you could think that's more of that.

415
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,840
 - Yeah, triangulation, things like that.

416
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,160
 - Yeah.

417
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,920
 - Can I tell you one more thing about getting lost?

418
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,760
 - Yeah, go for it, yes.

419
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,480
 - This is in 2011, a computer scientist

420
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,360
 called Ben Kerman invented Get Lost Bot, okay?

421
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,920
 And this was a technology

422
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,400
 which tracks your movements every day.

423
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,280
 And if you are too predictable,

424
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
 it sends you somewhere new.

425
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,360
 So if you have the same lunch at the same cafe every day,

426
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,320
 it will direct you to a different cafe.

427
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
 - That's clever.

428
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,040
 I read that like if someone had your mobile phone

429
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,600
 and got all the data off it,

430
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,480
 they'd be able to tell where you are

431
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,320
 and any time of any day to within like a 90% accuracy.

432
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
 - 'Cause we're doing the same routes.

433
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

434
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,960
 - So exactly, and this thing was not popular, by the way.

435
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,800
 - No, not probably with office bosses.

436
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,040
 It's going, "Where have all my staff gone?"

437
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,920
 - When you say if someone gets hold of your phone,

438
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,080
 I mean, they haven't got hold of our phones.

439
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,400
 - Yeah, no, absolutely.

440
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,280
 - They know where we are and what we're doing now or whatever.

441
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,520
 - It didn't work very well Get Lost Bot

442
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,680
 because one user found the app,

443
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,440
 had noticed him going to church every Sunday

444
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,680
 and told him to visit a nearby mosque instead.

445
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
 (laughing)

446
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,720
 - That's very clever.

447
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,600
 - It's going to be open on a Sunday.

448
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,680
 And other issues.

449
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,940
 (laughing)

450
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,520
 (upbeat music)

451
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,960
 - All right, there's time for fact number two

452
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,880
 and that is Andy's fact.

453
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,560
 - My fact is that one of the fiercest critics

454
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,280
 of poet Alexander Pope was a writer

455
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
 called Esdras Barnivilt.

456
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,840
 This was a secret identity

457
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,080
 and the real person criticising Alexander Pope

458
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,080
 was Alexander Pope.

459
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,800
 - Wow, what a twist.

460
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,360
 - The last person you'd expect.

461
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
 - Yeah.

462
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
 - He wrote a full thing slacking off his major work.

463
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,040
 - Was he doing it so why?

464
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,960
 Was he like being self-hating

465
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,840
 or was he trying to get ahead of his critics maybe?

466
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,960
 - I don't think he was.

467
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,120
 I think a lot of this stuff was done for fun

468
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,200
 and loads of stuff was anonymous at the time.

469
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,880
 So it wasn't mad to have a lot of stuff coming out.

470
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
 So it was literally on the day that his epic poem,

471
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,040
 which is called The Rape of the Lock,

472
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,320
 is about a society woman who has a lock of her hair grabbed.

473
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,000
 So it's based on the Iliad and the Odyssey, but it's fun.

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
 (all laughing)

475
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
 - More fun.

476
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,960
 - More fun, yeah, yeah.

477
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,440
 But he wrote, on the day it was published,

478
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,360
 he brought out a key to the lock under this fake name,

479
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,240
 Esdras Barnivilt, and he wrote to Pope.

480
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,040
 He addressed Pope directly himself

481
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,320
 and said he's writing an antidote against the poison

482
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,400
 which has been so artfully distilled through your quill.

483
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,240
 - So what did he do?

484
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,560
 Like say this bit's shit?

485
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,120
 How hard did he say it would have been better

486
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,360
 if you'd done it this way?

487
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,960
 - I think he was advising a bit about the meaning of it

488
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,360
 and maybe throwing in some other games

489
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,200
 and things along the way.

490
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,920
 I mean, it was just a fun thing to do.

491
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,400
 And he did this a second time, actually.

492
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,920
 So in 1735, there was a publisher who'd brought out

493
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,640
 an edition of Pope's letters.

494
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,960
 Apparently his unauthorized letters were being published.

495
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,280
 Imagine just someone publishing your WhatsApps

496
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,400
 like full, just nightmare.

497
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,160
 And this publisher was called Edmund Curle, with two L's.

498
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,000
 - How many are?

499
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,580
 (all laughing)

500
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,440
 - It's so weird that you stress the R and not the L.

501
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
 (all laughing)

502
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
 - But this was not true.

503
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
 Pope had collected his own letters.

504
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
 He'd edited them very carefully,

505
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,520
 then arranged for Curle to get hold of them.

506
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
 But he had instigated it.

507
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,880
 And then he had them seized.

508
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,440
 They were actually fake letters.

509
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,840
 Then two years later, he releases his actual letters.

510
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,080
 All sorts of just horse play going on.

511
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,520
 - So they're confusing games.

512
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,800
 What's he playing out there?

513
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,480
 And wasn't this thing there that he had a plan

514
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
 that some of those letters contained

515
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
 some correspondence with various members of parliament

516
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,480
 or the nobility where it was actually legal

517
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,040
 to expose them 'cause they're of a certain status.

518
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,400
 So he thought, oh, good Curle will be seized

519
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,440
 by the authorities, which he sort of was.

520
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,560
 But then no one cared.

521
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
 - But then he fell out with Curle

522
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,320
 'cause Curle had now thought, oh, now this is cool.

523
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,880
 I can just do all the letters I want.

524
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,400
 So he got a load of other letters.

525
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
 Ones that he didn't want anyone to see and publish those.

526
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,840
 And so Pope met him at a pub, the Swantaband,

527
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,600
 and gave him an emetic to cause him

528
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,680
 to go into convulsions of vomiting.

529
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,760
 - And that's why the toilet's still blocked in that.

530
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,520
 - And then Pope wrote some pamphlets about that,

531
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,880
 about his vomiting.

532
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
 And so they really fell out those two.

533
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,760
 - But is it done for fun or is it sinister?

534
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,800
 - I think it's for fun.

535
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,160
 - But it depends whether your Edmund Curle

536
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,800
 will be giving an emetic in the pub.

537
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,120
 Having a spasm in a pub toilet turns.

539
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
 You think, this has gone beyond banter.

540
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,960
 - Yes.

541
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,400
 - This is perfectly harmless.

542
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
 Just lashing lads, didn't you do that?

543
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
 Yeah, yeah.

544
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
 I don't know.

545
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,400
 I mean, he was a really, really funny guy.

546
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,360
 He was strange.

547
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,280
 He was called the wasp of Twickenham, was his nickname.

548
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
 - I think he was quite cruel.

549
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,520
 - He had to just turn up a pic next to him.

550
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,560
 - But yeah, even people who liked him.

551
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,040
 I think Virginia Woolf's dad, Leslie,

552
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,520
 wrote a biography of him.

553
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,120
 And even he said, look, I like his writing.

554
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
 It's very funny.

555
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,880
 It's very clever.

556
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
 And mostly, by the way, we should say he was famous

557
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
 for his translation, his serious translations

558
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,080
 of the Iliad and the Odyssey at the time.

559
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,920
 He said, I like his writing,

560
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
 but still, morally, it's a bit indefensible

561
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,840
 to like this guy 'cause he's so horrible about everyone.

562
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,160
 He called him a monkey pouring boiling oil on his victims.

563
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,520
 - That's a good reason for him to criticise himself

564
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,080
 first, essentially, isn't it?

565
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
 So he's one of the people who are in the sights

566
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,920
 of this sort of mystery critic.

567
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
 And then he goes, well, it can't be me.

568
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,800
 He's had a go at me.

569
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,880
 And then he can really, you know, go at people.

570
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,080
 So I suppose that's the mistake.

571
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,760
 Is it that more contemporaneous sock puppets have made

572
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,800
 is to not turn the gun on themselves first?

573
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,640
 - He didn't do all his other criticism.

574
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,880
 The mistake he actually made was not criticising everyone

575
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,640
 under the pseudonym, sadly, which would have been safer.

576
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
 - All of his other criticism was under his own name.

577
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,120
 - Was under his name, I like the sound of both.

578
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,960
 It's very confusing because there was a big thing

579
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,640
 between Protestants and Catholics at the time.

580
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,120
 So this is the end of the 18th century.

581
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,240
 William and Mary had come in.

582
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,680
 They'd swept the Catholics away.

583
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
 Pope was a Catholic.

584
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,920
 And so there was a lot of criticism of his work

585
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,440
 for being too popish.

586
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,000
 But that is quite confusing.

587
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,400
 - He wasn't allowed to go to university.

588
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,240
 - No, no.

589
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,160
 - No positions of trust or power.

590
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
 So what do you do?

591
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
 - The term wasp then that would be not,

592
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,400
 he wouldn't refer to himself as that.

593
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,320
 Nowadays you might label yourself waspish, wouldn't you?

594
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,360
 - Yeah, I reckon he would have labelled himself.

595
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,200
 I think he quite loves things.

596
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
 - But I think it was that other people called him that

597
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
 because he had an illness called Pots disease.

598
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,240
 He was only four foot six.

599
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,000
 And he found it very difficult to do anything basically.

600
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,320
 And I think that probably is what slightly made him

601
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,160
 an angry little man.

602
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
 - He was four foot six which made it difficult for him

603
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,440
 to do anything or he was four foot six.

604
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,400
 - No, he was also, yeah, like he had lung problems,

605
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 heart problems.

606
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,640
 He had problems walking and standing up for long periods

607
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
 and stuff like that.

608
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,800
 - There was a theory that his growth was restricted

609
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
 because of his nurse's milk.

610
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,960
 - I believe that is true.

611
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,720
 'Cause it contained a bacteria called myobacterium tuberculosis.

612
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
 - It doesn't sound good.

613
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,800
 - No, it doesn't.

614
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,680
 (laughing)

615
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,320
 - Yeah, and it causes this thing.

616
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,800
 And he was worried about it.

617
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,360
 And he wrote to Lady Mary Wartley Montague

618
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,280
 who was someone who he really fancied for most of his life

619
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,320
 saying that he imagined a place where women best like

620
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,960
 the ugliest fellows and look upon deformities

621
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,520
 as a signature as a divine favor.

622
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
 So he was like really,

623
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,080
 he knew that he was not an attractive man.

624
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,480
 - Yeah, be hard not to know 'cause you clearly aren't.

625
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,200
 And then everyone's telling you you're hideous as well, so.

626
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,760
 - But you're also slacking them off in print.

627
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
 - Yeah, and you're slacking yourself off in print.

628
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,720
 And it's very, and it's often should be limited,

629
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,440
 nowadays you could join an app that was specifically

630
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,640
 sort of dating app for people who are short

631
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,880
 and have had odd milk and he would be besieged

632
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,240
 with offers and opportunities.

633
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,560
 - You do wonder if he might actually in this day and age be,

634
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,520
 this is a kind of my facile thing people say on radio,

635
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,600
 isn't it, be a meninist, what are they?

636
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,880
 You know. - In cell?

637
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,520
 - An incel, yes.

638
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,320
 Well, he's small, he's got some confidence issues

639
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,160
 and he hates everyone.

640
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,880
 His podcast would have been terrific.

641
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,720
 We do know that.

642
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,560
 - Very good, wouldn't it?

643
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,400
 - Oh, yeah.

644
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,240
 - Slacking everyone off.

645
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,840
 - The podcast is really good.

646
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,800
 He would never have called himself a wasp

647
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,160
 because that means white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

648
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,400
 - Yes. - Oh, of course, yes, yes.

649
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,640
 - He was white Anglo-Saxon Catholic.

650
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
 - Yeah, that's true.

651
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,840
 - The nickname unpickable, can you already forgotten it,

652
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,880
 the nickname, the name he gave himself

653
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
 for writing criticism. - Oh, Esdras Barnveld.

654
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
 - Oh, yeah.

655
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,320
 - Esdras Barnveld.

656
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,160
 - Stupid idea, I haven't looked up.

657
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,480
 - I don't know if it's an acronym or a--

658
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
 - Clues or anything about it.

659
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,880
 - Well, Esdras looks like cod latin, doesn't it?

660
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
 Do you know what I mean?

661
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
 - It does a bit. - It's like, yeah.

662
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,240
 - But it doesn't quite work.

663
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,760
 - Thanks, Miles, I'm gonna spend the rest of this fact.

664
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,720
 Just reel in the message over and over and over.

665
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,560
 - No, you're right, I should have--

666
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,280
 - Could be an anagram or something.

667
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
 - I'm just gonna write out the,

668
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,640
 I'm just gonna write a little spider map of the letters now.

669
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
 - Just while you two are doing that,

670
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,080
 I was gonna mention just to Jane something about it.

671
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,280
 - Boris Dippelman, I think it's, yeah.

672
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,680
 - You think that I'm not getting involved

673
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,160
 with this anagram or stuff?

674
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,080
 - Sick. - You've known me

675
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,480
 for 12 years and-- - I'm not gonna get

676
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,600
 involved in it, you can talk to me.

677
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,240
 - Thank you, I really appreciate that.

678
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,000
 This lady, Mary Montague, he fancied her.

679
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,320
 She didn't fancy him.

680
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,000
 Quite an awkward moment where he made

681
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,920
 very, very passionate love to her

682
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,280
 in the old fashioned sense, he didn't, you know--

683
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,520
 - Was it wooing? - Wooing, yes.

684
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,680
 - Propositioning, yeah.

685
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,480
 - And she said that it was like a very awkward moment.

686
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
 He'd chosen a socially stupid moment to do it.

687
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
 And-- - She was basically convulsing

688
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,800
 in her pet toilet. (both laughing)

689
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,040
 - Yes.

690
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,800
 - She said that he did it so passionately

691
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,840
 that in spite of her utmost endeavors to be angry

692
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,960
 and look grave, she had an immediate fit of laughter.

693
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,840
 So she burst out laughing in his face,

694
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,680
 so then they became sworn enemies

695
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,160
 'cause he was quite upset.

696
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,440
 But the amazing thing about her is

697
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,280
 she invented the smallpox vaccine.

698
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,120
 And I think, I'm surprised we ever mentioned her before,

699
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,960
 actually. - Yeah.

700
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,440
 She was part of that, wasn't she?

701
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,320
 - A few people would claim,

702
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,000
 Jenna was there as well at the time in the area.

703
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,400
 She was the one who first, she went to Turkey

704
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,440
 'cause her husband was an ambassador.

705
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,120
 And she noticed that the locals in Turkey

706
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,440
 visited this lady who injected them

707
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,040
 with little bits of smallpox

708
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,760
 and the children seemed not to get it.

709
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,160
 And so she was the first person who said,

710
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,400
 "Right, I'm gonna get my kid exposed

711
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,360
 "to these weird smallpox rubbings."

712
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
 - The really fun thing about that

713
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,320
 is that he then started writing horrible poems about her

714
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
 and saying, like, making jokes about smallpox

715
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
 and the other kind of pox like venereal disease

716
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,960
 and saying that she, you know, she had syphilis or whatever.

717
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,800
 - Who did he?

718
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
 - And she got really upset about it.

719
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,440
 And so what did she do?

720
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,480
 She went to Sir Robert Walpole, the prime minister,

721
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,760
 and asked him to have a word.

722
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,600
 - Terrific.

723
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,200
 - We can all do that with our enemies.

724
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
 - I know.

725
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,160
 But yeah, he really fancied Lady Murray.

726
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
 - Yes.

727
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
 - Whenever he was with her,

728
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
 he would start talking in over elaborate puns.

729
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
 - Oh, oh, Alexander.

730
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,880
 You're already fighting some considerable disadvantages

731
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
 in the romance game.

732
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,000
 Don't do the elaborate puns.

733
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
 - I think it might work for some women.

734
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,200
 - James, you're...

735
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,160
 - James, you married you in spite of that.

736
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,400
 (laughing)

737
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,940
 (upbeat music)

738
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

739
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,040
 and that's my fact.

740
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,120
 My fact this week is that the first person

741
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,280
 to map the functions of the brain

742
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,640
 did so by literally sticking labels

743
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,280
 to different bits of it on a living person.

744
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,180
 - Sticky labels?

745
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,760
 - Yeah, they look like little post-its.

746
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,000
 And I read the study and I couldn't find out

747
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
 exactly what they were made of.

748
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,440
 - It doesn't feel like, 'cause they must have glue on them.

749
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
 - Yeah, I think that...

750
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,520
 - Doesn't feel very healthy for a brain.

751
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,440
 - And also to have had a large chunk of their skull...

752
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,400
 - Oh yeah.

753
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
 - Yes, no, also.

754
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
 - I mean, that struck me first.

755
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,160
 - Awesome.

756
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
 - It's temporary, isn't it?

757
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
 - Yeah.

758
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,680
 - Temporal.

759
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,520
 - It grows back.

760
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 (laughing)

761
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,800
 - It's like earthworms.

762
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,200
 You just wear a cap for the rest of your life.

763
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,160
 This was a Canadian neurosurgeon called Wilder Penfield,

764
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,320
 and he was the first person to do that thing

765
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,280
 that you might have seen in Hannibal,

766
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,400
 but also in brain surgery,

767
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,960
 which is safe if you do it right,

768
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,280
 where you can remove someone's scalp while they're awake

769
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,760
 and perform brain surgery on them.

770
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,760
 And he was trying to remove bits of brain

771
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,220
 that caused epileptic seizures

772
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,120
 on people who couldn't be cured any other way,

773
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,760
 but without damaging any other bits of the brain.

774
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,720
 And so he got a little electrode,

775
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,200
 stimulates lots of bits of the brain,

776
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,760
 and then writes down exactly what those bits do.

777
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,920
 So he, you know, poke a bit,

778
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,160
 and then he'd write something like,

779
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,920
 "Twitching of the left arm,"

780
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,360
 or, "Hmm, numbness of right side of the tongue,"

781
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,200
 and he can ask them.

782
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,720
 - Evacuation of the bells.

783
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,520
 (laughing)

784
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,800
 - Repeated cries of help.

785
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,960
 (laughing)

786
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,280
 - And so he'd put numbered labels

787
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,640
 and lettered labels on each bit,

788
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,960
 and he was basically the person who created the map,

789
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,440
 the thing that mapped the brain onto the body,

790
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,280
 the homunculus.

791
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,520
 So he drew, in his study,

792
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,720
 once he performed all these experiments,

793
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
 a picture that you've probably seen,

794
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,360
 or seen variations of,

795
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,200
 where you have the brain,

796
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,560
 but then you draw sort of following the line of the brain,

797
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,840
 you draw the size of bits of the body,

798
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,660
 depending on how much brain is allotted to them.

799
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,000
 So, you know, each section of this strip of brain,

800
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
 he found that controlled all of our movement,

801
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,800
 there was a section devoted to each finger and the thumb,

802
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,840
 and lots of big sections devoted to the face,

803
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,240
 the eyes, the nose, the ears,

804
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,080
 but then, you know, you've got a tiny torso,

805
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,220
 because what does the brain need to do with this?

806
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,800
 - So it's like a very monstrous figure with a big head,

807
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,000
 big hands, big genitals.

808
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,840
 - Exactly.

809
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,960
 - The male homunculus has big genitals,

810
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,320
 because men devote more of their brain to, you know,

811
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,640
 you're conscious,

812
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,280
 but the female doesn't have any genitals at all,

813
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
 and that might be because his sample size was very small

814
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,920
 of the women he was asking about this,

815
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,760
 an experiment, I think it was 2009.

816
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,040
 - 'Cause it certainly isn't that women

817
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,880
 don't have a single bit of their brain

818
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,040
 devoted to their genitals,

819
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,280
 so they've got everything else.

820
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,000
 But yes, we don't really know why he missed the women off,

821
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,640
 but I think it was actually a woman

822
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
 who drew the homunculus for him,

823
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,480
 called Mrs. Hortense Cantley,

824
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,760
 and I think some people have suggested

825
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,840
 she was a bit too prudish.

826
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,320
 - She said, "I'm not drawing that."

827
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,160
 (laughing)

828
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,600
 Certainly not at the size you suggest.

829
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
 (laughing)

830
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
 Make sure you look as if I think of nothing else.

831
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,120
 (laughing)

832
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,600
 - Exactly.

833
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,040
 - This thing, this method he invented

834
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,880
 that you're describing,

835
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,480
 the, you know, your brain is exposed,

836
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,240
 don't being operated on, but you are awake,

837
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,600
 is called, I just love this,

838
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
 the Montreal Procedure.

839
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,200
 And it sounds very spy-film-y, doesn't it?

840
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,480
 You know, like, the Ottawa Protocolls.

841
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,080
 You know, there's just a sort of, it's quite cool.

842
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,880
 But if you see people playing a musical instrument

843
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,760
 during their surgery, that's the thing,

844
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,480
 because they need to work out

845
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,760
 how to not damage your brain

846
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,280
 and the bit of you that's doing fine motor movements.

847
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,120
 So if you play the violin, that's really useful to them.

848
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,840
 If you can't play the violin, it's very bad.

849
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,160
 Yeah, yeah.

850
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,000
 And it's got to be an instrument

851
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,160
 that's sort of bearable as well

852
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,000
 within the slightly stressful environment

853
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,840
 of an operating theatre.

854
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,160
 - Oh yeah, you don't want bike bikes.

855
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,640
 - Yeah, exactly that.

856
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,480
 - There was last year.

857
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
 - Not many space for a harmonium in here.

858
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,800
 (laughing)

859
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,320
 There was someone last year in Wisconsin,

860
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720
 he developed really shaking hands

861
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,880
 and he couldn't, it got to the point,

862
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,040
 he couldn't pick up his granddaughter

863
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,680
 and he really wanted to sort that out, obviously.

864
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,960
 And he was operated on for deep brain stimulation.

865
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,080
 And they said, well, do you play an instrument at all?

866
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
 And he played the trombone.

867
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,680
 (laughing)

868
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,000
 - Well, he didn't, in the end, he didn't play it.

869
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,240
 He did the fingering movements,

870
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,200
 but it turns out that when you play the trombone,

871
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,800
 you know, it causes high pressure.

872
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,920
 - You know, when you just said,

873
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,000
 when you do the fingering movements

874
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,840
 and then you mined fingering,

875
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,680
 do you know how to play a trombone?

876
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,160
 (laughing)

877
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,520
 - Not, you will play the clarinet there.

878
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
 - Yeah, I'll play it.

879
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,440
 - That's a, yeah, alto sax.

880
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,280
 - Yes.

881
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,920
 - That's why my big band failed.

882
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,600
 It would have caused too much pressure inside its head,

883
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,400
 which might have killed him.

884
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,880
 So, yeah.

885
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,720
 - That's the last thing you want

886
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 when you're doing brain surgery on someone.

887
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,560
 - It's very clear.

888
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
 This is brain surgery.

889
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,520
 I had brain surgery in 2021.

890
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 And I, so, I then, I found myself sort of fascinated

891
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,640
 by that, you try not to think about it too much beforehand,

892
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,600
 but then afterwards, you think, gosh,

893
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,080
 I'd have to know how that worked.

894
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,440
 I'm not saying I'd like to sort of witness it happening.

895
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 I remember having knee surgery once

896
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,360
 and saying to a friend, is it a physio?

897
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,680
 It sounds fascinating, the operation.

898
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,800
 It's a shame it's not a local anesthetic,

899
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,640
 'cause I quite like to watch it.

900
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,840
 And she said, you would absolutely not.

901
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,680
 (laughing)

902
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
 I see a lot of these, no, you would really,

903
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,600
 you would really struggle.

904
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,440
 - Oh, really?

905
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,560
 - But the actual brain aspect of it, I mean, it's so,

906
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,200
 you know, in terms of there's a heavy machinery

907
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,040
 that is required.

908
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,520
 And then there's sort of a very sensitive work

909
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
 that's done once that bit's done, you know.

910
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,200
 - Yes.

911
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,040
 - It's absolutely, you know.

912
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,880
 - Yeah.

913
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,720
 - Contrast of skills.

914
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,560
 - Yeah, well, that's the best.

915
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,800
 Then you get a thing like an old fashioned sort of 1970s

916
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,880
 ashtray basically plonked on top of your head

917
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,600
 so they can sort of lead instruments on it or whatever.

918
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,200
 So you sort of turn you into a kind of giant fondue,

919
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,040
 I suppose.

920
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
 - Is that what it is?

921
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,840
 - Yeah, so I've got some dents in my head,

922
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,000
 which are like, what's that bit from?

923
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 They go, oh, that's just where the thing was attached.

924
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 You know, this tray is, they'd attach to people's car doors

925
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,600
 for their burgers and things that drive through.

926
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,160
 So sort of clip on.

927
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,360
 - The clip on the equipment shelf onto your brain.

928
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,200
 - Do you not kind of wish they left it there?

929
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,160
 It could be useful.

930
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
 - For just for storage.

931
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,840
 - Yeah.

932
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,680
 - Yeah.

933
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,000
 - Yeah, I think so.

934
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,480
 - I feel like we've got a house with quite a few

935
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,160
 sort of low door frames and things like that.

936
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,000
 How can I see it?

937
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
 How can I see it beginning to impact other members

938
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,560
 of the household as well?

939
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,520
 On my own, of course, I don't see it, I love it, you know.

940
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,400
 - So they sort of had to open and then,

941
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,560
 yeah, they sort of went around the side of the back for me.

942
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,080
 - I find it strange thinking of,

943
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,440
 'cause what Wilder Penfield was doing

944
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,320
 was operating on the surface.

945
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,160
 - Yeah.

946
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,960
 - But not the, I don't know if he got into

947
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
 the very deep tissues of the brain and how that's,

948
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
 I can't understand how they get through

949
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
 one bit of the brain to get to the rest of it.

950
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,360
 I think that's extraordinary.

951
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,120
 - Well, now they can use a sort of laser knife, I think.

952
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,440
 So you're doing, that's basically,

953
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,680
 you're targeting something specifically,

954
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,040
 not just in a sort of two-dimensional way,

955
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,600
 but in a three-dimensional way.

956
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,320
 Goodness knows how the science of that works.

957
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,160
 - Is that what they did?

958
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
 Do they use a laser on you?

959
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 - For me, no.

960
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,440
 What I had was a fairly, within this particular field,

961
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,280
 quite a straightforward view.

962
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,200
 - Just a spoon.

963
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,920
 - Just a spoon, yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,800
 - Dessert spoon, please.

965
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,960
 Do you wish you'd been awake during it?

966
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,120
 - No, I, no, I don't, I really don't.

967
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,520
 But I am sort of fascinated by the, I just,

968
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,960
 I didn't used to be sort of fascinated by it,

969
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,280
 I just sort of slightly take it for granted, I suppose.

970
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,880
 But the idea of then doing something so extreme

971
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,280
 and the sheer usefulness that that is now

972
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,680
 in terms of what symptoms that can be related

973
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,600
 to an aspect of the brain and therefore you could have no,

974
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,640
 you don't have to go in at all.

975
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,880
 You could just go, "Oh no, this is textbook."

976
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,760
 If that's happening, it's because

977
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,000
 there's a specific issue and it can be got to

978
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,760
 without us even going inside you.

979
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,600
 - Yeah.

980
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,720
 - You know, a sort of piece of laser equipment

981
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,560
 can handle that.

982
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,040
 That's, I mean, it's completely remarkable.

983
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,880
 - It is mad.

984
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,720
 - And I feel like we always owe such a big thank you

985
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,560
 to Epileptics over the last 100 years for it

986
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,640
 'cause it's basically them who are always

987
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,560
 being experimented on.

988
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,160
 Like hundreds of times, if you've got epilepsy,

989
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,760
 they're fascinated because you have an excuse

990
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,840
 to open the brain, so they say, "While we're here,

991
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,440
 do you mind if we do lots of twiddling around

992
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,760
 to find out how the brain works?"

993
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
 - That's what Penfield was doing quite a lot, wasn't it?

994
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
 - That's what Penfield was doing, yes.

995
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,520
 - I find him so interesting.

996
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,720
 He had a really amazing life.

997
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,880
 He's a classic friend of the podcast, I'd say,

998
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,800
 in that served in the First World War.

999
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,520
 His ship was torpedoed and sank.

1000
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
 His obituary was printed,

1001
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
 despite him not being dead when that happened.

1002
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,960
 He was a road scholar at Oxford.

1003
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,080
 He was a football coach before that in his homeland.

1004
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,520
 He was a medical ambassador after all these big discoveries.

1005
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,280
 His sister had a terrible brain cancer

1006
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,360
 and he operated on her to try and save her life.

1007
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
 Really complicated surgery and very dangerous.

1008
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,560
 He had to remove an eighth of her brain in the process.

1009
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,880
 He wasn't able to save her life in the end,

1010
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,720
 but he did grant her years more of life

1011
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
 that she wouldn't have had otherwise.

1012
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,200
 But he was really pioneering.

1013
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
 He was just discovering new things all the time

1014
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,120
 and then having to do the most difficult thing imaginable.

1015
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,200
 I imagine operating on a member of your family

1016
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,480
 to try and save their life, just extraordinary.

1017
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,240
 - I think there's a time after which

1018
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
 it does count as saving your life.

1019
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,600
 If someone's lived an extra five years,

1020
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,520
 plus I'd be saved their life, you can claim that.

1021
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,400
 - It's a terrifying area in which to be a pioneer in.

1022
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,720
 I remember some builders saying to us when we lived in Peckham,

1023
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
 we talked to them about loft extensions.

1024
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,840
 So we haven't done one before,

1025
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,560
 but of course you have to do a first one, don't you?

1026
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,080
 And we thought, "Nah, sorry, guys."

1027
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,680
 The idea of having that conversation

1028
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
 in a sort of neurology war.

1029
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,920
 Terrifying.

1030
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,440
 - Can I do something quickly about how the brain evolved?

1031
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,600
 'Cause it's kind of mental, right?

1032
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,840
 So you go back to the start of animals.

1033
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
 You have something called coano-flagellates,

1034
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,480
 and they're the relatives of all animals.

1035
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,280
 And they are the first ones

1036
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,880
 where the cells can talk to each other.

1037
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,320
 So that's kind of where brain cells begin,

1038
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,760
 because you've got lots of cells talking to each other.

1039
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,720
 And they have been described as a sperm wearing a skirt,

1040
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,400
 'cause that's what they look like.

1041
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,800
 Basically, they're very, very simple animals.

1042
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
 - Sounds like the sort of thing

1043
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,480
 Pope would call someone that he had got.

1044
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,840
 (all laughing)

1045
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,960
 - And then you got neurons, okay?

1046
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,680
 So these are actual brain cells.

1047
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,000
 And they started in something called an herbilitarian.

1048
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,320
 Oh, he said, "hypothetical animal."

1049
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
 But it's definitely a common ancestor

1050
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,360
 of all the animals that are split in two.

1051
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,480
 So like, basically all mammals

1052
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,280
 and lots of other animals as well.

1053
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,240
 They had the first tiny brain.

1054
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,480
 They also had the first eyes and the first anuses.

1055
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,800
 And people usually draw them like a little slug, okay?

1056
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,480
 - Okay, their pioneers, seriously.

1057
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,920
 And socially, they must have been very popular, you know?

1058
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,360
 They're cut above the neighbors.

1059
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,560
 - Yeah, yeah. - They've got eyes,

1060
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,640
 they've got, what was it?

1061
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,680
 - An anus. - An anus and a brain.

1062
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,920
 - People must have been terribly bunged up till then.

1063
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,560
 - Please. (all laughing)

1064
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
 Very uncomfortable.

1065
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,320
 - Often things would come out of the same way as the mouth.

1066
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,240
 - Oh, dear.

1067
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,240
 - Very much an Alexander Pope and Mr. Curl situation.

1068
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,200
 - Pope toilets were ruined across the world.

1069
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,600
 - And then it's really difficult for brains to evolve, right?

1070
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,640
 - Because you kind of need them to work all the time.

1071
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,800
 So you can't just keep trying things

1072
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,120
 because if you try something,

1073
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,720
 probably that animal will struggle to live, right?

1074
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,920
 - Sort of mutations. - To mutate, right?

1075
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,200
 So sometime around 500 million years ago,

1076
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,720
 two organisms had sex

1077
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,640
 and their entire genome was duplicated, okay?

1078
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,600
 And these are relatives of all the future mammals

1079
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
 and all the future kind of this.

1080
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,520
 And when you had two lots of the genome,

1081
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,080
 that meant that one half of the genome

1082
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,640
 could start practicing and start trying things out.

1083
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,520
 And then you get loads more mutations there.

1084
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,840
 And you might have an extra arm here

1085
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,600
 or an extra bigger brain or whatever.

1086
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,440
 And that's really important for brains to develop.

1087
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,800
 And then we now think, and this is really recent,

1088
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,640
 we think that that happened a second time,

1089
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,400
 about 100 million years ago,

1090
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,080
 where the entire genome got duplicated.

1091
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,200
 And that's when the brains got much, much bigger.

1092
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,240
 And we're not sure about that,

1093
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,480
 but it's called the Ono Hypothesis.

1094
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,320
 - Hypothesis?

1095
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,280
 - After Japanese geneticists, Sumo Ono.

1096
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,120
 (all laughing)

1097
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,960
 - Very good.

1098
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
 - So there's no exclamation mark.

1099
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,680
 - There's no exclamation mark.

1100
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,160
 - Not only one, that's perfect.

1101
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,280
 - And then you get the brain.

1102
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,760
 There's a few other steps.

1103
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,600
 (all laughing)

1104
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,800
 - But now you've got it to the punch line.

1105
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,120
 (all laughing)

1106
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,280
 - I just found this funny name

1107
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,800
 and I thought, how am I gonna get to it?

1108
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,060
 - Long and winding road.

1109
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,840
 (upbeat music)

1110
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number four and that's James.

1111
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,920
 - Okay, my fact this week

1112
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,920
 is that in 1885, a Samoan king plotted to kill a rival

1113
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,320
 by disguising his army as a 200 man cricket team.

1114
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,080
 (all laughing)

1115
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,240
 - Was he caught out?

1116
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,480
 - Oh, yeah, very good.

1117
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,320
 - Was he caught out?

1118
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,160
 - When he slipped.

1119
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,000
 - Yeah.

1120
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,640
 - Yeah, let's get those out of the way.

1121
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,760
 - Is it a bit sledgehammer to crack or not?

1122
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,360
 Getting a 200 man team to kill one rival.

1123
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,880
 - Oh, well, the rival would have had an opposition army.

1124
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
 - Oh, he had his own men coming.

1125
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

1126
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,560
 - 400 ping pong players.

1127
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,480
 (all laughing)

1128
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,460
 - So this is 19th century Samoa.

1129
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,440
 Cricket had been brought over by the British

1130
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
 and they kind of had their own version

1131
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
 that had lots and lots and lots of players in a team.

1132
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,280
 We might get to a specific cricket in a minute

1133
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,500
 and how that's different than normal cricket.

1134
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,840
 But he was in Apia, the capital of Samoa

1135
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,240
 and he'd heard that his rival was gonna come over

1136
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,640
 and try and take over

1137
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,680
 and he decided he was gonna get in there first.

1138
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,760
 So he sent like a Trojan horse of cricketers

1139
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,400
 'cause you might have a really big cricket team

1140
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,320
 in those days.

1141
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,780
 They had like the cricket bats and the cricket balls

1142
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,560
 in these boats when they're going from one island

1143
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,080
 to another, but underneath were guns

1144
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,640
 and grenades and stuff like that.

1145
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,880
 - So they weren't just gonna use the ball to the back

1146
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,160
 'cause this was the days before Bodyline was banned.

1147
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
 So you could really just kill people.

1148
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,600
 - That's true.

1149
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,960
 - Just like sharpened stumps and things like that.

1150
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

1151
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,760
 - But the coup was foiled in the end

1152
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,920
 thanks to the indiscretion

1153
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,160
 of one of the players.

1154
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,680
 - Oh, she must have, that's a very poor team member.

1155
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,020
 - Yes.

1156
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,580
 - That's like Kevin Peterson texting the opposition.

1157
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,920
 I mean, what's going on?

1158
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,320
 That's a very nice reference, but what specific cricket

1159
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,160
 then if you can have?

1160
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,880
 'Cause obviously to us like 200, that would be like

1161
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,840
 that's half the playing staff of the county championship.

1162
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,080
 It would sort of stick out like a sore thumb, wouldn't it?

1163
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,960
 But you could have the specific cricket

1164
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,800
 has complete different rules.

1165
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,640
 - Yeah, definitely.

1166
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,000
 So Samoa wasn't really into cricket for ages

1167
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,840
 and then it turned out that the British brought cricket

1168
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,120
 to Tonga and Tonga got really into it.

1169
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,600
 And they would, the Tongans would go over to Samoa

1170
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,480
 and say, "Oh, you guys can't play cricket, you idiots."

1171
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,800
 And so the Samoans decided

1172
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
 that they were going to get into it as well.

1173
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,280
 - They're very childish aren't they, the Samoans?

1174
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,000
 Yeah, you're probably not supposed to say it.

1175
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,240
 - It comes across that way, doesn't it?

1176
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,560
 But then it just kind of evolves that way.

1177
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,440
 You know, like village against village.

1178
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,200
 Even in those times, soccer and rugby and stuff

1179
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,440
 was quite often much bigger teams like village against village.

1180
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,920
 But in Samoa, yeah, it kind of evolved that way.

1181
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,280
 And it's known as kilikitty.

1182
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,560
 It's actually pronounced cricket,

1183
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,080
 but it's spelled kilikitty.

1184
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,600
 So most people would say kilikitty.

1185
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 - It's really fun.

1186
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,360
 - Yeah, and you might have,

1187
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,320
 instead of one batsman at each side,

1188
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,480
 you might have three batsmen at each side

1189
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
 and you would have no sixes and fours.

1190
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,160
 You would just whack the ball

1191
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,400
 and then just keep running and running.

1192
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,240
 - Run as many as you can.

1193
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,440
 - Quite often you would have runners,

1194
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,920
 which you don't really get in cricket these days so much.

1195
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,720
 So if you were overweight,

1196
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,200
 you would just get a young person

1197
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,120
 in to do all the running for you and stuff.

1198
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,920
 - Is this kilikitty?

1199
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,760
 I'm gonna say that.

1200
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,600
 - Let's say kilikitty, yeah.

1201
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,640
 - The Samoan version.

1202
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,760
 It was so much fun that when in the year 1900,

1203
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,960
 Britain ceded control of Samoa to Germany,

1204
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,800
 the Germans banned it.

1205
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
 'Cause it was taking up so much people's time.

1206
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,800
 And in Tonga, in fact,

1207
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,640
 they had to pass a law

1208
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,320
 that you're only allowed to play it one day a week.

1209
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,880
 'Cause everyone was just bunking off the whole time

1210
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,000
 to go and play cricket.

1211
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,440
 'Cause also, if you're that many people playing,

1212
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,840
 presumably, you could be perhaps not very active

1213
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,520
 in the game, but be quite happily absorbed.

1214
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,160
 If you've got 200 people on each team,

1215
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,000
 then there's quite a few passengers, aren't there?

1216
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
 - Absolutely.

1217
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,760
 - The level of which I play,

1218
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,880
 you can have sort of two or three people.

1219
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,720
 I could sort of, you know,

1220
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
 I pulled a muscle the other week

1221
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,840
 and I couldn't really move and that was fine.

1222
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,440
 - Doesn't make any difference.

1223
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
 - If you've got 200 people,

1224
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,120
 you really could turn up going,

1225
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,960
 where's the sort of quieter?

1226
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
 The ball doesn't seem to be going anywhere much.

1227
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,320
 - Yeah, you're so right.

1228
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,160
 - They did ban it,

1229
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,800
 but actually no one paid any attention to it.

1230
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,240
 They carried on playing anyway.

1231
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,920
 But there was a civil servant there

1232
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,320
 called Philip Snow.

1233
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
 This was just before it was ceded to Germany.

1234
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,800
 And he said that work,

1235
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,000
 Wesleyism and women were all suffering

1236
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,640
 due to cricket, basically.

1237
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,080
 He was saying, because people were so into cricket,

1238
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,280
 they just were doing nothing else.

1239
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,200
 They weren't going to church.

1240
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,360
 They weren't looking after the family

1241
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,480
 and they weren't doing any work.

1242
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,520
 - I mean, cricket's more fun than all those things.

1243
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,160
 So, he was CP Snow's brother.

1244
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,680
 For anyone who likes to read CP Snow.

1245
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,400
 Philip Snow, this chap who went out

1246
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,840
 and yelled at cricket.

1247
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,160
 - And CP Snow was?

1248
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
 - And CP Snow was a writer.

1249
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,480
 I've actually never read any CP Snow.

1250
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,720
 - I've read the two cultures.

1251
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,560
 - Is he good?

1252
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,400
 - It's terrific.

1253
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,600
 It's about the world of arts and the world of science

1254
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,440
 and how...

1255
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,600
 - Anyway, back to cricket.

1256
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,560
 (laughing)

1257
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,760
 - It's basically saying, I'll just say it,

1258
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,920
 if you say, I don't know what an atom is,

1259
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,880
 no one looks down on you in a social setting, right?

1260
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,400
 Whereas if you say, I've never heard of Mozart.

1261
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
 - I've never read CP Snow.

1262
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,000
 (laughing)

1263
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,160
 - That people will think you're a complete

1264
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
 irretrievable idiot.

1265
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,880
 And he was saying, this is not really a reasonable thing

1266
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,760
 because actually atoms are arguably

1267
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,160
 even more important than Mozart.

1268
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,960
 And you shouldn't have this huge divide

1269
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,040
 between the two cultures.

1270
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,840
 - Mozart was made of atoms in many ways.

1271
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,680
 - Exactly.

1272
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,520
 (laughing)

1273
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,640
 - And so, it's mad that the absolute granular,

1274
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,840
 like the most basic floor level entry thing of science,

1275
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,440
 for example, knowing what an atom is.

1276
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,320
 - We're not expected to know.

1277
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,720
 - We should be expected to know that.

1278
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,560
 You know?

1279
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,400
 Anyway, it's a terrific essay.

1280
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,320
 It's an essay, it's not even a book, it's short.

1281
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,200
 - Anyway, cricket, you're talking about cricket?

1282
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,040
 - Yeah, sorry.

1283
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,960
 - When I'm killer kitty, the bowling is all throwing.

1284
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,080
 So, you know in cricket, you're not allowed to throw the ball.

1285
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,920
 You're not allowed to chuck.

1286
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,480
 - I've seen it, I've seen it, I'm telling you.

1287
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,400
 - You had to keep a straight arm the whole time

1288
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,440
 and sort of go over the top of your head

1289
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,800
 and throw the ball like that.

1290
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,880
 But you're not allowed to,

1291
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,720
 if you were to throw a snowball, for instance,

1292
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,840
 you would bend your elbow, wouldn't you?

1293
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,240
 - Yes, I would.

1294
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,480
 - We've already said in the past

1295
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,760
 that you're not great at throwing things.

1296
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,200
 - No, and this is taking me right back

1297
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,000
 to a cricket ball throwing competition,

1298
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,280
 which I lost as a boy.

1299
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
 We don't need to get into it back.

1300
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,120
 Mental snake pit.

1301
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,200
 - But it was too a nine-year-old, isn't it?

1302
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,040
 - It was too a seven-year-old.

1303
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,880
 - So sorry, seven.

1304
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,720
 - And you were at what age?

1305
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,560
 - 14.

1306
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,720
 - Okay, did they have particularly long arms?

1307
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,560
 She did not.

1308
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,400
 (all laughing)

1309
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,040
 But she was German and I think that gave her

1310
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,560
 a sudden athleticism, which meant that I, yeah, anyway,

1311
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
 look, when I actually grew up in sort of Soviet era,

1312
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,400
 she'd been one of these people

1313
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,860
 who had been sent to a throwing college

1314
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,880
 from the age of three.

1315
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,720
 (all laughing)

1316
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,560
 She heavily drugged.

1317
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,080
 She's clearly never seen a cricket ball

1318
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,200
 before in her life being German.

1319
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,280
 - Roided up to the max, yeah.

1320
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,840
 Anyway, look, we're not here to,

1321
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,320
 if I could have one bit of my brain removed,

1322
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,040
 I think it might actually be that memory.

1323
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,800
 (all laughing)

1324
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,800
 - So this is according to a writer called C.H.B. Pridham,

1325
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,400
 who said about the bowling as all throwing.

1326
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,600
 He also said, "There is no idea of defensive play."

1327
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,080
 So in cricket, if someone bowls to you,

1328
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,240
 a lot of the time you're just trying to stop them

1329
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,120
 from getting you out.

1330
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,920
 You're not trying to score runs, but there was none of that.

1331
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,480
 And he also said, "Barracking is not in the Australian model,

1332
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,840
 but consists of pious invocations of the deity."

1333
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,340
 So you wouldn't say, you know, why are you so fat?

1334
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,240
 'Cause every time your wife shags me,

1335
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,280
 she gives me a biscuit or whatever.

1336
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,120
 You would say--

1337
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,960
 - As we would say.

1338
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,440
 (all laughing)

1339
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,920
 - As Shane Moore famously said,

1340
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,160
 but you would say instead, God's gonna get you.

1341
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,120
 - You've been abounding and neglecting your Wesleyanism.

1342
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,060
 Would you say that?

1343
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
 - Yeah, exactly.

1344
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,920
 - But that really hurt in the 19th century.

1345
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,120
 And they really, in Calicutty,

1346
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,740
 they really sort of made it official, the Barracking.

1347
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,080
 So they had, this was a particularly Calicutty in Samoa,

1348
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,560
 so slightly different between Pacific islands,

1349
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,040
 but they had cheerleaders called Lapé,

1350
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,280
 and they would dance and they would sing

1351
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,120
 to support their--

1352
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,960
 - The Lapé dancers.

1353
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,840
 (all laughing)

1354
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,960
 No, darling, no, it's not what it sounds like.

1355
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,440
 (all laughing)

1356
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,600
 It just sound like, actually it does sound like it.

1357
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,920
 (all laughing)

1358
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,040
 But actually, it could be that this was all just one man's

1359
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,920
 excuse for something that I've read,

1360
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,640
 but apparently the Lapé dancers would sing around

1361
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,040
 and the batsmen would get all geed up,

1362
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,400
 and then once their sides bowled out,

1363
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,800
 then they switch over to the other group of Lapés,

1364
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,320
 and they're the ones who Barrack and Hurlabue sat

1365
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,920
 the opposition as their backing.

1366
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,880
 - This all sounds better than the hundred.

1367
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,720
 (all laughing)

1368
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,760
 As a format, I think.

1369
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,280
 - So you play cricket, Miles, don't you?

1370
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,320
 - Yes, and not, I should say, to a very high standard.

1371
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,880
 - With your county days are behind you.

1372
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,400
 - Long behind, and in many ways ahead.

1373
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,160
 (all laughing)

1374
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
 - Are you a butter or a bowler?

1375
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,440
 - I'm bits and pieces, really.

1376
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,520
 I'm there, I particularly like the bit afterwards,

1377
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,960
 where you sit down in a camping chair

1378
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,880
 and talk about what's just happened.

1379
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,600
 To me, that's what the day is building up to.

1380
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,040
 - It's very important to happen to this.

1381
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,040
 - James, you like going to really unusual places

1382
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,760
 at unusual times, I think that's fair.

1383
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,320
 Have you ever been to Bramble Bank?

1384
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,160
 - Give me more?

1385
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,000
 - I have.

1386
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,840
 - In the Solent?

1387
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,680
 - Yes, I have.

1388
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,160
 - Oh, no, I haven't, in fact, if it's in the Solent, no.

1389
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,120
 - This is, so we're talking for international listeners,

1390
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,000
 just between Southampton and the Isle of Wight, basically.

1391
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,320
 - Yeah, it's sort of in the French channel.

1392
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,760
 - Yeah, just La Monche, if you're listening from,

1393
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,960
 no, we have no French listeners,

1394
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,800
 we've shaken them all off over the years.

1395
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,640
 - Why does that happen?

1396
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,280
 Are we really delivering policy stuff about cricket,

1397
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,120
 basically, yeah.

1398
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,880
 - As a group of people who have played a gig in Paris,

1399
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
 we could definitely say we have no French listeners.

1400
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,160
 - Oh, really?

1401
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,760
 - But basically, there is the sound bar

1402
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
 in the middle of the Solent,

1403
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,880
 which drains out twice a year for one hour or so.

1404
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,720
 - Yeah.

1405
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
 - And they try and play a game of cricket on it

1406
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,800
 as soon as it opens up.

1407
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,640
 - And you've been there?

1408
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,400
 - Yeah, I did a thing with Stuart Broad, the England Cricketer,

1409
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,840
 where it was sort of a promotional thing,

1410
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,400
 but we had to get there very early,

1411
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,240
 quite early in the morning,

1412
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,520
 we've got, I think, a boat called us Rib,

1413
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,160
 which is like some sort of speedboat thing

1414
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
 that they hang quite a lot of people on,

1415
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,080
 and arrive at this, and they just start playing.

1416
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
 It's very, it's not very big at all.

1417
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,960
 It was quite, you know, just as much you get on this can.

1418
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,840
 And they do set up some stumps quickly,

1419
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,200
 and just play a sort of a game of knock about cricket.

1420
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,840
 I was umpiring, Stuart Broad was playing.

1421
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,960
 - I'm gonna say, if you just turned it up there

1422
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,720
 with your mates on this sort of sand bank,

1423
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,480
 and Stuart Broad turns up on the greatest bowlers

1424
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,320
 of all time.

1425
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,840
 - It was, yeah, I mean, the golf obviously is extraordinary,

1426
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,800
 but he was just whacking everything.

1427
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,080
 But you have to, you know, you're fielding,

1428
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,760
 you have to go and get the ball out of the sea and stuff.

1429
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,080
 - Yes, it doesn't land in the water.

1430
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,920
 - Well, yeah.

1431
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,200
 - Yeah, and it just gets to a point where they go,

1432
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,760
 "Okay, it's up to our ankles, we've got to go."

1433
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,320
 The last sort of bit you're playing.

1434
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,480
 And there was spectators as well.

1435
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,840
 Of course, the longer the game goes on,

1436
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,240
 the closer the spectators have to stand for the action.

1437
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,080
 There are people playing the game.

1438
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,400
 We're further away from the wickets and the spectators.

1439
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,880
 - And all the lap dancers as well, that must be a nightmare.

1440
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1441
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,280
 - The idea of being on the south coast after the game is over,

1442
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,480
 like being a part of like the immigration authorities,

1443
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,680
 and seeing one of these small inflatable boats coming back,

1444
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,120
 and looking at them, thinking,

1445
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,720
 "Is that Miles Jappens, Stuart Broad?"

1446
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,560
 (laughing)

1447
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,880
 - What are they?

1448
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,120
 - I hope we're not expecting a coup.

1449
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,360
 (laughing)

1450
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,800
 - Amazing.

1451
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,080
 Have you heard of the fellowship

1452
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,440
 of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club?

1453
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,280
 - No.

1454
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,440
 - So this is a Dutch team,

1455
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,280
 and they only play one game every year,

1456
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,680
 but it always has to be somewhere strange.

1457
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,040
 So the first game they played

1458
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,280
 was on the borders of Belgium and Netherlands.

1459
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,960
 You know, it's a really sort of funky border

1460
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,720
 where you can walk from the Belgium into the Netherlands

1461
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,080
 across the border like 10 times.

1462
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,120
 The second game was against the Vatican.

1463
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,440
 They thought that they were gonna win that easily,

1464
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,240
 but they got absolutely battered.

1465
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,080
 (laughing)

1466
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,880
 They thought it was gonna be a load of Cardinals and stuff,

1467
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,520
 but it turned out to be a load of theology students.

1468
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,360
 - Brilliant.

1469
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,760
 - Who were all great at cricket, it turned out.

1470
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,480
 - Should have called themselves the Vatican.

1471
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,240
 (laughing)

1472
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,080
 Carry on.

1473
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,400
 - I'm trying to pull Lady Mary-Wartley-Montague off

1474
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,240
 and it shows over.

1475
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,480
 (laughing)

1476
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,920
 - Oh, dear.

1477
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,800
 It doesn't even feel worth carrying on after that, does it?

1478
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,640
 They played Iceland in the Northern Arctic.

1479
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,320
 - It was more hard to trump the invention of the Anus.

1480
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,880
 (laughing)

1481
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,320
 - They played Andorra and they, in 2017,

1482
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,160
 the last one I could find,

1483
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,400
 they played a place called Hirst Schanger in Munich,

1484
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,720
 and they chose that as Fairly Odd

1485
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,080
 because of the proximity of the Newt Sombavers

1486
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
 in nearby garden.

1487
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,320
 (laughing)

1488
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,480
 - Were they sort of a target?

1489
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,720
 Was it like that's a four?

1490
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,720
 That's a six?

1491
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,040
 - Six and out.

1492
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,640
 - Yeah.

1493
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,960
 - Wide ball.

1494
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,560
 No, it's just the way the lights show falling across it.

1495
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,640
 - Let me see your googly.

1496
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,320
 (laughing)

1497
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,160
 - Crikey.

1498
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,160
 - Oh, crikey.

1499
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,160
 - Oh, dear.

1500
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,560
 - You went on Mastermind years ago, didn't you?

1501
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,960
 - I've done it twice, yeah.

1502
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,800
 - Oh, have you?

1503
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,000
 Well, once your specialist subject

1504
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,080
 was David Gower.

1505
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,400
 - Yeah, that was unsuccessful.

1506
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,320
 - Is it?

1507
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,720
 - Yes, the first time, though,

1508
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,760
 it was Mike Latham.

1509
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,720
 Cricketer Mike Latham.

1510
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,560
 - Okay.

1511
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,960
 - And I had no passes on that one,

1512
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,640
 but I didn't really get out on the block

1513
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,680
 second time.

1514
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,120
 - Both times, you picked a cricketer.

1515
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,920
 - So it's not broad interest, isn't it?

1516
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,040
 - It's why, because they say, what's your,

1517
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,880
 no, not at all.

1518
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,720
 - He has got a broad interest.

1519
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,200
 (laughing)

1520
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
 - Well, David Gower, do you know,

1521
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
 I wonder if there's something that you don't know about him,

1522
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,280
 but did he ever tell you?

1523
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,840
 So did you meet him?

1524
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,760
 - Many times, yeah.

1525
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,600
 - Okay, you have?

1526
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,440
 - Yeah.

1527
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,280
 - I was reading about him.

1528
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,040
 So he's a famous, he was an England cricketer.

1529
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,880
 - Thank you.

1530
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,000
 - In the eighties.

1531
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,480
 He sounds like quite a fun guy, actually.

1532
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,040
 In 1990, he went on holiday to St. Moritz,

1533
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,520
 and he had, there was a frozen lake,

1534
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,200
 and he was in a hire car at three in the morning.

1535
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,600
 You can only imagine that if he was breathalyzed,

1536
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,520
 it might not have gone well,

1537
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,760
 but I'm not saying that I know that for sure.

1538
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,600
 It was three in the morning,

1539
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,160
 and he thought, I'll drive around on the lake.

1540
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,760
 And he spent an hour zooming around on the lake,

1541
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,600
 you know, doing handbrake turns and spins

1542
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,400
 and having a great time.

1543
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,880
 And then he saw a patch of what he knew was thin ice.

1544
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,120
 He thought, cool, I'll try and drive towards that

1545
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,960
 and brake just before I get to it.

1546
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,600
 - Just sensible decisions at three a.m.

1547
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,640
 You know, is it crooked?

1548
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,800
 Isn't exciting enough on this day?

1549
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,880
 (all laughing)

1550
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,360
 - And he misjudged it, and he didn't break in time,

1551
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,280
 and the car sort of went through the ice

1552
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,120
 and got quite stuck, and he tried to reverse out.

1553
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,920
 So it didn't go all, it didn't sink all the way down.

1554
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,320
 It just got a bit wedged in the ice, broke through.

1555
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,000
 So eventually he had to climb out and walk back to the hotel,

1556
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,400
 went to bed, and the next morning came down

1557
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,080
 and said to the hotel manager,

1558
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,040
 would you mind sort of calling your people

1559
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,480
 and checking if there's still a hire car on the lake?

1560
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,720
 'Cause I need to go and pick it up.

1561
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,520
 And sadly the hotel manager said, no, there's not.

1562
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,520
 - No, there's no longer any ice on the lake.

1563
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,640
 - Yeah, exactly.

1564
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,840
 And the hire car was never seen again.

1565
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,000
 But that made me think, he sounds like fun.

1566
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,120
 - He's Johnny, yeah, well he injured himself.

1567
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,320
 I think he did the crester run.

1568
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,680
 - I think he once had to miss some matches

1569
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,680
 'cause he'd broken himself between the crester run.

1570
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,840
 - Did he? - What'd I do?

1571
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,080
 - Bob sledding. - Yeah, yeah.

1572
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,760
 - He also did that in the hire car.

1573
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,080
 (laughing)

1574
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,600
 Hurt, yeah, it certainly does.

1575
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,860
 (laughing)

1576
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,440
 (upbeat music)

1577
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,840
 - Okay, that's all of our facts.

1578
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,360
