00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray. And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite packs from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Okay, my fight this week is that Thomas Edison was once almost killed by a flying badger.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Was this one of his inventions that have gone wrong? Absolutely right, he's a badger cannon. And one of the badgers got stuck in it and he kind of prodded it to see if the badger would get free and then it went off in his face.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Wow, that's not it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Dan's thinking I've researched about it. Two badger incidents? No, he was riding on a locomotive on a train and he got very friendly with people who were engineers on this train and they let him sit on the cow catcher, which is the little bit of metal in the front of the train, so kind of knocks things out of the way.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 It looks like if you picture the front of a night of the realm like like Solancelot's helmet that sort of bent and sticks out. The pies are bit that they look through looks like that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 That's a great description.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Yeah, he said the engineers gave me a small cushion and every day I rode in this manner. Only once was I in danger when the locomotive struck an animal about the size of a small cup bear, which I think was a badger.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 This animal struck the front of the locomotive just under the headlight with great violence, so it just passed his head and hit the train.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Imagine this was when he was quite young, I think it was about 31 or 32 at the time, so we could have never had all the things that he invented.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 We got killed by a badger.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 We wouldn't have had the podcast recording our voice.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 That's what the world would miss the most.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Everyone's walking around in the dark because there's no light bulbs going on. I wish I had a podcast.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 This is just a weird thing about Edison. I know we spoke about Edison a lot, but I can't believe I've never heard that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I know it's extraordinary.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 That was a year or so before he really got on his hot streak of inventions, wasn't it?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Yeah, he was famous-ish. They were still, they were calling him Professor Edison at that stage.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 He had done a few bits of inventing, we hadn't done the major inventions.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 The cool people were already into him who were going to spurn his later work.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 It does feel like a timestamp moment, doesn't it?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Time travellers back and we'll go back to alter history by just making the badger hit him.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Do you know what I mean? That's the moment where you could kill him.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 You'd have to be very skilled to place a badger in the exact place that when it hits a cow catcher, it goes and hits Edison in the face.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 You're right, there's probably a lot of failed attempts where you could just swap the badger for a cow. That would probably do it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Do you think?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Yeah, because cows are so much larger than badgers.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 So the harder to throw up in the air?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Actually, I don't know what happens when a train hits a cow catcher.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Well, I read some accounts of what happens, so they're very impressive.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 We do know what happens.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Sorry, I don't know exactly what happens yet, but a really good cow catcher, like a very effective one,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 could if it hit an ox, which would weigh up to 900 kilos, or 2,000 pounds, it could throw it 30 feet into the air.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 No way.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Come on.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 You've got a whole train behind it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I guess so, yeah.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 But in those days, they weren't going as fast.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Is this like a modern bullet train?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 No, this is a contemporary account.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Is it?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's a good cow catcher, yeah, yeah.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 So so much to do the mass on the Japanese bullet train and how high a cow would go under those like it was going to orbit?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I think it would.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Cow would jump over the moon.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 We know what happens.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 They were, it wasn't uncommon to ride on them.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Turns out.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Yeah, look them up.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 So I was looking them up in the British newspaper archive.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And there were just stories everywhere of people who took rides on the cow catchers.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So there was this woman in 1893 called Lady Grey Edgerton and she was holidaying in Canada.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And she said she asked the driver.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So it wasn't a regular thing, but she went to the driver and she said, can I sit in the cow catcher for the journey?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And apparently he said, look, all your purposes will be answered by riding in just the front cabin with me.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And it's very dangerous, so no.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 But then as she wrote, he was eventually obliged to allow that the scenery could be seen much better sitting on the front of the engine.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 And so he let me do it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 I think that is good.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Edgerton also said that it was so that he could see the scenery and stuff like that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Yeah.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Actually, there was one more modern one.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I think, didn't Jeremy Corbyn once sit on the cow catcher because he couldn't find the seat on a virgin train?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 That's a pretty niche joke.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Listen, there's an America going, what the hell is this all about?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 That's really, so it's like the 19th century equivalent of going into the cockpit on a plane, isn't it?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 It's a special perk that not many people get.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Yeah.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 No, it's going on the nose of the plane.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 It's like the 19th century equivalent of going on the DLR and getting that seat at the front.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 It looks like you're the driver.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 I think you've won around the American listening.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Does anyone know who invented the cow catcher?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 I mean, you must have done because you researched it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I do.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Yeah, it's incredible.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Oh, don't.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 It was invented by Charles Babbage, who invented the computer.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Wow.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Oh, that is surprising.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Yes.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 One of them really has stayed with us more, isn't it?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 I guess so.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Although, like, Babbage's computer, he invented a different engine, which was like an early prototype of the computer.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And people aren't really sure whether he made it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 I don't think he did make it, actually.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And actually, the cow catcher, it was supposed to be used between Liverpool and Manchester, but it didn't really, it didn't catch on if they ever made it.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And he also invented really big shoes for walking on water.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Cool.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And also speaking tubes that were supposed to link London and Liverpool.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And I don't think they ever got made either.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 So I'm wondering about Charles Babbage.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Yeah.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 What did he actually do?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Did the shoes, the water shoes, presumably, didn't work or did they?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 No, they didn't really work, because he invented them when he was 16 years old.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And he tried them out and he nearly drowned.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Oh.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Okay.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Presumably it does work if you just have to have really big shoes.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 It's basically like you've got two boats and you put one foot in each boat.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And that's not an invention.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 That's just straddling two boats.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 So the question is, how small can you make the boats?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Yes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 How small is a boat before it becomes a shoe?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 I think that's what we're wrestling with it.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 The first train to have a cow catcher on that we know of was called the John Bull, which is quite pleasing.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Was it?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Yeah.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Oh.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 It was in 1833.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 I read one story from 1963, which must have been when cow catchers were going out of fashion a bit.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 But one story from 1963, which reported that 65-year-old Mrs. G. Reorden came riding into Brisbane today on the cow catcher of a train.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And it turned out that she said she wasn't quick enough to get out of the way

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 when crossing the track.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So she grabbed on instead and hung on for dear life.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 She said, I thought of calling out the help when I was on there, but it seemed a bit silly.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 So she just waited until it got to Brisbane.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Wow.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 So some more stuff about Edison, some weird stuff I'd not seen before.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 So this trip where he was on the train, where he almost got killed by a badger,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 it was because he'd been to see a total eclipse of the sun.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Hmm. He'd been to Wyoming where this had happened and he wanted to try out an invention called a Tezin meter,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 which would measure small changes in temperature.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Now, that experiment failed because the device was too sensitive.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 But while he was there, he slept out in the open.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And a man who was there at the time said that Edison told him that when he lay down in the open,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 he wasn't thinking about resting, he lay up and looked at the beautiful stars in clear skylight

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 and invented the incandescent electric light.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 And apparently that is where Edison came up with the idea.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Apart from historical evidence, it indicates that the story is simply a myth.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 But who's to say?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Because lighting had already been invented years before.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 I've had it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And Edison came up with his idea of using these bamboo filaments years later.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And this guy kind of, it was quite a lot of years later when he said,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 "Oh, I remember Edison told me this thing."

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 But he said that he thought Edison was sleeping, but he wasn't, right?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 That's what he said.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Okay, because to me, that sounds like when you're sitting on the couch watching movie with your dad

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 and he's falling asleep and you wake him up, you're like, "No, I'm awake, I'm awake."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Yeah, I'm just inventing the light bulb.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 One thing Edison would do, he was very deaf.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 He was almost completely deaf in one ear and he was completely deaf in the other ear.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 So he really couldn't hear very much at all.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 And when someone was playing music or the piano, he, to listen, would bite the wood of the piano itself.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 That is incredibly off-putting for the performer.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 I would have thought, "What are you talking about?"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 The wood of the piano.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 It's a big thing, the piano.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 I guess he'd pick somewhere where the player could play it

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 and he could sit there biting the piano and listening through his head.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Because the vibrations would obviously make that way to his inner ear.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And there are accounts of him doing this from his daughter

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 and his old, his personal phonograph has toothmugs around the edge.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 No, he was listening to music.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 He must have been the nightmare to go to the orchestra with him.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Yeah, it wasn't this badger incident.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 It wasn't the only time that he sort of had his life in danger on a train.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 So he was actually fired from working on a train because he set up a chemistry lab inside one of the trains.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And it caught on fire while an experiment was going on.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 So the train was on fire and he got fired as a result.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And I found this out weirdly on a site.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 You know, TV tropes, where it just tells you all the great TV tropes.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Edison has a huge entry in TV tropes for the tropes of his life

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 that applied to the tropes he would use in TV.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 So in "Too Dumb to Live", which is a category,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 the badger incident is in there as a TV trope.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 He's got covert pervert.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 He's listed in that as well.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 For what incident?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 So in an interview, when he was talking about the application of the phonograph

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 when he first invented it, he had a list of what you could do with it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And one of the things was you could hide it in the white house as a listening device

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 so you're recording the conversation and then play it back later.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 The other one was that parents could put it in the homes of their married children

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 to listen to the sounds of their Spoonie courtship and Spoonie courtships in quotes.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Spoonie courtship.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 What a phrase.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Yeah, so that gets into the covert pervert.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 I think the website TV tropes is slightly extending its brief a bit here.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 I know.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 There's not a trope being hit by a badger when you're sitting on the front of a trope.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Can I also...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Can you imagine if your Edison's kids and you're just getting down to a bit of Spoonie courtship?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 I bet the bedposts, that is a bite of...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 My fact this week is that there are only two groups of animals on Earth

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 that live entirely on seaweed and they are a type of iguana and a type of sheep.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 They're not in the same place.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 They are not in the same place.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 They don't know each other.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 I don't think they hang out.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 We don't know if they make calls to each other at weekends or letters,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 but no evidence of that.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So this sheep is amazing.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 It's the Northern Ireland of Orkney.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 So it's part of Orkney and right to the north of Scotland.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And 50 people live on it and 2,000 sheep.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 They're very primitive sheep, so they've lived on the island for thousands and thousands of years.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 And they have this amazing thing where they subsist on exclusively seaweed.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 It's so cool.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 It's incredible that my favourite sheep in the world...

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Is it tough competition up there?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 To be honest, I didn't have a favourite until I researched this one.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 But no, I definitely do. That's so awesome.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And they've been living on the seaweed for so long now that...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 So there's a big wall that's been built, a big dike that's maintained by a lady called Shan.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 And she's living there and she's been...

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 She basically has to rebuild this wall all the time because when huge winds come and so on, it gets knocked down.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 So it's a big perimeter. She has to do...

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And in the article I was reading about saying that they're so used to the seaweed now,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 that if they break through and get to grassland, they can't eat grass anymore.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 They've evolved away from taking them...

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 If they eat too much of it, they think it might poison them.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And it hasn't even been that long though that they have been living off seaweeds.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 1832, I think, that people decided to cut them off from the land, basically.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 So the island has built this massive dike, as you say.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 And it was to keep the sheep away from the delicious grassy pasture

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 because they were farming their cows on that.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And so they sort of forced the sheep to just start living off this seaweed instead.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Yeah, so they're still on the outer edge of the island.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Yeah.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Just living on the beach, basically.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Yeah.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Basically, yeah.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Yeah, round the perimeter.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 And so annoying, if you end up sort of on one side and your mate's on the other side,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 because you just can't cut across the middle, you've got to go all the way around.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Well, actually they don't have mates on the other side.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 They always stick together in their little groups.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Oh, do they?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Yeah, and you can't move them from the north to the south or the south to the north.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 If you try and do that, they are having none of it at all.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 They just like staying in their little group.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 They have certain bits of seaweed and they like their bit of seaweed and they don't like any others.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Apparently, if you have to look after them, otherwise they swim out to a rock where you can't get it.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And there are also ones that are called lupers, which are sheep that climb on top of each other

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 to try and get over the wall.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Wow!

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Oh my god.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Isn't that cool?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And so self-sacrificing of the bottom sheep.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Yes.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Unless the ones at the top kind of pull them over, they don't have the possible thumbs.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Yeah.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I'm sure they would, if they could.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 But they know about the tide as well as sheep.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 They know where the tide is and they sleep accordingly.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 So they don't get caught out by it.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And as soon as the tide goes out, they rush out to get the seaweed that's been left behind by it.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And that's why they swim out.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Also for more seaweed.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 I love the idea of being a sheep checking the tide times every week.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Leaning against the wall.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Not until Wednesday will that beach be accessible.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Sean is called Sean Terrence and I found her on Twitter.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So I contacted her in the hope that she might check her Twitter before we recorded today just to see

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 if she had any more facts to give us.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 And turns out she's a massive fan of the podcast.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 No way.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Where her second favorite podcast.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Is the first one about sheep.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 That is guilty feminist.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 It's her favorite.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Really?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Yeah. But so I just asked her instead of getting facts.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 I said, when you're fixing this wall to stop the sheep, do you ever listen to us?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 And she's like, yeah, always.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 I'm listening to you guys as I build the wall.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Oh my god.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 I'm the silent.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Sean, I want to come to the island and help you build the wall.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 He wants to meet his favorite sheep.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Build the wall.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 I'm sorry.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 That's something else.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Sean, I'm so sorry that Dan is so obsessed with our podcast that he meant to go to you for facts.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And then he'll just say, oh my god, so when do you listen to us?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Do you listen to us before you go to sleep?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Do you listen to us when you're with the wall?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 So you got no interesting facts?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Did you go back?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 I did, but I didn't read them because I was just wet down that line, as you say.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 How long has Sean had the job?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Do you know?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Well, it's a three-year post.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 And I think, yeah, I think she's out there for a few more years.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 She just started in the last few months, I think.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 She is awesome.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Just because I read an article from before she got the job, I think, when it was in real disrepair.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And they were trying to fix it.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And they said that the cost of repairs was going to be about £3 million to build this because it just basically,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 you know, they didn't really have anyone with the skills.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And it's not just getting the labour, it's also getting the materials which aren't nearly as prevalent as they used to be.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Because apparently in 1902, it cost four pence an hour to repair the wall.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Wow, four pence an hour.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 That's pretty good.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Although, how many hours does it take?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Maybe it added up to a million after a few years.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Maybe Sean charges an enormous story doing this.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 That's what's happening.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 Did she say something about the sheep eating sea birds sometimes?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 To that day.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Well, this was on your Twitter feed down.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 We just have to click on Twitter and I only noticed the facts that she'd sent us.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 I think she said that the sheep sometimes find bodies of sea birds

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 with the heads and the feet missing at home.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 So Anna, your fact about them only eating seaweed?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Oh, this is snucking.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 This is luxury.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 This isn't part of their diet.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 You're on a five-two diet, aren't they?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 We're two days a week.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 They can eat a seabird's head.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 So that's what she sent.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 They're known to eat the feet and beaks of dead birds on the shore.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 So you see dead birds with feet and beaks missing all the time.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 They get faster.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 They get fatter in the winter because there's more seaweed washed up by the storms.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 And they run up to the dike and over it if it's leaning and into the island side away from the shore

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 and they've been found on airfields as well.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 So, assume there's an airfield on the island.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Do we think they're trying to catch a fly out of there?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 All the planes have sheep catchers on the front of us, so they're fine.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Wow.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 So it sounds to me like the sheep think that the birds beaks and feet are seaweed.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Oh, I don't think so.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Because we aren't eating the main bit of the bird.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Well, that's a good point.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 The main bit of a bird doesn't look like seaweed,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 but the beak and feet do look a bit seaweed, don't they?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Oh, Ronald C is a weird place, isn't it?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Anyway, it's so small, obviously.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 It's only a school shut down in 2017 after the only people left.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 It wouldn't be stupid to keep it open after that.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Well, they've actually said it's on standby in case any other children move to the island.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Right.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 What does that mean?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Are their teachers in possession of waiting to descend?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Constantly poised, chalk suspended by the blackboard.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 No, they had one people there who I think she was about 12 in 2017,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 and she'd been the only people ever two years,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 and her teacher would fly from Orkney's main island three times a week to teach her personally,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 and then she'd fly twice a week to Orkney,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 and then they decided to just send her, I think, I think to Orkney.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And now the only child, I think, is three years old.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Okay, go on to school next year.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Yeah.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Yeah, ready, teachers.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Some stuff on seaweed.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Oh, sure, yeah.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 So, seaweed is useful to otters.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 There's one of my favourite things about it, because otter babies,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 otter pups can't swim, but they're extremely buoyant, so it's fine, they don't drown,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 and it means their parents can leave them alone when they go out hunting for them,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 but they need to stop them floating away.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So, when they go hunting, they tie their pups up in seaweed.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Wow.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Wrap them in a little seaweed cradle and tie them to the tank.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Oh, sweet.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 That's cool.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And there is a company which does seaweed for the stars.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 It's a celebrity seaweed for movies.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 It's called the Hebridee and Seaweed Company, and they provide all the weeds

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 for the Pirates of the Caribbean film, because they obviously needed loads.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Wow.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And when they were filming Le Miserable, the recent Hollywood version of it,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 they bought nine tons of seaweed from this company.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Really?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Is it real seaweed, or fake?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Yeah, it's real.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 What is it?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Well, if they're in the Hebridee's, I don't think they're stitching it.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 I think they're just gathering it.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Oh, no, I know.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Yeah.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 It's just like for movies, real seaweed is going to be, you know.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Good point.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 I think it could be made of Harris Tweed.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Yeah.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Please.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 It could be made of thirds beaks stitched together.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 I'm pretty sure it's real seaweed.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 There is, in a sense, no such thing as seaweed.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Okay.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Because when we say seaweed, we're just talking about benfic macro algae,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 which is just lives in the sea and is visible to the naked eye, macro algae.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And technically, that's what you should order in a Japanese restaurant.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 But there are three big kinds of seaweed.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So then they get referred to as brown algae, red algae,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 and there's a third one which I didn't write down.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 And brown algae and red algae are not even in the same kingdom of life.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Really?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Yeah.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 They're less closely related than a cod and a jellyfish,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 which are very, very different life forms.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Okay.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Different kingdoms.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 That's amazing.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 I chose two things, which are not a million miles away.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 No, I should have said a wasp and mushroom.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Mushroom, brilliant.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Andy, you've just written a book of fiction,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 and that's how far your imagination can stretch.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 You couldn't even come up with an animal that was very similar to a wasp.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 In 1850, there was a moment where a Frenchman thought he'd discovered

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 a whole new species of seaweed.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 He'd never seen it before.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Fortunately, it wasn't seaweed.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 It was the new UK and France telegraph cable that had just been laid in between.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And he mistook it.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 And it's because they didn't do the wiring properly.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 It wasn't properly armoured.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 So he thought it was seaweed brought it up, cut it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 And then he thought he'd discovered gold because of all the wires inside.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 But yeah, it was mistook seaweed.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 This guy's a fucking idiot.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 I know.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Laura, this French fisherman.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And it was interesting because that first cable, sorry, I know this is not relevant.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 But when I found out that this guy thought it was seaweed...

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 You emailed him, and apparently he's a fan of the podcast.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 (Laughter)

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 So that cable, because of the armoring, which made him think it was seaweed, that wasn't there,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 it also meant that people who were listening to each other

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 over the cable couldn't hear each other properly, it was really distorted stuff.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 But when they first tested it and they got reception from France and France could hear England,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 they didn't realise that what they laid down was bad, because they thought both sides were drunken party

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 from the success of the thing.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Yeah, and it was only in the morning when they did another broadcast.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 They're like, "Oh no, this is terrible, this is unusable."

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 That's lie me for a good reason.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Seaweed?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Oh, it.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 It is.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 So otherwise they'd decapitate each other.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Oh, you're talking about the French.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Well, I wasn't.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 And I want to make that very clear.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 So seaweed is lying because otherwise it would decapitate itself.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 So it's because it's froms or was waving around in the sea.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And so they sort of rub up against each other.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And they would get tangled, obviously, in knots and like rip each other's limbs off or rip their own limbs off.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 They weren't so slimy.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 That's cool.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Smart.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 That's very cool.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And that is my fact.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 My fact this week is in 2017 China launched the world's first electric cargo ship.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 The ship is now being used exclusively to carry coal to power stations.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 So how ironic.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 How ironic.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Yeah, this is a 230 foot long ship.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And it's sort of it's not out in the oceans.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 It's on the Pearl River.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And the idea is it's going in between the coal pickup point to the power point.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And when it docks, it sort of plugs itself in and recharges its batteries.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 And the time it takes to load and unload is roughly the time it takes to charge up.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Well, it's just it is a step in the right direction.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, it could have done without that bit of press.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Of it having powered power stations.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 This is sort of what it's being used for at the moment.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Who knows if they might suddenly turn it to something else.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 But it feels like it's just going to remain doing it.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 If it's battery ports are at both places there.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 But yeah, but it is a big step forward.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 If that technology becomes available to new ships.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Because yeah, ships are extremely dirty.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Yeah, cargo ships especially.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Apparently ships burn the dirtiest oil that you can get.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 It's called bunker oil and you scrape it from the bottom of the refinery.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And it's all gunky and stuff like that.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 And it's so thick that if you were to go into the engine room of a ship

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 and go to where the fuel is, you could walk on it.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Oh, cool.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 But don't do that.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 You wouldn't even need magical shoes.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 You're not invented by Charles Babich.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 She wouldn't need those.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 But you can travel by cargo ship.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And that is environmentally friendly.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Because obviously they don't usually take passengers.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 So it saves you getting a flight and people do this.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 I got really obsessed with these guys last year and wondered if I'd want to do it.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 But there was one man who I read about called Torbjorn Pederson.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 And he basically is blacking his way around the world on container ships.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Which sounds just awful.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And he says everyone should do this.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 You've got to get on board.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 So it's months and months at sea.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 And he says you call up not the captain.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Because apparently they get offended and they don't like it.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 You call up the shipping company.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 And you try to black your way on.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 And you promise that you can be on your own for long stretches of time at once.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Well, I'm really happy just sitting on the very front of the ship.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Like I'm on Titanic or something.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Just pushing cows out the way.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 You have to say you'll be like invisible.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 You'll never get in the way of the crew.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 You sleep in basically this tiny sort of.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Well, he says it's all right.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 He's got a bed.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 He's got a shower.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 And apparently it has unlimited hot water because they run the water through the engine.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 So it gets free he sinks.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Fortunately, it's also full of oil.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 The worst thing about that is 33% of crew on the world's cargo ships

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 don't have any means of communication.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 So no Wi-Fi, no 3G, nothing like that.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 You're just away from, you can't go on Twitter.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Yeah.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Bring a book.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Bring a book.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 You're driving to Australia by cargo ship.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Take a long book.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Really lonely places, aren't they?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Because the crews are so much smaller than they used to be.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Because automation means you could do so much more with many fewer people.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Only 2% of seafarers on cargo ships are women.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Is that so?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Yeah.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 He did say one of the disadvantages as being you won't see a woman for three months.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Get used to male company.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Yeah, it's because he was saying actually the crew was something like 20 people.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And actually these ships are massive.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 So the biggest ones are longer than the Empire State Building is tall.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And yet, yeah, so few people on them.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Do you know how ships are launched?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 With a champagne bottle.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Very true.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 But there's another, so in which dimension are they launched?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 Oh, which direction are they launched?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Towards the sea.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Towards the sea.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Absolutely correct, yes.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 You don't really, really great.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 But is it not?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 I thought they put a load of butter on them.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 I thought we thought this.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Yeah, you put a load of butter on the slipway.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 That's why it's called slipway because it's slippy.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 And then you smash the champagne and then you give it a little bit of a nudge

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 and then the butter lets it go into the water.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 I thought you shove it sideways.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Lots of ships along sideways.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 That's what you're getting at.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 It's insane.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Yeah.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 There are videos on YouTube of ships being launched sideways and they are great.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 I spent a lot of time watching them.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Me too.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 I watched the last night.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 It's really intoxicating when you start.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 You can't start.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Why?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Are they launched sideways?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 It's crazy.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Well, sometimes there's no room to launch lengthways given the body of water you're launching into.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 So you might be launching into a sort of a river or a, you know, a sort of shipping lane

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 on its way to the sea.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 And they tilt over really far.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 And if I can give another shout out to the YouTube video, compilation of accidents

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 with boats on lifts and cranes.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 This is a minute and a half of sheer mayhem.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 But it's failing to be launched.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 And sometimes the crane goes in the water.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 And sometimes they let go too early.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 It's so funny.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 It's extraordinary.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 I found one ship that did sink on launch.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Did you?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 There was only one in 1907.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 And it was a really nice sounding ship as well.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 It was a luxury Italian liner.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 It was 149 meters long.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 And they launched it into the water.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And it started tilting.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 And then when it started tilting, obviously everything inside fell over towards the edge that

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 was tilting.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 So that made it for further.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Well, that's one problem.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 They can get taken.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 They can get sunk by avalanches.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Can't they?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Ships, container ships.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And it's avalanches inside the ship.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 No.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 So if you have something in your ship which might be gravel.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Or in fact, this would work with literally anything as long as there was enough of it.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And there was enough space.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Like it starts acting like a landslide.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 And then once a little bit starts going, it all goes more and more and more.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 And it's like a vicious circle.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 And there's an avalanche inside the ship.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And it just goes over.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 And so, presumably then you have to scream to the crew.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Like everyone get on the other side of the ship quickly.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Yeah.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 On the other side of the ship.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Jump up and down.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Who's that fat guy?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Get over here.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 I'm going to say that the 24 people are fat.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 I'm not going to outway.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Why didn't we take that hitchhiker?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And that is Andy.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 My fact is that the first ever instrument made for food quality control was built

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 to test the consistency of jelly.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Right.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And this is from an article on the science museum's website.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And they have an article all about the history of food and food testing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 And this was made by a German chemist in I think 1861.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And it's a thing called the jelly puncture test.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And what you do is you just put your jelly on a little platform.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And then there's a kind of weight above it.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Like a sort of hard on weight.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 It looks a bit like a pendulum actually.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 And it's on a stick.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And it slowly just pushes down on the jelly with increasing pressure.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And then you can see how much pressure it takes to puncture the jelly.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 And that's how you test it.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Yeah, you pour a lead shot into the top of it, don't you?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Until it punctures and then you take the lead shot out and you weigh that

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 and that tells you what your story is.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Oh, yes, that's the original one, isn't it?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Sorry, yes, the one I'm discovering doesn't like it.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 And did they always remember to remove the lead shot?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Or is it like eating game or part of the way?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Careful of shot in your jelly.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 You know it's a posh children's birthday party, don't you?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 You've got a little bits of lead shot in your jelly on that screen.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 Yeah, it was invented by a guy called Alexander Lipovitz,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 who was a German chemist.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 And he's really cool actually.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 He also was a first person to find out that lithium dissolved uric acid

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 so that you could use it for gout.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 He also wrote about self-ignition of peat, wool and linen rags.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 He wrote a brief description of the Poznan-guano factory.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 He wrote a draft for the establishment of the fire insurance bank

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 for pharmacists of northern Germany.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 And he invented a new type of pinchcock.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Oh, what?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Which we all used today.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Yeah.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 We all used today.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 The health of pinchcock, please.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 It's a clamp used on a flexible tube

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 to control the flow of fluid through it.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Gosh.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 But he was like--

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 I'm sad he's no longer with us.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Because I would have loved to invite him to a party.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Yeah.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Come on, imagine sitting next to him in a party

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 when he tells you about the Poznan-guano factory.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 It's like a shit-babbage.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Oh, good-- the consistency of jelly testing.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 Is it like if it was too soft, then you weren't allowed to sell it?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 What were they checking for?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Do they need it to be really hard, really soft?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 I don't actually know.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Just right.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 I think it was-- I think that must be what it was.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 But people afterwards kept inventing puncture tests

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 for different kinds of foods.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 And they kept-- they didn't notice

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 that there was already a decent puncture testing machine

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 which had been invented for jelly.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 So over the next five decades, they've invented different puncture tests for butter,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 for solid fats, one for egg shells,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 and they just kept inventing new machines until someone said

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 you're all inventing the same machine over and over again.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 It's exactly the same machine.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 It's literally the same machine.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 You've got to talk to each other people.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Come on.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 There is one thing you need to know if you are testing jelly.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 And that is that American chilometers, as we call them these days,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 have square plunges at the bottom,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 whereas European ones have rounded bits at the bottom.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 And so that means that if you're testing an American jelly

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 and a European jelly, you might get slightly different readings.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Just a little tip for those of you who've got all kinds of puncturing jelly.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 The first fact I ever found for QI was about jelly.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 Was it?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Yeah.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 And so I went back, it was my old post.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 It was that thing in the J-Series about how if you attach an EEG machine to jelly,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 then it gives the same readings as a human brain.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Do you remember that in its wobbling?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Yeah.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And that was, was it something like if a jelly was attached to it,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 in theory you wouldn't turn off the live support machine.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 It was exactly that.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 So it gives, it's called "another rhythm", I think,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 which is when humans are awake, but with their eyes closed,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 it's the rhythm the your brain waves give off.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And yeah, it was an experiment to show, look guys,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 we're sort of keeping a lot of people apparently alive who are just definitely dead.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Wow.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Or that actually all jelly's are sentient.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Or yep, that was another interpretation, which was a more nation interpretation.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Some people certainly thought it.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Do you guys know about the jelly houses of Covent Garden?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 No.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So they exist, they exist, do they exist now?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 No, they don't exist now.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Yeah, it doesn't sound like a durable material.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 So I'm surprised.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 So this was in the late 18th century.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And what it was is, this was to do with sex work.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 So a high-end sex worker would sit in a cafe in Covent Garden

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 and they would have next to them some jelly.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 And if you saw them with jelly, that would set.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 It's basically like a red light district kind of thing.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It's saying that that's what I do for a living.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 I'm a sex worker.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Is that where the phrase, I don't think you're ready for my jelly comes from?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 That's bizarre.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Yeah, so some people were just enjoying jelly.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Well, it led to, yeah, a lot of awkwardness, but...

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Of course, was it like meant to be a post-coitle snack perhaps?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 I don't know if the jelly ever was consumed as part of the transaction,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 but it was the signal to say that this is what I do for a living.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Sure, I just wondered why, particularly you choose jelly.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 But if you did have to consume it before every time,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 then you have to buy a hell of a lot of jelly if you're a successful prostitute.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 So it's probably not.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 But it makes no less sense than a red light district.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Well, yeah.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Red light is traditionally associated with stop.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 No, no action, no movement.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Yeah.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 I know what you mean.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Whereas jelly is quite sexy food.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 I think it is kind of, isn't it?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Because of the movement and the wobbling.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Yes.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Until the children's party business got in on it,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 I wish I would have very quickly stopped becoming sexy.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Well, there was a book.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 I was reading the article called The Jello Cid and her own,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Investigating Popular Culture in Jelly by Sarah E. Newton.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And she wrote that there was a book called Recipes to Make Your Honeymoon Last,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 which was actually in 1987, so not that long ago.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And 33% of the salad recipes contain jelly.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 What?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Yes.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Salad.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Wow.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 So I was reading this and it seems to me like in America,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 they have jelly in the salad.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Okay.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 And not a fruit salad.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 No.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 How disgusting.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 I know.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Recipes to Make Your Honeymoon Last.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Yeah.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 1987.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 1987.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Year of my birth.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Oh.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Let's draw no conclusions.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 There was a bit of sexy food.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 What was that called?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Spoony.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Spoony.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Spoony business.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Spoony courtship.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Yeah.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.720
 to advertise what she did.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.560
 - Yes.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.400
 - Very good.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.240
 - 'Cause it's sweet.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.080
 - No, it's sour.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.280
 - It's a whole and she looks.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.120
 - Sorry, I thought you meant it.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.920
 Slit your sleepy and it's time to get a bed.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.200
 (laughing)

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.720
 - I've been revved off of so many jelly houses.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.040
 (laughing)

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040
 - Oh god.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.800
 - Sorry, your legs.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.840
 So they test their drink.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.360
 - By dipping a telescope into it.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.440
 (laughing)

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.280
 - What?

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.720
 - It's called the dipping refractometer.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.080
 It's a tiny telescope.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.920
 - Okay.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.480
 - It's not like a judge or a bank.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.680
 (laughing)

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.680
 You dip a tiny one and it goes into each hole in the hole,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.960
 it's 'cause it's quite bubbly.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.320
 And it sees how much the light is refracted

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.400
 and that tells you whether you've got good olix on that.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.240
 - Cool.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.600
 - Is there a perfect refraction level,

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.200
 sort of 38 degrees or something?

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.160
 - I imagine there is, but I don't know what it is.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.320
 - That's incredible.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.320
 - And it's to test the concentration of ingredients

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.440
 in the sample.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.280
 - Right.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.960
 - It's hard if you've made it right.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.200
 - Just a quick thing on jelly beans.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.280
 I was reading up on jelly, I went to jelly beans.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.960
 And jelly belly, who make all the biggest brand of jelly beans.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.160
 So to get their flavors, they have to invent interesting ways

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.720
 to sort of get this new flavor that they're advertising.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.480
 And there's a line that they have,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.760
 which is called Bertie Bots Every Flavor Beans,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.160
 which is kind of like a Harry Potter one

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.080
 where it's meant to taste of horrible stuff.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.840
 So the way that they actually do that

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.480
 is to make the taste of the beans.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.360
 So let's say it's stinky socks.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.400
 They actually had a scientist have socks worn for weeks,

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.800
 then put them into a plastic bag.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.440
 They had to eat the age of them to be even smellier.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.320
 And then he popped them into a gas chromatograph,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.640
 which is basically something that just breaks down

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.440
 the molecules to understand the smells.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.000
 Takes the flavor makeup from this specific scientist's socks.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.920
 And that is now the smelly socks jelly bean.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.320
 Yeah, that is the actual socks of a guy.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.360
 - That's incredible.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.520
 - Yeah.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520
 - They do it for a bunch of ones.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.160
 They try to do a pizza flavor one,

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.600
 but it ended up tasting like vomit.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.640
 So they put it aside.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.880
 And then they needed a vomit jelly bean.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.240
 So they just found the pizza one.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.640
 Remember that pizza one?

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.080
 And that's now the, do you know what they could have used?

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.000
 They could have used a parmesan flavored bean.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.800
 Because parmesan smells like vomit.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.480
 And if you tell people that they're smelling vomit,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.320
 they're disgusted.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.520
 And then if you tell them, oh, don't worry,

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.440
 it's only parmesan, the disgust bit of their brain

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.360
 switches off.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.200
 - Really?

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.040
 - Oh yeah, I love parmesan.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.640
 - Because I was having this conversation yesterday

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.120
 with someone actually, what?

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.120
 Well, let's say it's a hypothetical situation

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.280
 where someone farts.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.120
 - Okay.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.960
 - And then--

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.800
 - Okay, and then--

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.800
 - Then the other person says--

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.480
 - This is completely identical, right?

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.640
 - This is a situation we were imagining.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.480
 - Yeah.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.320
 - Someone sparsed it.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.080
 And then the other person says, that smells exactly like eggs.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.760
 And then the first person says, well,

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.840
 if it was actually eggs, you wouldn't find it disgusting.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.720
 So why are you so disgusted?

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.560
 - Ah.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.960
 - And debating whether or not, if you fart,

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.520
 and then you tell someone, oh, don't worry,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.760
 I'm just boiling an egg.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.600
 - Yeah?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.440
 - Then they're not gonna be,

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.040
 they're not gonna find it unpleasant, are they?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.120
 And that implies that they wouldn't.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.360
 - Yeah, but you can't always boil an egg, say,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.200
 if you're--

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.040
 - In the lift.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.880
 - In the lift.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.200
 (laughing)

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.880
 - No, I think if you always keep a camping stove

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.960
 with you all the time, the box of eggs.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.880
 - It's worth a try.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880
 - Yeah.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.560
 - You won't get kicked out of the film, but--

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.880
 (laughing)

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.460
 (upbeat music)

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:07.280
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.680
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.440

 Nosuchthing is a fish.com.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.000
 We have all of our previous episodes up there,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.760
 links to things like our free books

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.400
 that are still available online.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.560
 And yeah, we'll see you again next week, guys.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.400
 Goodbye.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.980
 (upbeat music)

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:47.740
 - I did actually read about that, and it said the Kings

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.940
 representative would march around to the poop.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:50.780
 - Deck.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.940
 - The poop deck, absolutely.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.740
 (laughing)

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.940
 - Jesus Christ, it's a funny phrase.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.780
 - It's funny work.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.620
 - There it is.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.620
 - There were some 11 year olds listening

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.380
 to this, just pressing themselves.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.420
 (laughing)

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.020
 (upbeat music)

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.020
 (upbeat music)
