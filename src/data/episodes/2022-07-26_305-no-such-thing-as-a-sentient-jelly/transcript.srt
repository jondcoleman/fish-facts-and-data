00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray. And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite packs from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Starting with you, James.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Okay, my fight this week is that Thomas Edison was once almost killed by a flying badger.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Was this one of his inventions that have gone wrong? Absolutely right, he's a badger cannon. And one of the badgers got stuck in it and he kind of prodded it to see if the badger would get free and then it went off in his face.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Wow, that's not it.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Dan's thinking I've researched about it. Two badger incidents? No, he was riding on a locomotive on a train and he got very friendly with people who were engineers on this train and they let him sit on the cow catcher, which is the little bit of metal in the front of the train, so kind of knocks things out of the way.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It looks like if you picture the front of a night of the realm like like Solancelot's helmet that sort of bent and sticks out. The pies are bit that they look through looks like that.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 That's a great description.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Yeah, he said the engineers gave me a small cushion and every day I rode in this manner. Only once was I in danger when the locomotive struck an animal about the size of a small cup bear, which I think was a badger.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 This animal struck the front of the locomotive just under the headlight with great violence, so it just passed his head and hit the train.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Imagine this was when he was quite young, I think it was about 31 or 32 at the time, so we could have never had all the things that he invented.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We got killed by a badger.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We wouldn't have had the podcast recording our voice.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 That's what the world would miss the most.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Everyone's walking around in the dark because there's no light bulbs going on. I wish I had a podcast.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 This is just a weird thing about Edison. I know we spoke about Edison a lot, but I can't believe I've never heard that.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I know it's extraordinary.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That was a year or so before he really got on his hot streak of inventions, wasn't it?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Yeah, he was famous-ish. They were still, they were calling him Professor Edison at that stage.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 He had done a few bits of inventing, we hadn't done the major inventions.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 The cool people were already into him who were going to spurn his later work.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 It does feel like a timestamp moment, doesn't it?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Time travellers back and we'll go back to alter history by just making the badger hit him.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Do you know what I mean? That's the moment where you could kill him.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 You'd have to be very skilled to place a badger in the exact place that when it hits a cow catcher, it goes and hits Edison in the face.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 You're right, there's probably a lot of failed attempts where you could just swap the badger for a cow. That would probably do it.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Do you think?

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Yeah, because cows are so much larger than badgers.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 So the harder to throw up in the air?

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Actually, I don't know what happens when a train hits a cow catcher.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Well, I read some accounts of what happens, so they're very impressive.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 We do know what happens.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Sorry, I don't know exactly what happens yet, but a really good cow catcher, like a very effective one,

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 could if it hit an ox, which would weigh up to 900 kilos, or 2,000 pounds, it could throw it 30 feet into the air.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 No way.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Come on.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 You've got a whole train behind it.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I guess so, yeah.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But in those days, they weren't going as fast.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Is this like a modern bullet train?

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 No, this is a contemporary account.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Is it?

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's a good cow catcher, yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 So so much to do the mass on the Japanese bullet train and how high a cow would go under those like it was going to orbit?

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I think it would.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Cow would jump over the moon.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 We know what happens.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 They were, it wasn't uncommon to ride on them.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Turns out.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Yeah, look them up.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So I was looking them up in the British newspaper archive.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And there were just stories everywhere of people who took rides on the cow catchers.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So there was this woman in 1893 called Lady Grey Edgerton and she was holidaying in Canada.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And she said she asked the driver.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 So it wasn't a regular thing, but she went to the driver and she said, can I sit in the cow catcher for the journey?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And apparently he said, look, all your purposes will be answered by riding in just the front cabin with me.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And it's very dangerous, so no.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 But then as she wrote, he was eventually obliged to allow that the scenery could be seen much better sitting on the front of the engine.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And so he let me do it.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I think that is good.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Edgerton also said that it was so that he could see the scenery and stuff like that.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Yeah.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Actually, there was one more modern one.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I think, didn't Jeremy Corbyn once sit on the cow catcher because he couldn't find the seat on a virgin train?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 That's a pretty niche joke.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Listen, there's an America going, what the hell is this all about?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 That's really, so it's like the 19th century equivalent of going into the cockpit on a plane, isn't it?

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It's a special perk that not many people get.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Yeah.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 No, it's going on the nose of the plane.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Oh, yeah, sorry.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's like the 19th century equivalent of going on the DLR and getting that seat at the front.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 It looks like you're the driver.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I think you've won around the American listening.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Does anyone know who invented the cow catcher?

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I mean, you must have done because you researched it.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I do.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Yeah, it's incredible.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Oh, don't.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 It was invented by Charles Babbage, who invented the computer.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Wow.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Oh, that is surprising.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Yes.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 One of them really has stayed with us more, isn't it?

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I guess so.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Although, like, Babbage's computer, he invented a different engine, which was like an early prototype of the computer.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And people aren't really sure whether he made it.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 I don't think he did make it, actually.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And actually, the cow catcher, it was supposed to be used between Liverpool and Manchester, but it didn't really, it didn't catch on if they ever made it.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And he also invented really big shoes for walking on water.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Cool.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And also speaking tubes that were supposed to link London and Liverpool.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And I don't think they ever got made either.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 So I'm wondering about Charles Babbage.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Yeah.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 What did he actually do?

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Did the shoes, the water shoes, presumably, didn't work or did they?

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 No, they didn't really work, because he invented them when he was 16 years old.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And he tried them out and he nearly drowned.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Oh.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Okay.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Presumably it does work if you just have to have really big shoes.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 It's basically like you've got two boats and you put one foot in each boat.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And that's not an invention.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 That's just straddling two boats.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So the question is, how small can you make the boats?

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Yes.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 How small is a boat before it becomes a shoe?

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I think that's what we're wrestling with it.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 The first train to have a cow catcher on that we know of was called the John Bull, which is quite pleasing.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Was it?

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Yeah.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Oh.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It was in 1833.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I read one story from 1963, which must have been when cow catchers were going out of fashion a bit.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But one story from 1963, which reported that 65-year-old Mrs. G. Reorden came riding into Brisbane today on the cow catcher of a train.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And it turned out that she said she wasn't quick enough to get out of the way

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 when crossing the track.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 So she grabbed on instead and hung on for dear life.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 She said, I thought of calling out the help when I was on there, but it seemed a bit silly.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So she just waited until it got to Brisbane.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Wow.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 So some more stuff about Edison, some weird stuff I'd not seen before.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So this trip where he was on the train, where he almost got killed by a badger,

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 it was because he'd been to see a total eclipse of the sun.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Hmm. He'd been to Wyoming where this had happened and he wanted to try out an invention called a Tezin meter,

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 which would measure small changes in temperature.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Now, that experiment failed because the device was too sensitive.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 But while he was there, he slept out in the open.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And a man who was there at the time said that Edison told him that when he lay down in the open,

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 he wasn't thinking about resting, he lay up and looked at the beautiful stars in clear skylight

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 and invented the incandescent electric light.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And apparently that is where Edison came up with the idea.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Apart from historical evidence, it indicates that the story is simply a myth.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 But who's to say?

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Because lighting had already been invented years before.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I've had it.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And Edison came up with his idea of using these bamboo filaments years later.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And this guy kind of, it was quite a lot of years later when he said,

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 "Oh, I remember Edison told me this thing."

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 But he said that he thought Edison was sleeping, but he wasn't, right?

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 That's what he said.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Okay, because to me, that sounds like when you're sitting on the couch watching movie with your dad

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 and he's falling asleep and you wake him up, you're like, "No, I'm awake, I'm awake."

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Yeah, I'm just inventing the light bulb.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Yeah, exactly.

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 One thing Edison would do, he was very deaf.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He was almost completely deaf in one ear and he was completely deaf in the other ear.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 So he really couldn't hear very much at all.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And when someone was playing music or the piano, he, to listen, would bite the wood of the piano itself.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 That is incredibly off-putting for the performer.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I would have thought, "What are you talking about?"

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 The wood of the piano.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 It's a big thing, the piano.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I guess he'd pick somewhere where the player could play it

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 and he could sit there biting the piano and listening through his head.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Because the vibrations would obviously make that way to his inner ear.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And there are accounts of him doing this from his daughter

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 and his old, his personal phonograph has toothmugs around the edge.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 No, he was listening to music.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 He must have been the nightmare to go to the orchestra with him.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Yeah, it wasn't this badger incident.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It wasn't the only time that he sort of had his life in danger on a train.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So he was actually fired from working on a train because he set up a chemistry lab inside one of the trains.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And it caught on fire while an experiment was going on.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So the train was on fire and he got fired as a result.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And I found this out weirdly on a site.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 You know, TV tropes, where it just tells you all the great TV tropes.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Edison has a huge entry in TV tropes for the tropes of his life

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 that applied to the tropes he would use in TV.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So in "Too Dumb to Live", which is a category,

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 the badger incident is in there as a TV trope.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 He's got covert pervert.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 He's listed in that as well.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 For what incident?

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So in an interview, when he was talking about the application of the phonograph

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 when he first invented it, he had a list of what you could do with it.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And one of the things was you could hide it in the white house as a listening device

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 so you're recording the conversation and then play it back later.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 The other one was that parents could put it in the homes of their married children

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 to listen to the sounds of their Spoonie courtship and Spoonie courtships in quotes.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Spoonie courtship.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Oh my goodness.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 What a phrase.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Yeah, so that gets into the covert pervert.

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I think the website TV tropes is slightly extending its brief a bit here.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 I know.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 There's not a trope being hit by a badger when you're sitting on the front of a trope.

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Can I also...

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Can you imagine if your Edison's kids and you're just getting down to a bit of Spoonie courtship?

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I bet the bedposts, that is a bite of...

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna.

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 My fact this week is that there are only two groups of animals on Earth

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 that live entirely on seaweed and they are a type of iguana and a type of sheep.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 They're not in the same place.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 They are not in the same place.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 They don't know each other.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I don't think they hang out.

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 We don't know if they make calls to each other at weekends or letters,

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 but no evidence of that.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So this sheep is amazing.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It's the Northern Ireland of Orkney.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So it's part of Orkney and right to the north of Scotland.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And 50 people live on it and 2,000 sheep.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 They're very primitive sheep, so they've lived on the island for thousands and thousands of years.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And they have this amazing thing where they subsist on exclusively seaweed.

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 It's so cool.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It's incredible that my favourite sheep in the world...

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Is it tough competition up there?

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 To be honest, I didn't have a favourite until I researched this one.

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But no, I definitely do. That's so awesome.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And they've been living on the seaweed for so long now that...

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So there's a big wall that's been built, a big dike that's maintained by a lady called Shan.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And she's living there and she's been...

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 She basically has to rebuild this wall all the time because when huge winds come and so on, it gets knocked down.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So it's a big perimeter. She has to do...

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And in the article I was reading about saying that they're so used to the seaweed now,

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 that if they break through and get to grassland, they can't eat grass anymore.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 They've evolved away from taking them...

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 If they eat too much of it, they think it might poison them.

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And it hasn't even been that long though that they have been living off seaweeds.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 1832, I think, that people decided to cut them off from the land, basically.

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So the island has built this massive dike, as you say.

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And it was to keep the sheep away from the delicious grassy pasture

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 because they were farming their cows on that.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And so they sort of forced the sheep to just start living off this seaweed instead.

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Yeah, so they're still on the outer edge of the island.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Yeah.

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Just living on the beach, basically.

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Yeah.

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Basically, yeah.

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Yeah, round the perimeter.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And so annoying, if you end up sort of on one side and your mate's on the other side,

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 because you just can't cut across the middle, you've got to go all the way around.

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Well, actually they don't have mates on the other side.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 They always stick together in their little groups.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Oh, do they?

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Yeah, and you can't move them from the north to the south or the south to the north.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 If you try and do that, they are having none of it at all.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 They just like staying in their little group.

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 They have certain bits of seaweed and they like their bit of seaweed and they don't like any others.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Apparently, if you have to look after them, otherwise they swim out to a rock where you can't get it.

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And there are also ones that are called lupers, which are sheep that climb on top of each other

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 to try and get over the wall.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Wow!

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Oh my god.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Isn't that cool?

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And so self-sacrificing of the bottom sheep.

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Yes.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Unless the ones at the top kind of pull them over, they don't have the possible thumbs.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Yeah.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I'm sure they would, if they could.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But they know about the tide as well as sheep.

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 They know where the tide is and they sleep accordingly.

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 So they don't get caught out by it.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And as soon as the tide goes out, they rush out to get the seaweed that's been left behind by it.

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And that's why they swim out.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Also for more seaweed.

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I love the idea of being a sheep checking the tide times every week.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Leaning against the wall.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Not until Wednesday will that beach be accessible.

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Sean is called Sean Terrence and I found her on Twitter.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So I contacted her in the hope that she might check her Twitter before we recorded today just to see

267
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 if she had any more facts to give us.

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And turns out she's a massive fan of the podcast.

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 No way.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Yeah, yeah.

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Where her second favorite podcast.

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Is the first one about sheep.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 That is guilty feminist.

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's her favorite.

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Really?

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Yeah. But so I just asked her instead of getting facts.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I said, when you're fixing this wall to stop the sheep, do you ever listen to us?

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And she's like, yeah, always.

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I'm listening to you guys as I build the wall.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Oh my god.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I'm the silent.

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Sean, I want to come to the island and help you build the wall.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 He wants to meet his favorite sheep.

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Build the wall.

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I'm sorry.

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 That's something else.

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Sean, I'm so sorry that Dan is so obsessed with our podcast that he meant to go to you for facts.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And then he'll just say, oh my god, so when do you listen to us?

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Do you listen to us before you go to sleep?

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Do you listen to us when you're with the wall?

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 So you got no interesting facts?

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Did you go back?

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I did, but I didn't read them because I was just wet down that line, as you say.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 How long has Sean had the job?

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Do you know?

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Well, it's a three-year post.

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And I think, yeah, I think she's out there for a few more years.

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 She just started in the last few months, I think.

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 She is awesome.

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Just because I read an article from before she got the job, I think, when it was in real disrepair.

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And they were trying to fix it.

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And they said that the cost of repairs was going to be about £3 million to build this because it just basically,

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 you know, they didn't really have anyone with the skills.

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And it's not just getting the labour, it's also getting the materials which aren't nearly as prevalent as they used to be.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Because apparently in 1902, it cost four pence an hour to repair the wall.

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Wow, four pence an hour.

307
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 That's pretty good.

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Although, how many hours does it take?

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Maybe it added up to a million after a few years.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Maybe Sean charges an enormous story doing this.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 That's what's happening.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Did she say something about the sheep eating sea birds sometimes?

313
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 To that day.

314
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Well, this was on your Twitter feed down.

315
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 We just have to click on Twitter and I only noticed the facts that she'd sent us.

316
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I think she said that the sheep sometimes find bodies of sea birds

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 with the heads and the feet missing at home.

318
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So Anna, your fact about them only eating seaweed?

319
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Oh, this is snucking.

320
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 This is luxury.

321
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 This isn't part of their diet.

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 You're on a five-two diet, aren't they?

324
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 We're two days a week.

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 They can eat a seabird's head.

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 So that's what she sent.

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 They're known to eat the feet and beaks of dead birds on the shore.

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So you see dead birds with feet and beaks missing all the time.

329
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 They get faster.

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 They get fatter in the winter because there's more seaweed washed up by the storms.

331
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And they run up to the dike and over it if it's leaning and into the island side away from the shore

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 and they've been found on airfields as well.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So, assume there's an airfield on the island.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Do we think they're trying to catch a fly out of there?

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 All the planes have sheep catchers on the front of us, so they're fine.

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Wow.

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 So it sounds to me like the sheep think that the birds beaks and feet are seaweed.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Oh, I don't think so.

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Because we aren't eating the main bit of the bird.

340
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Well, that's a good point.

341
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 The main bit of a bird doesn't look like seaweed,

342
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 but the beak and feet do look a bit seaweed, don't they?

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Oh, Ronald C is a weird place, isn't it?

344
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Anyway, it's so small, obviously.

345
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 It's only a school shut down in 2017 after the only people left.

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It wouldn't be stupid to keep it open after that.

347
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Well, they've actually said it's on standby in case any other children move to the island.

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Right.

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 What does that mean?

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Are their teachers in possession of waiting to descend?

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Constantly poised, chalk suspended by the blackboard.

352
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 No, they had one people there who I think she was about 12 in 2017,

353
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 and she'd been the only people ever two years,

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 and her teacher would fly from Orkney's main island three times a week to teach her personally,

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 and then she'd fly twice a week to Orkney,

356
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and then they decided to just send her, I think, I think to Orkney.

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And now the only child, I think, is three years old.

358
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Okay, go on to school next year.

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Yeah.

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Yeah, ready, teachers.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Some stuff on seaweed.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Oh, sure, yeah.

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So, seaweed is useful to otters.

364
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 There's one of my favourite things about it, because otter babies,

365
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 otter pups can't swim, but they're extremely buoyant, so it's fine, they don't drown,

366
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and it means their parents can leave them alone when they go out hunting for them,

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 but they need to stop them floating away.

368
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So, when they go hunting, they tie their pups up in seaweed.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Wow.

370
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Wrap them in a little seaweed cradle and tie them to the tank.

371
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Oh, sweet.

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 That's cool.

373
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And there is a company which does seaweed for the stars.

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's a celebrity seaweed for movies.

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's called the Hebridee and Seaweed Company, and they provide all the weeds

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 for the Pirates of the Caribbean film, because they obviously needed loads.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Wow.

378
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And when they were filming Le Miserable, the recent Hollywood version of it,

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 they bought nine tons of seaweed from this company.

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Really?

381
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Is it real seaweed, or fake?

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Yeah, it's real.

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 What is it?

384
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Well, if they're in the Hebridee's, I don't think they're stitching it.

385
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I think they're just gathering it.

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Oh, no, I know.

387
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Yeah.

388
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's just like for movies, real seaweed is going to be, you know.

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Good point.

390
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I think it could be made of Harris Tweed.

391
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Yeah.

392
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Please.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It could be made of thirds beaks stitched together.

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I'm pretty sure it's real seaweed.

395
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Yeah.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 There is, in a sense, no such thing as seaweed.

397
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Okay.

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Because when we say seaweed, we're just talking about benfic macro algae,

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 which is just lives in the sea and is visible to the naked eye, macro algae.

400
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And technically, that's what you should order in a Japanese restaurant.

401
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But there are three big kinds of seaweed.

402
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So then they get referred to as brown algae, red algae,

403
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 and there's a third one which I didn't write down.

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And brown algae and red algae are not even in the same kingdom of life.

405
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Really?

406
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Yeah.

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 They're less closely related than a cod and a jellyfish,

408
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 which are very, very different life forms.

409
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Okay.

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Different kingdoms.

411
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 That's amazing.

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I chose two things, which are not a million miles away.

413
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 No, I should have said a wasp and mushroom.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Mushroom, brilliant.

415
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Andy, you've just written a book of fiction,

416
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 and that's how far your imagination can stretch.

417
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 You couldn't even come up with an animal that was very similar to a wasp.

418
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 In 1850, there was a moment where a Frenchman thought he'd discovered

419
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 a whole new species of seaweed.

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 He'd never seen it before.

421
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Fortunately, it wasn't seaweed.

422
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It was the new UK and France telegraph cable that had just been laid in between.

423
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And he mistook it.

424
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And it's because they didn't do the wiring properly.

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 It wasn't properly armoured.

426
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So he thought it was seaweed brought it up, cut it.

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And then he thought he'd discovered gold because of all the wires inside.

428
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But yeah, it was mistook seaweed.

429
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 This guy's a fucking idiot.

430
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I know.

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Laura, this French fisherman.

432
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And it was interesting because that first cable, sorry, I know this is not relevant.

433
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 But when I found out that this guy thought it was seaweed...

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 You emailed him, and apparently he's a fan of the podcast.

435
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 (Laughter)

436
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So that cable, because of the armoring, which made him think it was seaweed, that wasn't there,

437
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 it also meant that people who were listening to each other

438
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 over the cable couldn't hear each other properly, it was really distorted stuff.

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 But when they first tested it and they got reception from France and France could hear England,

440
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 they didn't realise that what they laid down was bad, because they thought both sides were drunken party

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 from the success of the thing.

442
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Yeah, and it was only in the morning when they did another broadcast.

443
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 They're like, "Oh no, this is terrible, this is unusable."

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's lie me for a good reason.

445
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Seaweed?

446
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Oh, it.

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It is.

448
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 So otherwise they'd decapitate each other.

449
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Oh, you're talking about the French.

450
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Yeah.

451
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Well, I wasn't.

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And I want to make that very clear.

453
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So seaweed is lying because otherwise it would decapitate itself.

454
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So it's because it's froms or was waving around in the sea.

455
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And so they sort of rub up against each other.

456
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And they would get tangled, obviously, in knots and like rip each other's limbs off or rip their own limbs off.

457
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 They weren't so slimy.

458
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 That's cool.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Smart.

460
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 That's very cool.

461
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

462
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And that is my fact.

463
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 My fact this week is in 2017 China launched the world's first electric cargo ship.

464
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 The ship is now being used exclusively to carry coal to power stations.

465
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 So how ironic.

466
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 How ironic.

467
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Yeah, this is a 230 foot long ship.

468
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And it's sort of it's not out in the oceans.

469
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 It's on the Pearl River.

470
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And the idea is it's going in between the coal pickup point to the power point.

471
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And when it docks, it sort of plugs itself in and recharges its batteries.

472
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And the time it takes to load and unload is roughly the time it takes to charge up.

473
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Well, it's just it is a step in the right direction.

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, it could have done without that bit of press.

475
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Of it having powered power stations.

476
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 This is sort of what it's being used for at the moment.

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Who knows if they might suddenly turn it to something else.

478
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But it feels like it's just going to remain doing it.

479
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 If it's battery ports are at both places there.

480
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But yeah, but it is a big step forward.

481
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 If that technology becomes available to new ships.

482
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Because yeah, ships are extremely dirty.

483
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Yeah, cargo ships especially.

484
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Apparently ships burn the dirtiest oil that you can get.

485
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 It's called bunker oil and you scrape it from the bottom of the refinery.

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And it's all gunky and stuff like that.

487
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And it's so thick that if you were to go into the engine room of a ship

488
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 and go to where the fuel is, you could walk on it.

489
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Oh, cool.

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But don't do that.

491
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You wouldn't even need magical shoes.

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 You're not invented by Charles Babich.

493
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 She wouldn't need those.

494
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 But you can travel by cargo ship.

495
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And that is environmentally friendly.

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Because obviously they don't usually take passengers.

497
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 So it saves you getting a flight and people do this.

498
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I got really obsessed with these guys last year and wondered if I'd want to do it.

499
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 But there was one man who I read about called Torbjorn Pederson.

500
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And he basically is blacking his way around the world on container ships.

501
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Which sounds just awful.

502
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And he says everyone should do this.

503
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 You've got to get on board.

504
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So it's months and months at sea.

505
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And he says you call up not the captain.

506
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Because apparently they get offended and they don't like it.

507
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 You call up the shipping company.

508
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And you try to black your way on.

509
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And you promise that you can be on your own for long stretches of time at once.

510
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Well, I'm really happy just sitting on the very front of the ship.

511
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Like I'm on Titanic or something.

512
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Just pushing cows out the way.

513
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 You have to say you'll be like invisible.

514
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 You'll never get in the way of the crew.

515
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You sleep in basically this tiny sort of.

516
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Well, he says it's all right.

517
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He's got a bed.

518
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He's got a shower.

519
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And apparently it has unlimited hot water because they run the water through the engine.

520
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 So it gets free he sinks.

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Fortunately, it's also full of oil.

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 The worst thing about that is 33% of crew on the world's cargo ships

523
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 don't have any means of communication.

524
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So no Wi-Fi, no 3G, nothing like that.

525
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You're just away from, you can't go on Twitter.

526
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Yeah.

527
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Bring a book.

528
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Bring a book.

529
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You're driving to Australia by cargo ship.

530
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Take a long book.

531
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Really lonely places, aren't they?

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Because the crews are so much smaller than they used to be.

533
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Because automation means you could do so much more with many fewer people.

534
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Only 2% of seafarers on cargo ships are women.

535
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Is that so?

536
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Yeah.

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 He did say one of the disadvantages as being you won't see a woman for three months.

538
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Get used to male company.

539
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Yeah, it's because he was saying actually the crew was something like 20 people.

540
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And actually these ships are massive.

541
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 So the biggest ones are longer than the Empire State Building is tall.

542
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And yet, yeah, so few people on them.

543
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Do you know how ships are launched?

544
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 With a champagne bottle.

545
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Very true.

546
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 But there's another, so in which dimension are they launched?

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Oh, which direction are they launched?

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Towards the sea.

549
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Towards the sea.

550
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Absolutely correct, yes.

551
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 You don't really, really great.

552
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 But is it not?

553
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I thought they put a load of butter on them.

554
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I thought we thought this.

555
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Yeah, you put a load of butter on the slipway.

556
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 That's why it's called slipway because it's slippy.

557
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And then you smash the champagne and then you give it a little bit of a nudge

558
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 and then the butter lets it go into the water.

559
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I thought you shove it sideways.

560
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Lots of ships along sideways.

561
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 That's what you're getting at.

562
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 It's insane.

563
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Yeah.

564
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 There are videos on YouTube of ships being launched sideways and they are great.

565
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I spent a lot of time watching them.

566
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Me too.

567
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I watched the last night.

568
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 It's really intoxicating when you start.

569
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 You can't start.

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Why?

571
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Are they launched sideways?

572
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 It's crazy.

573
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Well, sometimes there's no room to launch lengthways given the body of water you're launching into.

574
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 So you might be launching into a sort of a river or a, you know, a sort of shipping lane

575
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 on its way to the sea.

576
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And they tilt over really far.

577
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And if I can give another shout out to the YouTube video, compilation of accidents

578
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 with boats on lifts and cranes.

579
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 This is a minute and a half of sheer mayhem.

580
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 But it's failing to be launched.

581
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And sometimes the crane goes in the water.

582
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And sometimes they let go too early.

583
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 It's so funny.

584
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It's extraordinary.

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I found one ship that did sink on launch.

586
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Did you?

587
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 There was only one in 1907.

588
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And it was a really nice sounding ship as well.

589
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It was a luxury Italian liner.

590
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It was 149 meters long.

591
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And they launched it into the water.

592
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And it started tilting.

593
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And then when it started tilting, obviously everything inside fell over towards the edge that

594
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 was tilting.

595
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So that made it for further.

596
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Well, that's one problem.

597
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 They can get taken.

598
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 They can get sunk by avalanches.

599
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Can't they?

600
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Ships, container ships.

601
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And it's avalanches inside the ship.

602
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 No.

603
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 So if you have something in your ship which might be gravel.

604
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Or in fact, this would work with literally anything as long as there was enough of it.

605
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And there was enough space.

606
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Like it starts acting like a landslide.

607
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And then once a little bit starts going, it all goes more and more and more.

608
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And it's like a vicious circle.

609
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And there's an avalanche inside the ship.

610
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And it just goes over.

611
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And so, presumably then you have to scream to the crew.

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Like everyone get on the other side of the ship quickly.

613
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Yeah.

614
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 On the other side of the ship.

615
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Jump up and down.

616
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Who's that fat guy?

617
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Get over here.

618
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I'm going to say that the 24 people are fat.

619
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I'm not going to outway.

620
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Why didn't we take that hitchhiker?

621
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

622
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And that is Andy.

623
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 My fact is that the first ever instrument made for food quality control was built

624
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 to test the consistency of jelly.

625
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Right.

626
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And this is from an article on the science museum's website.

627
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And they have an article all about the history of food and food testing.

628
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And this was made by a German chemist in I think 1861.

629
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And it's a thing called the jelly puncture test.

630
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And what you do is you just put your jelly on a little platform.

631
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And then there's a kind of weight above it.

632
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Like a sort of hard on weight.

633
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 It looks a bit like a pendulum actually.

634
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And it's on a stick.

635
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 And it slowly just pushes down on the jelly with increasing pressure.

636
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And then you can see how much pressure it takes to puncture the jelly.

637
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And that's how you test it.

638
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Yeah, you pour a lead shot into the top of it, don't you?

639
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Until it punctures and then you take the lead shot out and you weigh that

640
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 and that tells you what your story is.

641
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Oh, yes, that's the original one, isn't it?

642
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Sorry, yes, the one I'm discovering doesn't like it.

643
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And did they always remember to remove the lead shot?

644
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Or is it like eating game or part of the way?

645
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Careful of shot in your jelly.

646
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 You know it's a posh children's birthday party, don't you?

647
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 You've got a little bits of lead shot in your jelly on that screen.

648
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Yeah, it was invented by a guy called Alexander Lipovitz,

649
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 who was a German chemist.

650
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And he's really cool actually.

651
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 He also was a first person to find out that lithium dissolved uric acid

652
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 so that you could use it for gout.

653
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 He also wrote about self-ignition of peat, wool and linen rags.

654
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 He wrote a brief description of the Poznan-guano factory.

655
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 He wrote a draft for the establishment of the fire insurance bank

656
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 for pharmacists of northern Germany.

657
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And he invented a new type of pinchcock.

658
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Oh, what?

659
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Which we all used today.

660
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Yeah.

661
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 We all used today.

662
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 The health of pinchcock, please.

663
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 It's a clamp used on a flexible tube

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 to control the flow of fluid through it.

665
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Gosh.

666
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But he was like--

667
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

668
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I'm sad he's no longer with us.

669
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Because I would have loved to invite him to a party.

670
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Yeah.

671
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Come on, imagine sitting next to him in a party

672
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 when he tells you about the Poznan-guano factory.

673
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 It's like a shit-babbage.

674
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Oh, good-- the consistency of jelly testing.

675
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Is it like if it was too soft, then you weren't allowed to sell it?

676
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 What were they checking for?

677
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Oh, yeah.

678
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Do they need it to be really hard, really soft?

679
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I don't actually know.

680
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Just right.

681
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I think it was-- I think that must be what it was.

682
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 But people afterwards kept inventing puncture tests

683
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 for different kinds of foods.

684
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And they kept-- they didn't notice

685
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 that there was already a decent puncture testing machine

686
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 which had been invented for jelly.

687
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 So over the next five decades, they've invented different puncture tests for butter,

688
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 for solid fats, one for egg shells,

689
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 and they just kept inventing new machines until someone said

690
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 you're all inventing the same machine over and over again.

691
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It's exactly the same machine.

692
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It's literally the same machine.

693
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 You've got to talk to each other people.

694
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Come on.

695
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 There is one thing you need to know if you are testing jelly.

696
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And that is that American chilometers, as we call them these days,

697
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 have square plunges at the bottom,

698
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 whereas European ones have rounded bits at the bottom.

699
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And so that means that if you're testing an American jelly

700
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 and a European jelly, you might get slightly different readings.

701
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Just a little tip for those of you who've got all kinds of puncturing jelly.

702
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 The first fact I ever found for QI was about jelly.

703
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Was it?

704
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Yeah.

705
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And so I went back, it was my old post.

706
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 It was that thing in the J-Series about how if you attach an EEG machine to jelly,

707
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 then it gives the same readings as a human brain.

708
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Do you remember that in its wobbling?

709
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Yeah.

710
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And that was, was it something like if a jelly was attached to it,

711
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 in theory you wouldn't turn off the live support machine.

712
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It was exactly that.

713
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 So it gives, it's called "another rhythm", I think,

714
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 which is when humans are awake, but with their eyes closed,

715
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 it's the rhythm the your brain waves give off.

716
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And yeah, it was an experiment to show, look guys,

717
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 we're sort of keeping a lot of people apparently alive who are just definitely dead.

718
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Wow.

719
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Or that actually all jelly's are sentient.

720
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Or yep, that was another interpretation, which was a more nation interpretation.

721
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Some people certainly thought it.

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Do you guys know about the jelly houses of Covent Garden?

723
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 No.

724
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 So they exist, they exist, do they exist now?

725
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 No, they don't exist now.

726
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Yeah, it doesn't sound like a durable material.

727
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 So I'm surprised.

728
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 So this was in the late 18th century.

729
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And what it was is, this was to do with sex work.

730
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 So a high-end sex worker would sit in a cafe in Covent Garden

731
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 and they would have next to them some jelly.

732
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And if you saw them with jelly, that would set.

733
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 It's basically like a red light district kind of thing.

734
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 It's saying that that's what I do for a living.

735
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I'm a sex worker.

736
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Is that where the phrase, I don't think you're ready for my jelly comes from?

737
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 That's bizarre.

738
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Yeah, so some people were just enjoying jelly.

739
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Well, it led to, yeah, a lot of awkwardness, but...

740
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Of course, was it like meant to be a post-coitle snack perhaps?

741
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I don't know if the jelly ever was consumed as part of the transaction,

742
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 but it was the signal to say that this is what I do for a living.

743
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Sure, I just wondered why, particularly you choose jelly.

744
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 But if you did have to consume it before every time,

745
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 then you have to buy a hell of a lot of jelly if you're a successful prostitute.

746
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 So it's probably not.

747
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 But it makes no less sense than a red light district.

748
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Well, yeah.

749
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Red light is traditionally associated with stop.

750
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 No, no action, no movement.

751
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Yeah.

752
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 I know what you mean.

753
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Whereas jelly is quite sexy food.

754
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 I think it is kind of, isn't it?

755
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Because of the movement and the wobbling.

756
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Yes.

757
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Until the children's party business got in on it,

758
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 I wish I would have very quickly stopped becoming sexy.

759
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Well, there was a book.

760
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I was reading the article called The Jello Cid and her own,

761
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Investigating Popular Culture in Jelly by Sarah E. Newton.

762
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And she wrote that there was a book called Recipes to Make Your Honeymoon Last,

763
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 which was actually in 1987, so not that long ago.

764
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And 33% of the salad recipes contain jelly.

765
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 What?

766
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Yes.

767
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Salad.

768
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Wow.

769
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 So I was reading this and it seems to me like in America,

770
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 they have jelly in the salad.

771
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Okay.

772
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And not a fruit salad.

773
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 No.

774
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 How disgusting.

775
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 I know.

776
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Recipes to Make Your Honeymoon Last.

777
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Yeah.

778
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 1987.

779
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 1987.

780
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Year of my birth.

781
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Oh.

782
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Let's draw no conclusions.

783
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 There was a bit of sexy food.

784
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 What was that called?

785
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Spoony.

786
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Spoony.

787
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Spoony business.

788
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Spoony courtship.

789
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Spoony courtship.

790
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Spoony courtship.

791
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Spoony courtship.

792
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Spoony courtship.

793
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Spoony courtship.

794
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Spoony courtship.

795
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Spoony courtship.

796
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Spoony courtship.

797
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Spoony courtship.

798
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Spoony courtship.

799
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Spoony courtship.

800
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Spoony courtship.

801
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Spoony courtship.

802
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Spoony courtship.

803
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Spoony courtship.

804
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Spoony courtship.

805
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Spoony courtship.

806
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Spoony courtship.

807
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Spoony courtship.

808
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Spoony courtship.

809
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Spoony courtship.

810
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Spoony courtship.

811
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Spoony courtship.

812
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Yeah.

813
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,720
 to advertise what she did.

814
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,560
 - Yes.

815
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,400
 - Very good.

816
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
 - 'Cause it's sweet.

817
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,080
 - No, it's sour.

818
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,280
 - It's a whole and she looks.

819
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,120
 - Sorry, I thought you meant it.

820
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,920
 Slit your sleepy and it's time to get a bed.

821
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,200
 (laughing)

822
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,720
 - I've been revved off of so many jelly houses.

823
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,040
 (laughing)

824
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
 - Oh god.

825
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,800
 - Sorry, your legs.

826
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,840
 So they test their drink.

827
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,360
 - By dipping a telescope into it.

828
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,440
 (laughing)

829
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,280
 - What?

830
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,720
 - It's called the dipping refractometer.

831
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,080
 It's a tiny telescope.

832
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,920
 - Okay.

833
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,480
 - It's not like a judge or a bank.

834
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,680
 (laughing)

835
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,680
 You dip a tiny one and it goes into each hole in the hole,

836
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,960
 it's 'cause it's quite bubbly.

837
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,320
 And it sees how much the light is refracted

838
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,400
 and that tells you whether you've got good olix on that.

839
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
 - Cool.

840
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,600
 - Is there a perfect refraction level,

841
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
 sort of 38 degrees or something?

842
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,160
 - I imagine there is, but I don't know what it is.

843
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,320
 - That's incredible.

844
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,320
 - And it's to test the concentration of ingredients

845
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,440
 in the sample.

846
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,280
 - Right.

847
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,120
 - Oh yeah.

848
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,960
 - It's hard if you've made it right.

849
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,200
 - Just a quick thing on jelly beans.

850
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,280
 I was reading up on jelly, I went to jelly beans.

851
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,960
 And jelly belly, who make all the biggest brand of jelly beans.

852
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,160
 So to get their flavors, they have to invent interesting ways

853
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,720
 to sort of get this new flavor that they're advertising.

854
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,480
 And there's a line that they have,

855
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,760
 which is called Bertie Bots Every Flavor Beans,

856
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,160
 which is kind of like a Harry Potter one

857
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,080
 where it's meant to taste of horrible stuff.

858
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,840
 So the way that they actually do that

859
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,480
 is to make the taste of the beans.

860
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,360
 So let's say it's stinky socks.

861
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,400
 They actually had a scientist have socks worn for weeks,

862
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
 then put them into a plastic bag.

863
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,440
 They had to eat the age of them to be even smellier.

864
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,320
 And then he popped them into a gas chromatograph,

865
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,640
 which is basically something that just breaks down

866
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,440
 the molecules to understand the smells.

867
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,000
 Takes the flavor makeup from this specific scientist's socks.

868
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,920
 And that is now the smelly socks jelly bean.

869
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,320
 Yeah, that is the actual socks of a guy.

870
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,360
 - That's incredible.

871
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,520
 - Yeah.

872
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
 - They do it for a bunch of ones.

873
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
 They try to do a pizza flavor one,

874
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,600
 but it ended up tasting like vomit.

875
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,640
 So they put it aside.

876
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,880
 And then they needed a vomit jelly bean.

877
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,240
 So they just found the pizza one.

878
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,640
 Remember that pizza one?

879
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,080
 And that's now the, do you know what they could have used?

880
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,000
 They could have used a parmesan flavored bean.

881
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,800
 Because parmesan smells like vomit.

882
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,480
 And if you tell people that they're smelling vomit,

883
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,320
 they're disgusted.

884
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,520
 And then if you tell them, oh, don't worry,

885
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,440
 it's only parmesan, the disgust bit of their brain

886
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,360
 switches off.

887
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,200
 - Really?

888
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,040
 - Oh yeah, I love parmesan.

889
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
 - Because I was having this conversation yesterday

890
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,120
 with someone actually, what?

891
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
 Well, let's say it's a hypothetical situation

892
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,280
 where someone farts.

893
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
 - Okay.

894
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,960
 - And then--

895
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,800
 - Okay, and then--

896
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 - Then the other person says--

897
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
 - This is completely identical, right?

898
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,640
 - This is a situation we were imagining.

899
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,480
 - Yeah.

900
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,320
 - Someone sparsed it.

901
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,080
 And then the other person says, that smells exactly like eggs.

902
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
 And then the first person says, well,

903
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,840
 if it was actually eggs, you wouldn't find it disgusting.

904
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,720
 So why are you so disgusted?

905
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,560
 - Ah.

906
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
 - And debating whether or not, if you fart,

907
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,520
 and then you tell someone, oh, don't worry,

908
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,760
 I'm just boiling an egg.

909
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,600
 - Yeah?

910
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,440
 - Then they're not gonna be,

911
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
 they're not gonna find it unpleasant, are they?

912
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,120
 And that implies that they wouldn't.

913
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,360
 - Yeah, but you can't always boil an egg, say,

914
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,200
 if you're--

915
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,040
 - In the lift.

916
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,880
 - In the lift.

917
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,200
 (laughing)

918
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,880
 - No, I think if you always keep a camping stove

919
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,960
 with you all the time, the box of eggs.

920
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,880
 - It's worth a try.

921
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
 - Yeah.

922
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,560
 - You won't get kicked out of the film, but--

923
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,880
 (laughing)

924
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,460
 (upbeat music)

925
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,280
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

926
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,680

 (upbeat music)

944
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:47,740
 - I did actually read about that, and it said the Kings

945
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,940
 representative would march around to the poop.

946
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,780
 - Deck.

947
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,940
 - The poop deck, absolutely.

948
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,740
 (laughing)

949
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,940
 - Jesus Christ, it's a funny phrase.

950
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,780
 - It's funny work.

951
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,620
 - There it is.

952
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
 - There were some 11 year olds listening

953
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,380
 to this, just pressing themselves.

954
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,420
 (laughing)

955
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,020
 (upbeat music)

956
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
