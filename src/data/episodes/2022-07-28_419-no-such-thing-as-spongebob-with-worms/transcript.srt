1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,500
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,820
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,900
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,620
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,020
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,260
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,860
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,340
 and in a particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,220
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,780
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,500
 in the 1920 Winter Olympics, US skater, Teresa Weld,

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,620
 was the only woman in the figure skating who performed jumps.

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,420
 But she was marked down every time she did

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,100
 because her skirt rose above her knees,

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,580
 which was considered too scandalous.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,500
 - Mm, did she have pants on?

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,340
 (laughing)

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,820
 - You can't tell if it's got rises above the knees.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,980
 - Depends how long the pants are.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,940
 - Yeah, possibly they could be like bloomers.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,420
 - Yeah, they did wear pants down to the knees back then.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,420
 - So it sounds very sexy, James.

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,260
 - Oh yeah.

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,220
 - And clearly it was at the time.

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,180
 - Yeah, it depends when about she were.

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,860
 If she wore what she was wearing then,

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,500
 now in the Winter Olympics,

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,740
 like just to show behind the curtain,

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,780
 we're actually recording this

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,740
 when the Winter Olympics is on.

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,500
 And you're gonna hear this in the spring, but...

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
 - Sounds like she was showing people

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,300
 why in the curtain of her dress.

36
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,140
 - Yeah?

37
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,260
 - Wow.

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,300
 (laughing)

40
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,140
 - Andy's drunk just so everyone knows.

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,500
 (laughing)

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,100
 - But yeah, she would have worn a skirt

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,460
 that was kind of round the ankles at the time

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,300
 because that's the way that women--

45
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,380
 - She wouldn't have worn her skirt around her ankles.

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,740
 She wouldn't have worn a skirt.

47
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,500
 - That does lose you points actually, yeah.

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,620
 (laughing)

49
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,660
 - It was round her ankles,

50
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,100
 but also round her calves, and her knees,

51
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,500
 and her thighs, and her bum.

52
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
 - Yes, and that is the normal way

53
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,860
 of describing the length skirt.

54
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,180
 (laughing)

55
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
 - And yeah, this is the way that basically

56
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,900
 until the 20s and 30s,

57
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,500
 women figure skaters would wear long dresses.

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,340
 - That's amazing.

59
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,100
 - And it was only when a very famous skater

60
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,660
 called Sonja Haney came along

61
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,100
 and she was only 11 when she started to compete.

62
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,140
 And 'cause she was a child,

63
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,960
 she could get away with wearing like children's clothes.

64
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,020
 - Right, sorry, I thought she'd get away

65
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,300
 with wearing much sexier stuff.

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,620
 (laughing)

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,420
 - Well, she didn't have to wear full adult long dresses,

68
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,380
 and she could do these amazing jumps,

69
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,460
 and then all of the adult skaters had to wear a short skirt

70
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,940
 so that they could keep up with her amazing skills.

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,940
 - So, what was the skating like

72
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,340
 if Theresa Weld was the only person doing jumps?

73
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,460
 What were the others doing in their show-off with skating?

74
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,060
 - Well, it's called figure skating,

75
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,700
 so they were doing figures mostly.

76
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,280
 - Like carving out shapes in the ice.

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
 - Yeah, exactly, not so much carving out

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,680
 so that you could then pull it out and there's a shape there.

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
 - The last person always fell through, didn't they?

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,400
 Once you connected the lines.

81
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
 - Yeah, exactly.

82
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,560
 So, what you would do is you would do the shapes

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,120
 of a figure of eight, or at the very start of figure skating,

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,720
 someone would shout out what figure they wanted you to do,

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
 so they'd shout out, you know, snowman,

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,160
 and then you'd have to do a shape of a snowman,

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,520
 and then they'd shout out something else

88
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
 and you'd have to do that.

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,280
 - That's really cool.

90
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,040
 - But really in the olden days,

91
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,540
 figure skating, especially for women,

92
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,580
 wasn't about the jumps.

93
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,540
 It was about doing something graceful,

94
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,220
 doing lots of shapes and stuff like that,

95
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,060
 and then when this woman came in, Teresa Weld,

96
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,620
 she was the first to do the jumps,

97
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,540
 and then before long, everyone was doing jumps,

98
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,220
 and now they're doing kick-ass jumps.

99
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,220
 - Yeah, and the jumps sort of took over in a way

100
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,340
 because in television terms, drawing these circles

101
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,140
 into the ice wasn't as televisual for the Olympics,

102
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,980
 so it'd usually be 60% or so of the mark

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,820
 that you would get was for the figures

104
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,200
 that you were creating in the ice,

105
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
 and they just sort of thought that's a bit crap.

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
 - It sounds incredible, the process,

107
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
 because it was ended about 30 years ago, wasn't it?

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,920
 They stopped having actual figures,

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,960
 so I read a bit about that,

110
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,400
 and the judging took such a long time,

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,320
 so there were 41 different figures at the start of it,

112
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,400
 which you would have to be able to master,

113
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,920
 but the judges would examine the skating three times,

114
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,880
 as in they'd examine the shapes on the ice.

115
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
 They would get down on their stomachs like detectives

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,440
 to tell if there was a slight variation in the line,

117
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,280
 or detectives.

118
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,180
 - It was, generally it was only detectives

119
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,660
 getting their stomachs in the prime scenes.

120
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,940
 - It was like forensics.

121
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,780
 - What they used to do,

122
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,540
 they would skate the shape of a dead body

123
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,700
 with the name of the ice.

124
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,600
 - That was figure 37, yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,860
 No, apparently the judging could last up to eight hours,

126
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,660
 which sounds, I read an article from the Dutch Beagle,

127
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,500
 the German thing,

128
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,620
 and it was saying, it was from the '80s,

129
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,540
 just before it ended,

130
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,940
 and it was like, this is so boring.

131
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,100
 - There was a guy called George Anderson

132
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,420
 who wrote a skating book in the 1860s,

133
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,200
 and he wrote that after the shamrock,

134
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,720
 a one foot figure requiring three turns

135
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
 and two changes of edge,

136
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,220
 the acme of female accomplishment has now been reached.

137
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,060
 - Wow.

138
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,480
 - So he's like, once you've done the shamrock,

139
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,880
 there's literally nothing better than that, true?

140
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,280
 - Downhill ever since.

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,500
 All these quintuple spins.

142
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,160
 - One of the early guys who sort of turned figure skating

143
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,920
 into the sort of art that it is now

144
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
 was a guy called Jackson Haynes.

145
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,640
 He was from New York, born in 1840s,

146
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 and he started, he was the person

147
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,500
 who kind of turned it into more of a dance.

148
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,620
 You know, he was trained in ballet,

149
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,220
 and he took popular dances like the waltz,

150
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,220
 and he turned that into what you would do on the ice.

151
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,020
 And he did this in America, and they hated it there,

152
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,140
 so he came over to Europe,

153
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,780
 and he started performing it here,

154
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,820
 and they loved it here,

155
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,900
 and he performed to royalty.

156
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,660
 But I've been reading into banned things

157
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,020
 that would get you deducted points

158
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,180
 or that you're not allowed to do it all.

159
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,780
 And one of the things in modern times

160
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,440
 is you're not allowed same sex couples

161
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,320
 when you do Olympic or even any sort of official skating.

162
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,620
 And it turns out that the very first pairing,

163
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,120
 which is with Jackson Haynes, was a same sex couple.

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
 - Was it?

165
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,800
 - Yeah.

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,640
 - Well, he was dancing with another guy.

167
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
 - Yeah, he was dancing with another guy.

168
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,480
 It was in Vienna.

169
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,800
 It was called Franz Bellasi,

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
 and they were the first ever couple,

171
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
 and he's held up actually as a result

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,760
 as a sort of LGBT pioneer.

173
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,080
 - Is he, are we sure they weren't doing

174
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,360
 the same sex couple just 'cause it was so regressive

175
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,300
 that women weren't allowed to do figure skating?

176
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,740
 Was it that they were a--

177
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,580
 - No, I think--

178
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,420
 - Progressive, progressive.

179
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,120
 You know, at a certain point in the circle

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,060
 that they're the same?

181
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,500
 That's possible, although he's sort of been embraced

182
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,260
 by the community of sort of being progressive.

183
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,540
 - Was it the tango that was also like that originally?

184
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,020
 - Just really, all male.

185
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,420
 - Yeah, there was one dance,

186
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,300
 I can't remember whether it was flamenco or tango,

187
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,060
 or there was a huge dance craze, which was men only,

188
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,940
 that we think of as a mixed-sex dance these days.

189
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,780
 - Right.

190
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,620
 - It was classically meant to be that.

191
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,460
 - Yeah.

192
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,340
 - And it was as well that Haynes wasn't,

193
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,360
 he was dressed as a bear at the time.

194
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,600
 - Oh, was he?

195
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,340
 - Yeah, wasn't strictly two men dancing together.

196
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,620
 - I think that is still strictly--

197
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,820
 (laughing)

198
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,020
 - Well, yeah.

199
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,500
 I mean, if only strictly was like that.

200
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,140
 - Dan, do you watch the Masked Singer

201
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,400
 and you go, "Well, obviously it's an actual robot bunny."

202
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,220
 I mean, I don't know what they're talking about,

203
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,140
 celebrities, this is clearly a big pile of donuts.

204
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,620
 - I'm afraid you are disqualified, it's a human only.

205
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,540
 - Human only, sorry.

206
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,220
 - So women, women skating was a kind of a thing,

207
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,420
 or women competing anyway in figure skating.

208
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,460
 And it was actually because of the clothes,

209
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,780
 these long dresses that they weren't allowed to take part

210
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,940
 in the world championships.

211
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,300
 So there was basically only men

212
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,460
 who entered figure skating contests for ages,

213
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,380
 and it just wasn't really, didn't occur to people

214
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,580
 that a woman might enter, so they didn't ban it.

215
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,780
 And then this amazing skater called Madge Sires

216
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,580
 entered in 1902, the world figure skating championships.

217
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,940
 And she got silver, and there was lots of reports

218
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,380
 saying she should have got gold,

219
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,340
 and actually the winner was a guy called Ulrich Salko,

220
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,940
 and he offered her his gold medal, 'cause he said,

221
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,700
 "I think you were actually the deserving winner,

222
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,860
 "you were better than I was."

223
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,180
 But anyway, then the judges are like,

224
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,860
 "Oh, bummer, we weren't supposed to have women in this,

225
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,900
 "what are we gonna do?"

226
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,180
 And so they went through all the problems

227
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,340
 with having women figure skate,

228
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,340
 and they basically said it was things like,

229
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,300
 "The problem with it is that a judge might judge a girl

230
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,500
 "on how much he's attracted to her,

231
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,580
 "rather than how good she is at skating."

232
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,700
 - There's definitely a problem with the female skater,

233
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,180
 rather than with the judges there.

234
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, get her off the ice.

235
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
 But the other thing was, 'cause their dresses are so long,

236
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,660
 you can't see their feet,

237
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,060
 so they could be doing anything under there.

238
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,740
 They could be cheating, they could have five feet,

239
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,060
 they could have a child under there.

240
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
 - They could have a child under there.

241
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,580
 - Yeah, yeah, like have a snobberbill.

242
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,340
 - Yeah, exactly.

243
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,780
 - What do you think is like sneaking into a cinema,

244
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,620
 where it's sort of sitting on top of a lot of the code?

245
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,460
 - Three kids in a code, and they can't let

246
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,420
 that kind of thing get through.

247
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,380
 And so to be fair to Matt, she did say,

248
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,340
 "Well, I'm very happy to wear a shorter skirt."

249
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,980
 But then obviously she couldn't do that either,

250
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,300
 so it was really rocking a hard place.

251
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,820
 - Right, although while we're on men and women skating,

252
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,580
 the patron saint of figure skating is a woman.

253
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,740
 Saint Lidwina, you heard of her?

254
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,580
 - Yeah, no.

255
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,820
 - She was a Dutch teenager, 'cause you know

256
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,260
 there are lots of canals and things in the Netherlands,

257
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,100
 and they are from Friesey,

258
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,780
 but there are lots of skating happens on them.

259
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,340
 And I think this was in the 13th century.

260
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,220
 Anyway, she was skating, she fell, she broke her leg,

261
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,580
 and she never recovered.

262
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,380
 And as a result, she's the patron saint of figure skating.

263
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,220
 - Right.

264
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,540
 - I'm not completely sure why.

265
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,380
 - When was she around?

266
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,500
 - 13th, a long time ago, several hundred years ago.

267
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,780
 And it was, it sounds quite stressful.

268
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,300
 There aren't, they think she might have had something

269
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,020
 that we'd recognize as a modern condition today,

270
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,260
 maybe the first ever case of MS,

271
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,020
 but also the saintly accounts are so strange and exaggerated.

272
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,460
 It's kind of hard to diagnose.

273
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,540
 So for example, large pieces of her body fell off,

274
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,220
 blood poured from her mouth, ears, and nose.

275
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,620
 She shed bones, skin, and part of her intestines,

276
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,340
 and her parents kept them in a vase.

277
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
 And they gave off--

278
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,020
 - That's not MS.

279
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,860
 (laughing)

280
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,700
 - And they gave off an incredible--

281
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,680
 - That's the walking dead to what you're describing.

282
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,220
 - Her parents kept these bits of her body in a vase

283
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,420
 and they gave off a sweet odor,

284
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,620
 so they knew she was holy.

285
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,060
 - Oh, the odor of sanctity.

286
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,820
 - Yeah, exactly, so it's holy.

287
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,660
 Anyway, so--

288
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,300
 - Wait, is she still alive while this is happening?

289
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

290
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,660
 - What, while her intestines are in the vase?

291
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,140
 - I think, from the account I read, yes.

292
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,980
 - Well, I was gonna say,

293
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,140
 doesn't it sound like she's very good at skating

294
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,980
 if she broke her leg?

295
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,540
 But to be honest, if she's missing half of her body parts,

296
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,620
 it sounds like, well done to her for getting up

297
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,460
 in the morning.

298
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

299
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,420
 - She never skated again, anyway.

300
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,260
 (laughing)

301
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,100
 - Wow.

302
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,740
 - That's very funny.

303
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,140
 - You still get costume infringements, don't you,

304
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,980
 in skating?

305
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,820
 I hadn't realized this.

306
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,300
 In fact, I knew very little about figure skating,

307
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,580
 but you can get points docked

308
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,740
 for wearing the wrong stuff now.

309
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,220
 Well, you used to be able to,

310
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,660
 until I think about less than 20 years ago,

311
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,580
 it used to be that women couldn't wear skirts

312
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,140
 that came up above the bum or the hips,

313
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,980
 so you had to wear a skirt.

314
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,820
 - Above the bum?

315
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,660
 - Yeah, so sorry, you had to--

316
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,820
 - Too sexy, that's so sexy, it's above the bum.

317
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,940
 That was just having a bum out, wasn't it?

318
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,780
 - Hang on.

319
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,340
 - I don't wanna sound like a prude,

320
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,140
 but I do think there are some good reasons why.

321
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,500
 - I think every now and then,

322
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,180
 the phrase, "You're not going out looking like that,

323
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,660
 "you're bleeding" is appropriate.

324
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,180
 I've misspoken.

325
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,740
 They had to wear skirts and they had to be below the bum.

326
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,940
 I should have said it like that.

327
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,420
 Yeah, so you would be fined--

328
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,940
 - So you'd have to cover the bum?

329
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,020
 - You had to cover the bum.

330
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,860
 You'd have a point docked.

331
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,020
 - Well, you don't anymore, you can wear a leotard, can't you?

332
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,860
 - Yes.

333
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,780
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,180
 But your bum is not fully out.

335
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,780
 There's no mooning at the Olympics.

336
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,860
 - I don't know what the rules are on that,

337
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,140
 but I think you have to cover the genitals.

338
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,540
 - And you think you might get jumped

339
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,020
 as one of those detectives.

340
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,220
 (all laughing)

341
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,020
 - What a finishing move that would be for your routine.

342
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,940
 Lots of jumps, lots of spins,

343
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,780
 and a full moon at the end of it.

344
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,580
 (all laughing)

345
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,140
 - Suck it, guys.

346
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,980
 - So on infringements, there was someone

347
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,260
 at the 2018 Winter Olympics called Gabriela Papadakis,

348
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,220
 whose nipple fell out during her performance, right?

349
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,260
 - A Jackson moment.

350
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,100
 - A Jackson moment.

351
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,420
 - When you say fell out.

352
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,220
 - It just, it didn't fall off her body like that.

353
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
 - They said an argument, they fell out,

354
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,220
 and-- - It smelled sweet, though.

355
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,820
 It had the odor of sanctity.

356
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,260
 - The detectives rushed onto the ice to collect it.

357
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,500
 - And put it in a jar.

358
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,900
 - It came out of her costume.

359
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,300
 And it looks, it's like your worst nightmare,

360
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,820
 but also you're getting point stocks.

361
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,980
 Not only have you exposed yourself in national television,

362
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,380
 you also get points deducted.

363
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,100
 They still got silver, impressively.

364
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,500
 - Have you heard of the job

365
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,020
 of the Olympic figure skating poo wrangler?

366
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,260
 - Jesus Christ.

367
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,100
 - No.

368
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,940
 - No.

369
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,060
 - Is it surely the detective can double up?

370
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,620
 (all laughing)

371
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,540
 - Take a scoop on.

372
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,180
 - What on earth could this be?

373
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,580
 Oh, I know, is it about Hanyu, the Japanese guy?

374
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,420
 - Yes, it is.

375
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,500
 - I do know that, yeah.

376
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,860
 - So this is a skater, he's called,

377
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,820
 yeah, he's Japanese, he's called Yuzuru Hanyu,

378
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,940
 and he's associated with Winnie the Pooh.

379
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,780
 As in, he loves Winnie the Pooh,

380
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,980
 and his fans, as a result, love Winnie the Pooh too.

381
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,900
 And whenever he skates,

382
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,660
 they throw Winnie the Pooh stuffed toys onto the ice.

383
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,380
 - That sounds like it would ruin your routine.

384
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,780
 - They throw hundreds.

385
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,620
 It's insane.

386
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,300
 And there was a job at the last,

387
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,180
 I don't know if it's at every single Olympics,

388
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,300
 but basically there has to be someone who skates around,

389
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,780
 scooping up the Winnie the Poohs.

390
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,620
 - Right.

391
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,460
 - And shoving them into a huge golf park.

392
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,260
 - I watched Hanyu in this Olympics,

393
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,780
 and there was no Winnie the Poohs there.

394
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,860
 So maybe because of COVID?

395
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,620
 - So, well, Xi Jinping is compared,

396
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,300
 Xi Jinping hates being compared to Winnie the Pooh.

397
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,620
 - I forgot about that, yes.

398
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,460
 - For some reason, for such a powerful guy,

399
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
 he's pretty thin-skinned about this.

400
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,180
 He doesn't like being compared to Winnie the Pooh.

401
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,340
 And yeah, and so it wouldn't be a big problem.

402
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,140
 Fortunately, foreign spectators have not been allowed

403
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,460
 into China for this Olympics.

404
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,380
 So no Winnie the Poohs have been chucked on.

405
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,100
 - Hanyu's fans are super crazy.

406
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,220
 Like, they literally, they're called fan news,

407
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,300
 and they go around the world just following.

408
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,940
 Like, if they can get tickets anywhere,

409
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,820
 they'll go on eBay for thousands of pounds.

410
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,460
 Like, he's really, really super famous in Japan, yeah.

411
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,300
 - Well, what's weird is,

412
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,380
 I've been to a few sporting events recently,

413
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,940
 and in most cases these days,

414
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,580
 you get checked as you're coming in

415
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,660
 to these sort of bigger ones.

416
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,700
 You have to, you know, if you go even see gigs

417
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,740
 at like the O2, there's a metal detector and so on.

418
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,580
 - Right.

419
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,060
 - Surely that's the spot to put the Pooh wrangler,

420
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,900
 you know, to...

421
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,660
 (laughing)

422
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,780
 - But I think normally when it's not happening in a state

423
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,820
 where the totalitarian head of state

424
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,700
 is compared to Winnie the Pooh and hates it.

425
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,100
 - I'm not talking about current Beijing,

426
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,540
 I'm talking about any other...

427
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,300
 - I think they're fine with it, I like that.

428
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,140
 - So they're fine with it.

429
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,060
 - Yeah, it's fun, yeah.

430
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,020
 - I think surely not at an Olympic level,

431
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,780
 if you're going for gold, he'd be really annoyed.

432
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,620
 Surely they'd hold back then.

433
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,740
 - It's not at him on the ice.

434
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,580
 - Oh.

435
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,380
 - It's onto the ice while he's performing.

436
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,220
 - It's after he's finished.

437
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
 - It's after he's finished, yeah, yeah.

438
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,900
 - Okay, 'cause they're really off-putting.

439
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,980
 - It's not mid-routine, yeah.

440
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,820
 - Okay.

441
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,180
 - But it is apparently off-putting for his opponent.

442
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,140
 So Nathan Chen, who's the other really amazing

443
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,500
 figure skater male, his manager hates it.

444
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,900
 His manager thinks it's like psychological warfare

445
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,740
 against him.

446
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,140
 - He's jealous 'cause he wants a teddy.

447
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,460
 That's so sad, 'cause that's from Djokovic's behavior.

448
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,180
 - I wonder if he's been trying to push his own thing,

449
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,820
 like Trolls or My Little Pony, he's like, "Come on."

450
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,020
 (laughing)

451
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,500
 - One sad Troll thrown by his manager at this point.

452
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,380
 - So the whole thing about the couples doing their dances,

453
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
 I was reading this article where it sort of says,

454
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
 obviously the choreography is amazing,

455
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,220
 but also what they want is emotion

456
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,420
 and they want to feel a routine.

457
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,580
 And so a love story tends to be the thing

458
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,620
 that you kind of go for.

459
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,700
 And so a problem that siblings have is that they obviously,

460
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,540
 it's a bit off if you see a brother and sister

461
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,820
 kind of doing sort of that.

462
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,580
 So they have a really odd position where they have to come up

463
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,660
 with slightly kookier routines as a result

464
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,700
 because they can't be seen to be like almost kissing

465
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,660
 at the end of a routine.

466
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,860
 - There was one in this Olympics.

467
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,780
 I'm not sure if it was brother and sister.

468
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,980
 It probably wasn't, but one of them was in the alien

469
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,260
 and the other one was someone being probed.

470
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,740
 (laughing)

471
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,780
 - It would still be too sexy for brother and sister,

472
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,620
 I think.

473
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,620
 - You get the Benny Hill music playing.

474
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,860
 One of them chasing the other one with a probe

475
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,180
 has 10 points for me.

476
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,020
 - It's not interesting.

477
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,900
 They've never tried the Benny Hill music, to my knowledge.

478
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,660
 (laughing)

479
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,180
 - Too sexual, that's the problem.

480
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,780
 - One of the most famous figure skaters of all time,

481
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,620
 Tonya Harding, at least one of the most infamous.

482
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,460
 I was reading up on her.

483
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,380
 I never saw that movie with Margot Robbie.

484
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,700
 - Eitania.

485
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,780
 - Eitania, yeah, but what a pretty extraordinary life

486
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
 that she's led even post her career.

487
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,620
 So she got banned as a result of a controversy

488
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,340
 where she was implicated in harming another skater.

489
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
 What was her name?

490
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,020
 Nancy Kerrigan.

491
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,700
 - Neat capping nose, no, it was a breeze.

492
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,860
 - It was her ex-husband hired someone to do it

493
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,500
 and what came out through court cases was that

494
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,020
 maybe she had an inkling that this was gonna happen,

495
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,780
 that they were planning something.

496
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,300
 That's got her a lifetime ban, basically.

497
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,740
 But post this happening, she released a sex tape.

498
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,100
 It was a sort of leaked sex tape,

499
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,740
 but then she went to Penthouse, I think it was,

500
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,700
 and they were playboy and said,

501
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,940
 "You can officially release it for a man of money."

502
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,340
 She became a manager for Pro Wrestlers.

503
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,140
 She became herself a boxer.

504
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,980
 She did boxing.

505
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,940
 She started a band called the Golden Blades.

506
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,260
 They got booed off stage on their

507
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,900
 first gig. - Oh my gosh.

508
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,340
 - Yeah, she's worked as a welder, a painter and a metal,

509
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,260
 yeah, this is her career.

510
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,900
 A painter at a metal fabrication company,

511
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,260
 a hardware sales clerk, a deck builder.

512
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,900
 She set the automobile racing land speed record.

513
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,620
 Tonya's had a fucking life.

514
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,060
 - She's desperately trying to erase

515
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,740
 the one thing everyone knows about her.

516
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,220
 Just trying anything on a Wikipedia

517
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,420
 is all these different things,

518
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,700
 but they still put that at the time.

519
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,260
 - Exactly, but she was an amazing figure skater

520
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,300
 and when they made this movie with Margot Robbie,

521
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,740
 there's a scene in it where Margot Robbie

522
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,340
 has to do a triple axel and Margot Robbie,

523
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,980
 who did train to do it, obviously couldn't do it,

524
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,220
 but they also couldn't find anyone to do it

525
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,820
 because it's so rare that anyone's ever landed that,

526
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,460
 that they had to use CGI in the film, yeah.

527
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,300
 - She's also amazing at bow and arrow shooting.

528
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,620
 - She shoots the show.

529
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,580
 - There was a piece about her that interviewed her

530
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,980
 and she goes hunting a lot with her husband,

531
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,660
 like hunting sort of elephants.

532
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,700
 - Other figure skaters.

533
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,300
 (all laughing)

534
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:49,060
 - Hunting elk and such like.

535
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,620
 And her husband takes a big gun

536
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,180
 and she just takes a bow and arrow.

537
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,900
 She says because she wants to give the animal

538
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,220
 a 50/50 chance to make it interesting and fair,

539
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,580
 although the journalist points out also

540
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,060
 because felons aren't technically supposed

541
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,180
 to possess guns in Washington state.

542
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,760
 (upbeat music)

543
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,620
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

544
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,340
 - My fact this week is that in the early 1900s,

545
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,500
 the US government installed telephones

546
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,960
 at the top of trees.

547
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,700
 - What?

548
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
 - Be cool.

549
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,380
 - What?

550
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,060
 - Convenient place to make a call.

551
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,900
 This--

552
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,500
 - A trunk call.

553
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,340
 - Good.

554
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,180
 - Yeah.

555
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,020
 - Is that a thing?

556
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
 - That's a very old fashioned term

557
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,220
 for a very long distance phone call, yeah.

558
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,060
 - Oh, okay.

559
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,780
 - Would have got a huge laugh in the '70s.

560
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,540
 This is, it was the US Forest Service

561
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,580
 that started installing them

562
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
 at like 10th of the century, early 1900s,

563
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,100
 and it was for fire lookouts.

564
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
 So it was in like fire prone states

565
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,740
 like your Arizona's or your California's,

566
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,680
 and they'd find the tallest tree

567
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,420
 on top of the biggest hill in the area,

568
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,460
 and then they'd climb to the top,

569
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,980
 they'd put a ladder up the tree,

570
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,540
 and then a ranger would basically

571
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,940
 lop off the top of the tree,

572
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,220
 and in its place put a platform there,

573
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,100
 and on the platform is just a telephone.

574
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,940
 And then a guy's job is to sit at the top of the tree,

575
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
 and then if he sees a fire,

576
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,380
 he makes a phone call and says fire,

577
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,540
 and they go and put it out.

578
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,180
 It's so cool.

579
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,900
 And sometimes, what I didn't get was it says,

580
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,300
 sometimes they're worked in pairs,

581
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,020
 and so there'd be two of them up the tree,

582
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,980
 and one of them spots the fire

583
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,940
 and then sends the other one to put it out.

584
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,300
 But I don't understand how one single human being,

585
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,540
 I imagine they weren't giant forest fires,

586
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,020
 yeah, there's a small campfire, I suppose.

587
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,060
 - What would you be, you would just,

588
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,020
 if it was small enough,

589
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,860
 you'd only see a plume of smoke, right?

590
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,940
 I think as soon as you see flames,

591
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,740
 that one guy's not really gonna appreciate

592
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,980
 what's being sent on his own.

593
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
 - Once the flames are coming out

594
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,300
 at the top of the forest.

595
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,500
 - Were you allowed to use the telephones for other things,

596
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,820
 like calling your mates or stuff?

597
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,060
 - No personal phone calls.

598
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
 They do go through at the end of the month,

599
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,540
 it's your phone record.

600
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,060
 The bill's very high this month.

601
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,940
 We don't remember hearing from you at all, lots of fires.

602
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,580
 - They're still there today, some of them, it's amazing.

603
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,900
 They get called the freaks of the peaks.

604
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,260
 It's one cool nickname they have.

605
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,420
 - The trees. - The people are the trees.

606
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,540
 - The people, the people, I think.

607
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,940
 But there are not many left.

608
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,460
 There were 5,000 at most in the '30s,

609
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,220
 and now there I think are a few hundred, maybe 500.

610
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
 - I think it went up, I think it was peak was the '50s,

611
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,500
 where there were about 10,000 in the US.

612
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,300
 But yeah, I think such a cool job,

613
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,620
 such an interesting kind of person who does that job.

614
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,220
 - You've got to be very happy with your own company.

615
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,060
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

616
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,580
 - Well, I know if there's two of you up there.

617
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,420
 - That's a good point.

618
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,740
 But in most cases, it's like the lookout,

619
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,180
 not the tree situation, but other lookout.

620
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,100
 Sounds like it was one person the entire time.

621
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,420
 - Yeah, it mostly does seem to be one person.

622
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,660
 - Jack Kerouac was one of these guys, wasn't he?

623
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,100
 - Was he? - Yeah, he was.

624
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,380
 He spent 63 days as a US Forest Service fire lookout

625
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,100
 on a place called Desolation Peak.

626
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,940
 - Sounds fun.

627
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,700
 - Yeah, and he went there thinking that he'll be on his own.

628
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,420
 He only has to look out for fires for a while,

629
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,860
 so it'll be fine, he can write some stuff.

630
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,740
 But in the end, he wrote only one letter to his mother,

631
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,620
 some Haiku poetry, and a couple of journal entries

632
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,700
 and no novels.

633
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,180
 - Well, I was reading one of the lookouts today

634
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,540
 who says when new people come to do the job,

635
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,180
 apply for the job, they imagine they're gonna do

636
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,980
 all this stuff, like write their great novel

637
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,780
 and learn an instrument, he says, or you know, they think--

638
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,600
 - Oh my God, imagine if you had like two of you

639
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,940
 at the top of the thing.

640
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,540
 You see a laughing point climbing with the bagpipes.

641
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
 Oh, here we go.

642
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,900
 - You laugh.

643
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,460
 There's genuinely a girl who's learning bagpipes

644
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,300
 while she does this.

645
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,380
 - Really? - I believe she is.

646
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,220
 - Is she by herself?

647
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,060
 - So true ones.

648
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,100
 - Yes. - Okay.

649
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,220
 - Yeah. - Oh God.

650
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,140
 - But yeah, he says people tend to get nothing done.

651
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,660
 You actually go and you end up--

652
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
 - Oh, I'm sure.

653
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,180
 I mean, you'd always think you'd only get stuff done

654
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,020
 and you never do.

655
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,940
 That's just life.

656
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,660
 - I mean, your job is literally doing nothing.

657
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,500
 - But it's to look.

658
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,860
 You have to be looking for fires, don't you?

659
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,380
 You have to be scaring the horizon.

660
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,780
 You know, your binoculars, a little room.

661
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,140
 - I feel like you can look

662
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,500
 and play the bagpipes at the same time.

663
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,100
 - Yes, that is one of the things.

664
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,060
 - It's kind of sad that there are all these people

665
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,740
 by themselves at the top of trees.

666
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,940
 It's a 50/50 split.

667
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,780
 And yet they obviously can't date each other

668
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,180
 because they're all at the top of trees by themselves.

669
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,540
 - You know how trees have sex?

670
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,900
 They kind of fire.

671
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,780
 - They release their seed into the wind.

672
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,620
 - Into the wind.

673
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,260
 They should try that.

674
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,060
 - I'm sure it's been tried.

675
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,100
 I'm sure someone's done it.

676
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,780
 (laughing)

677
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,860
 - It gets pretty dull up there.

678
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,500
 - We've had some complaints from tourists

679
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,780
 at the bottom of the tree.

680
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,040
 (laughing)

681
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,780
 - Well, they could do,

682
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,180
 they did a sort of semaphore, not a semaphore.

683
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,980
 They did a way of communicating

684
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,100
 in the very early days before the phones.

685
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,220
 What? - It has nothing.

686
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,500
 - No, not semaphore, is that all?

687
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,100
 - There we go, thank you, yeah, yep.

688
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,060
 - Didn't need to happen, did it?

689
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,380
 They had these things called heliographs.

690
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,740
 So the ones that weren't high-tech enough

691
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,460
 to have the telephones in the early 1900s

692
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,740
 would just have two mirrors.

693
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,380
 And there would be someone,

694
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,980
 and they'd be called the flasher,

695
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,980
 who would use the mirrors to transmit messages

696
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,740
 by bouncing the sun off them.

697
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,300
 - Right, isn't that how you start fires?

698
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,560
 (laughing)

699
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,100
 That's a great point.

700
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,540
 - It's a major flaw in the plan.

701
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,080
 Yeah, I guess you have to be quite careful.

702
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,180
 I guess if you make sure it's a convex mirror, maybe.

703
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,380
 - Okay, yeah, interesting.

704
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,020
 - But yeah, it would reflect the sunlight

705
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,140
 and they could transmit Morse code up to 70 miles.

706
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,540
 - So we're saying that this is a technology basic,

707
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,380
 it's not a technology,

708
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,700
 it's a lack of technology that should be wiped out by now,

709
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,780
 but it's still going.

710
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,780
 And you would think with drones,

711
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,300
 with satellite imagery, with planes,

712
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,660
 we wouldn't need this anymore,

713
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,100
 but it survived because it's the one thing

714
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,420
 that we can still do when there is an electrical storm

715
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,620
 and we can't send up drones

716
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,180
 and we can't get satellite imaging

717
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,400
 through clouding and so on.

718
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,580
 So it's a job that hasn't died out

719
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,540
 through the modern technological world,

720
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,380
 which is pretty cool.

721
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,300
 - Yeah, they've done a few studies recently

722
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,100
 and found that the human observation is as efficient,

723
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,860
 if not more efficient overall than using drones

724
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,020
 and stuff like that.

725
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,100
 Exactly like Dan says,

726
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,260
 they can't be used in all conditions and stuff.

727
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,460
 - And also they know,

728
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,020
 'cause it's such a personal attachment they have

729
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,860
 to the land,

730
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,220
 so often they've been there 30 or 40 years,

731
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,340
 you'll get a look out. - What?

732
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,420
 - They've lived up there,

733
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,900
 so they know every centimeter of the land,

734
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,260
 so these people can instinctively spot

735
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,780
 the tiniest thing wrong.

736
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,820
 - But do you think they're like,

737
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,260
 there's a fire where,

738
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,200
 you know where the co-op used to be?

739
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,260
 (all laughing)

740
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,900
 Where old Vera used to live?

741
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,200
 - Yeah, just down there.

742
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,420
 - Yeah, it's that.

743
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,420
 A lot of co-ops in the chorus, actually.

744
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,020
 - They use something called an Osborne fire finder,

745
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,860
 don't they?

746
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,580
 An OFF, which is a topographic map.

747
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,400
 So you know like those maps when you go to a tourist place

748
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,300
 and it shows you where all the things are on the horizon,

749
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,420
 it's like this building is this tower of this building,

750
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,860
 it's like one of those.

751
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,020
 And then there's a few different things

752
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,500
 so you can tell exactly where the fire's happening.

753
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 And that was invented in 1840 by a guy

754
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 called Sir Francis Ronalds.

755
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,700
 And he also was one of the first people

756
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,100
 to do electrical signalling.

757
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,260
 So when he was 28, he put eight miles worth of iron wire

758
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,700
 on his mother's lawn in Hammersmith

759
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,660
 and managed to send a signal from one end of the eight miles

760
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,820
 to the other end of the eight miles.

761
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,060
 It was all kind of like folded up.

762
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,140
 So he didn't go very far in actual terms.

763
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,740
 But he said after that, he said,

764
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,300
 "Why add to the torments of pens, ink, paper and posts?

765
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,660
 "Let's us all have electrical conversazione offices

766
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,380
 "communicating with each other all over the kingdom.

767
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,380
 "Give me enough material and I will electrify the world."

768
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,660
 - Wow. - So he basically invented email.

769
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,580
 - Yeah. - Isn't that amazing?

770
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,780
 - I just sort of imagined him at the end of his garden

771
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,420
 going like, "Mom, talk into the wire."

772
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,780
 And his mom being like, "I can just say to you,

773
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,940
 "come in for dinner, talk into the wire, mom.

774
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,900
 "I can hear it."

775
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,300
 Yeah, you can't even 10 meters away from me.

776
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,140
 So funny.

777
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,860
 On the Watchman thing, but the non-fire-related Watchman.

778
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,700
 - Oh yeah.

779
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,860
 - So, Lausanne in Switzerland has its own Watchman

780
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,500
 who climbs the bell tower every night and shouts the time.

781
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,940
 And that's been going since 1405.

782
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,900
 - They can't have put a clock up there or anything.

783
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,740
 - Well, they've got, I think they've also--

784
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,580
 - In Switzerland.

785
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,100
 (laughing)

786
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,940
 - You're absolutely right.

787
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,340
 In fact, they've definitely got a clock

788
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,340
 'cause it's the bell goes and then the watchkeeper

789
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,540
 shouts the time and chouts that it's all fine.

790
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,620
 - Watch, watcher.

791
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,460
 - Yeah, but--

792
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,260
 - Shouts that it's all fine.

793
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,340
 - Yeah, there's a rubric that you say,

794
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,620
 which is, you know, it's 10 o'clock and all is well.

795
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,460
 Good night.

796
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,740
 - Oh, not like 10 bongs and--

797
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,900
 - Yep, it's right again.

798
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,060
 (laughing)

799
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,300
 - I do think they speak after the bell rings.

800
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,140
 In fact, they do.

801
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,380
 The bell rings and then they shout

802
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,420
 from the foresight of the tower what time it is.

803
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,260
 Anyway, for the first time--

804
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,820
 - It feels like a redundant job, literally.

805
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,100
 - Yeah, that's the son of the owner of the bell

806
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,780
 just trying to find a gig for his kid.

807
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,380
 - They've just appointed their first ever female watchkeeper

808
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,700
 in 2021.

809
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,860
 This is after 600 years.

810
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,700
 - Huge steps.

811
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,540
 - Yeah, it is.

812
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,340
 And there was a big protest a couple of years ago

813
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,500
 about the fact that no women had been invited

814
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,340
 to be watch keepers.

815
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,380
 - Not 'cause she got the job.

816
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,220
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, right.

817
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,340
 - No, a couple of years ago,

818
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,940
 a lot of women said, "Look, we want to enter this."

819
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,300
 A sweet gig, apparently.

820
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,540
 (laughing)

821
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,060
 Well, they had a vacancy last year to join the team

822
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,020
 and I think 80% of the applications were from women.

823
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,980
 - I think what you want is a dinner lady.

824
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,260
 They have the loudest voices in the world, don't they?

825
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,820
 - Yes, and there was a voice test.

826
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,660
 That was part of it.

827
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,540
 It was sort of they need to test

828
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,740
 that you've got a good pair of lungs to shout the time.

829
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,460
 And the job comes with a little lodge

830
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,220
 that you can keep warm in, in between bongs, I guess.

831
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,020
 And it comes with a felt hat, a lantern,

832
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,700
 and a cheese fondue set.

833
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,660
 (laughing)

834
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,260
 - It's in the lodge, right?

835
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,100
 - Pretty Swiss.

836
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,900
 - With those perks, I can really understand

837
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,620
 why they went for it.

838
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,460
 A felt hat.

839
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,700
 Just one more thing, actually, on fire towers

840
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,660
 that I found so interesting is that this was,

841
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,180
 I was reading a piece with a lookout called Levi Brinniger.

842
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,220
 And I do want to say they all have really cool names

843
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,380
 like that or like Leaf Hogan.

844
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,660
 All names that sound like they're a forest lookout.

845
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,100
 But Levi Brinniger pointed out

846
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,340
 that if there's a lightning storm,

847
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,580
 you are in the tallest place up the tallest tree

848
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,460
 with an electric phone line that you're supposed to use.

849
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,740
 So first of all, they do have a kill switch.

850
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,420
 They just have a kill switch to kill the phone lines

851
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,740
 if the lightning came too close.

852
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,340
 And then if it's really close, they have a stool,

853
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,780
 and there are a couple of others who all had this,

854
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,060
 a stool where they've just put sort of glasses

855
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,100
 on each leg, under the leg, to insulate it from lightning.

856
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,700
 So you just go and sit on this one stool

857
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,060
 in the middle of the room and wait for the lightning

858
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,900
 to pass through.

859
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,700
 - I would have thought the power of a lightning bolt

860
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
 on a tree if it hits it.

861
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,940
 - It explodes it.

862
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,780
 - It explodes it.

863
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,140
 And it doesn't matter if you've got four tightly glasses

864
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,460
 on the bottom of your chair.

865
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,140
 - I think, friend of the podcast, Roy Sullivan,

866
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,980
 was that his name?

867
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,900
 The guy who was struck by lightning seven times.

868
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,620
 I think one of the times he was hit by lightning

869
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,260
 was when he was up a fire lookout thing.

870
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,100
 - Was it?

871
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,740
 - Yeah, yeah, wow.

872
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,460
 - Didn't put his glasses under the stool.

873
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,020
 - No, clearly, yeah.

874
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,140
 - And in fact, it wasn't one of the other times

875
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,540
 when he was being chased by a bear.

876
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,380
 Do you remember?

877
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,220
 - Yes, yes, yes.

878
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,540
 - He was being chased by a bear then struck by lightning.

879
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,940
 He was beating it off with a stick.

880
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,820
 - Sorry, he wasn't, let me rephrase that.

881
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,540
 He was beating the bear with a stick at the time.

882
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,380
 - Well then, I don't blame the bear for chasing him.

883
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,540
 - Yeah, yeah.

884
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,660
 - He just wanted to do an ice dance with it.

885
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,240
 (upbeat music)

886
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,140
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

887
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,940
 That is Andy.

888
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,540
 - My fact is there is a worm,

889
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,180
 which can grow multiple bottoms,

890
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,680
 which then fires off to have sex without it.

891
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,020
 - Okay.

892
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,860
 - Yeah.

893
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,260
 - So this is a newly named worm, very exciting.

894
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,940
 There were a couple in the same kind of family

895
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,500
 with the same kind of body shape

896
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,900
 that were known about already, but this is a new one.

897
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,180
 It's called Ramisela's King Ghidorahi,

898
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,300
 which is after a thing from Godzilla.

899
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,020
 It's one of the other things that is a villain.

900
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,860
 I mean, yeah.

901
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,420
 - I always thought Godzilla was the villain,

902
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,260
 but anyway, we'll come back to that.

903
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,620
 - Well, I'm sure we'll come to that.

904
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,740
 Basically, this worm is an amazing branching creature.

905
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,180
 It lives in sea sponges.

906
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,260
 It has one head, and then the back end of it branches,

907
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,180
 'cause it lives in a sea sponge.

908
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,820
 It branches through all the different tunnels

909
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,380
 and crevices and paths of the sponge, right?

910
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,420
 And then when it wants to reproduce,

911
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,220
 basically the end of each branch of its body,

912
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,340
 and there can be dozens or even hundreds of these branches,

913
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,860
 the end of each one breaks off, swims up to the surface,

914
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,060
 independently releases its eggs or sperm

915
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,140
 into the water column where they'll all find each other.

916
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,860
 So they fertilize each other and then the bums die,

917
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,900
 but the head of the worm living in the sea sponge lives,

918
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,580
 lives to breed another day,

919
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,420
 and it starts regenerating all of its--

920
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,380
 - It's so amazing. - It's a bums.

921
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,580
 - It's incredible. - It really is.

922
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,180
 - It's just such a weird, weird thing.

923
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,820
 - I just feel so sorry for the head.

924
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,100
 Don't you think that is the worst?

925
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,660
 Because you're spending your whole life as a face

926
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,340
 buried in the pitch-black belly of a sponge,

927
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,500
 and you're sending off your arses to have sex,

928
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 and you never, ever get to do that yourself.

929
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,580
 - Mm. - Isn't that so weird?

930
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,420
 - Yes.

931
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,820
 - You do have a nice sponge to live in.

932
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,140
 - Yeah, I guess that's why it comes true.

933
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,420
 - That's a sponge bath every day.

934
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,620
 (all laughing)

935
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,500
 - They can't survive the head part,

936
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,860
 can't survive outside the sponge.

937
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,820
 As soon as they go outside the sponge, they die.

938
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,860
 - Oh, that's a lady of shallot there.

939
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,940
 I bet they sometimes want to.

940
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,820
 I bet there are a few heads who have gone sod it.

941
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,700
 I'm gonna give it a go.

942
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,260
 - Yeah. - Let it pop out.

943
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,540
 - That's it. - It's so crazy, isn't it,

944
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,300
 when you think of evolution, right?

945
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,980
 Like, just the fact that this thing had to evolve

946
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,460
 to send its anus off to go and have the babies, you know,

947
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,820
 while, like, it was like, what do we do?

948
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,740
 We can't, my head can't leave this sponge.

949
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,580
 (all laughing)

950
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,920
 What do I do?

951
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,700
 - These things that you call bums as well,

952
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,500
 they are kind of, they can be more than bums.

953
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,460
 They can have, like, they have very rudimentary brains.

954
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,380
 They have very rudimentary eyes.

955
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,220
 - Yeah.

956
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,900
 - So they're like, not just a bum.

957
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,260
 - No, you're absolutely right.

958
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,060
 - So they're their own kind of, as it were, consciousness,

959
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,260
 even though I know they're not thinking,

960
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,300
 but they've got their own--

961
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,220
 - Yeah, they have nerves. - Yeah, this is the most

962
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,060
 amazing thing.

963
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,500
 - And they're called stolons, technically.

964
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,980
 So they're reproductive units.

965
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,820
 But as James says, they've got eyes,

966
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,220
 they've got very primitive brains,

967
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,100
 and that helps them to steer and to mate.

968
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,260
 - I find this the most extraordinary thing about this,

969
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,900
 and almost anything I've ever read in nature,

970
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,180
 that these are basically living creatures

971
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,020
 that they turn into.

972
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,820
 So every single time they let go of a branch,

973
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,740
 that they split their organs in half somehow.

974
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
 So every organ duplicates,

975
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,420
 so that branch has its own set of organs

976
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,820
 that it then goes off with.

977
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,660
 - Extraordinary.

978
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,500
 - It's so weird.

979
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,620
 - So all of them have guts and nerves,

980
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,300
 and every single branch does.

981
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,860
 And so when that forks, the organs fork as well.

982
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,340
 And some of them have been measured.

983
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,580
 So this is the other species,

984
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,980
 Ramicillus multicordata,

985
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,260
 which is just a very similar creature.

986
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,820
 They've been measured with 500 different branches.

987
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,620
 - The reason you kind of call them bums

988
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,460
 is because when they're sticking out of the sponge,

989
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,860
 it's the bum bitch which's sticking out, right?

990
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,100
 And the way that they eat is they can't,

991
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,020
 well, we're not quite sure,

992
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,940
 because no one's ever found any food inside any of them.

993
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,980
 - It's insane.

994
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,820
 - It's insane.

995
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,540
 But what we think is that they dissolve,

996
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,540
 they kind of soak in the food into their body,

997
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,860
 and then there's no stomach or anything like that,

998
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,740
 and then they send out the waste through the bums.

999
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,700
 And then when they become like the thing that reproduces

1000
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,980
 and decides to swim off,

1001
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,620
 then a new little anal opening comes

1002
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,100
 where they used to live,

1003
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,460
 and then they grow out again.

1004
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,260
 - Constantly mooning the world.

1005
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,340
 - They were found, the first one was found in the 1870s,

1006
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,340
 and then they didn't find the other two species,

1007
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,860
 'cause they're three species altogether, this thing,

1008
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,820
 until about 20 years ago.

1009
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,100
 And the first one was found on the Challenger Expedition,

1010
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,220
 which I had never read about,

1011
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,900
 but is this extraordinary expedition from 18,

1012
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,300
 maybe we've discussed it before,

1013
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,940
 but 1872 to 1876, this three and a half year voyage,

1014
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,260
 which basically started oceanography.

1015
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,500
 And I didn't realize that before that,

1016
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,620
 people didn't care about the oceans at all.

1017
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,340
 It was a big team of people,

1018
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,940
 and it sounds really dull.

1019
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,780
 So Darwin had called the oceans

1020
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,980
 "a tedious waste, a desert of water."

1021
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,500
 He was like, "There's nothing in here, don't bother with it."

1022
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,820
 So everyone thought that,

1023
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,660
 and then they set off on this expedition.

1024
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,940
 - You think that's because you know how Darwin basically

1025
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
 lived in England, right?

1026
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,180
 And then he went all the way over to the Galapagos,

1027
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,500
 all the way over the sea.

1028
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,660
 Do you reckon people said, "What were you doing on the way,

1029
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,820
 all were you doing, fuck all?"

1030
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,660
 He was like, "Oh, it's pointless, I wouldn't do anything."

1031
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,780
 Anyway, just see, there's nothing in there.

1032
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,340
 - He forgot to look in it.

1033
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,820
 - Is it the opposite where he found,

1034
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,100
 he obviously knew how much was in there,

1035
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,780
 but he was just trying to put off other scientists.

1036
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,260
 "No, don't bother looking there, it's just water, mate."

1037
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,380
 - Yeah, he always went to get to it.

1038
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,220
 Well, they did look there

1039
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,900
 and they collected 4,800 new species,

1040
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,660
 and they found the Marianas Trench on the expedition,

1041
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,620
 and they started the whole field.

1042
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,100
 - This guy who we're talking about with all the bums,

1043
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,580
 the way that he eats by dissolving stuff

1044
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,180
 that is around him basically is how mushrooms live.

1045
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,740
 And so I read one place that they said

1046
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,460
 that it's basically an animal

1047
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,660
 that has adopted a fungal lifestyle.

1048
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,220
 So it's living like a fungus lives, but it's an animal.

1049
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,660
 - Yeah, it does seem like that.

1050
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,220
 And actually other marine worms

1051
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,180
 do that kind of dissolving thing, don't they?

1052
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,860
 There's a worm called the zombie worm,

1053
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,220
 which feeds off skeletons of mostly whales

1054
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,700
 by other dead ocean animals at the bottom of the sea.

1055
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,620
 And that sends acid out onto the bone,

1056
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,300
 which kind of melts it, well, dissolves it.

1057
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,340
 And then they just live inside whale bones

1058
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,100
 for ever and ever.

1059
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,940
 - It's incredible.

1060
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,780
 - That is really amazing.

1061
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,580
 I think I've read that there are some sponges

1062
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,860
 which have been observed feeding on fossils,

1063
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,860
 as in fossilized bones of ancient whales.

1064
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,980
 And it's why the fossil record

1065
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,300
 is really patchy in some places.

1066
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,900
 It's just 'cause down there, they've been eaten, yeah.

1067
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,740
 - I guess, yeah.

1068
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,700
 I suppose if bones didn't disintegrate,

1069
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,100
 we would just have-

1070
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,940
 - Just be needy.

1071
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,420
 - Well, yeah, if you actually like,

1072
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,540
 if you looked at the bottom of the ocean,

1073
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,580
 it should just be bones, right?

1074
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,100
 At least one layer.

1075
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,940
 - Is it really?

1076
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,260
 - Well, they get compressed and compressed over time,

1077
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,140
 and they form rock layers, basically.

1078
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,740
 I mean, so if you look at short cliffs,

1079
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,020
 that's all the skeletons of the plankton stuff.

1080
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,860
 - That's right.

1081
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,940
 - So those bones just turn into

1082
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,700
 what everything else turns into, which is mulch.

1083
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,860
 - That's true, but I'm talking,

1084
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,100
 I think I'm just talking short term.

1085
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,060
 Let's say in like a 50 year period,

1086
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,420
 there must be a lot of sea creatures that die

1087
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,340
 that just do a collection of bones,

1088
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,780
 but they're being eaten by-

1089
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,900
 - 'Cause these zombie worms,

1090
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,500
 something like that. - Yeah, exactly.

1091
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,660
 - Scale worms are another water worm.

1092
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,500
 - Oh, yeah.

1093
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,220
 - And some of them have this really cool trick.

1094
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,780
 So they're a bit like wood lice,

1095
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,940
 with the wood lice of the sea.

1096
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,740
 So they have these like hard scales around them,

1097
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,340
 and that's so if something tries to eat them,

1098
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,620
 they slough off these scales,

1099
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,140
 and the scales end up in the thing's mouth,

1100
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,460
 and they wriggle off.

1101
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,300
 - Brilliant.

1102
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,540
 - But then sometimes they have scales

1103
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,220
 that produce like bioluminescent light,

1104
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,180
 and so something will try to eat it.

1105
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,180
 They slough off the scales in the thing's mouth,

1106
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,660
 and then the thing's mouth is glowing in the dark,

1107
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,420
 and then that thing gets hunted by its predator.

1108
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,260
 - So cool.

1109
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,020
 - And you're off literally in its face.

1110
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,580
 (laughing)

1111
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,420
 - That's clever.

1112
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,340
 - Have you heard of the bobbit worm?

1113
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,180
 - Oh, yeah.

1114
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,020
 Is that the massive one?

1115
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,180
 - It's huge, yeah.

1116
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,500
 It's like 10 feet long.

1117
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,860
 It's a iridescent worm.

1118
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,900
 It buries its body into the ocean,

1119
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,020
 and it sort of just sits there,

1120
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,220
 and it sends out these kind of traps,

1121
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,500
 like five little antennae that just sit there.

1122
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,580
 And if a fish comes along,

1123
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,100
 it leaps out, just sort of slithers very quickly,

1124
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,780
 and with its jaws,

1125
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,580
 it can snap, because the force is so great,

1126
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,180
 it can slice a fish in half.

1127
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,620
 Like it's just like insanely horrible.

1128
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,860
 But it then brings it back down into a hole,

1129
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,020
 and they don't fully know what happens next.

1130
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,580
 Scientists have not any idea really of what happens next,

1131
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,700
 'cause we haven't been able to study it.

1132
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,620
 So they don't know if there's a toxin

1133
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
 that goes into the animal,

1134
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,500
 that if they haven't split into two,

1135
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,460
 that is still alive,

1136
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,660
 that just then kills it,

1137
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,060
 and then they can, you know, ingest it, and so on.

1138
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,400
 - Well, so sometimes it's still alive,

1139
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,780
 kind of thing, I don't know how they kill it.

1140
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,620
 - Yeah, exactly.

1141
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,300
 Like, sometimes they'll bring something back in

1142
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,620
 that they've just got a good grip on,

1143
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,900
 as opposed to having it sliced.

1144
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,660
 And the thought is, is that the name,

1145
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,140
 although no one's fully sure,

1146
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,820
 they think John Wayne Bobbet's wife is the inspiration for.

1147
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,660
 - I think so.

1148
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,620
 - Yeah, I think that is known, isn't it?

1149
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,180
 - I think that wasn't conclusive.

1150
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,740
 I think it was a sort of nickname given to it,

1151
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,820
 and they sort of,

1152
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,700
 well, at least the places I was reading,

1153
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,940
 saying we're not fully sure,

1154
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,780
 because it doesn't do anything to your genitals.

1155
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,660
 It's not like it bites your balls off,

1156
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,740
 or it's like, no, it doesn't slice it.

1157
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,700
 - So we should say this is a famous case

1158
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,260
 of a couple called John Wayne Bobbet,

1159
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,140
 and his wife, Lorena Bobbet,

1160
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,780
 and she cut off his--

1161
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,220
 - Penis. - Yes.

1162
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,740
 - And threw it out of a car.

1163
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,820
 - Yeah. - Yes.

1164
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,420
 - And this isn't what the worm does,

1165
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,860
 but it does seem like too much.

1166
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
 - There's something a bit,

1167
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,100
 there's something a bit slicey,

1168
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,540
 and a bit penise-y involved here,

1169
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,980
 'cause it's this worm.

1170
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,820
 - Yes.

1171
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,300
 - It kind of lives under the sand,

1172
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,740
 and then jumps out and grabs you,

1173
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,780
 a bit like the worms in Dune, really, I think.

1174
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,820
 Or, what's that other one, Tremors,

1175
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,300
 a bit like Tremors? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

1176
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,380
 - It has been compared to the Mongolian Death Worm.

1177
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,220
 - Yes, yeah.

1178
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,660
 - And here we are, back on stage territory.

1179
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,980
 - Doesn't, Dan.

1180
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,020
 - It hasn't featured in SpongeBob SquarePants yet,

1181
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,380
 has it, this creature?

1182
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,220
 No.

1183
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,140
 - Imagine if, is there an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants

1184
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,380
 where it has one of these bond-dividing worms in it?

1185
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,420
 - SpongeBob Gets Worms, yeah.

1186
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,700
 (all laughing)

1187
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,660
 - So a little bit on Godzilla, maybe?

1188
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,740
 - Yes. - Yes.

1189
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,220
 - He is a Japanese citizen.

1190
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,060
 (all laughing)

1191
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,420
 - Date of birth, April of 1954.

1192
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,980
 Reason for special, he's got special residency.

1193
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,820
 - You'd have to.

1194
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,740
 - Yeah, yeah.

1195
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,340
 For promoting the entertainment of,

1196
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,900
 and watching over the Kabukicho neighborhood,

1197
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,420
 and drawing visitors from around the world.

1198
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,020
 Because I know you've been to Japan, Andy.

1199
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,740
 Have you seen the giant Godzilla

1200
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,180
 that's sticking out of one of the buildings?

1201
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,020
 - I have not, is it Tokyo? - It's really called

1202
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,740
 next to Shinjuku Station, yeah.

1203
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,900
 You're just walking down the street,

1204
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,740
 and you turn around,

1205
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,380
 and suddenly there's a massive Godzilla

1206
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,660
 sort of looking over you.

1207
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,980
 - That's so cool. - Is he watching over?

1208
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,540
 'Cause I thought that he destroyed buildings.

1209
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,260
 - Well, he got-- - I mean, yes.

1210
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,340
 - He doesn't move because he's just a statue.

1211
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
 - No, but the idea of Godzilla,

1212
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,100
 the idea of a very destructive creature, right?

1213
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,860
 - I see what you mean, actually.

1214
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,740
 - I mean, it's complicated. - He could save you

1215
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,780
 from Mothra, or from whoever this other guy was,

1216
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,820
 King Ghidorah. - Ghidorah, yeah, yeah.

1217
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,300
 - It's a complicated relationship,

1218
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,260
 because basically, at various points,

1219
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,420
 he's been the goodie and the heel.

1220
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,460
 And, you know, if he's fighting King Kong, for example,

1221
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,940
 - What? - He, as he did

1222
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,340
 in the latest, very bad movie.

1223
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,300
 - Oh, they're two completely different creatures.

1224
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,180
 - Well, you haven't seen King Kong

1225
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,340
 versus Godzilla, have you?

1226
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,300
 And I gotta say, that's two hours.

1227
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,580
 I'm never getting back, because it's--

1228
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,540
 - What's it about? - It's a bad, really.

1229
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,380
 - It wasn't bad.

1230
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,340
 I mean, Kong's skull island is magnificent.

1231
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,180
 - Is it? - Yeah.

1232
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,140
 - Yeah, you keep telling me that.

1233
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,700
 - But basically, Godzilla can be a goodie and baddie.

1234
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,780
 I mean, very, very destructive of property.

1235
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
 - Thank you. - Yes.

1236
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,460
 - Thank you, back to that.

1237
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,860
 Okay. - Yeah.

1238
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,700
 - He can be angered,

1239
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,420
 but he's never on the side of the humans, right?

1240
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,260
 Or is he?

1241
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,820
 - He's not really on any side.

1242
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,500
 - He's on Godzilla side. - He's on Godzilla side, yeah.

1243
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,140
 - Does it look like to him?

1244
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,020
 So, does it love story with him?

1245
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,260
 No, that's Kong, isn't it?

1246
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,500
 - "Fade Down Away" in the '33 movie, yeah.

1247
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,620
 There's always, yeah, that's the--

1248
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,700
 - Yeah. - That's Kong.

1249
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,900
 - That's Kong. - That's Kong, yeah.

1250
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,340
 - Or Brie Larson in Kong's skull island, yeah.

1251
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,180
 - Sure, okay.

1252
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,820
 - And actually, they don't really have a relationship

1253
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,500
 in the same way that Kong and "Fade Down Away" did.

1254
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,900
 - I would say, when you're on "Mastermind"

1255
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,340
 and they say, "What's your specialist subject?"

1256
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,820
 If you do choose Kong and Godzilla,

1257
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,180
 don't just give a fucking monologue

1258
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,220
 as soon as he asks his first question,

1259
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,860
 'cause you're gonna run out of time.

1260
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,180
 - The thing about Skull Island is, though,

1261
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,620
 it's a brilliant Vietnam War metaphor,

1262
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,180
 and the whole mood, it's incredible.

1263
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,300
 - I started and finished a long time ago, Andrew.

1264
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,880
 (upbeat music)

1265
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
 (upbeat music)

1266
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,560
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1267
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,160
 and that is my fact.

1268
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,760
 My fact this week is that comedian Lenny Bruce

1269
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,300
 was arrested so often during his sets

1270
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,680
 that he would go on stage wearing his coat

1271
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,360
 just so he was ready to leave with the police immediately.

1272
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,480
 - Brilliant. - Go on.

1273
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,800
 - Yeah, so this is a fact that I learned

1274
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,360
 in a brilliant autobiography

1275
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,760
 that was written by George Carlin,

1276
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,920
 who is also one of the greatest stand-ups

1277
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,760
 that we've ever had.

1278
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
 It's called "Last Words," highly recommend

1279
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
 anyone who's interested in the world of comedy

1280
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,280
 reading it, and this was on a night in 1962

1281
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,000
 when Lenny Bruce was playing at a club

1282
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,560
 called the Gate of Horn, and during the performance,

1283
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,280
 a police officer stood up in the middle of the crowd

1284
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,780
 and he basically shut down the show,

1285
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,960
 and he immediately arrested Bruce,

1286
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,840
 and he tried to take him to jail.

1287
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,980
 So, Carlin's bit of this story is that he was upstairs

1288
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,880
 having a drink with another comic,

1289
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,920
 and they weren't only just arresting Lenny Bruce,

1290
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,040
 they were also arresting anyone else that they could

1291
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,680
 because they wanted to make a real point

1292
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,920
 about this happening, this gig.

1293
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,480
 So they IDed everyone who was at the show

1294
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,880
 to see if there were any minors there

1295
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,980
 to see if they could arrest them,

1296
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,660
 if anyone was too young to be there.

1297
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,520
 They arrested the owner and the bartender

1298
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,920
 because drinks were being served during the set,

1299
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,080
 which was not allowed,

1300
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,520
 and they ended up arresting as well George Carlin,

1301
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,760
 who was upstairs and refused to give his ID

1302
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
 and started making a joke out of it

1303
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,520
 because he was quite drunk.

1304
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,200
 So George Carlin ended up in the van,

1305
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,020
 the police van, with Lenny Bruce,

1306
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,600
 and so he was there specifically for this moment.

1307
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,880
 Lenny told him he would wear his coat while he was on stage

1308
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,480
 because sometimes the police would just take him out

1309
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,840
 immediately and he wouldn't be able to get his coat,

1310
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,400
 and he loved his coat because it was made

1311
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,000
 from a really nice cashier

1312
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,600
 and he didn't want to be parted with it.

1313
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,440
 So that's why he wore it on stage all the time.

1314
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,360
 - I saw that he went to prison.

1315
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,920
 They bailed him out, right?

1316
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,680
 And he was back on stage by something like 1 a.m.

1317
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,960
 for the second show of the night.

1318
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,200
 When he was on stage, he did a joke by saying,

1319
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,620
 "I better keep my coat on 'cause I may have to go out again."

1320
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,020
 So he kind of made a point of the arrest as well.

1321
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,860
 - Yeah.

1322
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,540
 - Do we know how long into the set the policeman waited?

1323
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
 Did he wait for him to do all his favorite jokes

1324
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,700
 and then stand up or did he just give him 10 seconds?

1325
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,580
 - You wait until he said something really rude.

1326
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,620
 - It was, yeah, it was the moment he said something rude.

1327
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,900
 So Lenny Bruce is, if you haven't heard of him

1328
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,660
 as the listener of the show, he was a 1960s comedian.

1329
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,660
 - The listener, we have more than one listener.

1330
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,500
 (laughing)

1331
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,340
 - Sorry, I have one listener.

1332
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,460
 The rest of you have millions.

1333
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,620
 I've got one dedicated listener.

1334
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,360
 He was basically, in a way, the first modern

1335
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,640
 stand-up comedian, and there were a lot of comedians

1336
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,760
 before him, obviously, and you can say people like

1337
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,800
 Bob Hope and so on who would go around on stage

1338
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,840
 telling jokes, but they were very much joke merchants.

1339
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,280
 They had a team of writers who were writing for them.

1340
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,720
 Lenny Bruce was the first person to really talk

1341
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,080
 about his personal life.

1342
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,440
 He used swear words.

1343
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,080
 He talked like a real person, basically.

1344
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,920
 And that's--

1345
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,120
 - It was like stream of consciousness-y type stuff

1346
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,120
 rather than just gag, gag, gag, right?

1347
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,240
 - Yeah, but they were written, it was written material

1348
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,540
 as well, but he was basically counter-culture America.

1349
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,140
 He was part of the beat people.

1350
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,160
 So Jack Kerouac, who was mentioned before,

1351
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,240
 very much part of that scene, and he opened up

1352
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,360
 the whole industry of stand-up to this new way of doing it.

1353
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,920
 What came with that is he spoke about

1354
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,160
 very controversial topics.

1355
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,120
 He spoke about religion, which he really didn't like.

1356
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,820
 He used swear words on stage, which no one was doing

1357
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,800
 at this time, and so he was constantly being arrested

1358
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,380
 for these reasons, and he became a sort of martyr

1359
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,720
 to the whole of the comedy industry, because he--

1360
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,560
 - Yeah.

1361
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,380
 - Sorry.

1362
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,400
 - Well, no, we should say that he was pardoned as well,

1363
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,240
 which is great news.

1364
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,880
 So he was convicted of obscenity, but then he was pardoned.

1365
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,480
 - In this one, right?

1366
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,440
 - Well, so this is when he was tried in 1964

1367
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,720
 for obscenity and prosecuted, but the good news is

1368
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,200
 that he was pardoned, and it was in 2003

1369
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,040
 that he was pardoned.

1370
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,880
 - That's right.

1371
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,720
 - He had been dead for nearly 40 years, but.

1372
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,680
 There was a petition to cancel it.

1373
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,880
 So the governor of New York was George Pataki,

1374
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,340
 who in 2003 granted this posthumous pardon.

1375
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
 The petition was brought by a couple of comedians

1376
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,180
 I'd never heard of, called Tom Smothers and Dick Smothers,

1377
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,140
 known as the Smothers Brothers, who themselves were canceled

1378
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,100
 and properly canceled, 'cause they were very lefty,

1379
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,340
 and that was obviously also pretty controversial.

1380
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,180
 - Yeah, so he wasn't found guilty in the event

1381
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,620
 that Dan was describing.

1382
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,580
 He was got off there.

1383
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,260
 His defense compared him to Aristophanes Rabele

1384
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,580
 and Jonathan Swift in the court case,

1385
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,400
 and the jury agreed, and they let him off,

1386
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,160
 and then he was later arrested quite a lot of times

1387
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,360
 in lots of different places,

1388
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,280
 but in New York was the big famous one,

1389
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,560
 which is what you're talking about, he got.

1390
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,120
 - I think I agree with the judge, right?

1391
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,720
 I don't know Rabele, come on, you're not that pretentious,

1392
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,480
 but Aristophanes and Swift, kind of impenetrable,

1393
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,180
 desperate wannabe satirists, apparently genius,

1394
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,120
 but actually not that fun to experience.

1395
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,360
 I would say it's quite a good description of Lenny Bruce.

1396
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,520
 - Wow. - For me.

1397
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,360
 - Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1398
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,200
 - For me.

1399
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
 - Jonathan Swift is very funny,

1400
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,060
 and some of the Aristophanes stuff is pretty funny.

1401
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,060
 - I love the level, Anna, how can you be at a level

1402
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,020
 where you're pretentious enough to know Aristophanes

1403
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,700
 and Jonathan Swift, but no,

1404
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,940
 I'm not pretentious enough to know Rabele, come on.

1405
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,820
 - Well, you all know that's the line, okay?

1406
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,660
 You've crossed the line when you know Rabele.

1407
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,100
 - I mean, he represented himself in court at various points,

1408
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,940
 so that might've been the point

1409
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,780
 where he was being compared to Jonathan Swift

1410
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,140
 and Aristophanes, so he fired his lawyer

1411
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,820
 halfway through this trial, the 1964 one.

1412
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,040
 And then the New York law journal

1413
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,280
 refused to publish the judgment

1414
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,160
 because it contained offensive words, so.

1415
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,000
 - Right.

1416
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,280
 - And then just going back to the original one

1417
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,480
 that you were talking about, Dan,

1418
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,240
 I was reading the newspaper articles

1419
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,880
 from the day and from the day after and stuff,

1420
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,800
 and he did his second show,

1421
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
 and then he went back to his hotel, the Clifft Hotel,

1422
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,720
 and then he got kicked out of his hotel

1423
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,440
 because the hotel owner had heard about him being arrested

1424
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,400
 and didn't want his like in his hotel,

1425
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,200
 and so he just got kicked out into the street.

1426
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,160
 And as a result from then on,

1427
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,140
 he performed always with a small suitcase on stage.

1428
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,380
 (laughing)

1429
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,380
 - He did like a spot of morphine, heroin, yes,

1430
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,860
 and actually he was ejected from another hotel once

1431
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,420
 for blocking its toilet with heroin needles.

1432
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,260
 - Oh.

1433
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,100
 - Or for blocking its toilet with needles.

1434
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,100
 - That's one of needles, isn't it?

1435
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,260
 (laughing)

1436
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,540
 It's not like toilet roll, it's like.

1437
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,100
 - I think maybe it only takes a couple of needles

1438
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,460
 to block a loo, I've never, never tried it,

1439
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,540
 but there was another time he was, I promise.

1440
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,260
 (laughing)

1441
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,380
 - We've been on tour with you,

1442
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,000
 we know you are a needle toilet blocker.

1443
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,840
 The number of Premier Inns we've been unceremoniously kicked

1444
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,680
 out of.

1445
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,920
 - I'm sorry about that, but I have changed.

1446
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,040
 He was another thing I do on tour, actually.

1447
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,760
 He was kicked out of another hotel

1448
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,720
 for apparently conducting a nocturnal trio of blondes

1449
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,040
 in an original composition, the chorus of which ran,

1450
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,640
 please fuck me, Lenny, in three-part harmony.

1451
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,300
 - Oh, wow, in harmony.

1452
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,140
 - In harmony.

1453
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,540
 - Actually, at a Premier In, you wouldn't be allowed

1454
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,540
 to do that, 'cause they have the good night's sleep policy.

1455
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,880
 (laughing)

1456
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,100
 - Or the sign saying, shh, our corridors.

1457
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,140
 - That's why it's Lenny Henry who's the mascot

1458
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,220
 and not Lenny Bruce.

1459
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,560
 - It was a top-up, wasn't it?

1460
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,300
 (laughing)

1461
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,060
 - But yeah, he had a big old sexual appetite

1462
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,500
 and he married a stripper called Honey Harlow.

1463
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,340
 - Yes.

1464
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
 - But as you say, Anna, like you don't think he's funny

1465
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,500
 and a lot of people absolutely agree with you.

1466
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,920
 He has to be looked at as someone who is just the person

1467
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,680
 who paved the way and who, you know, Richard Pryor,

1468
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,920
 who is seen by many as the funniest person ever,

1469
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,040
 says that Lenny Bruce was the funniest person ever.

1470
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,360
 George Carlin as well, Lenny Bruce was the funniest person

1471
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,200
 ever.

1472
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,680
 Modern day comedians like Mark Marron, Lenny Bruce,

1473
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,520
 funniest person ever.

1474
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,360
 - Yeah, I respect him a lot.

1475
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,000
 - Michael McIntyre, you can see the influence so much

1476
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,420
 in McIntyre's material.

1477
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,480
 But they did, they did a, on the 50th.

1478
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,240
 - I like to just say I like Michael McIntyre.

1479
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,720
 I don't even know why I said that.

1480
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,200
 It's just the first day that came into my head.

1481
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,080
 - They're just not similar.

1482
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,420
 - However much you like either of them,

1483
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,220
 I don't think Michael McIntyre would claim

1484
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,560
 that he's taking after Lenny Bruce.

1485
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,260
 - I'm just saying if Michael McIntyre was beyond

1486
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,620
 his BBC primetime show, I'm sorry.

1487
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,700
 (all laughing)

1488
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,900
 - But he does block a lot of hotel toilets

1489
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,420
 with heroin needles, that's the McIntyre thing, isn't it?

1490
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,940
 It's kind of his trademark, yeah.

1491
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,860
 - But on the 50th anniversary of his death,

1492
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,860
 they did a screening of one of his recorded stand-up shows

1493
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,980
 to an audience of fans and just to, you know,

1494
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,920
 commemorate him, it was 40 minutes of jokes

1495
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,880
 and hardly anyone laughed according to the article.

1496
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,380
 And that makes sense, he was a, he was a conscience.

1497
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,400
 - He's the one that you go, when you're watching him,

1498
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,160
 you go, ah, you sort of smile and you're like, oh.

1499
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,800
 - I like Stuart Lee.

1500
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,840
 - That's certainly a bit of Stuart Lee to him.

1501
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,680
 (all laughing)

1502
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,520
 - Is there anyone left?

1503
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,400
 - Let's just destroy anyone we might work with in the future.

1504
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,160
 - There was a brilliant article in Playboy

1505
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,800
 that he, that was quoting him in 1963

1506
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,760
 and he was talking about when he was going on stage

1507
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,900
 and the owner decided to introduce him

1508
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,100
 but was really worried that he was gonna get a bad reaction.

1509
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,780
 And so the owner said, "Ladies and gentlemen,

1510
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,300
 the star of our show, Lenny Bruce,

1511
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,980
 who incidentally is the next GI

1512
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,860
 and a hell of a good performer, folks.

1513
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,560
 And he's a great kidder, you know what I mean?

1514
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,980
 It's just a bunch of silliness.

1515
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,980
 He doesn't mean what he says.

1516
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,940
 The kids and the Pope and the Jewish religion, honestly.

1517
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,740
 It's just a make-believe world, it's fine.

1518
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,340
 He's a hell of a nice guy, folks.

1519
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,140
 And he was at a veterans' hospital today

1520
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,620
 doing a show for the boys.

1521
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,120
 And here he is, by the way, his mom's out there tonight too.

1522
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,760
 She hasn't seen him in a couple of years

1523
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,560
 and she lives here in the town.

1524
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,200
 Now, it jokes a joke, right, folks?

1525
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,240
 What the hell?

1526
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,200
 I wish she'd try and cooperate.

1527
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,040
 And whoever has been sticking ice picks

1528
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,480
 in the tires outside, that's not funny.

1529
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,320
 - Is this real?

1530
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,160
 That's real?

1531
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,480
 That's the best intro ever.

1532
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,320
 - That's really good.

1533
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,080
 - I feel like he must have written it for the video.

1534
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,200
 - That's so good.

1535
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,920
 - His mom, interestingly, was his main inspiration.

1536
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,560
 And she was really awesome.

1537
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,940
 And she was this woman called Sally Ma.

1538
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,820
 And she was a stand-up comedian,

1539
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,220
 well, before stand-up was a thing, really,

1540
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,820
 in the '30s and '40s.

1541
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,420
 And she did impersonations, I think,

1542
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,260
 was part of her comedy.

1543
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,780
 Like, she impersonated Humphrey Bogart

1544
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,940
 and James Cagney and people like that.

1545
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,100
 And she--

1546
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,300
 - She introduced him on stage for his first ever show.

1547
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,140
 - Oh, did she?

1548
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,180
 - Well, his first big break, he was in a radio show

1549
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,900
 called Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts.

1550
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,500
 And she was the hype woman for him.

1551
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,580
 - She was a manager, also, later in her career.

1552
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,420
 - Yes.

1553
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,280
 - So she managed, who I did not know

1554
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,440
 was a stand-up comedian.

1555
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,320
 But the man who played Mr. Miyagi

1556
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,400
 from the Karate Kid movies, Pat Morito,

1557
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,600
 was a stand-up before he became a sort of

1558
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,600
 more serious actor.

1559
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,040
 And yeah, she managed him.

1560
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:56,880
 - Really?

1561
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,720
 - Yeah.

1562
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,560
 - He had a brief act, didn't he?

1563
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,760
 Walks on, walks off.

1564
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,920
 - Beautiful.

1565
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,560
 That is beautiful.

1566
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,400
 - Lenny Bruce, actually, he only ever performed

1567
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,360
 once in the UK.

1568
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,320
 It was in London.

1569
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,400
 And it was on Greek Street in central London in Soho.

1570
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,800
 And it was at the Establishment Club,

1571
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,620
 which was created by Peter Cook of Beyond the Fringe.

1572
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,900
 And it was, the Establishment was set up basically

1573
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,100
 because they wanted to try and give acts the opportunity

1574
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,540
 to try the stuff that was censored.

1575
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,860
 At this point in the UK, if you were performing,

1576
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,060
 it was part of a theater show.

1577
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,020
 And the Lord Chamberlain had veto over every script

1578
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,940
 that would be performed.

1579
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,900
 So they'd go through it and say,

1580
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,580
 "You can't say this and you can't say this."

1581
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,180
 But in private establishments, you were allowed to do that.

1582
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,540
 And so Peter Cook set up this place.

1583
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,880
 And that is how Lenny Bruce came to the UK

1584
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,600
 for his one and only trip

1585
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,240
 because he was deported the second time around.

1586
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,040
 He wasn't allowed in.

1587
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,440
 And by all accounts, it was quite a bad run of gigs.

1588
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,160
 He was pretty ill at that point in terms of the drug taking.

1589
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,040
 This story you mentioned about the women and the syringes

1590
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,040
 that was in London, where that happened.

1591
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,560
 And Peter Cook himself, who was a massive fan of his,

1592
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,520
 went and picked him up from the airport.

1593
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,860
 And he said that he just met this shambling guy

1594
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,780
 coming out at the arrivals.

1595
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,420
 He got into the car

1596
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,660
 and he was holding a record player,

1597
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,660
 a sort of miniature tape recorder.

1598
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,580
 And he insisted on playing his tapes

1599
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,220
 all the way on the journey back.

1600
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,260
 And the tapes consisted of nothing but airplane noises

1601
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,140
 and grunting and farting.

1602
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,980
 That was it.

1603
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,340
 And Peter Cook just saw what the hell is going on here.

1604
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,980
 And yeah, and so he came and he performed in London.

1605
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,300
 - What was going on?

1606
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,140
 - He doesn't really know.

1607
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,900
 Like Peter Cook, just basically what he had

1608
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,500
 was a junkie in the back of the car.

1609
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,680
 - I don't know, is that classic junkie behavior,

1610
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,700
 playing fart noises over a tape player,

1611
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,340
 which I haven't been invented yet, but.

1612
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,580
 - But he might've been, like there was,

1613
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,980
 there's accounts of Lenny Bruce making car stops

1614
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,660
 'cause he's sort of like a field of flowers

1615
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,060
 just so he could run and lay in them

1616
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,180
 and then get back in the car.

1617
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,500
 And they didn't realize at the time he was doing heroin.

1618
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,180
 And that was, that was him just.

1619
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,500
 - It was a field of poppies.

1620
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,180
 (all laughing)

1621
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,760
 (upbeat music)

1622
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,280
 - Okay, that's it.

1623
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,240

00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,040
 It's not like a history of the sea or the ab.

1647
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,880
 - No, no, no.

1648
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,560
 I've uploaded my new fish book.
