00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.500
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.820
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.900
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.620
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.020
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.260
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.340
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.220
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.780
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.500
 in the 1920 Winter Olympics, US skater, Teresa Weld,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.620
 was the only woman in the figure skating who performed jumps.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 But she was marked down every time she did

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.100
 because her skirt rose above her knees,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.580
 which was considered too scandalous.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.500
 - Mm, did she have pants on?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.340
 (laughing)

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.820
 - You can't tell if it's got rises above the knees.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.980
 - Depends how long the pants are.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.940
 - Yeah, possibly they could be like bloomers.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.420
 - Yeah, they did wear pants down to the knees back then.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 - So it sounds very sexy, James.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.260
 - Oh yeah.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.220
 - And clearly it was at the time.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 - Yeah, it depends when about she were.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.860
 If she wore what she was wearing then,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.500
 now in the Winter Olympics,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740
 like just to show behind the curtain,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.780
 we're actually recording this

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 when the Winter Olympics is on.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.500
 And you're gonna hear this in the spring, but...

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 - Sounds like she was showing people

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.300
 why in the curtain of her dress.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 - Yeah?

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.260
 - Wow.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.300
 (laughing)

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.140
 - Andy's drunk just so everyone knows.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.500
 (laughing)

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 - But yeah, she would have worn a skirt

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.460
 that was kind of round the ankles at the time

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.300
 because that's the way that women--

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.380
 - She wouldn't have worn her skirt around her ankles.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.740
 She wouldn't have worn a skirt.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.500
 - That does lose you points actually, yeah.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620
 (laughing)

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.660
 - It was round her ankles,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.100
 but also round her calves, and her knees,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.500
 and her thighs, and her bum.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.100
 - Yes, and that is the normal way

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.860
 of describing the length skirt.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.180
 (laughing)

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.300
 - And yeah, this is the way that basically

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.900
 until the 20s and 30s,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.500
 women figure skaters would wear long dresses.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.340
 - That's amazing.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.100
 - And it was only when a very famous skater

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.660
 called Sonja Haney came along

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.100
 and she was only 11 when she started to compete.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.140
 And 'cause she was a child,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.960
 she could get away with wearing like children's clothes.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.020
 - Right, sorry, I thought she'd get away

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.300
 with wearing much sexier stuff.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.620
 (laughing)

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.420
 - Well, she didn't have to wear full adult long dresses,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.380
 and she could do these amazing jumps,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.460
 and then all of the adult skaters had to wear a short skirt

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.940
 so that they could keep up with her amazing skills.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.940
 - So, what was the skating like

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.340
 if Theresa Weld was the only person doing jumps?

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.460
 What were the others doing in their show-off with skating?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.060
 - Well, it's called figure skating,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.700
 so they were doing figures mostly.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.280
 - Like carving out shapes in the ice.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 - Yeah, exactly, not so much carving out

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.680
 so that you could then pull it out and there's a shape there.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.760
 - The last person always fell through, didn't they?

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.400
 Once you connected the lines.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.240
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.560
 So, what you would do is you would do the shapes

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.120
 of a figure of eight, or at the very start of figure skating,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.720
 someone would shout out what figure they wanted you to do,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.280
 so they'd shout out, you know, snowman,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160
 and then you'd have to do a shape of a snowman,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.520
 and then they'd shout out something else

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.360
 and you'd have to do that.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.280
 - That's really cool.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.040
 - But really in the olden days,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.540
 figure skating, especially for women,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.580
 wasn't about the jumps.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.540
 It was about doing something graceful,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.220
 doing lots of shapes and stuff like that,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.060
 and then when this woman came in, Teresa Weld,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.620
 she was the first to do the jumps,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.540
 and then before long, everyone was doing jumps,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.220
 and now they're doing kick-ass jumps.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.220
 - Yeah, and the jumps sort of took over in a way

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.340
 because in television terms, drawing these circles

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.140
 into the ice wasn't as televisual for the Olympics,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.980
 so it'd usually be 60% or so of the mark

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.820
 that you would get was for the figures

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.200
 that you were creating in the ice,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.000
 and they just sort of thought that's a bit crap.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400
 - It sounds incredible, the process,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 because it was ended about 30 years ago, wasn't it?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.920
 They stopped having actual figures,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.960
 so I read a bit about that,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.400
 and the judging took such a long time,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.320
 so there were 41 different figures at the start of it,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.400
 which you would have to be able to master,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.920
 but the judges would examine the skating three times,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.880
 as in they'd examine the shapes on the ice.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.880
 They would get down on their stomachs like detectives

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.440
 to tell if there was a slight variation in the line,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.280
 or detectives.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.180
 - It was, generally it was only detectives

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.660
 getting their stomachs in the prime scenes.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.940
 - It was like forensics.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.780
 - What they used to do,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.540
 they would skate the shape of a dead body

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.700
 with the name of the ice.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.600
 - That was figure 37, yeah, yeah.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.860
 No, apparently the judging could last up to eight hours,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.660
 which sounds, I read an article from the Dutch Beagle,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.500
 the German thing,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.620
 and it was saying, it was from the '80s,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.540
 just before it ended,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.940
 and it was like, this is so boring.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.100
 - There was a guy called George Anderson

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.420
 who wrote a skating book in the 1860s,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.200
 and he wrote that after the shamrock,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.720
 a one foot figure requiring three turns

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.400
 and two changes of edge,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.220
 the acme of female accomplishment has now been reached.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.060
 - Wow.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.480
 - So he's like, once you've done the shamrock,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.880
 there's literally nothing better than that, true?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.280
 - Downhill ever since.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.500
 All these quintuple spins.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.160
 - One of the early guys who sort of turned figure skating

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.920
 into the sort of art that it is now

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.720
 was a guy called Jackson Haynes.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.640
 He was from New York, born in 1840s,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.640
 and he started, he was the person

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.500
 who kind of turned it into more of a dance.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.620
 You know, he was trained in ballet,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.220
 and he took popular dances like the waltz,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.220
 and he turned that into what you would do on the ice.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.020
 And he did this in America, and they hated it there,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.140
 so he came over to Europe,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.780
 and he started performing it here,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.820
 and they loved it here,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.900
 and he performed to royalty.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.660
 But I've been reading into banned things

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.020
 that would get you deducted points

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.180
 or that you're not allowed to do it all.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.780
 And one of the things in modern times

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.440
 is you're not allowed same sex couples

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.320
 when you do Olympic or even any sort of official skating.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.620
 And it turns out that the very first pairing,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.120
 which is with Jackson Haynes, was a same sex couple.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.960
 - Was it?

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.800
 - Yeah.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.640
 - Well, he was dancing with another guy.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640
 - Yeah, he was dancing with another guy.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.480
 It was in Vienna.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.800
 It was called Franz Bellasi,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.960
 and they were the first ever couple,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.720
 and he's held up actually as a result

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.760
 as a sort of LGBT pioneer.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.080
 - Is he, are we sure they weren't doing

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.360
 the same sex couple just 'cause it was so regressive

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.300
 that women weren't allowed to do figure skating?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.740
 Was it that they were a--

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.580
 - No, I think--

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.420
 - Progressive, progressive.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.120
 You know, at a certain point in the circle

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.060
 that they're the same?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.500
 That's possible, although he's sort of been embraced

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.260
 by the community of sort of being progressive.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.540
 - Was it the tango that was also like that originally?

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.020
 - Just really, all male.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.420
 - Yeah, there was one dance,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.300
 I can't remember whether it was flamenco or tango,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.060
 or there was a huge dance craze, which was men only,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.940
 that we think of as a mixed-sex dance these days.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.780
 - Right.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.620
 - It was classically meant to be that.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.460
 - Yeah.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.340
 - And it was as well that Haynes wasn't,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.360
 he was dressed as a bear at the time.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.600
 - Oh, was he?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.340
 - Yeah, wasn't strictly two men dancing together.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.620
 - I think that is still strictly--

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.820
 (laughing)

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.020
 - Well, yeah.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.500
 I mean, if only strictly was like that.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.140
 - Dan, do you watch the Masked Singer

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.400
 and you go, "Well, obviously it's an actual robot bunny."

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.220
 I mean, I don't know what they're talking about,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.140
 celebrities, this is clearly a big pile of donuts.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.620
 - I'm afraid you are disqualified, it's a human only.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.540
 - Human only, sorry.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.220
 - So women, women skating was a kind of a thing,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.420
 or women competing anyway in figure skating.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.460
 And it was actually because of the clothes,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.780
 these long dresses that they weren't allowed to take part

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.940
 in the world championships.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.300
 So there was basically only men

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.460
 who entered figure skating contests for ages,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.380
 and it just wasn't really, didn't occur to people

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.580
 that a woman might enter, so they didn't ban it.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.780
 And then this amazing skater called Madge Sires

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.580
 entered in 1902, the world figure skating championships.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.940
 And she got silver, and there was lots of reports

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.380
 saying she should have got gold,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.340
 and actually the winner was a guy called Ulrich Salko,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.940
 and he offered her his gold medal, 'cause he said,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.700
 "I think you were actually the deserving winner,

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.860
 "you were better than I was."

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.180
 But anyway, then the judges are like,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.860
 "Oh, bummer, we weren't supposed to have women in this,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.900
 "what are we gonna do?"

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.180
 And so they went through all the problems

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.340
 with having women figure skate,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.340
 and they basically said it was things like,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.300
 "The problem with it is that a judge might judge a girl

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.500
 "on how much he's attracted to her,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.580
 "rather than how good she is at skating."

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.700
 - There's definitely a problem with the female skater,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.180
 rather than with the judges there.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, get her off the ice.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.740
 But the other thing was, 'cause their dresses are so long,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.660
 you can't see their feet,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.060
 so they could be doing anything under there.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.740
 They could be cheating, they could have five feet,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.060
 they could have a child under there.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.900
 - They could have a child under there.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.580
 - Yeah, yeah, like have a snobberbill.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.340
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.780
 - What do you think is like sneaking into a cinema,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.620
 where it's sort of sitting on top of a lot of the code?

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.460
 - Three kids in a code, and they can't let

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.420
 that kind of thing get through.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.380
 And so to be fair to Matt, she did say,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.340
 "Well, I'm very happy to wear a shorter skirt."

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.980
 But then obviously she couldn't do that either,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.300
 so it was really rocking a hard place.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.820
 - Right, although while we're on men and women skating,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.580
 the patron saint of figure skating is a woman.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.740
 Saint Lidwina, you heard of her?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.580
 - Yeah, no.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.820
 - She was a Dutch teenager, 'cause you know

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.260
 there are lots of canals and things in the Netherlands,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.100
 and they are from Friesey,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.780
 but there are lots of skating happens on them.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.340
 And I think this was in the 13th century.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.220
 Anyway, she was skating, she fell, she broke her leg,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.580
 and she never recovered.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.380
 And as a result, she's the patron saint of figure skating.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.220
 - Right.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.540
 - I'm not completely sure why.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.380
 - When was she around?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.500
 - 13th, a long time ago, several hundred years ago.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.780
 And it was, it sounds quite stressful.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.300
 There aren't, they think she might have had something

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.020
 that we'd recognize as a modern condition today,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.260
 maybe the first ever case of MS,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.020
 but also the saintly accounts are so strange and exaggerated.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.460
 It's kind of hard to diagnose.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.540
 So for example, large pieces of her body fell off,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.220
 blood poured from her mouth, ears, and nose.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.620
 She shed bones, skin, and part of her intestines,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.340
 and her parents kept them in a vase.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.180
 And they gave off--

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.020
 - That's not MS.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.860
 (laughing)

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.700
 - And they gave off an incredible--

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.680
 - That's the walking dead to what you're describing.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.220
 - Her parents kept these bits of her body in a vase

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.420
 and they gave off a sweet odor,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.620
 so they knew she was holy.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.060
 - Oh, the odor of sanctity.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.820
 - Yeah, exactly, so it's holy.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.660
 Anyway, so--

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.300
 - Wait, is she still alive while this is happening?

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.420
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.660
 - What, while her intestines are in the vase?

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.140
 - I think, from the account I read, yes.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.980
 - Well, I was gonna say,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.140
 doesn't it sound like she's very good at skating

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.980
 if she broke her leg?

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.540
 But to be honest, if she's missing half of her body parts,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.620
 it sounds like, well done to her for getting up

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.460
 in the morning.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.420
 - She never skated again, anyway.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.260
 (laughing)

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.100
 - Wow.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.740
 - That's very funny.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.140
 - You still get costume infringements, don't you,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.980
 in skating?

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.820
 I hadn't realized this.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.300
 In fact, I knew very little about figure skating,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.580
 but you can get points docked

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.740
 for wearing the wrong stuff now.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.220
 Well, you used to be able to,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.660
 until I think about less than 20 years ago,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.580
 it used to be that women couldn't wear skirts

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.140
 that came up above the bum or the hips,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.980
 so you had to wear a skirt.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.820
 - Above the bum?

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.660
 - Yeah, so sorry, you had to--

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.820
 - Too sexy, that's so sexy, it's above the bum.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.940
 That was just having a bum out, wasn't it?

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.780
 - Hang on.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.340
 - I don't wanna sound like a prude,

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.140
 but I do think there are some good reasons why.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.500
 - I think every now and then,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.180
 the phrase, "You're not going out looking like that,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.660
 "you're bleeding" is appropriate.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.180
 I've misspoken.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.740
 They had to wear skirts and they had to be below the bum.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.940
 I should have said it like that.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.420
 Yeah, so you would be fined--

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.940
 - So you'd have to cover the bum?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.020
 - You had to cover the bum.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.860
 You'd have a point docked.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.020
 - Well, you don't anymore, you can wear a leotard, can't you?

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.860
 - Yes.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.780
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.180
 But your bum is not fully out.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.780
 There's no mooning at the Olympics.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.860
 - I don't know what the rules are on that,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.140
 but I think you have to cover the genitals.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.540
 - And you think you might get jumped

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.020
 as one of those detectives.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.220
 (all laughing)

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.020
 - What a finishing move that would be for your routine.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.940
 Lots of jumps, lots of spins,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.780
 and a full moon at the end of it.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.580
 (all laughing)

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.140
 - Suck it, guys.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.980
 - So on infringements, there was someone

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.260
 at the 2018 Winter Olympics called Gabriela Papadakis,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.220
 whose nipple fell out during her performance, right?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.260
 - A Jackson moment.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.100
 - A Jackson moment.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.420
 - When you say fell out.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.220
 - It just, it didn't fall off her body like that.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.620
 - They said an argument, they fell out,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.220
 and-- - It smelled sweet, though.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.820
 It had the odor of sanctity.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.260
 - The detectives rushed onto the ice to collect it.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.500
 - And put it in a jar.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.900
 - It came out of her costume.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.300
 And it looks, it's like your worst nightmare,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.820
 but also you're getting point stocks.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.980
 Not only have you exposed yourself in national television,

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.380
 you also get points deducted.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.100
 They still got silver, impressively.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.500
 - Have you heard of the job

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.020
 of the Olympic figure skating poo wrangler?

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.260
 - Jesus Christ.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.100
 - No.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.940
 - No.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.060
 - Is it surely the detective can double up?

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.620
 (all laughing)

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.540
 - Take a scoop on.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.180
 - What on earth could this be?

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.580
 Oh, I know, is it about Hanyu, the Japanese guy?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.420
 - Yes, it is.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.500
 - I do know that, yeah.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.860
 - So this is a skater, he's called,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.820
 yeah, he's Japanese, he's called Yuzuru Hanyu,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.940
 and he's associated with Winnie the Pooh.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.780
 As in, he loves Winnie the Pooh,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.980
 and his fans, as a result, love Winnie the Pooh too.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.900
 And whenever he skates,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.660
 they throw Winnie the Pooh stuffed toys onto the ice.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.380
 - That sounds like it would ruin your routine.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.780
 - They throw hundreds.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.620
 It's insane.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.300
 And there was a job at the last,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.180
 I don't know if it's at every single Olympics,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.300
 but basically there has to be someone who skates around,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.780
 scooping up the Winnie the Poohs.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.620
 - Right.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.460
 - And shoving them into a huge golf park.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.260
 - I watched Hanyu in this Olympics,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.780
 and there was no Winnie the Poohs there.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.860
 So maybe because of COVID?

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.620
 - So, well, Xi Jinping is compared,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.300
 Xi Jinping hates being compared to Winnie the Pooh.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.620
 - I forgot about that, yes.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.460
 - For some reason, for such a powerful guy,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.060
 he's pretty thin-skinned about this.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.180
 He doesn't like being compared to Winnie the Pooh.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.340
 And yeah, and so it wouldn't be a big problem.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.140
 Fortunately, foreign spectators have not been allowed

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.460
 into China for this Olympics.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.380
 So no Winnie the Poohs have been chucked on.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.100
 - Hanyu's fans are super crazy.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.220
 Like, they literally, they're called fan news,

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.300
 and they go around the world just following.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.940
 Like, if they can get tickets anywhere,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.820
 they'll go on eBay for thousands of pounds.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.460
 Like, he's really, really super famous in Japan, yeah.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.300
 - Well, what's weird is,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.380
 I've been to a few sporting events recently,

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.940
 and in most cases these days,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.580
 you get checked as you're coming in

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.660
 to these sort of bigger ones.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.700
 You have to, you know, if you go even see gigs

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.740
 at like the O2, there's a metal detector and so on.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.580
 - Right.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.060
 - Surely that's the spot to put the Pooh wrangler,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.900
 you know, to...

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.660
 (laughing)

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.780
 - But I think normally when it's not happening in a state

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.820
 where the totalitarian head of state

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.700
 is compared to Winnie the Pooh and hates it.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.100
 - I'm not talking about current Beijing,

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.540
 I'm talking about any other...

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.300
 - I think they're fine with it, I like that.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.140
 - So they're fine with it.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.060
 - Yeah, it's fun, yeah.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.020
 - I think surely not at an Olympic level,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.780
 if you're going for gold, he'd be really annoyed.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.620
 Surely they'd hold back then.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.740
 - It's not at him on the ice.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.580
 - Oh.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.380
 - It's onto the ice while he's performing.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.220
 - It's after he's finished.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.060
 - It's after he's finished, yeah, yeah.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.900
 - Okay, 'cause they're really off-putting.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.980
 - It's not mid-routine, yeah.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.820
 - Okay.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.180
 - But it is apparently off-putting for his opponent.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.140
 So Nathan Chen, who's the other really amazing

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.500
 figure skater male, his manager hates it.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.900
 His manager thinks it's like psychological warfare

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.740
 against him.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.140
 - He's jealous 'cause he wants a teddy.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.460
 That's so sad, 'cause that's from Djokovic's behavior.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.180
 - I wonder if he's been trying to push his own thing,

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.820
 like Trolls or My Little Pony, he's like, "Come on."

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.020
 (laughing)

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.500
 - One sad Troll thrown by his manager at this point.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.380
 - So the whole thing about the couples doing their dances,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.380
 I was reading this article where it sort of says,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.780
 obviously the choreography is amazing,

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.220
 but also what they want is emotion

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.420
 and they want to feel a routine.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.580
 And so a love story tends to be the thing

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.620
 that you kind of go for.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.700
 And so a problem that siblings have is that they obviously,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.540
 it's a bit off if you see a brother and sister

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.820
 kind of doing sort of that.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.580
 So they have a really odd position where they have to come up

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.660
 with slightly kookier routines as a result

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.700
 because they can't be seen to be like almost kissing

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.660
 at the end of a routine.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.860
 - There was one in this Olympics.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.780
 I'm not sure if it was brother and sister.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.980
 It probably wasn't, but one of them was in the alien

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.260
 and the other one was someone being probed.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.740
 (laughing)

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.780
 - It would still be too sexy for brother and sister,

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.620
 I think.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.620
 - You get the Benny Hill music playing.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.860
 One of them chasing the other one with a probe

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.180
 has 10 points for me.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.020
 - It's not interesting.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.900
 They've never tried the Benny Hill music, to my knowledge.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.660
 (laughing)

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.180
 - Too sexual, that's the problem.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.780
 - One of the most famous figure skaters of all time,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.620
 Tonya Harding, at least one of the most infamous.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.460
 I was reading up on her.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.380
 I never saw that movie with Margot Robbie.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.700
 - Eitania.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.780
 - Eitania, yeah, but what a pretty extraordinary life

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.780
 that she's led even post her career.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.620
 So she got banned as a result of a controversy

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.340
 where she was implicated in harming another skater.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.180
 What was her name?

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.020
 Nancy Kerrigan.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.700
 - Neat capping nose, no, it was a breeze.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.860
 - It was her ex-husband hired someone to do it

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.500
 and what came out through court cases was that

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.020
 maybe she had an inkling that this was gonna happen,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.780
 that they were planning something.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.300
 That's got her a lifetime ban, basically.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.740
 But post this happening, she released a sex tape.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.100
 It was a sort of leaked sex tape,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.740
 but then she went to Penthouse, I think it was,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.700
 and they were playboy and said,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.940
 "You can officially release it for a man of money."

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.340
 She became a manager for Pro Wrestlers.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.140
 She became herself a boxer.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.980
 She did boxing.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.940
 She started a band called the Golden Blades.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.260
 They got booed off stage on their

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.900
 first gig. - Oh my gosh.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.340
 - Yeah, she's worked as a welder, a painter and a metal,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.260
 yeah, this is her career.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.900
 A painter at a metal fabrication company,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.260
 a hardware sales clerk, a deck builder.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.900
 She set the automobile racing land speed record.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.620
 Tonya's had a fucking life.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.060
 - She's desperately trying to erase

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.740
 the one thing everyone knows about her.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.220
 Just trying anything on a Wikipedia

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.420
 is all these different things,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.700
 but they still put that at the time.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.260
 - Exactly, but she was an amazing figure skater

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.300
 and when they made this movie with Margot Robbie,

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.740
 there's a scene in it where Margot Robbie

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.340
 has to do a triple axel and Margot Robbie,

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.980
 who did train to do it, obviously couldn't do it,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.220
 but they also couldn't find anyone to do it

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.820
 because it's so rare that anyone's ever landed that,

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.460
 that they had to use CGI in the film, yeah.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.300
 - She's also amazing at bow and arrow shooting.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.620
 - She shoots the show.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.580
 - There was a piece about her that interviewed her

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.980
 and she goes hunting a lot with her husband,

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.660
 like hunting sort of elephants.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.700
 - Other figure skaters.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.300
 (all laughing)

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:49.060
 - Hunting elk and such like.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.620
 And her husband takes a big gun

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.180
 and she just takes a bow and arrow.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.900
 She says because she wants to give the animal

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.220
 a 50/50 chance to make it interesting and fair,

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.580
 although the journalist points out also

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.060
 because felons aren't technically supposed

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.180
 to possess guns in Washington state.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.760
 (upbeat music)

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.620
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.340
 - My fact this week is that in the early 1900s,

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.500
 the US government installed telephones

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.960
 at the top of trees.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.700
 - What?

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.540
 - Be cool.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.380
 - What?

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.060
 - Convenient place to make a call.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.900
 This--

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.500
 - A trunk call.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.340
 - Good.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.180
 - Yeah.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.020
 - Is that a thing?

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.860
 - That's a very old fashioned term

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.220
 for a very long distance phone call, yeah.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.060
 - Oh, okay.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.780
 - Would have got a huge laugh in the '70s.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.540
 This is, it was the US Forest Service

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.580
 that started installing them

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.580
 at like 10th of the century, early 1900s,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.100
 and it was for fire lookouts.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.700
 So it was in like fire prone states

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.740
 like your Arizona's or your California's,

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.680
 and they'd find the tallest tree

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.420
 on top of the biggest hill in the area,

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.460
 and then they'd climb to the top,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.980
 they'd put a ladder up the tree,

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.540
 and then a ranger would basically

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.940
 lop off the top of the tree,

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.220
 and in its place put a platform there,

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.100
 and on the platform is just a telephone.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.940
 And then a guy's job is to sit at the top of the tree,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940
 and then if he sees a fire,

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.380
 he makes a phone call and says fire,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.540
 and they go and put it out.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.180
 It's so cool.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.900
 And sometimes, what I didn't get was it says,

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.300
 sometimes they're worked in pairs,

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.020
 and so there'd be two of them up the tree,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.980
 and one of them spots the fire

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.940
 and then sends the other one to put it out.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.300
 But I don't understand how one single human being,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.540
 I imagine they weren't giant forest fires,

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.020
 yeah, there's a small campfire, I suppose.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.060
 - What would you be, you would just,

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.020
 if it was small enough,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.860
 you'd only see a plume of smoke, right?

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.940
 I think as soon as you see flames,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.740
 that one guy's not really gonna appreciate

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.980
 what's being sent on his own.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.980
 - Once the flames are coming out

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.300
 at the top of the forest.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.500
 - Were you allowed to use the telephones for other things,

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.820
 like calling your mates or stuff?

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.060
 - No personal phone calls.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.060
 They do go through at the end of the month,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.540
 it's your phone record.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.060
 The bill's very high this month.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.940
 We don't remember hearing from you at all, lots of fires.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.580
 - They're still there today, some of them, it's amazing.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.900
 They get called the freaks of the peaks.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.260
 It's one cool nickname they have.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.420
 - The trees. - The people are the trees.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.540
 - The people, the people, I think.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.940
 But there are not many left.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.460
 There were 5,000 at most in the '30s,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.220
 and now there I think are a few hundred, maybe 500.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.220
 - I think it went up, I think it was peak was the '50s,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.500
 where there were about 10,000 in the US.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.300
 But yeah, I think such a cool job,

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.620
 such an interesting kind of person who does that job.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.220
 - You've got to be very happy with your own company.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.060
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.580
 - Well, I know if there's two of you up there.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.420
 - That's a good point.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.740
 But in most cases, it's like the lookout,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.180
 not the tree situation, but other lookout.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.100
 Sounds like it was one person the entire time.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.420
 - Yeah, it mostly does seem to be one person.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.660
 - Jack Kerouac was one of these guys, wasn't he?

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.100
 - Was he? - Yeah, he was.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.380
 He spent 63 days as a US Forest Service fire lookout

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.100
 on a place called Desolation Peak.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:45.940
 - Sounds fun.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.700
 - Yeah, and he went there thinking that he'll be on his own.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.420
 He only has to look out for fires for a while,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.860
 so it'll be fine, he can write some stuff.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.740
 But in the end, he wrote only one letter to his mother,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.620
 some Haiku poetry, and a couple of journal entries

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.700
 and no novels.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.180
 - Well, I was reading one of the lookouts today

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.540
 who says when new people come to do the job,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.180
 apply for the job, they imagine they're gonna do

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.980
 all this stuff, like write their great novel

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.780
 and learn an instrument, he says, or you know, they think--

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.600
 - Oh my God, imagine if you had like two of you

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.940
 at the top of the thing.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.540
 You see a laughing point climbing with the bagpipes.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.540
 Oh, here we go.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.900
 - You laugh.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.460
 There's genuinely a girl who's learning bagpipes

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.300
 while she does this.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.380
 - Really? - I believe she is.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.220
 - Is she by herself?

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.060
 - So true ones.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.100
 - Yes. - Okay.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.220
 - Yeah. - Oh God.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.140
 - But yeah, he says people tend to get nothing done.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.660
 You actually go and you end up--

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.500
 - Oh, I'm sure.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.180
 I mean, you'd always think you'd only get stuff done

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.020
 and you never do.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.940
 That's just life.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.660
 - I mean, your job is literally doing nothing.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.500
 - But it's to look.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.860
 You have to be looking for fires, don't you?

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.380
 You have to be scaring the horizon.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.780
 You know, your binoculars, a little room.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.140
 - I feel like you can look

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.500
 and play the bagpipes at the same time.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.100
 - Yes, that is one of the things.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.060
 - It's kind of sad that there are all these people

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.740
 by themselves at the top of trees.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.940
 It's a 50/50 split.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.780
 And yet they obviously can't date each other

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.180
 because they're all at the top of trees by themselves.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.540
 - You know how trees have sex?

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.900
 They kind of fire.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.780
 - They release their seed into the wind.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.620
 - Into the wind.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.260
 They should try that.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.060
 - I'm sure it's been tried.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.100
 I'm sure someone's done it.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.780
 (laughing)

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.860
 - It gets pretty dull up there.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.500
 - We've had some complaints from tourists

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.780
 at the bottom of the tree.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.040
 (laughing)

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.780
 - Well, they could do,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.180
 they did a sort of semaphore, not a semaphore.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.980
 They did a way of communicating

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.100
 in the very early days before the phones.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.220
 What? - It has nothing.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.500
 - No, not semaphore, is that all?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.100
 - There we go, thank you, yeah, yep.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.060
 - Didn't need to happen, did it?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.380
 They had these things called heliographs.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.740
 So the ones that weren't high-tech enough

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.460
 to have the telephones in the early 1900s

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.740
 would just have two mirrors.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.380
 And there would be someone,

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.980
 and they'd be called the flasher,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.980
 who would use the mirrors to transmit messages

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.740
 by bouncing the sun off them.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.300
 - Right, isn't that how you start fires?

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.560
 (laughing)

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.100
 That's a great point.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.540
 - It's a major flaw in the plan.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.080
 Yeah, I guess you have to be quite careful.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.180
 I guess if you make sure it's a convex mirror, maybe.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.380
 - Okay, yeah, interesting.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.020
 - But yeah, it would reflect the sunlight

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.140
 and they could transmit Morse code up to 70 miles.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.540
 - So we're saying that this is a technology basic,

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.380
 it's not a technology,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.700
 it's a lack of technology that should be wiped out by now,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.780
 but it's still going.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.780
 And you would think with drones,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.300
 with satellite imagery, with planes,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.660
 we wouldn't need this anymore,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.100
 but it survived because it's the one thing

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.420
 that we can still do when there is an electrical storm

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.620
 and we can't send up drones

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.180
 and we can't get satellite imaging

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.400
 through clouding and so on.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.580
 So it's a job that hasn't died out

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.540
 through the modern technological world,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.380
 which is pretty cool.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.300
 - Yeah, they've done a few studies recently

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.100
 and found that the human observation is as efficient,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.860
 if not more efficient overall than using drones

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.020
 and stuff like that.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.100
 Exactly like Dan says,

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.260
 they can't be used in all conditions and stuff.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.460
 - And also they know,

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.020
 'cause it's such a personal attachment they have

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:03.860
 to the land,

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.220
 so often they've been there 30 or 40 years,

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.340
 you'll get a look out. - What?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.420
 - They've lived up there,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.900
 so they know every centimeter of the land,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.260
 so these people can instinctively spot

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.780
 the tiniest thing wrong.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.820
 - But do you think they're like,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.260
 there's a fire where,

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.200
 you know where the co-op used to be?

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.260
 (all laughing)

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.900
 Where old Vera used to live?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.200
 - Yeah, just down there.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.420
 - Yeah, it's that.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.420
 A lot of co-ops in the chorus, actually.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.020
 - They use something called an Osborne fire finder,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.860
 don't they?

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.580
 An OFF, which is a topographic map.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.400
 So you know like those maps when you go to a tourist place

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.300
 and it shows you where all the things are on the horizon,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.420
 it's like this building is this tower of this building,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.860
 it's like one of those.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.020
 And then there's a few different things

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.500
 so you can tell exactly where the fire's happening.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500
 And that was invented in 1840 by a guy

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.500
 called Sir Francis Ronalds.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.700
 And he also was one of the first people

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.100
 to do electrical signalling.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.260
 So when he was 28, he put eight miles worth of iron wire

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.700
 on his mother's lawn in Hammersmith

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.660
 and managed to send a signal from one end of the eight miles

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.820
 to the other end of the eight miles.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.060
 It was all kind of like folded up.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.140
 So he didn't go very far in actual terms.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.740
 But he said after that, he said,

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:21.300
 "Why add to the torments of pens, ink, paper and posts?

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.660
 "Let's us all have electrical conversazione offices

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.380
 "communicating with each other all over the kingdom.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.380
 "Give me enough material and I will electrify the world."

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.660
 - Wow. - So he basically invented email.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.580
 - Yeah. - Isn't that amazing?

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.780
 - I just sort of imagined him at the end of his garden

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.420
 going like, "Mom, talk into the wire."

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.780
 And his mom being like, "I can just say to you,

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.940
 "come in for dinner, talk into the wire, mom.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.900
 "I can hear it."

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.300
 Yeah, you can't even 10 meters away from me.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.140
 So funny.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.860
 On the Watchman thing, but the non-fire-related Watchman.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.700
 - Oh yeah.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.860
 - So, Lausanne in Switzerland has its own Watchman

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.500
 who climbs the bell tower every night and shouts the time.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.940
 And that's been going since 1405.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.900
 - They can't have put a clock up there or anything.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.740
 - Well, they've got, I think they've also--

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.580
 - In Switzerland.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.100
 (laughing)

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.940
 - You're absolutely right.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.340
 In fact, they've definitely got a clock

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.340
 'cause it's the bell goes and then the watchkeeper

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.540
 shouts the time and chouts that it's all fine.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.620
 - Watch, watcher.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.460
 - Yeah, but--

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.260
 - Shouts that it's all fine.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.340
 - Yeah, there's a rubric that you say,

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.620
 which is, you know, it's 10 o'clock and all is well.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.460
 Good night.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.740
 - Oh, not like 10 bongs and--

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.900
 - Yep, it's right again.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.060
 (laughing)

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.300
 - I do think they speak after the bell rings.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.140
 In fact, they do.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.380
 The bell rings and then they shout

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.420
 from the foresight of the tower what time it is.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.260
 Anyway, for the first time--

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.820
 - It feels like a redundant job, literally.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.100
 - Yeah, that's the son of the owner of the bell

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.780
 just trying to find a gig for his kid.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.380
 - They've just appointed their first ever female watchkeeper

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.700
 in 2021.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.860
 This is after 600 years.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.700
 - Huge steps.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.540
 - Yeah, it is.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.340
 And there was a big protest a couple of years ago

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.500
 about the fact that no women had been invited

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.340
 to be watch keepers.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.380
 - Not 'cause she got the job.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.220
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, right.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.340
 - No, a couple of years ago,

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.940
 a lot of women said, "Look, we want to enter this."

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.300
 A sweet gig, apparently.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.540
 (laughing)

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.060
 Well, they had a vacancy last year to join the team

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.020
 and I think 80% of the applications were from women.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.980
 - I think what you want is a dinner lady.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.260
 They have the loudest voices in the world, don't they?

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.820
 - Yes, and there was a voice test.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.660
 That was part of it.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.540
 It was sort of they need to test

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.740
 that you've got a good pair of lungs to shout the time.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.460
 And the job comes with a little lodge

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.220
 that you can keep warm in, in between bongs, I guess.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.020
 And it comes with a felt hat, a lantern,

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.700
 and a cheese fondue set.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.660
 (laughing)

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.260
 - It's in the lodge, right?

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.100
 - Pretty Swiss.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.900
 - With those perks, I can really understand

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.620
 why they went for it.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.460
 A felt hat.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.700
 Just one more thing, actually, on fire towers

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.660
 that I found so interesting is that this was,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.180
 I was reading a piece with a lookout called Levi Brinniger.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.220
 And I do want to say they all have really cool names

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.380
 like that or like Leaf Hogan.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.660
 All names that sound like they're a forest lookout.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.100
 But Levi Brinniger pointed out

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.340
 that if there's a lightning storm,

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.580
 you are in the tallest place up the tallest tree

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.460
 with an electric phone line that you're supposed to use.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.740
 So first of all, they do have a kill switch.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.420
 They just have a kill switch to kill the phone lines

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.740
 if the lightning came too close.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.340
 And then if it's really close, they have a stool,

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.780
 and there are a couple of others who all had this,

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.060
 a stool where they've just put sort of glasses

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:30.100
 on each leg, under the leg, to insulate it from lightning.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.700
 So you just go and sit on this one stool

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.060
 in the middle of the room and wait for the lightning

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.900
 to pass through.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.700
 - I would have thought the power of a lightning bolt

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.100
 on a tree if it hits it.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.940
 - It explodes it.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.780
 - It explodes it.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.140
 And it doesn't matter if you've got four tightly glasses

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.460
 on the bottom of your chair.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.140
 - I think, friend of the podcast, Roy Sullivan,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.980
 was that his name?

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.900
 The guy who was struck by lightning seven times.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.620
 I think one of the times he was hit by lightning

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.260
 was when he was up a fire lookout thing.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.100
 - Was it?

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.740
 - Yeah, yeah, wow.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.460
 - Didn't put his glasses under the stool.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.020
 - No, clearly, yeah.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.140
 - And in fact, it wasn't one of the other times

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.540
 when he was being chased by a bear.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.380
 Do you remember?

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.220
 - Yes, yes, yes.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.540
 - He was being chased by a bear then struck by lightning.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.940
 He was beating it off with a stick.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.820
 - Sorry, he wasn't, let me rephrase that.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.540
 He was beating the bear with a stick at the time.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.380
 - Well then, I don't blame the bear for chasing him.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.540
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.660
 - He just wanted to do an ice dance with it.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.240
 (upbeat music)

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.140
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.940
 That is Andy.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.540
 - My fact is there is a worm,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.180
 which can grow multiple bottoms,

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.680
 which then fires off to have sex without it.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.020
 - Okay.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.860
 - Yeah.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.260
 - So this is a newly named worm, very exciting.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.940
 There were a couple in the same kind of family

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.500
 with the same kind of body shape

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.900
 that were known about already, but this is a new one.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.180
 It's called Ramisela's King Ghidorahi,

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.300
 which is after a thing from Godzilla.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.020
 It's one of the other things that is a villain.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:53.860
 I mean, yeah.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.420
 - I always thought Godzilla was the villain,

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.260
 but anyway, we'll come back to that.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.620
 - Well, I'm sure we'll come to that.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.740
 Basically, this worm is an amazing branching creature.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.180
 It lives in sea sponges.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.260
 It has one head, and then the back end of it branches,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.180
 'cause it lives in a sea sponge.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.820
 It branches through all the different tunnels

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.380
 and crevices and paths of the sponge, right?

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.420
 And then when it wants to reproduce,

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.220
 basically the end of each branch of its body,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.340
 and there can be dozens or even hundreds of these branches,

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.860
 the end of each one breaks off, swims up to the surface,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.060
 independently releases its eggs or sperm

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.140
 into the water column where they'll all find each other.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.860
 So they fertilize each other and then the bums die,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.900
 but the head of the worm living in the sea sponge lives,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.580
 lives to breed another day,

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.420
 and it starts regenerating all of its--

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.380
 - It's so amazing. - It's a bums.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.580
 - It's incredible. - It really is.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.180
 - It's just such a weird, weird thing.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.820
 - I just feel so sorry for the head.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.100
 Don't you think that is the worst?

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.660
 Because you're spending your whole life as a face

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.340
 buried in the pitch-black belly of a sponge,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.500
 and you're sending off your arses to have sex,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.500
 and you never, ever get to do that yourself.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.580
 - Mm. - Isn't that so weird?

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.420
 - Yes.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.820
 - You do have a nice sponge to live in.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.140
 - Yeah, I guess that's why it comes true.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.420
 - That's a sponge bath every day.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.620
 (all laughing)

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.500
 - They can't survive the head part,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.860
 can't survive outside the sponge.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.820
 As soon as they go outside the sponge, they die.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.860
 - Oh, that's a lady of shallot there.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.940
 I bet they sometimes want to.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.820
 I bet there are a few heads who have gone sod it.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.700
 I'm gonna give it a go.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.260
 - Yeah. - Let it pop out.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.540
 - That's it. - It's so crazy, isn't it,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.300
 when you think of evolution, right?

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.980
 Like, just the fact that this thing had to evolve

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.460
 to send its anus off to go and have the babies, you know,

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.820
 while, like, it was like, what do we do?

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.740
 We can't, my head can't leave this sponge.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.580
 (all laughing)

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.920
 What do I do?

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.700
 - These things that you call bums as well,

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.500
 they are kind of, they can be more than bums.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.460
 They can have, like, they have very rudimentary brains.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.380
 They have very rudimentary eyes.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.220
 - Yeah.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.900
 - So they're like, not just a bum.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.260
 - No, you're absolutely right.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.060
 - So they're their own kind of, as it were, consciousness,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.260
 even though I know they're not thinking,

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.300
 but they've got their own--

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.220
 - Yeah, they have nerves. - Yeah, this is the most

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.060
 amazing thing.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.500
 - And they're called stolons, technically.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.980
 So they're reproductive units.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.820
 But as James says, they've got eyes,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.220
 they've got very primitive brains,

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.100
 and that helps them to steer and to mate.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.260
 - I find this the most extraordinary thing about this,

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.900
 and almost anything I've ever read in nature,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.180
 that these are basically living creatures

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.020
 that they turn into.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.820
 So every single time they let go of a branch,

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.740
 that they split their organs in half somehow.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.740
 So every organ duplicates,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.420
 so that branch has its own set of organs

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.820
 that it then goes off with.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.660
 - Extraordinary.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.500
 - It's so weird.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.620
 - So all of them have guts and nerves,

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.300
 and every single branch does.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.860
 And so when that forks, the organs fork as well.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.340
 And some of them have been measured.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.580
 So this is the other species,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.980
 Ramicillus multicordata,

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.260
 which is just a very similar creature.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.820
 They've been measured with 500 different branches.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.620
 - The reason you kind of call them bums

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.460
 is because when they're sticking out of the sponge,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.860
 it's the bum bitch which's sticking out, right?

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.100
 And the way that they eat is they can't,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.020
 well, we're not quite sure,

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.940
 because no one's ever found any food inside any of them.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.980
 - It's insane.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.820
 - It's insane.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.540
 But what we think is that they dissolve,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.540
 they kind of soak in the food into their body,

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.860
 and then there's no stomach or anything like that,

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.740
 and then they send out the waste through the bums.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.700
 And then when they become like the thing that reproduces

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.980
 and decides to swim off,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.620
 then a new little anal opening comes

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.100
 where they used to live,

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.460
 and then they grow out again.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.260
 - Constantly mooning the world.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.340
 - They were found, the first one was found in the 1870s,

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.340
 and then they didn't find the other two species,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.860
 'cause they're three species altogether, this thing,

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.820
 until about 20 years ago.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.100
 And the first one was found on the Challenger Expedition,

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.220
 which I had never read about,

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.900
 but is this extraordinary expedition from 18,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.300
 maybe we've discussed it before,

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.940
 but 1872 to 1876, this three and a half year voyage,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.260
 which basically started oceanography.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.500
 And I didn't realize that before that,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.620
 people didn't care about the oceans at all.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.340
 It was a big team of people,

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.940
 and it sounds really dull.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.780
 So Darwin had called the oceans

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.980
 "a tedious waste, a desert of water."

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.500
 He was like, "There's nothing in here, don't bother with it."

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.820
 So everyone thought that,

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.660
 and then they set off on this expedition.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.940
 - You think that's because you know how Darwin basically

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.940
 lived in England, right?

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.180
 And then he went all the way over to the Galapagos,

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.500
 all the way over the sea.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.660
 Do you reckon people said, "What were you doing on the way,

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.820
 all were you doing, fuck all?"

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.660
 He was like, "Oh, it's pointless, I wouldn't do anything."

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.780
 Anyway, just see, there's nothing in there.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.340
 - He forgot to look in it.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.820
 - Is it the opposite where he found,

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.100
 he obviously knew how much was in there,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.780
 but he was just trying to put off other scientists.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.260
 "No, don't bother looking there, it's just water, mate."

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.380
 - Yeah, he always went to get to it.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.220
 Well, they did look there

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.900
 and they collected 4,800 new species,

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.660
 and they found the Marianas Trench on the expedition,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.620
 and they started the whole field.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.100
 - This guy who we're talking about with all the bums,

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.580
 the way that he eats by dissolving stuff

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.180
 that is around him basically is how mushrooms live.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.740
 And so I read one place that they said

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.460
 that it's basically an animal

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.660
 that has adopted a fungal lifestyle.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.220
 So it's living like a fungus lives, but it's an animal.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.660
 - Yeah, it does seem like that.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.220
 And actually other marine worms

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.180
 do that kind of dissolving thing, don't they?

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.860
 There's a worm called the zombie worm,

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.220
 which feeds off skeletons of mostly whales

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.700
 by other dead ocean animals at the bottom of the sea.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.620
 And that sends acid out onto the bone,

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.300
 which kind of melts it, well, dissolves it.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.340
 And then they just live inside whale bones

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.100
 for ever and ever.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.940
 - It's incredible.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.780
 - That is really amazing.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.580
 I think I've read that there are some sponges

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.860
 which have been observed feeding on fossils,

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.860
 as in fossilized bones of ancient whales.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.980
 And it's why the fossil record

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.300
 is really patchy in some places.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.900
 It's just 'cause down there, they've been eaten, yeah.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.740
 - I guess, yeah.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.700
 I suppose if bones didn't disintegrate,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.100
 we would just have-

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.940
 - Just be needy.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.420
 - Well, yeah, if you actually like,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.540
 if you looked at the bottom of the ocean,

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.580
 it should just be bones, right?

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.100
 At least one layer.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:51.940
 - Is it really?

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.260
 - Well, they get compressed and compressed over time,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.140
 and they form rock layers, basically.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.740
 I mean, so if you look at short cliffs,

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.020
 that's all the skeletons of the plankton stuff.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.860
 - That's right.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.940
 - So those bones just turn into

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.700
 what everything else turns into, which is mulch.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.860
 - That's true, but I'm talking,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.100
 I think I'm just talking short term.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.060
 Let's say in like a 50 year period,

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.420
 there must be a lot of sea creatures that die

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.340
 that just do a collection of bones,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.780
 but they're being eaten by-

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.900
 - 'Cause these zombie worms,

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.500
 something like that. - Yeah, exactly.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.660
 - Scale worms are another water worm.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.500
 - Oh, yeah.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.220
 - And some of them have this really cool trick.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.780
 So they're a bit like wood lice,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.940
 with the wood lice of the sea.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.740
 So they have these like hard scales around them,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.340
 and that's so if something tries to eat them,

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.620
 they slough off these scales,

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.140
 and the scales end up in the thing's mouth,

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.460
 and they wriggle off.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.300
 - Brilliant.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.540
 - But then sometimes they have scales

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.220
 that produce like bioluminescent light,

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.180
 and so something will try to eat it.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.180
 They slough off the scales in the thing's mouth,

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.660
 and then the thing's mouth is glowing in the dark,

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.420
 and then that thing gets hunted by its predator.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.260
 - So cool.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.020
 - And you're off literally in its face.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.580
 (laughing)

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.420
 - That's clever.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.340
 - Have you heard of the bobbit worm?

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.180
 - Oh, yeah.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.020
 Is that the massive one?

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.180
 - It's huge, yeah.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.500
 It's like 10 feet long.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.860
 It's a iridescent worm.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.900
 It buries its body into the ocean,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.020
 and it sort of just sits there,

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.220
 and it sends out these kind of traps,

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.500
 like five little antennae that just sit there.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.580
 And if a fish comes along,

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.100
 it leaps out, just sort of slithers very quickly,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.780
 and with its jaws,

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.580
 it can snap, because the force is so great,

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.180
 it can slice a fish in half.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.620
 Like it's just like insanely horrible.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.860
 But it then brings it back down into a hole,

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.020
 and they don't fully know what happens next.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.580
 Scientists have not any idea really of what happens next,

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.700
 'cause we haven't been able to study it.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.620
 So they don't know if there's a toxin

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.620
 that goes into the animal,

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.500
 that if they haven't split into two,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.460
 that is still alive,

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.660
 that just then kills it,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.060
 and then they can, you know, ingest it, and so on.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.400
 - Well, so sometimes it's still alive,

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.780
 kind of thing, I don't know how they kill it.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.620
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.300
 Like, sometimes they'll bring something back in

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.620
 that they've just got a good grip on,

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.900
 as opposed to having it sliced.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.660
 And the thought is, is that the name,

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.140
 although no one's fully sure,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.820
 they think John Wayne Bobbet's wife is the inspiration for.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.660
 - I think so.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.620
 - Yeah, I think that is known, isn't it?

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.180
 - I think that wasn't conclusive.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.740
 I think it was a sort of nickname given to it,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.820
 and they sort of,

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.700
 well, at least the places I was reading,

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.940
 saying we're not fully sure,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.780
 because it doesn't do anything to your genitals.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.660
 It's not like it bites your balls off,

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.740
 or it's like, no, it doesn't slice it.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.700
 - So we should say this is a famous case

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.260
 of a couple called John Wayne Bobbet,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.140
 and his wife, Lorena Bobbet,

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.780
 and she cut off his--

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.220
 - Penis. - Yes.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.740
 - And threw it out of a car.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.820
 - Yeah. - Yes.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.420
 - And this isn't what the worm does,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.860
 but it does seem like too much.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.700
 - There's something a bit,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.100
 there's something a bit slicey,

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.540
 and a bit penise-y involved here,

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.980
 'cause it's this worm.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.820
 - Yes.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.300
 - It kind of lives under the sand,

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.740
 and then jumps out and grabs you,

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.780
 a bit like the worms in Dune, really, I think.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.820
 Or, what's that other one, Tremors,

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.300
 a bit like Tremors? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.380
 - It has been compared to the Mongolian Death Worm.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.220
 - Yes, yeah.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.660
 - And here we are, back on stage territory.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.980
 - Doesn't, Dan.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.020
 - It hasn't featured in SpongeBob SquarePants yet,

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.380
 has it, this creature?

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.220
 No.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.140
 - Imagine if, is there an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.380
 where it has one of these bond-dividing worms in it?

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.420
 - SpongeBob Gets Worms, yeah.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.700
 (all laughing)

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.660
 - So a little bit on Godzilla, maybe?

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.740
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.220
 - He is a Japanese citizen.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.060
 (all laughing)

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.420
 - Date of birth, April of 1954.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.980
 Reason for special, he's got special residency.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.820
 - You'd have to.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.740
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.340
 For promoting the entertainment of,

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.900
 and watching over the Kabukicho neighborhood,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.420
 and drawing visitors from around the world.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.020
 Because I know you've been to Japan, Andy.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.740
 Have you seen the giant Godzilla

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.180
 that's sticking out of one of the buildings?

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.020
 - I have not, is it Tokyo? - It's really called

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.740
 next to Shinjuku Station, yeah.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.900
 You're just walking down the street,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.740
 and you turn around,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.380
 and suddenly there's a massive Godzilla

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.660
 sort of looking over you.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.980
 - That's so cool. - Is he watching over?

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.540
 'Cause I thought that he destroyed buildings.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.260
 - Well, he got-- - I mean, yes.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.340
 - He doesn't move because he's just a statue.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.340
 - No, but the idea of Godzilla,

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.100
 the idea of a very destructive creature, right?

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.860
 - I see what you mean, actually.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.740
 - I mean, it's complicated. - He could save you

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.780
 from Mothra, or from whoever this other guy was,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.820
 King Ghidorah. - Ghidorah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.300
 - It's a complicated relationship,

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.260
 because basically, at various points,

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.420
 he's been the goodie and the heel.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.460
 And, you know, if he's fighting King Kong, for example,

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.940
 - What? - He, as he did

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.340
 in the latest, very bad movie.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.300
 - Oh, they're two completely different creatures.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.180
 - Well, you haven't seen King Kong

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.340
 versus Godzilla, have you?

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.300
 And I gotta say, that's two hours.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.580
 I'm never getting back, because it's--

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.540
 - What's it about? - It's a bad, really.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.380
 - It wasn't bad.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.340
 I mean, Kong's skull island is magnificent.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.180
 - Is it? - Yeah.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.140
 - Yeah, you keep telling me that.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.700
 - But basically, Godzilla can be a goodie and baddie.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.780
 I mean, very, very destructive of property.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.620
 - Thank you. - Yes.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.460
 - Thank you, back to that.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.860
 Okay. - Yeah.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.700
 - He can be angered,

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.420
 but he's never on the side of the humans, right?

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.260
 Or is he?

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.820
 - He's not really on any side.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.500
 - He's on Godzilla side. - He's on Godzilla side, yeah.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.140
 - Does it look like to him?

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.020
 So, does it love story with him?

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.260
 No, that's Kong, isn't it?

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.500
 - "Fade Down Away" in the '33 movie, yeah.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.620
 There's always, yeah, that's the--

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.700
 - Yeah. - That's Kong.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.900
 - That's Kong. - That's Kong, yeah.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.340
 - Or Brie Larson in Kong's skull island, yeah.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.180
 - Sure, okay.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.820
 - And actually, they don't really have a relationship

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.500
 in the same way that Kong and "Fade Down Away" did.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.900
 - I would say, when you're on "Mastermind"

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.340
 and they say, "What's your specialist subject?"

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.820
 If you do choose Kong and Godzilla,

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.180
 don't just give a fucking monologue

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.220
 as soon as he asks his first question,

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.860
 'cause you're gonna run out of time.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.180
 - The thing about Skull Island is, though,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.620
 it's a brilliant Vietnam War metaphor,

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.180
 and the whole mood, it's incredible.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.300
 - I started and finished a long time ago, Andrew.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.880
 (upbeat music)

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.040
 (upbeat music)

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.560
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.160
 and that is my fact.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.760
 My fact this week is that comedian Lenny Bruce

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.300
 was arrested so often during his sets

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.680
 that he would go on stage wearing his coat

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.360
 just so he was ready to leave with the police immediately.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.480
 - Brilliant. - Go on.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.800
 - Yeah, so this is a fact that I learned

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.360
 in a brilliant autobiography

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.760
 that was written by George Carlin,

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.920
 who is also one of the greatest stand-ups

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.760
 that we've ever had.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.680
 It's called "Last Words," highly recommend

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.440
 anyone who's interested in the world of comedy

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.280
 reading it, and this was on a night in 1962

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.000
 when Lenny Bruce was playing at a club

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.560
 called the Gate of Horn, and during the performance,

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.280
 a police officer stood up in the middle of the crowd

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.780
 and he basically shut down the show,

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.960
 and he immediately arrested Bruce,

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.840
 and he tried to take him to jail.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.980
 So, Carlin's bit of this story is that he was upstairs

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.880
 having a drink with another comic,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.920
 and they weren't only just arresting Lenny Bruce,

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.040
 they were also arresting anyone else that they could

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.680
 because they wanted to make a real point

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.920
 about this happening, this gig.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.480
 So they IDed everyone who was at the show

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.880
 to see if there were any minors there

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.980
 to see if they could arrest them,

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.660
 if anyone was too young to be there.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.520
 They arrested the owner and the bartender

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.920
 because drinks were being served during the set,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.080
 which was not allowed,

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.520
 and they ended up arresting as well George Carlin,

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.760
 who was upstairs and refused to give his ID

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.280
 and started making a joke out of it

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.520
 because he was quite drunk.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.200
 So George Carlin ended up in the van,

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.020
 the police van, with Lenny Bruce,

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.600
 and so he was there specifically for this moment.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.880
 Lenny told him he would wear his coat while he was on stage

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.480
 because sometimes the police would just take him out

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.840
 immediately and he wouldn't be able to get his coat,

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.400
 and he loved his coat because it was made

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.000
 from a really nice cashier

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.600
 and he didn't want to be parted with it.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.440
 So that's why he wore it on stage all the time.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.360
 - I saw that he went to prison.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.920
 They bailed him out, right?

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.680
 And he was back on stage by something like 1 a.m.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.960
 for the second show of the night.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.200
 When he was on stage, he did a joke by saying,

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.620
 "I better keep my coat on 'cause I may have to go out again."

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.020
 So he kind of made a point of the arrest as well.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:38.860
 - Yeah.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.540
 - Do we know how long into the set the policeman waited?

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.540
 Did he wait for him to do all his favorite jokes

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.700
 and then stand up or did he just give him 10 seconds?

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.580
 - You wait until he said something really rude.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.620
 - It was, yeah, it was the moment he said something rude.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.900
 So Lenny Bruce is, if you haven't heard of him

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.660
 as the listener of the show, he was a 1960s comedian.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.660
 - The listener, we have more than one listener.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.500
 (laughing)

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.340
 - Sorry, I have one listener.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.460
 The rest of you have millions.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.620
 I've got one dedicated listener.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:06.360
 He was basically, in a way, the first modern

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.640
 stand-up comedian, and there were a lot of comedians

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.760
 before him, obviously, and you can say people like

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.800
 Bob Hope and so on who would go around on stage

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.840
 telling jokes, but they were very much joke merchants.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.280
 They had a team of writers who were writing for them.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.720
 Lenny Bruce was the first person to really talk

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.080
 about his personal life.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.440
 He used swear words.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.080
 He talked like a real person, basically.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.920
 And that's--

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.120
 - It was like stream of consciousness-y type stuff

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.120
 rather than just gag, gag, gag, right?

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.240
 - Yeah, but they were written, it was written material

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.540
 as well, but he was basically counter-culture America.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.140
 He was part of the beat people.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.160
 So Jack Kerouac, who was mentioned before,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.240
 very much part of that scene, and he opened up

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.360
 the whole industry of stand-up to this new way of doing it.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.920
 What came with that is he spoke about

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.160
 very controversial topics.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.120
 He spoke about religion, which he really didn't like.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.820
 He used swear words on stage, which no one was doing

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.800
 at this time, and so he was constantly being arrested

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.380
 for these reasons, and he became a sort of martyr

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.720
 to the whole of the comedy industry, because he--

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.560
 - Yeah.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.380
 - Sorry.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.400
 - Well, no, we should say that he was pardoned as well,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.240
 which is great news.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.880
 So he was convicted of obscenity, but then he was pardoned.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.480
 - In this one, right?

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.440
 - Well, so this is when he was tried in 1964

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.720
 for obscenity and prosecuted, but the good news is

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.200
 that he was pardoned, and it was in 2003

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.040
 that he was pardoned.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.880
 - That's right.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.720
 - He had been dead for nearly 40 years, but.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.680
 There was a petition to cancel it.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.880
 So the governor of New York was George Pataki,

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.340
 who in 2003 granted this posthumous pardon.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.340
 The petition was brought by a couple of comedians

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:37.180
 I'd never heard of, called Tom Smothers and Dick Smothers,

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:41.140
 known as the Smothers Brothers, who themselves were canceled

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.100
 and properly canceled, 'cause they were very lefty,

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.340
 and that was obviously also pretty controversial.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.180
 - Yeah, so he wasn't found guilty in the event

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.620
 that Dan was describing.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.580
 He was got off there.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.260
 His defense compared him to Aristophanes Rabele

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.580
 and Jonathan Swift in the court case,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.400
 and the jury agreed, and they let him off,

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.160
 and then he was later arrested quite a lot of times

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.360
 in lots of different places,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.280
 but in New York was the big famous one,

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.560
 which is what you're talking about, he got.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.120
 - I think I agree with the judge, right?

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.720
 I don't know Rabele, come on, you're not that pretentious,

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.480
 but Aristophanes and Swift, kind of impenetrable,

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.180
 desperate wannabe satirists, apparently genius,

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.120
 but actually not that fun to experience.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.360
 I would say it's quite a good description of Lenny Bruce.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.520
 - Wow. - For me.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.360
 - Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.200
 - For me.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200
 - Jonathan Swift is very funny,

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.060
 and some of the Aristophanes stuff is pretty funny.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.060
 - I love the level, Anna, how can you be at a level

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.020
 where you're pretentious enough to know Aristophanes

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.700
 and Jonathan Swift, but no,

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.940
 I'm not pretentious enough to know Rabele, come on.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.820
 - Well, you all know that's the line, okay?

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.660
 You've crossed the line when you know Rabele.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.100
 - I mean, he represented himself in court at various points,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:48.940
 so that might've been the point

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.780
 where he was being compared to Jonathan Swift

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.140
 and Aristophanes, so he fired his lawyer

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.820
 halfway through this trial, the 1964 one.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.040
 And then the New York law journal

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.280
 refused to publish the judgment

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.160
 because it contained offensive words, so.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.000
 - Right.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.280
 - And then just going back to the original one

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.480
 that you were talking about, Dan,

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.240
 I was reading the newspaper articles

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.880
 from the day and from the day after and stuff,

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.800
 and he did his second show,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.040
 and then he went back to his hotel, the Clifft Hotel,

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.720
 and then he got kicked out of his hotel

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.440
 because the hotel owner had heard about him being arrested

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.400
 and didn't want his like in his hotel,

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.200
 and so he just got kicked out into the street.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.160
 And as a result from then on,

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.140
 he performed always with a small suitcase on stage.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.380
 (laughing)

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.380
 - He did like a spot of morphine, heroin, yes,

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.860
 and actually he was ejected from another hotel once

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.420
 for blocking its toilet with heroin needles.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.260
 - Oh.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.100
 - Or for blocking its toilet with needles.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.100
 - That's one of needles, isn't it?

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.260
 (laughing)

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.540
 It's not like toilet roll, it's like.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.100
 - I think maybe it only takes a couple of needles

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.460
 to block a loo, I've never, never tried it,

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.540
 but there was another time he was, I promise.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.260
 (laughing)

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.380
 - We've been on tour with you,

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.000
 we know you are a needle toilet blocker.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.840
 The number of Premier Inns we've been unceremoniously kicked

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.680
 out of.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.920
 - I'm sorry about that, but I have changed.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.040
 He was another thing I do on tour, actually.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.760
 He was kicked out of another hotel

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.720
 for apparently conducting a nocturnal trio of blondes

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.040
 in an original composition, the chorus of which ran,

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.640
 please fuck me, Lenny, in three-part harmony.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.300
 - Oh, wow, in harmony.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.140
 - In harmony.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.540
 - Actually, at a Premier In, you wouldn't be allowed

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.540
 to do that, 'cause they have the good night's sleep policy.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.880
 (laughing)

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.100
 - Or the sign saying, shh, our corridors.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.140
 - That's why it's Lenny Henry who's the mascot

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.220
 and not Lenny Bruce.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.560
 - It was a top-up, wasn't it?

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.300
 (laughing)

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.060
 - But yeah, he had a big old sexual appetite

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.500
 and he married a stripper called Honey Harlow.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.340
 - Yes.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.340
 - But as you say, Anna, like you don't think he's funny

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.500
 and a lot of people absolutely agree with you.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.920
 He has to be looked at as someone who is just the person

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.680
 who paved the way and who, you know, Richard Pryor,

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.920
 who is seen by many as the funniest person ever,

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.040
 says that Lenny Bruce was the funniest person ever.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.360
 George Carlin as well, Lenny Bruce was the funniest person

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.200
 ever.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.680
 Modern day comedians like Mark Marron, Lenny Bruce,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.520
 funniest person ever.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.360
 - Yeah, I respect him a lot.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.000
 - Michael McIntyre, you can see the influence so much

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.420
 in McIntyre's material.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.480
 But they did, they did a, on the 50th.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.240
 - I like to just say I like Michael McIntyre.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.720
 I don't even know why I said that.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.200
 It's just the first day that came into my head.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.080
 - They're just not similar.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.420
 - However much you like either of them,

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.220
 I don't think Michael McIntyre would claim

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.560
 that he's taking after Lenny Bruce.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.260
 - I'm just saying if Michael McIntyre was beyond

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.620
 his BBC primetime show, I'm sorry.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.700
 (all laughing)

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.900
 - But he does block a lot of hotel toilets

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.420
 with heroin needles, that's the McIntyre thing, isn't it?

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.940
 It's kind of his trademark, yeah.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.860
 - But on the 50th anniversary of his death,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.860
 they did a screening of one of his recorded stand-up shows

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.980
 to an audience of fans and just to, you know,

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.920
 commemorate him, it was 40 minutes of jokes

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.880
 and hardly anyone laughed according to the article.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.380
 And that makes sense, he was a, he was a conscience.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.400
 - He's the one that you go, when you're watching him,

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.160
 you go, ah, you sort of smile and you're like, oh.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.800
 - I like Stuart Lee.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.840
 - That's certainly a bit of Stuart Lee to him.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.680
 (all laughing)

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.520
 - Is there anyone left?

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.400
 - Let's just destroy anyone we might work with in the future.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.160
 - There was a brilliant article in Playboy

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.800
 that he, that was quoting him in 1963

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.760
 and he was talking about when he was going on stage

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.900
 and the owner decided to introduce him

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.100
 but was really worried that he was gonna get a bad reaction.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.780
 And so the owner said, "Ladies and gentlemen,

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.300
 the star of our show, Lenny Bruce,

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.980
 who incidentally is the next GI

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.860
 and a hell of a good performer, folks.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.560
 And he's a great kidder, you know what I mean?

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.980
 It's just a bunch of silliness.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.980
 He doesn't mean what he says.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.940
 The kids and the Pope and the Jewish religion, honestly.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.740
 It's just a make-believe world, it's fine.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.340
 He's a hell of a nice guy, folks.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.140
 And he was at a veterans' hospital today

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.620
 doing a show for the boys.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.120
 And here he is, by the way, his mom's out there tonight too.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.760
 She hasn't seen him in a couple of years

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.560
 and she lives here in the town.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.200
 Now, it jokes a joke, right, folks?

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.240
 What the hell?

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.200
 I wish she'd try and cooperate.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.040
 And whoever has been sticking ice picks

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.480
 in the tires outside, that's not funny.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.320
 - Is this real?

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.160
 That's real?

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.480
 That's the best intro ever.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.320
 - That's really good.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.080
 - I feel like he must have written it for the video.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.200
 - That's so good.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.920
 - His mom, interestingly, was his main inspiration.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.560
 And she was really awesome.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.940
 And she was this woman called Sally Ma.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.820
 And she was a stand-up comedian,

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.220
 well, before stand-up was a thing, really,

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.820
 in the '30s and '40s.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.420
 And she did impersonations, I think,

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.260
 was part of her comedy.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.780
 Like, she impersonated Humphrey Bogart

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.940
 and James Cagney and people like that.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.100
 And she--

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.300
 - She introduced him on stage for his first ever show.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.140
 - Oh, did she?

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.180
 - Well, his first big break, he was in a radio show

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.900
 called Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.500
 And she was the hype woman for him.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.580
 - She was a manager, also, later in her career.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.420
 - Yes.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.280
 - So she managed, who I did not know

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.440
 was a stand-up comedian.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.320
 But the man who played Mr. Miyagi

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.400
 from the Karate Kid movies, Pat Morito,

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.600
 was a stand-up before he became a sort of

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.600
 more serious actor.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.040
 And yeah, she managed him.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.880
 - Really?

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.720
 - Yeah.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.560
 - He had a brief act, didn't he?

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.760
 Walks on, walks off.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.920
 - Beautiful.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.560
 That is beautiful.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.400
 - Lenny Bruce, actually, he only ever performed

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.360
 once in the UK.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.320
 It was in London.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.400
 And it was on Greek Street in central London in Soho.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.800
 And it was at the Establishment Club,

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.620
 which was created by Peter Cook of Beyond the Fringe.

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.900
 And it was, the Establishment was set up basically

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.100
 because they wanted to try and give acts the opportunity

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.540
 to try the stuff that was censored.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.860
 At this point in the UK, if you were performing,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.060
 it was part of a theater show.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.020
 And the Lord Chamberlain had veto over every script

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.940
 that would be performed.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.900
 So they'd go through it and say,

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.580
 "You can't say this and you can't say this."

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.180
 But in private establishments, you were allowed to do that.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.540
 And so Peter Cook set up this place.

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.880
 And that is how Lenny Bruce came to the UK

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.600
 for his one and only trip

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.240
 because he was deported the second time around.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.040
 He wasn't allowed in.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.440
 And by all accounts, it was quite a bad run of gigs.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.160
 He was pretty ill at that point in terms of the drug taking.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.040
 This story you mentioned about the women and the syringes

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.040
 that was in London, where that happened.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.560
 And Peter Cook himself, who was a massive fan of his,

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.520
 went and picked him up from the airport.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.860
 And he said that he just met this shambling guy

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.780
 coming out at the arrivals.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.420
 He got into the car

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.660
 and he was holding a record player,

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.660
 a sort of miniature tape recorder.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.580
 And he insisted on playing his tapes

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.220
 all the way on the journey back.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.260
 And the tapes consisted of nothing but airplane noises

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.140
 and grunting and farting.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:28.980
 That was it.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.340
 And Peter Cook just saw what the hell is going on here.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.980
 And yeah, and so he came and he performed in London.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.300
 - What was going on?

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.140
 - He doesn't really know.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.900
 Like Peter Cook, just basically what he had

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.500
 was a junkie in the back of the car.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.680
 - I don't know, is that classic junkie behavior,

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.700
 playing fart noises over a tape player,

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.340
 which I haven't been invented yet, but.

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.580
 - But he might've been, like there was,

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.980
 there's accounts of Lenny Bruce making car stops

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.660
 'cause he's sort of like a field of flowers

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.060
 just so he could run and lay in them

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.180
 and then get back in the car.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.500
 And they didn't realize at the time he was doing heroin.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.180
 And that was, that was him just.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.500
 - It was a field of poppies.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.180
 (all laughing)

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.760
 (upbeat music)

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:09.280
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.240
 That's all of our facts.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.560

 which is now selling online.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.840
 It's a sort of history of fish

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.240
 with lots of random fun things.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.080
 Check it out. - By the way,

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.600
 when you say fish, it's us.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.040
 It's not like a history of the sea or the ab.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:47.880
 - No, no, no.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.560
 I've uploaded my new fish book.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.400
 Yeah, turns out there is such a thing.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.400
 So yeah, no, do check that out and come back next week.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.240

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.560
 and we'll see you then.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.900
 Goodbye.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.480

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.180

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.760
