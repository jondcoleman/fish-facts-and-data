00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:26,00:00:29,James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:29,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:33,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:33,00:00:37,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:00:40,00:00:42,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:00:42,00:00:47,"in the 1920 Winter Olympics, US skater, Teresa Weld,"
00:00:47,00:00:51,was the only woman in the figure skating who performed jumps.
00:00:51,00:00:54,But she was marked down every time she did
00:00:54,00:00:57,"because her skirt rose above her knees,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,which was considered too scandalous.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"- Mm, did she have pants on?"
00:01:01,00:01:03,(laughing)
00:01:03,00:01:05,- You can't tell if it's got rises above the knees.
00:01:05,00:01:06,- Depends how long the pants are.
00:01:06,00:01:08,"- Yeah, possibly they could be like bloomers."
00:01:08,00:01:11,"- Yeah, they did wear pants down to the knees back then."
00:01:11,00:01:14,"- So it sounds very sexy, James."
00:01:14,00:01:15,- Oh yeah.
00:01:15,00:01:16,- And clearly it was at the time.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"- Yeah, it depends when about she were."
00:01:18,00:01:20,"If she wore what she was wearing then,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"now in the Winter Olympics,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,"like just to show behind the curtain,"
00:01:24,00:01:25,we're actually recording this
00:01:25,00:01:27,when the Winter Olympics is on.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"And you're gonna hear this in the spring, but..."
00:01:29,00:01:30,- Sounds like she was showing people
00:01:30,00:01:34,why in the curtain of her dress.
00:01:34,00:01:35,- Yeah?
00:01:35,00:01:36,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:36,00:01:37,- Wow.
00:01:37,00:01:38,(laughing)
00:01:38,00:01:40,- Andy's drunk just so everyone knows.
00:01:40,00:01:42,(laughing)
00:01:42,00:01:44,"- But yeah, she would have worn a skirt"
00:01:44,00:01:46,that was kind of round the ankles at the time
00:01:46,00:01:47,because that's the way that women--
00:01:47,00:01:49,- She wouldn't have worn her skirt around her ankles.
00:01:49,00:01:50,She wouldn't have worn a skirt.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"- That does lose you points actually, yeah."
00:01:52,00:01:54,(laughing)
00:01:54,00:01:55,"- It was round her ankles,"
00:01:55,00:01:58,"but also round her calves, and her knees,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,"and her thighs, and her bum."
00:01:59,00:02:01,"- Yes, and that is the normal way"
00:02:01,00:02:02,of describing the length skirt.
00:02:02,00:02:05,(laughing)
00:02:05,00:02:07,"- And yeah, this is the way that basically"
00:02:07,00:02:09,"until the 20s and 30s,"
00:02:09,00:02:13,women figure skaters would wear long dresses.
00:02:13,00:02:14,- That's amazing.
00:02:14,00:02:16,- And it was only when a very famous skater
00:02:16,00:02:17,called Sonja Haney came along
00:02:17,00:02:20,and she was only 11 when she started to compete.
00:02:20,00:02:21,"And 'cause she was a child,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,she could get away with wearing like children's clothes.
00:02:23,00:02:26,"- Right, sorry, I thought she'd get away"
00:02:26,00:02:27,with wearing much sexier stuff.
00:02:27,00:02:28,(laughing)
00:02:28,00:02:32,"- Well, she didn't have to wear full adult long dresses,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"and she could do these amazing jumps,"
00:02:34,00:02:38,and then all of the adult skaters had to wear a short skirt
00:02:38,00:02:40,so that they could keep up with her amazing skills.
00:02:40,00:02:43,"- So, what was the skating like"
00:02:43,00:02:46,if Theresa Weld was the only person doing jumps?
00:02:46,00:02:48,What were the others doing in their show-off with skating?
00:02:48,00:02:50,"- Well, it's called figure skating,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,so they were doing figures mostly.
00:02:52,00:02:54,- Like carving out shapes in the ice.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"- Yeah, exactly, not so much carving out"
00:02:56,00:02:59,so that you could then pull it out and there's a shape there.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- The last person always fell through, didn't they?"
00:03:01,00:03:03,Once you connected the lines.
00:03:03,00:03:04,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:03:04,00:03:06,"So, what you would do is you would do the shapes"
00:03:06,00:03:10,"of a figure of eight, or at the very start of figure skating,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,"someone would shout out what figure they wanted you to do,"
00:03:12,00:03:15,"so they'd shout out, you know, snowman,"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"and then you'd have to do a shape of a snowman,"
00:03:17,00:03:18,and then they'd shout out something else
00:03:18,00:03:19,and you'd have to do that.
00:03:19,00:03:20,- That's really cool.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"- But really in the olden days,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,"figure skating, especially for women,"
00:03:23,00:03:24,wasn't about the jumps.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"It was about doing something graceful,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"doing lots of shapes and stuff like that,"
00:03:28,00:03:32,"and then when this woman came in, Teresa Weld,"
00:03:32,00:03:33,"she was the first to do the jumps,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"and then before long, everyone was doing jumps,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,and now they're doing kick-ass jumps.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- Yeah, and the jumps sort of took over in a way"
00:03:39,00:03:43,"because in television terms, drawing these circles"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"into the ice wasn't as televisual for the Olympics,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,so it'd usually be 60% or so of the mark
00:03:48,00:03:50,that you would get was for the figures
00:03:50,00:03:52,"that you were creating in the ice,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,and they just sort of thought that's a bit crap.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"- It sounds incredible, the process,"
00:03:55,00:03:58,"because it was ended about 30 years ago, wasn't it?"
00:03:58,00:03:59,"They stopped having actual figures,"
00:03:59,00:04:00,"so I read a bit about that,"
00:04:00,00:04:04,"and the judging took such a long time,"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"so there were 41 different figures at the start of it,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"which you would have to be able to master,"
00:04:09,00:04:12,"but the judges would examine the skating three times,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,as in they'd examine the shapes on the ice.
00:04:14,00:04:16,They would get down on their stomachs like detectives
00:04:16,00:04:20,"to tell if there was a slight variation in the line,"
00:04:20,00:04:21,or detectives.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- It was, generally it was only detectives"
00:04:23,00:04:24,getting their stomachs in the prime scenes.
00:04:24,00:04:25,- It was like forensics.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- What they used to do,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,they would skate the shape of a dead body
00:04:28,00:04:29,with the name of the ice.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- That was figure 37, yeah, yeah."
00:04:31,00:04:34,"No, apparently the judging could last up to eight hours,"
00:04:34,00:04:37,"which sounds, I read an article from the Dutch Beagle,"
00:04:37,00:04:38,"the German thing,"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"and it was saying, it was from the '80s,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,"just before it ended,"
00:04:41,00:04:42,"and it was like, this is so boring."
00:04:42,00:04:46,- There was a guy called George Anderson
00:04:46,00:04:48,"who wrote a skating book in the 1860s,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"and he wrote that after the shamrock,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,a one foot figure requiring three turns
00:04:53,00:04:55,"and two changes of edge,"
00:04:55,00:04:59,the acme of female accomplishment has now been reached.
00:04:59,00:05:00,- Wow.
00:05:00,00:05:01,"- So he's like, once you've done the shamrock,"
00:05:01,00:05:03,"there's literally nothing better than that, true?"
00:05:03,00:05:05,- Downhill ever since.
00:05:05,00:05:07,All these quintuple spins.
00:05:07,00:05:12,- One of the early guys who sort of turned figure skating
00:05:12,00:05:13,into the sort of art that it is now
00:05:13,00:05:15,was a guy called Jackson Haynes.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"He was from New York, born in 1840s,"
00:05:17,00:05:19,"and he started, he was the person"
00:05:19,00:05:22,who kind of turned it into more of a dance.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"You know, he was trained in ballet,"
00:05:24,00:05:28,"and he took popular dances like the waltz,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,and he turned that into what you would do on the ice.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"And he did this in America, and they hated it there,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"so he came over to Europe,"
00:05:34,00:05:35,"and he started performing it here,"
00:05:35,00:05:36,"and they loved it here,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,and he performed to royalty.
00:05:38,00:05:41,But I've been reading into banned things
00:05:41,00:05:43,that would get you deducted points
00:05:43,00:05:44,or that you're not allowed to do it all.
00:05:44,00:05:45,And one of the things in modern times
00:05:45,00:05:48,is you're not allowed same sex couples
00:05:48,00:05:53,when you do Olympic or even any sort of official skating.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"And it turns out that the very first pairing,"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"which is with Jackson Haynes, was a same sex couple."
00:05:59,00:05:59,- Was it?
00:05:59,00:06:00,- Yeah.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"- Well, he was dancing with another guy."
00:06:01,00:06:02,"- Yeah, he was dancing with another guy."
00:06:02,00:06:03,It was in Vienna.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"It was called Franz Bellasi,"
00:06:04,00:06:06,"and they were the first ever couple,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,and he's held up actually as a result
00:06:08,00:06:10,as a sort of LGBT pioneer.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"- Is he, are we sure they weren't doing"
00:06:12,00:06:14,the same sex couple just 'cause it was so regressive
00:06:14,00:06:16,that women weren't allowed to do figure skating?
00:06:16,00:06:17,Was it that they were a--
00:06:17,00:06:18,"- No, I think--"
00:06:18,00:06:19,"- Progressive, progressive."
00:06:19,00:06:21,"You know, at a certain point in the circle"
00:06:21,00:06:23,that they're the same?
00:06:23,00:06:25,"That's possible, although he's sort of been embraced"
00:06:25,00:06:28,by the community of sort of being progressive.
00:06:28,00:06:30,- Was it the tango that was also like that originally?
00:06:30,00:06:32,"- Just really, all male."
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Yeah, there was one dance,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,"I can't remember whether it was flamenco or tango,"
00:06:35,00:06:38,"or there was a huge dance craze, which was men only,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,that we think of as a mixed-sex dance these days.
00:06:40,00:06:41,- Right.
00:06:41,00:06:42,- It was classically meant to be that.
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"- And it was as well that Haynes wasn't,"
00:06:45,00:06:47,he was dressed as a bear at the time.
00:06:47,00:06:48,"- Oh, was he?"
00:06:48,00:06:52,"- Yeah, wasn't strictly two men dancing together."
00:06:52,00:06:53,- I think that is still strictly--
00:06:53,00:06:54,(laughing)
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- Well, yeah."
00:06:56,00:06:58,"I mean, if only strictly was like that."
00:06:58,00:07:00,"- Dan, do you watch the Masked Singer"
00:07:00,00:07:03,"and you go, ""Well, obviously it's an actual robot bunny."""
00:07:03,00:07:05,"I mean, I don't know what they're talking about,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,"celebrities, this is clearly a big pile of donuts."
00:07:08,00:07:10,"- I'm afraid you are disqualified, it's a human only."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"- Human only, sorry."
00:07:12,00:07:15,"- So women, women skating was a kind of a thing,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,or women competing anyway in figure skating.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"And it was actually because of the clothes,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,these long dresses that they weren't allowed to take part
00:07:21,00:07:23,in the world championships.
00:07:23,00:07:25,So there was basically only men
00:07:25,00:07:27,"who entered figure skating contests for ages,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,"and it just wasn't really, didn't occur to people"
00:07:29,00:07:31,"that a woman might enter, so they didn't ban it."
00:07:31,00:07:34,And then this amazing skater called Madge Sires
00:07:34,00:07:38,"entered in 1902, the world figure skating championships."
00:07:38,00:07:41,"And she got silver, and there was lots of reports"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"saying she should have got gold,"
00:07:43,00:07:46,"and actually the winner was a guy called Ulrich Salko,"
00:07:46,00:07:49,"and he offered her his gold medal, 'cause he said,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"""I think you were actually the deserving winner,"
00:07:51,00:07:52,"""you were better than I was."""
00:07:52,00:07:54,"But anyway, then the judges are like,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"""Oh, bummer, we weren't supposed to have women in this,"
00:07:56,00:07:57,"""what are we gonna do?"""
00:07:57,00:07:59,And so they went through all the problems
00:07:59,00:08:00,"with having women figure skate,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"and they basically said it was things like,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,"""The problem with it is that a judge might judge a girl"
00:08:04,00:08:05,"""on how much he's attracted to her,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"""rather than how good she is at skating."""
00:08:07,00:08:09,"- There's definitely a problem with the female skater,"
00:08:09,00:08:11,rather than with the judges there.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, get her off the ice."
00:08:13,00:08:15,"But the other thing was, 'cause their dresses are so long,"
00:08:15,00:08:16,"you can't see their feet,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,so they could be doing anything under there.
00:08:18,00:08:19,"They could be cheating, they could have five feet,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,they could have a child under there.
00:08:21,00:08:21,- They could have a child under there.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"- Yeah, yeah, like have a snobberbill."
00:08:23,00:08:25,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:08:25,00:08:26,"- What do you think is like sneaking into a cinema,"
00:08:26,00:08:29,where it's sort of sitting on top of a lot of the code?
00:08:29,00:08:31,"- Three kids in a code, and they can't let"
00:08:31,00:08:32,that kind of thing get through.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"And so to be fair to Matt, she did say,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"""Well, I'm very happy to wear a shorter skirt."""
00:08:36,00:08:37,"But then obviously she couldn't do that either,"
00:08:37,00:08:39,so it was really rocking a hard place.
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- Right, although while we're on men and women skating,"
00:08:41,00:08:44,the patron saint of figure skating is a woman.
00:08:44,00:08:46,"Saint Lidwina, you heard of her?"
00:08:46,00:08:47,"- Yeah, no."
00:08:47,00:08:48,"- She was a Dutch teenager, 'cause you know"
00:08:48,00:08:51,"there are lots of canals and things in the Netherlands,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,"and they are from Friesey,"
00:08:52,00:08:53,but there are lots of skating happens on them.
00:08:53,00:08:56,And I think this was in the 13th century.
00:08:56,00:08:59,"Anyway, she was skating, she fell, she broke her leg,"
00:08:59,00:09:00,and she never recovered.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"And as a result, she's the patron saint of figure skating."
00:09:03,00:09:04,- Right.
00:09:04,00:09:05,- I'm not completely sure why.
00:09:05,00:09:06,- When was she around?
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- 13th, a long time ago, several hundred years ago."
00:09:08,00:09:09,"And it was, it sounds quite stressful."
00:09:09,00:09:13,"There aren't, they think she might have had something"
00:09:13,00:09:15,"that we'd recognize as a modern condition today,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"maybe the first ever case of MS,"
00:09:17,00:09:21,but also the saintly accounts are so strange and exaggerated.
00:09:21,00:09:22,It's kind of hard to diagnose.
00:09:22,00:09:25,"So for example, large pieces of her body fell off,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,"blood poured from her mouth, ears, and nose."
00:09:28,00:09:31,"She shed bones, skin, and part of her intestines,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,and her parents kept them in a vase.
00:09:33,00:09:34,And they gave off--
00:09:34,00:09:35,- That's not MS.
00:09:35,00:09:36,(laughing)
00:09:36,00:09:37,- And they gave off an incredible--
00:09:37,00:09:40,- That's the walking dead to what you're describing.
00:09:40,00:09:42,- Her parents kept these bits of her body in a vase
00:09:42,00:09:43,"and they gave off a sweet odor,"
00:09:43,00:09:44,so they knew she was holy.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"- Oh, the odor of sanctity."
00:09:46,00:09:47,"- Yeah, exactly, so it's holy."
00:09:47,00:09:48,"Anyway, so--"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"- Wait, is she still alive while this is happening?"
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:51,00:09:53,"- What, while her intestines are in the vase?"
00:09:53,00:09:56,"- I think, from the account I read, yes."
00:09:56,00:09:56,"- Well, I was gonna say,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,doesn't it sound like she's very good at skating
00:09:58,00:09:58,if she broke her leg?
00:09:58,00:10:01,"But to be honest, if she's missing half of her body parts,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,"it sounds like, well done to her for getting up"
00:10:03,00:10:04,in the morning.
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- She never skated again, anyway."
00:10:07,00:10:08,(laughing)
00:10:08,00:10:09,- Wow.
00:10:09,00:10:11,- That's very funny.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"- You still get costume infringements, don't you,"
00:10:14,00:10:14,in skating?
00:10:14,00:10:15,I hadn't realized this.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"In fact, I knew very little about figure skating,"
00:10:17,00:10:18,but you can get points docked
00:10:18,00:10:20,for wearing the wrong stuff now.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"Well, you used to be able to,"
00:10:22,00:10:25,"until I think about less than 20 years ago,"
00:10:25,00:10:28,it used to be that women couldn't wear skirts
00:10:28,00:10:31,"that came up above the bum or the hips,"
00:10:31,00:10:31,so you had to wear a skirt.
00:10:31,00:10:32,- Above the bum?
00:10:32,00:10:33,"- Yeah, so sorry, you had to--"
00:10:33,00:10:36,"- Too sexy, that's so sexy, it's above the bum."
00:10:36,00:10:38,"That was just having a bum out, wasn't it?"
00:10:38,00:10:39,- Hang on.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"- I don't wanna sound like a prude,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,but I do think there are some good reasons why.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"- I think every now and then,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,"the phrase, ""You're not going out looking like that,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"""you're bleeding"" is appropriate."
00:10:48,00:10:52,I've misspoken.
00:10:52,00:10:55,They had to wear skirts and they had to be below the bum.
00:10:55,00:10:57,I should have said it like that.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"Yeah, so you would be fined--"
00:10:59,00:11:00,- So you'd have to cover the bum?
00:11:00,00:11:02,- You had to cover the bum.
00:11:02,00:11:02,You'd have a point docked.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"- Well, you don't anymore, you can wear a leotard, can't you?"
00:11:05,00:11:05,- Yes.
00:11:05,00:11:06,"- Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:06,00:11:08,But your bum is not fully out.
00:11:08,00:11:11,There's no mooning at the Olympics.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"- I don't know what the rules are on that,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,but I think you have to cover the genitals.
00:11:15,00:11:16,- And you think you might get jumped
00:11:16,00:11:18,as one of those detectives.
00:11:18,00:11:20,(all laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:23,- What a finishing move that would be for your routine.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"Lots of jumps, lots of spins,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,and a full moon at the end of it.
00:11:26,00:11:28,(all laughing)
00:11:28,00:11:30,"- Suck it, guys."
00:11:30,00:11:31,"- So on infringements, there was someone"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"at the 2018 Winter Olympics called Gabriela Papadakis,"
00:11:35,00:11:39,"whose nipple fell out during her performance, right?"
00:11:39,00:11:40,- A Jackson moment.
00:11:40,00:11:41,- A Jackson moment.
00:11:41,00:11:42,- When you say fell out.
00:11:42,00:11:45,"- It just, it didn't fall off her body like that."
00:11:45,00:11:47,"- They said an argument, they fell out,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"and-- - It smelled sweet, though."
00:11:49,00:11:50,It had the odor of sanctity.
00:11:50,00:11:53,- The detectives rushed onto the ice to collect it.
00:11:53,00:11:54,- And put it in a jar.
00:11:54,00:11:56,- It came out of her costume.
00:11:56,00:11:59,"And it looks, it's like your worst nightmare,"
00:11:59,00:12:00,but also you're getting point stocks.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"Not only have you exposed yourself in national television,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,you also get points deducted.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"They still got silver, impressively."
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Have you heard of the job
00:12:07,00:12:11,of the Olympic figure skating poo wrangler?
00:12:11,00:12:12,- Jesus Christ.
00:12:12,00:12:13,- No.
00:12:13,00:12:13,- No.
00:12:13,00:12:16,- Is it surely the detective can double up?
00:12:16,00:12:17,(all laughing)
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Take a scoop on.
00:12:18,00:12:20,- What on earth could this be?
00:12:20,00:12:23,"Oh, I know, is it about Hanyu, the Japanese guy?"
00:12:23,00:12:24,"- Yes, it is."
00:12:24,00:12:25,"- I do know that, yeah."
00:12:25,00:12:27,"- So this is a skater, he's called,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,"yeah, he's Japanese, he's called Yuzuru Hanyu,"
00:12:29,00:12:31,and he's associated with Winnie the Pooh.
00:12:31,00:12:33,"As in, he loves Winnie the Pooh,"
00:12:33,00:12:35,"and his fans, as a result, love Winnie the Pooh too."
00:12:35,00:12:36,"And whenever he skates,"
00:12:36,00:12:40,they throw Winnie the Pooh stuffed toys onto the ice.
00:12:40,00:12:42,- That sounds like it would ruin your routine.
00:12:42,00:12:43,- They throw hundreds.
00:12:43,00:12:44,It's insane.
00:12:44,00:12:46,"And there was a job at the last,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,"I don't know if it's at every single Olympics,"
00:12:48,00:12:52,"but basically there has to be someone who skates around,"
00:12:52,00:12:53,scooping up the Winnie the Poohs.
00:12:53,00:12:54,- Right.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- And shoving them into a huge golf park.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"- I watched Hanyu in this Olympics,"
00:12:57,00:12:58,and there was no Winnie the Poohs there.
00:12:58,00:13:00,So maybe because of COVID?
00:13:00,00:13:04,"- So, well, Xi Jinping is compared,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,Xi Jinping hates being compared to Winnie the Pooh.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"- I forgot about that, yes."
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- For some reason, for such a powerful guy,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,he's pretty thin-skinned about this.
00:13:12,00:13:14,He doesn't like being compared to Winnie the Pooh.
00:13:14,00:13:17,"And yeah, and so it wouldn't be a big problem."
00:13:17,00:13:20,"Fortunately, foreign spectators have not been allowed"
00:13:20,00:13:22,into China for this Olympics.
00:13:22,00:13:24,So no Winnie the Poohs have been chucked on.
00:13:24,00:13:26,- Hanyu's fans are super crazy.
00:13:26,00:13:29,"Like, they literally, they're called fan news,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,and they go around the world just following.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"Like, if they can get tickets anywhere,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,they'll go on eBay for thousands of pounds.
00:13:34,00:13:37,"Like, he's really, really super famous in Japan, yeah."
00:13:37,00:13:38,"- Well, what's weird is,"
00:13:38,00:13:40,"I've been to a few sporting events recently,"
00:13:40,00:13:41,"and in most cases these days,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,you get checked as you're coming in
00:13:43,00:13:44,to these sort of bigger ones.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"You have to, you know, if you go even see gigs"
00:13:46,00:13:48,"at like the O2, there's a metal detector and so on."
00:13:48,00:13:49,- Right.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"- Surely that's the spot to put the Pooh wrangler,"
00:13:52,00:13:52,"you know, to..."
00:13:52,00:13:54,(laughing)
00:13:54,00:13:57,- But I think normally when it's not happening in a state
00:13:57,00:13:59,where the totalitarian head of state
00:13:59,00:14:01,is compared to Winnie the Pooh and hates it.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"- I'm not talking about current Beijing,"
00:14:03,00:14:04,I'm talking about any other...
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- I think they're fine with it, I like that."
00:14:06,00:14:07,- So they're fine with it.
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- Yeah, it's fun, yeah."
00:14:08,00:14:11,"- I think surely not at an Olympic level,"
00:14:11,00:14:12,"if you're going for gold, he'd be really annoyed."
00:14:12,00:14:13,Surely they'd hold back then.
00:14:13,00:14:15,- It's not at him on the ice.
00:14:15,00:14:16,- Oh.
00:14:16,00:14:18,- It's onto the ice while he's performing.
00:14:18,00:14:19,- It's after he's finished.
00:14:19,00:14:20,"- It's after he's finished, yeah, yeah."
00:14:20,00:14:20,"- Okay, 'cause they're really off-putting."
00:14:20,00:14:21,"- It's not mid-routine, yeah."
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Okay.
00:14:22,00:14:25,- But it is apparently off-putting for his opponent.
00:14:25,00:14:28,"So Nathan Chen, who's the other really amazing"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"figure skater male, his manager hates it."
00:14:30,00:14:32,His manager thinks it's like psychological warfare
00:14:32,00:14:33,against him.
00:14:33,00:14:35,- He's jealous 'cause he wants a teddy.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"That's so sad, 'cause that's from Djokovic's behavior."
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- I wonder if he's been trying to push his own thing,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"like Trolls or My Little Pony, he's like, ""Come on."""
00:14:41,00:14:43,(laughing)
00:14:43,00:14:46,- One sad Troll thrown by his manager at this point.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"- So the whole thing about the couples doing their dances,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,"I was reading this article where it sort of says,"
00:14:51,00:14:52,"obviously the choreography is amazing,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,but also what they want is emotion
00:14:54,00:14:56,and they want to feel a routine.
00:14:56,00:14:59,And so a love story tends to be the thing
00:14:59,00:15:00,that you kind of go for.
00:15:00,00:15:04,"And so a problem that siblings have is that they obviously,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,it's a bit off if you see a brother and sister
00:15:07,00:15:08,kind of doing sort of that.
00:15:08,00:15:11,So they have a really odd position where they have to come up
00:15:11,00:15:14,with slightly kookier routines as a result
00:15:14,00:15:17,because they can't be seen to be like almost kissing
00:15:17,00:15:18,at the end of a routine.
00:15:18,00:15:19,- There was one in this Olympics.
00:15:19,00:15:21,I'm not sure if it was brother and sister.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"It probably wasn't, but one of them was in the alien"
00:15:23,00:15:27,and the other one was someone being probed.
00:15:27,00:15:29,(laughing)
00:15:29,00:15:31,"- It would still be too sexy for brother and sister,"
00:15:31,00:15:32,I think.
00:15:32,00:15:35,- You get the Benny Hill music playing.
00:15:35,00:15:37,One of them chasing the other one with a probe
00:15:37,00:15:39,has 10 points for me.
00:15:39,00:15:40,- It's not interesting.
00:15:40,00:15:42,"They've never tried the Benny Hill music, to my knowledge."
00:15:42,00:15:45,(laughing)
00:15:45,00:15:48,"- Too sexual, that's the problem."
00:15:48,00:15:50,"- One of the most famous figure skaters of all time,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,"Tonya Harding, at least one of the most infamous."
00:15:53,00:15:54,I was reading up on her.
00:15:54,00:15:56,I never saw that movie with Margot Robbie.
00:15:56,00:15:57,- Eitania.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"- Eitania, yeah, but what a pretty extraordinary life"
00:16:00,00:16:02,that she's led even post her career.
00:16:02,00:16:05,So she got banned as a result of a controversy
00:16:05,00:16:09,where she was implicated in harming another skater.
00:16:09,00:16:10,What was her name?
00:16:10,00:16:11,Nancy Kerrigan.
00:16:11,00:16:12,"- Neat capping nose, no, it was a breeze."
00:16:12,00:16:14,- It was her ex-husband hired someone to do it
00:16:14,00:16:17,and what came out through court cases was that
00:16:17,00:16:20,"maybe she had an inkling that this was gonna happen,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,that they were planning something.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"That's got her a lifetime ban, basically."
00:16:24,00:16:27,"But post this happening, she released a sex tape."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"It was a sort of leaked sex tape,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"but then she went to Penthouse, I think it was,"
00:16:31,00:16:32,"and they were playboy and said,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"""You can officially release it for a man of money."""
00:16:34,00:16:37,She became a manager for Pro Wrestlers.
00:16:37,00:16:39,She became herself a boxer.
00:16:39,00:16:39,She did boxing.
00:16:39,00:16:41,She started a band called the Golden Blades.
00:16:41,00:16:43,They got booed off stage on their
00:16:43,00:16:44,first gig. - Oh my gosh.
00:16:44,00:16:49,"- Yeah, she's worked as a welder, a painter and a metal,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,"yeah, this is her career."
00:16:51,00:16:53,"A painter at a metal fabrication company,"
00:16:53,00:16:57,"a hardware sales clerk, a deck builder."
00:16:57,00:17:00,She set the automobile racing land speed record.
00:17:00,00:17:02,Tonya's had a fucking life.
00:17:02,00:17:04,- She's desperately trying to erase
00:17:04,00:17:05,the one thing everyone knows about her.
00:17:05,00:17:08,Just trying anything on a Wikipedia
00:17:08,00:17:09,"is all these different things,"
00:17:09,00:17:10,but they still put that at the time.
00:17:10,00:17:13,"- Exactly, but she was an amazing figure skater"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"and when they made this movie with Margot Robbie,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,there's a scene in it where Margot Robbie
00:17:16,00:17:19,"has to do a triple axel and Margot Robbie,"
00:17:19,00:17:20,"who did train to do it, obviously couldn't do it,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,but they also couldn't find anyone to do it
00:17:23,00:17:25,"because it's so rare that anyone's ever landed that,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"that they had to use CGI in the film, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:31,- She's also amazing at bow and arrow shooting.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- She shoots the show.
00:17:32,00:17:34,- There was a piece about her that interviewed her
00:17:34,00:17:36,"and she goes hunting a lot with her husband,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,like hunting sort of elephants.
00:17:38,00:17:39,- Other figure skaters.
00:17:39,00:17:42,(all laughing)
00:17:42,00:17:49,- Hunting elk and such like.
00:17:49,00:17:51,And her husband takes a big gun
00:17:51,00:17:53,and she just takes a bow and arrow.
00:17:53,00:17:54,She says because she wants to give the animal
00:17:54,00:17:57,"a 50/50 chance to make it interesting and fair,"
00:17:57,00:17:58,although the journalist points out also
00:17:58,00:18:00,because felons aren't technically supposed
00:18:00,00:18:02,to possess guns in Washington state.
00:18:02,00:18:04,(upbeat music)
00:18:07,00:18:11,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:18:11,00:18:14,"- My fact this week is that in the early 1900s,"
00:18:14,00:18:16,the US government installed telephones
00:18:16,00:18:17,at the top of trees.
00:18:17,00:18:19,- What?
00:18:19,00:18:20,- Be cool.
00:18:20,00:18:21,- What?
00:18:21,00:18:23,- Convenient place to make a call.
00:18:23,00:18:23,This--
00:18:23,00:18:25,- A trunk call.
00:18:25,00:18:26,- Good.
00:18:26,00:18:27,- Yeah.
00:18:27,00:18:28,- Is that a thing?
00:18:28,00:18:28,- That's a very old fashioned term
00:18:28,00:18:30,"for a very long distance phone call, yeah."
00:18:30,00:18:31,"- Oh, okay."
00:18:31,00:18:32,- Would have got a huge laugh in the '70s.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"This is, it was the US Forest Service"
00:18:34,00:18:35,that started installing them
00:18:35,00:18:37,"at like 10th of the century, early 1900s,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,and it was for fire lookouts.
00:18:40,00:18:42,So it was in like fire prone states
00:18:42,00:18:44,"like your Arizona's or your California's,"
00:18:44,00:18:47,and they'd find the tallest tree
00:18:47,00:18:50,"on top of the biggest hill in the area,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"and then they'd climb to the top,"
00:18:52,00:18:53,"they'd put a ladder up the tree,"
00:18:53,00:18:56,and then a ranger would basically
00:18:56,00:18:57,"lop off the top of the tree,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,"and in its place put a platform there,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,and on the platform is just a telephone.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"And then a guy's job is to sit at the top of the tree,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,"and then if he sees a fire,"
00:19:05,00:19:08,"he makes a phone call and says fire,"
00:19:08,00:19:09,and they go and put it out.
00:19:09,00:19:11,It's so cool.
00:19:11,00:19:12,"And sometimes, what I didn't get was it says,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,"sometimes they're worked in pairs,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"and so there'd be two of them up the tree,"
00:19:16,00:19:17,and one of them spots the fire
00:19:17,00:19:19,and then sends the other one to put it out.
00:19:19,00:19:22,"But I don't understand how one single human being,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,"I imagine they weren't giant forest fires,"
00:19:24,00:19:27,"yeah, there's a small campfire, I suppose."
00:19:27,00:19:28,"- What would you be, you would just,"
00:19:28,00:19:29,"if it was small enough,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,"you'd only see a plume of smoke, right?"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"I think as soon as you see flames,"
00:19:32,00:19:35,that one guy's not really gonna appreciate
00:19:35,00:19:36,what's being sent on his own.
00:19:36,00:19:37,- Once the flames are coming out
00:19:37,00:19:39,at the top of the forest.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- Were you allowed to use the telephones for other things,"
00:19:41,00:19:42,like calling your mates or stuff?
00:19:42,00:19:45,- No personal phone calls.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"They do go through at the end of the month,"
00:19:47,00:19:48,it's your phone record.
00:19:48,00:19:51,The bill's very high this month.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"We don't remember hearing from you at all, lots of fires."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"- They're still there today, some of them, it's amazing."
00:19:56,00:19:58,They get called the freaks of the peaks.
00:19:58,00:20:00,It's one cool nickname they have.
00:20:00,00:20:01,- The trees. - The people are the trees.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"- The people, the people, I think."
00:20:03,00:20:04,But there are not many left.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"There were 5,000 at most in the '30s,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"and now there I think are a few hundred, maybe 500."
00:20:10,00:20:12,"- I think it went up, I think it was peak was the '50s,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,"where there were about 10,000 in the US."
00:20:14,00:20:16,"But yeah, I think such a cool job,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,such an interesting kind of person who does that job.
00:20:18,00:20:21,- You've got to be very happy with your own company.
00:20:21,00:20:22,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"- Well, I know if there's two of you up there."
00:20:23,00:20:24,- That's a good point.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"But in most cases, it's like the lookout,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"not the tree situation, but other lookout."
00:20:28,00:20:30,Sounds like it was one person the entire time.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"- Yeah, it mostly does seem to be one person."
00:20:33,00:20:35,"- Jack Kerouac was one of these guys, wasn't he?"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"- Was he? - Yeah, he was."
00:20:38,00:20:42,He spent 63 days as a US Forest Service fire lookout
00:20:42,00:20:45,on a place called Desolation Peak.
00:20:45,00:20:45,- Sounds fun.
00:20:45,00:20:49,"- Yeah, and he went there thinking that he'll be on his own."
00:20:49,00:20:51,"He only has to look out for fires for a while,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"so it'll be fine, he can write some stuff."
00:20:53,00:20:56,"But in the end, he wrote only one letter to his mother,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,"some Haiku poetry, and a couple of journal entries"
00:20:59,00:21:00,and no novels.
00:21:02,00:21:05,"- Well, I was reading one of the lookouts today"
00:21:05,00:21:07,"who says when new people come to do the job,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"apply for the job, they imagine they're gonna do"
00:21:09,00:21:10,"all this stuff, like write their great novel"
00:21:10,00:21:13,"and learn an instrument, he says, or you know, they think--"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"- Oh my God, imagine if you had like two of you"
00:21:16,00:21:17,at the top of the thing.
00:21:17,00:21:21,You see a laughing point climbing with the bagpipes.
00:21:21,00:21:22,"Oh, here we go."
00:21:22,00:21:24,- You laugh.
00:21:24,00:21:27,There's genuinely a girl who's learning bagpipes
00:21:27,00:21:28,while she does this.
00:21:28,00:21:29,- Really? - I believe she is.
00:21:29,00:21:30,- Is she by herself?
00:21:30,00:21:31,- So true ones.
00:21:31,00:21:32,- Yes. - Okay.
00:21:32,00:21:33,- Yeah. - Oh God.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"- But yeah, he says people tend to get nothing done."
00:21:35,00:21:36,You actually go and you end up--
00:21:36,00:21:37,"- Oh, I'm sure."
00:21:37,00:21:39,"I mean, you'd always think you'd only get stuff done"
00:21:39,00:21:40,and you never do.
00:21:40,00:21:40,That's just life.
00:21:40,00:21:43,"- I mean, your job is literally doing nothing."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- But it's to look.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"You have to be looking for fires, don't you?"
00:21:45,00:21:47,You have to be scaring the horizon.
00:21:47,00:21:48,"You know, your binoculars, a little room."
00:21:48,00:21:50,- I feel like you can look
00:21:50,00:21:52,and play the bagpipes at the same time.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"- Yes, that is one of the things."
00:21:54,00:21:57,- It's kind of sad that there are all these people
00:21:57,00:21:58,by themselves at the top of trees.
00:21:58,00:21:59,It's a 50/50 split.
00:21:59,00:22:01,And yet they obviously can't date each other
00:22:01,00:22:04,because they're all at the top of trees by themselves.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- You know how trees have sex?
00:22:05,00:22:06,They kind of fire.
00:22:06,00:22:08,- They release their seed into the wind.
00:22:08,00:22:09,- Into the wind.
00:22:09,00:22:11,They should try that.
00:22:11,00:22:13,- I'm sure it's been tried.
00:22:13,00:22:15,I'm sure someone's done it.
00:22:15,00:22:16,(laughing)
00:22:16,00:22:18,- It gets pretty dull up there.
00:22:18,00:22:20,- We've had some complaints from tourists
00:22:20,00:22:21,at the bottom of the tree.
00:22:21,00:22:24,(laughing)
00:22:28,00:22:29,"- Well, they could do,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"they did a sort of semaphore, not a semaphore."
00:22:32,00:22:33,They did a way of communicating
00:22:33,00:22:36,in the very early days before the phones.
00:22:36,00:22:37,What? - It has nothing.
00:22:37,00:22:38,"- No, not semaphore, is that all?"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"- There we go, thank you, yeah, yep."
00:22:41,00:22:43,"- Didn't need to happen, did it?"
00:22:43,00:22:45,They had these things called heliographs.
00:22:45,00:22:46,So the ones that weren't high-tech enough
00:22:46,00:22:49,to have the telephones in the early 1900s
00:22:49,00:22:51,would just have two mirrors.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"And there would be someone,"
00:22:53,00:22:54,"and they'd be called the flasher,"
00:22:54,00:22:59,who would use the mirrors to transmit messages
00:22:59,00:23:01,by bouncing the sun off them.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"- Right, isn't that how you start fires?"
00:23:04,00:23:06,(laughing)
00:23:06,00:23:09,That's a great point.
00:23:09,00:23:11,- It's a major flaw in the plan.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"Yeah, I guess you have to be quite careful."
00:23:13,00:23:16,"I guess if you make sure it's a convex mirror, maybe."
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- Okay, yeah, interesting."
00:23:17,00:23:19,"- But yeah, it would reflect the sunlight"
00:23:19,00:23:21,and they could transmit Morse code up to 70 miles.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"- So we're saying that this is a technology basic,"
00:23:23,00:23:24,"it's not a technology,"
00:23:24,00:23:26,"it's a lack of technology that should be wiped out by now,"
00:23:26,00:23:27,but it's still going.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"And you would think with drones,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,"with satellite imagery, with planes,"
00:23:31,00:23:32,"we wouldn't need this anymore,"
00:23:32,00:23:35,but it survived because it's the one thing
00:23:35,00:23:38,that we can still do when there is an electrical storm
00:23:38,00:23:39,and we can't send up drones
00:23:39,00:23:41,and we can't get satellite imaging
00:23:41,00:23:42,through clouding and so on.
00:23:42,00:23:44,So it's a job that hasn't died out
00:23:44,00:23:46,"through the modern technological world,"
00:23:46,00:23:47,which is pretty cool.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- Yeah, they've done a few studies recently"
00:23:49,00:23:52,"and found that the human observation is as efficient,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,if not more efficient overall than using drones
00:23:54,00:23:56,and stuff like that.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Exactly like Dan says,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,they can't be used in all conditions and stuff.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"- And also they know,"
00:24:00,00:24:03,'cause it's such a personal attachment they have
00:24:03,00:24:03,"to the land,"
00:24:03,00:24:06,"so often they've been there 30 or 40 years,"
00:24:06,00:24:07,you'll get a look out. - What?
00:24:07,00:24:08,"- They've lived up there,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"so they know every centimeter of the land,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,so these people can instinctively spot
00:24:13,00:24:14,the tiniest thing wrong.
00:24:14,00:24:15,"- But do you think they're like,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,"there's a fire where,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,you know where the co-op used to be?
00:24:19,00:24:20,(all laughing)
00:24:20,00:24:21,Where old Vera used to live?
00:24:21,00:24:23,"- Yeah, just down there."
00:24:23,00:24:25,"- Yeah, it's that."
00:24:25,00:24:28,"A lot of co-ops in the chorus, actually."
00:24:28,00:24:31,"- They use something called an Osborne fire finder,"
00:24:31,00:24:31,don't they?
00:24:31,00:24:34,"An OFF, which is a topographic map."
00:24:34,00:24:38,So you know like those maps when you go to a tourist place
00:24:38,00:24:41,"and it shows you where all the things are on the horizon,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,"it's like this building is this tower of this building,"
00:24:43,00:24:44,it's like one of those.
00:24:44,00:24:46,And then there's a few different things
00:24:46,00:24:48,so you can tell exactly where the fire's happening.
00:24:48,00:24:50,And that was invented in 1840 by a guy
00:24:50,00:24:53,called Sir Francis Ronalds.
00:24:53,00:24:56,And he also was one of the first people
00:24:56,00:24:59,to do electrical signalling.
00:24:59,00:25:03,"So when he was 28, he put eight miles worth of iron wire"
00:25:03,00:25:05,on his mother's lawn in Hammersmith
00:25:05,00:25:08,and managed to send a signal from one end of the eight miles
00:25:08,00:25:09,to the other end of the eight miles.
00:25:09,00:25:12,It was all kind of like folded up.
00:25:12,00:25:15,So he didn't go very far in actual terms.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"But he said after that, he said,"
00:25:16,00:25:21,"""Why add to the torments of pens, ink, paper and posts?"
00:25:21,00:25:24,"""Let's us all have electrical conversazione offices"
00:25:24,00:25:27,"""communicating with each other all over the kingdom."
00:25:27,00:25:30,"""Give me enough material and I will electrify the world."""
00:25:30,00:25:32,- Wow. - So he basically invented email.
00:25:32,00:25:34,- Yeah. - Isn't that amazing?
00:25:34,00:25:36,- I just sort of imagined him at the end of his garden
00:25:36,00:25:38,"going like, ""Mom, talk into the wire."""
00:25:38,00:25:39,"And his mom being like, ""I can just say to you,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"""come in for dinner, talk into the wire, mom."
00:25:42,00:25:43,"""I can hear it."""
00:25:43,00:25:46,"Yeah, you can't even 10 meters away from me."
00:25:46,00:25:47,So funny.
00:25:47,00:25:51,"On the Watchman thing, but the non-fire-related Watchman."
00:25:51,00:25:52,- Oh yeah.
00:25:52,00:25:56,"- So, Lausanne in Switzerland has its own Watchman"
00:25:56,00:25:59,who climbs the bell tower every night and shouts the time.
00:25:59,00:26:01,And that's been going since 1405.
00:26:01,00:26:03,- They can't have put a clock up there or anything.
00:26:03,00:26:04,"- Well, they've got, I think they've also--"
00:26:04,00:26:05,- In Switzerland.
00:26:05,00:26:08,(laughing)
00:26:08,00:26:08,- You're absolutely right.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"In fact, they've definitely got a clock"
00:26:10,00:26:14,'cause it's the bell goes and then the watchkeeper
00:26:14,00:26:17,shouts the time and chouts that it's all fine.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"- Watch, watcher."
00:26:18,00:26:19,"- Yeah, but--"
00:26:19,00:26:21,- Shouts that it's all fine.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- Yeah, there's a rubric that you say,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"which is, you know, it's 10 o'clock and all is well."
00:26:25,00:26:26,Good night.
00:26:26,00:26:27,"- Oh, not like 10 bongs and--"
00:26:27,00:26:28,"- Yep, it's right again."
00:26:28,00:26:31,(laughing)
00:26:31,00:26:33,- I do think they speak after the bell rings.
00:26:33,00:26:34,"In fact, they do."
00:26:34,00:26:35,The bell rings and then they shout
00:26:35,00:26:37,from the foresight of the tower what time it is.
00:26:37,00:26:39,"Anyway, for the first time--"
00:26:39,00:26:41,"- It feels like a redundant job, literally."
00:26:41,00:26:44,"- Yeah, that's the son of the owner of the bell"
00:26:44,00:26:46,just trying to find a gig for his kid.
00:26:46,00:26:50,- They've just appointed their first ever female watchkeeper
00:26:50,00:26:51,in 2021.
00:26:51,00:26:53,This is after 600 years.
00:26:53,00:26:54,- Huge steps.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Yeah, it is."
00:26:55,00:26:58,And there was a big protest a couple of years ago
00:26:58,00:27:00,about the fact that no women had been invited
00:27:00,00:27:01,to be watch keepers.
00:27:01,00:27:02,- Not 'cause she got the job.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, right."
00:27:03,00:27:04,"- No, a couple of years ago,"
00:27:04,00:27:06,"a lot of women said, ""Look, we want to enter this."""
00:27:06,00:27:08,"A sweet gig, apparently."
00:27:08,00:27:11,(laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:14,"Well, they had a vacancy last year to join the team"
00:27:14,00:27:16,and I think 80% of the applications were from women.
00:27:16,00:27:17,- I think what you want is a dinner lady.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"They have the loudest voices in the world, don't they?"
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- Yes, and there was a voice test."
00:27:21,00:27:22,That was part of it.
00:27:22,00:27:24,It was sort of they need to test
00:27:24,00:27:27,that you've got a good pair of lungs to shout the time.
00:27:27,00:27:29,And the job comes with a little lodge
00:27:29,00:27:32,"that you can keep warm in, in between bongs, I guess."
00:27:32,00:27:34,"And it comes with a felt hat, a lantern,"
00:27:34,00:27:35,and a cheese fondue set.
00:27:35,00:27:37,(laughing)
00:27:37,00:27:40,"- It's in the lodge, right?"
00:27:40,00:27:41,- Pretty Swiss.
00:27:41,00:27:42,"- With those perks, I can really understand"
00:27:42,00:27:44,why they went for it.
00:27:44,00:27:45,A felt hat.
00:27:45,00:27:48,"Just one more thing, actually, on fire towers"
00:27:48,00:27:51,"that I found so interesting is that this was,"
00:27:51,00:27:55,I was reading a piece with a lookout called Levi Brinniger.
00:27:55,00:27:57,And I do want to say they all have really cool names
00:27:57,00:27:59,like that or like Leaf Hogan.
00:27:59,00:28:01,All names that sound like they're a forest lookout.
00:28:01,00:28:04,But Levi Brinniger pointed out
00:28:04,00:28:06,"that if there's a lightning storm,"
00:28:06,00:28:09,you are in the tallest place up the tallest tree
00:28:09,00:28:13,with an electric phone line that you're supposed to use.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"So first of all, they do have a kill switch."
00:28:15,00:28:17,They just have a kill switch to kill the phone lines
00:28:17,00:28:18,if the lightning came too close.
00:28:18,00:28:21,"And then if it's really close, they have a stool,"
00:28:21,00:28:23,"and there are a couple of others who all had this,"
00:28:23,00:28:26,a stool where they've just put sort of glasses
00:28:26,00:28:30,"on each leg, under the leg, to insulate it from lightning."
00:28:30,00:28:32,So you just go and sit on this one stool
00:28:32,00:28:35,in the middle of the room and wait for the lightning
00:28:35,00:28:35,to pass through.
00:28:35,00:28:38,- I would have thought the power of a lightning bolt
00:28:38,00:28:41,on a tree if it hits it.
00:28:41,00:28:41,- It explodes it.
00:28:41,00:28:42,- It explodes it.
00:28:42,00:28:45,And it doesn't matter if you've got four tightly glasses
00:28:45,00:28:46,on the bottom of your chair.
00:28:46,00:28:49,"- I think, friend of the podcast, Roy Sullivan,"
00:28:49,00:28:49,was that his name?
00:28:49,00:28:51,The guy who was struck by lightning seven times.
00:28:51,00:28:53,I think one of the times he was hit by lightning
00:28:53,00:28:55,was when he was up a fire lookout thing.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- Was it?
00:28:56,00:28:57,"- Yeah, yeah, wow."
00:28:57,00:28:59,- Didn't put his glasses under the stool.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"- No, clearly, yeah."
00:29:01,00:29:02,"- And in fact, it wasn't one of the other times"
00:29:02,00:29:03,when he was being chased by a bear.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Do you remember?
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- Yes, yes, yes."
00:29:05,00:29:06,- He was being chased by a bear then struck by lightning.
00:29:06,00:29:07,He was beating it off with a stick.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- Sorry, he wasn't, let me rephrase that."
00:29:09,00:29:12,He was beating the bear with a stick at the time.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- Well then, I don't blame the bear for chasing him."
00:29:14,00:29:15,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:15,00:29:17,- He just wanted to do an ice dance with it.
00:29:17,00:29:20,(upbeat music)
00:29:20,00:29:26,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:29:26,00:29:27,That is Andy.
00:29:27,00:29:29,"- My fact is there is a worm,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,"which can grow multiple bottoms,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,which then fires off to have sex without it.
00:29:33,00:29:36,- Okay.
00:29:36,00:29:36,- Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"- So this is a newly named worm, very exciting."
00:29:39,00:29:41,There were a couple in the same kind of family
00:29:41,00:29:43,with the same kind of body shape
00:29:43,00:29:45,"that were known about already, but this is a new one."
00:29:45,00:29:48,"It's called Ramisela's King Ghidorahi,"
00:29:48,00:29:50,which is after a thing from Godzilla.
00:29:50,00:29:53,It's one of the other things that is a villain.
00:29:53,00:29:53,"I mean, yeah."
00:29:53,00:29:55,"- I always thought Godzilla was the villain,"
00:29:55,00:29:56,"but anyway, we'll come back to that."
00:29:56,00:29:58,"- Well, I'm sure we'll come to that."
00:29:58,00:30:02,"Basically, this worm is an amazing branching creature."
00:30:02,00:30:04,It lives in sea sponges.
00:30:04,00:30:08,"It has one head, and then the back end of it branches,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,'cause it lives in a sea sponge.
00:30:10,00:30:11,It branches through all the different tunnels
00:30:11,00:30:14,"and crevices and paths of the sponge, right?"
00:30:14,00:30:16,"And then when it wants to reproduce,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,"basically the end of each branch of its body,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"and there can be dozens or even hundreds of these branches,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"the end of each one breaks off, swims up to the surface,"
00:30:24,00:30:27,independently releases its eggs or sperm
00:30:27,00:30:30,into the water column where they'll all find each other.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"So they fertilize each other and then the bums die,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,"but the head of the worm living in the sea sponge lives,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,"lives to breed another day,"
00:30:37,00:30:39,and it starts regenerating all of its--
00:30:39,00:30:40,- It's so amazing. - It's a bums.
00:30:40,00:30:41,- It's incredible. - It really is.
00:30:41,00:30:44,"- It's just such a weird, weird thing."
00:30:44,00:30:46,- I just feel so sorry for the head.
00:30:46,00:30:48,Don't you think that is the worst?
00:30:48,00:30:51,Because you're spending your whole life as a face
00:30:51,00:30:54,"buried in the pitch-black belly of a sponge,"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"and you're sending off your arses to have sex,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,"and you never, ever get to do that yourself."
00:30:58,00:31:00,- Mm. - Isn't that so weird?
00:31:00,00:31:01,- Yes.
00:31:01,00:31:02,- You do have a nice sponge to live in.
00:31:02,00:31:04,"- Yeah, I guess that's why it comes true."
00:31:04,00:31:05,- That's a sponge bath every day.
00:31:05,00:31:06,(all laughing)
00:31:06,00:31:08,"- They can't survive the head part,"
00:31:08,00:31:09,can't survive outside the sponge.
00:31:09,00:31:11,"As soon as they go outside the sponge, they die."
00:31:11,00:31:13,"- Oh, that's a lady of shallot there."
00:31:13,00:31:14,I bet they sometimes want to.
00:31:14,00:31:16,I bet there are a few heads who have gone sod it.
00:31:16,00:31:17,I'm gonna give it a go.
00:31:17,00:31:19,- Yeah. - Let it pop out.
00:31:19,00:31:20,"- That's it. - It's so crazy, isn't it,"
00:31:20,00:31:23,"when you think of evolution, right?"
00:31:23,00:31:25,"Like, just the fact that this thing had to evolve"
00:31:25,00:31:29,"to send its anus off to go and have the babies, you know,"
00:31:29,00:31:30,"while, like, it was like, what do we do?"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"We can't, my head can't leave this sponge."
00:31:32,00:31:33,(all laughing)
00:31:33,00:31:34,What do I do?
00:31:34,00:31:37,"- These things that you call bums as well,"
00:31:37,00:31:40,"they are kind of, they can be more than bums."
00:31:40,00:31:43,"They can have, like, they have very rudimentary brains."
00:31:43,00:31:45,They have very rudimentary eyes.
00:31:45,00:31:46,- Yeah.
00:31:46,00:31:47,"- So they're like, not just a bum."
00:31:47,00:31:49,"- No, you're absolutely right."
00:31:49,00:31:52,"- So they're their own kind of, as it were, consciousness,"
00:31:52,00:31:53,"even though I know they're not thinking,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,but they've got their own--
00:31:54,00:31:55,"- Yeah, they have nerves. - Yeah, this is the most"
00:31:55,00:31:56,amazing thing.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"- And they're called stolons, technically."
00:31:58,00:31:59,So they're reproductive units.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"But as James says, they've got eyes,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"they've got very primitive brains,"
00:32:03,00:32:06,and that helps them to steer and to mate.
00:32:06,00:32:08,"- I find this the most extraordinary thing about this,"
00:32:08,00:32:09,"and almost anything I've ever read in nature,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,that these are basically living creatures
00:32:12,00:32:13,that they turn into.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"So every single time they let go of a branch,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,that they split their organs in half somehow.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"So every organ duplicates,"
00:32:20,00:32:23,so that branch has its own set of organs
00:32:23,00:32:24,that it then goes off with.
00:32:24,00:32:25,- Extraordinary.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- It's so weird.
00:32:26,00:32:29,"- So all of them have guts and nerves,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,and every single branch does.
00:32:31,00:32:35,"And so when that forks, the organs fork as well."
00:32:35,00:32:37,And some of them have been measured.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"So this is the other species,"
00:32:39,00:32:40,"Ramicillus multicordata,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,which is just a very similar creature.
00:32:43,00:32:45,They've been measured with 500 different branches.
00:32:45,00:32:47,- The reason you kind of call them bums
00:32:47,00:32:50,"is because when they're sticking out of the sponge,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"it's the bum bitch which's sticking out, right?"
00:32:52,00:32:55,"And the way that they eat is they can't,"
00:32:55,00:32:56,"well, we're not quite sure,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,because no one's ever found any food inside any of them.
00:32:58,00:32:59,- It's insane.
00:32:59,00:33:00,- It's insane.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"But what we think is that they dissolve,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"they kind of soak in the food into their body,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,"and then there's no stomach or anything like that,"
00:33:07,00:33:11,and then they send out the waste through the bums.
00:33:11,00:33:14,And then when they become like the thing that reproduces
00:33:14,00:33:15,"and decides to swim off,"
00:33:15,00:33:18,then a new little anal opening comes
00:33:18,00:33:20,"where they used to live,"
00:33:20,00:33:21,and then they grow out again.
00:33:21,00:33:23,- Constantly mooning the world.
00:33:24,00:33:27,"- They were found, the first one was found in the 1870s,"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"and then they didn't find the other two species,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,"'cause they're three species altogether, this thing,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,until about 20 years ago.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"And the first one was found on the Challenger Expedition,"
00:33:35,00:33:36,"which I had never read about,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"but is this extraordinary expedition from 18,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"maybe we've discussed it before,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,"but 1872 to 1876, this three and a half year voyage,"
00:33:44,00:33:47,which basically started oceanography.
00:33:47,00:33:48,"And I didn't realize that before that,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,people didn't care about the oceans at all.
00:33:50,00:33:52,"It was a big team of people,"
00:33:52,00:33:53,and it sounds really dull.
00:33:53,00:33:55,So Darwin had called the oceans
00:33:55,00:33:57,"""a tedious waste, a desert of water."""
00:33:57,00:34:00,"He was like, ""There's nothing in here, don't bother with it."""
00:34:00,00:34:01,"So everyone thought that,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,and then they set off on this expedition.
00:34:03,00:34:05,- You think that's because you know how Darwin basically
00:34:05,00:34:07,"lived in England, right?"
00:34:07,00:34:11,"And then he went all the way over to the Galapagos,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,all the way over the sea.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"Do you reckon people said, ""What were you doing on the way,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,"all were you doing, fuck all?"""
00:34:15,00:34:17,"He was like, ""Oh, it's pointless, I wouldn't do anything."""
00:34:17,00:34:20,"Anyway, just see, there's nothing in there."
00:34:20,00:34:22,- He forgot to look in it.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"- Is it the opposite where he found,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,"he obviously knew how much was in there,"
00:34:25,00:34:26,but he was just trying to put off other scientists.
00:34:26,00:34:30,"""No, don't bother looking there, it's just water, mate."""
00:34:30,00:34:32,"- Yeah, he always went to get to it."
00:34:32,00:34:33,"Well, they did look there"
00:34:33,00:34:35,"and they collected 4,800 new species,"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"and they found the Marianas Trench on the expedition,"
00:34:38,00:34:40,and they started the whole field.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"- This guy who we're talking about with all the bums,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,the way that he eats by dissolving stuff
00:34:45,00:34:49,that is around him basically is how mushrooms live.
00:34:49,00:34:51,And so I read one place that they said
00:34:51,00:34:53,that it's basically an animal
00:34:53,00:34:56,that has adopted a fungal lifestyle.
00:34:56,00:35:00,"So it's living like a fungus lives, but it's an animal."
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- Yeah, it does seem like that."
00:35:01,00:35:03,And actually other marine worms
00:35:03,00:35:05,"do that kind of dissolving thing, don't they?"
00:35:05,00:35:06,"There's a worm called the zombie worm,"
00:35:06,00:35:10,which feeds off skeletons of mostly whales
00:35:10,00:35:12,by other dead ocean animals at the bottom of the sea.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"And that sends acid out onto the bone,"
00:35:15,00:35:19,"which kind of melts it, well, dissolves it."
00:35:19,00:35:21,And then they just live inside whale bones
00:35:21,00:35:23,for ever and ever.
00:35:23,00:35:23,- It's incredible.
00:35:23,00:35:24,- That is really amazing.
00:35:24,00:35:26,I think I've read that there are some sponges
00:35:26,00:35:30,"which have been observed feeding on fossils,"
00:35:30,00:35:33,as in fossilized bones of ancient whales.
00:35:33,00:35:34,And it's why the fossil record
00:35:34,00:35:36,is really patchy in some places.
00:35:36,00:35:39,"It's just 'cause down there, they've been eaten, yeah."
00:35:39,00:35:40,"- I guess, yeah."
00:35:40,00:35:42,"I suppose if bones didn't disintegrate,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,we would just have-
00:35:44,00:35:44,- Just be needy.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"- Well, yeah, if you actually like,"
00:35:46,00:35:47,"if you looked at the bottom of the ocean,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"it should just be bones, right?"
00:35:49,00:35:51,At least one layer.
00:35:51,00:35:51,- Is it really?
00:35:51,00:35:54,"- Well, they get compressed and compressed over time,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"and they form rock layers, basically."
00:35:56,00:35:57,"I mean, so if you look at short cliffs,"
00:35:57,00:36:01,that's all the skeletons of the plankton stuff.
00:36:01,00:36:01,- That's right.
00:36:01,00:36:02,- So those bones just turn into
00:36:02,00:36:04,"what everything else turns into, which is mulch."
00:36:04,00:36:05,"- That's true, but I'm talking,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,I think I'm just talking short term.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"Let's say in like a 50 year period,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,there must be a lot of sea creatures that die
00:36:11,00:36:13,"that just do a collection of bones,"
00:36:13,00:36:14,but they're being eaten by-
00:36:14,00:36:15,"- 'Cause these zombie worms,"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"something like that. - Yeah, exactly."
00:36:17,00:36:19,- Scale worms are another water worm.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"- Oh, yeah."
00:36:20,00:36:23,- And some of them have this really cool trick.
00:36:23,00:36:24,"So they're a bit like wood lice,"
00:36:24,00:36:25,with the wood lice of the sea.
00:36:25,00:36:29,"So they have these like hard scales around them,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,"and that's so if something tries to eat them,"
00:36:31,00:36:32,"they slough off these scales,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"and the scales end up in the thing's mouth,"
00:36:34,00:36:35,and they wriggle off.
00:36:35,00:36:36,- Brilliant.
00:36:36,00:36:37,- But then sometimes they have scales
00:36:37,00:36:40,"that produce like bioluminescent light,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,and so something will try to eat it.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"They slough off the scales in the thing's mouth,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,"and then the thing's mouth is glowing in the dark,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,and then that thing gets hunted by its predator.
00:36:50,00:36:51,- So cool.
00:36:51,00:36:53,- And you're off literally in its face.
00:36:53,00:36:55,(laughing)
00:36:55,00:36:56,- That's clever.
00:36:56,00:36:58,- Have you heard of the bobbit worm?
00:36:58,00:36:59,"- Oh, yeah."
00:36:59,00:37:00,Is that the massive one?
00:37:00,00:37:01,"- It's huge, yeah."
00:37:01,00:37:02,It's like 10 feet long.
00:37:02,00:37:03,It's a iridescent worm.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"It buries its body into the ocean,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,"and it sort of just sits there,"
00:37:07,00:37:09,"and it sends out these kind of traps,"
00:37:09,00:37:11,like five little antennae that just sit there.
00:37:11,00:37:12,"And if a fish comes along,"
00:37:12,00:37:15,"it leaps out, just sort of slithers very quickly,"
00:37:15,00:37:16,"and with its jaws,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"it can snap, because the force is so great,"
00:37:18,00:37:20,it can slice a fish in half.
00:37:20,00:37:22,Like it's just like insanely horrible.
00:37:22,00:37:25,"But it then brings it back down into a hole,"
00:37:25,00:37:28,and they don't fully know what happens next.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"Scientists have not any idea really of what happens next,"
00:37:30,00:37:31,'cause we haven't been able to study it.
00:37:31,00:37:33,So they don't know if there's a toxin
00:37:33,00:37:35,"that goes into the animal,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"that if they haven't split into two,"
00:37:37,00:37:38,"that is still alive,"
00:37:38,00:37:39,"that just then kills it,"
00:37:39,00:37:43,"and then they can, you know, ingest it, and so on."
00:37:43,00:37:44,"- Well, so sometimes it's still alive,"
00:37:44,00:37:45,"kind of thing, I don't know how they kill it."
00:37:45,00:37:46,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"Like, sometimes they'll bring something back in"
00:37:48,00:37:49,"that they've just got a good grip on,"
00:37:49,00:37:50,as opposed to having it sliced.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"And the thought is, is that the name,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,"although no one's fully sure,"
00:37:54,00:37:57,they think John Wayne Bobbet's wife is the inspiration for.
00:37:57,00:37:58,- I think so.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"- Yeah, I think that is known, isn't it?"
00:38:00,00:38:02,- I think that wasn't conclusive.
00:38:02,00:38:03,"I think it was a sort of nickname given to it,"
00:38:03,00:38:04,"and they sort of,"
00:38:04,00:38:06,"well, at least the places I was reading,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,"saying we're not fully sure,"
00:38:08,00:38:11,because it doesn't do anything to your genitals.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"It's not like it bites your balls off,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"or it's like, no, it doesn't slice it."
00:38:15,00:38:17,- So we should say this is a famous case
00:38:17,00:38:19,"of a couple called John Wayne Bobbet,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"and his wife, Lorena Bobbet,"
00:38:21,00:38:22,and she cut off his--
00:38:22,00:38:24,- Penis. - Yes.
00:38:24,00:38:25,- And threw it out of a car.
00:38:25,00:38:26,- Yeah. - Yes.
00:38:26,00:38:28,"- And this isn't what the worm does,"
00:38:28,00:38:29,but it does seem like too much.
00:38:29,00:38:30,"- There's something a bit,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,"there's something a bit slicey,"
00:38:32,00:38:33,"and a bit penise-y involved here,"
00:38:33,00:38:34,'cause it's this worm.
00:38:34,00:38:35,- Yes.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"- It kind of lives under the sand,"
00:38:37,00:38:38,"and then jumps out and grabs you,"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"a bit like the worms in Dune, really, I think."
00:38:41,00:38:43,"Or, what's that other one, Tremors,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,"a bit like Tremors? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes."
00:38:45,00:38:47,- It has been compared to the Mongolian Death Worm.
00:38:47,00:38:48,"- Yes, yeah."
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- And here we are, back on stage territory."
00:38:50,00:38:51,"- Doesn't, Dan."
00:38:51,00:38:54,"- It hasn't featured in SpongeBob SquarePants yet,"
00:38:54,00:38:55,"has it, this creature?"
00:38:55,00:38:56,No.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"- Imagine if, is there an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants"
00:39:00,00:39:03,where it has one of these bond-dividing worms in it?
00:39:03,00:39:05,"- SpongeBob Gets Worms, yeah."
00:39:05,00:39:08,(all laughing)
00:39:08,00:39:10,"- So a little bit on Godzilla, maybe?"
00:39:10,00:39:11,- Yes. - Yes.
00:39:11,00:39:15,- He is a Japanese citizen.
00:39:15,00:39:16,(all laughing)
00:39:16,00:39:19,"- Date of birth, April of 1954."
00:39:19,00:39:21,"Reason for special, he's got special residency."
00:39:21,00:39:22,- You'd have to.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:39:23,00:39:25,"For promoting the entertainment of,"
00:39:25,00:39:28,"and watching over the Kabukicho neighborhood,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,and drawing visitors from around the world.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"Because I know you've been to Japan, Andy."
00:39:33,00:39:35,Have you seen the giant Godzilla
00:39:35,00:39:38,that's sticking out of one of the buildings?
00:39:38,00:39:39,"- I have not, is it Tokyo? - It's really called"
00:39:39,00:39:41,"next to Shinjuku Station, yeah."
00:39:41,00:39:42,"You're just walking down the street,"
00:39:42,00:39:43,"and you turn around,"
00:39:43,00:39:45,and suddenly there's a massive Godzilla
00:39:45,00:39:46,sort of looking over you.
00:39:46,00:39:47,- That's so cool. - Is he watching over?
00:39:47,00:39:50,'Cause I thought that he destroyed buildings.
00:39:50,00:39:52,"- Well, he got-- - I mean, yes."
00:39:52,00:39:55,- He doesn't move because he's just a statue.
00:39:55,00:39:57,"- No, but the idea of Godzilla,"
00:39:57,00:40:00,"the idea of a very destructive creature, right?"
00:40:00,00:40:01,"- I see what you mean, actually."
00:40:01,00:40:03,"- I mean, it's complicated. - He could save you"
00:40:03,00:40:06,"from Mothra, or from whoever this other guy was,"
00:40:06,00:40:08,"King Ghidorah. - Ghidorah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:08,00:40:11,"- It's a complicated relationship,"
00:40:11,00:40:13,"because basically, at various points,"
00:40:13,00:40:14,he's been the goodie and the heel.
00:40:14,00:40:18,"And, you know, if he's fighting King Kong, for example,"
00:40:18,00:40:19,"- What? - He, as he did"
00:40:19,00:40:22,"in the latest, very bad movie."
00:40:22,00:40:24,"- Oh, they're two completely different creatures."
00:40:24,00:40:26,"- Well, you haven't seen King Kong"
00:40:26,00:40:27,"versus Godzilla, have you?"
00:40:27,00:40:29,"And I gotta say, that's two hours."
00:40:29,00:40:31,"I'm never getting back, because it's--"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- What's it about? - It's a bad, really."
00:40:33,00:40:34,- It wasn't bad.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"I mean, Kong's skull island is magnificent."
00:40:36,00:40:37,- Is it? - Yeah.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"- Yeah, you keep telling me that."
00:40:38,00:40:40,"- But basically, Godzilla can be a goodie and baddie."
00:40:40,00:40:42,"I mean, very, very destructive of property."
00:40:42,00:40:43,- Thank you. - Yes.
00:40:43,00:40:45,"- Thank you, back to that."
00:40:45,00:40:46,Okay. - Yeah.
00:40:46,00:40:47,"- He can be angered,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,"but he's never on the side of the humans, right?"
00:40:49,00:40:50,Or is he?
00:40:50,00:40:51,- He's not really on any side.
00:40:51,00:40:53,"- He's on Godzilla side. - He's on Godzilla side, yeah."
00:40:53,00:40:55,- Does it look like to him?
00:40:55,00:40:57,"So, does it love story with him?"
00:40:57,00:40:58,"No, that's Kong, isn't it?"
00:40:58,00:41:00,"- ""Fade Down Away"" in the '33 movie, yeah."
00:41:00,00:41:02,"There's always, yeah, that's the--"
00:41:02,00:41:03,- Yeah. - That's Kong.
00:41:03,00:41:04,"- That's Kong. - That's Kong, yeah."
00:41:04,00:41:07,"- Or Brie Larson in Kong's skull island, yeah."
00:41:07,00:41:08,"- Sure, okay."
00:41:08,00:41:09,"- And actually, they don't really have a relationship"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"in the same way that Kong and ""Fade Down Away"" did."
00:41:11,00:41:14,"- I would say, when you're on ""Mastermind"""
00:41:14,00:41:17,"and they say, ""What's your specialist subject?"""
00:41:17,00:41:19,"If you do choose Kong and Godzilla,"
00:41:19,00:41:22,don't just give a fucking monologue
00:41:22,00:41:24,"as soon as he asks his first question,"
00:41:24,00:41:25,'cause you're gonna run out of time.
00:41:25,00:41:28,"- The thing about Skull Island is, though,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"it's a brilliant Vietnam War metaphor,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"and the whole mood, it's incredible."
00:41:32,00:41:35,"- I started and finished a long time ago, Andrew."
00:41:35,00:41:37,(upbeat music)
00:41:38,00:41:41,(upbeat music)
00:41:41,00:41:43,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,and that is my fact.
00:41:45,00:41:46,My fact this week is that comedian Lenny Bruce
00:41:46,00:41:49,was arrested so often during his sets
00:41:49,00:41:51,that he would go on stage wearing his coat
00:41:51,00:41:54,just so he was ready to leave with the police immediately.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- Brilliant. - Go on.
00:41:55,00:41:57,"- Yeah, so this is a fact that I learned"
00:41:57,00:41:59,in a brilliant autobiography
00:41:59,00:42:00,"that was written by George Carlin,"
00:42:00,00:42:02,who is also one of the greatest stand-ups
00:42:02,00:42:03,that we've ever had.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"It's called ""Last Words,"" highly recommend"
00:42:05,00:42:07,anyone who's interested in the world of comedy
00:42:07,00:42:12,"reading it, and this was on a night in 1962"
00:42:12,00:42:15,when Lenny Bruce was playing at a club
00:42:15,00:42:18,"called the Gate of Horn, and during the performance,"
00:42:18,00:42:21,a police officer stood up in the middle of the crowd
00:42:21,00:42:23,"and he basically shut down the show,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,"and he immediately arrested Bruce,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,and he tried to take him to jail.
00:42:27,00:42:30,"So, Carlin's bit of this story is that he was upstairs"
00:42:30,00:42:32,"having a drink with another comic,"
00:42:32,00:42:34,"and they weren't only just arresting Lenny Bruce,"
00:42:34,00:42:37,they were also arresting anyone else that they could
00:42:37,00:42:38,because they wanted to make a real point
00:42:38,00:42:40,"about this happening, this gig."
00:42:40,00:42:43,So they IDed everyone who was at the show
00:42:43,00:42:44,to see if there were any minors there
00:42:44,00:42:45,"to see if they could arrest them,"
00:42:45,00:42:47,if anyone was too young to be there.
00:42:47,00:42:49,They arrested the owner and the bartender
00:42:49,00:42:51,"because drinks were being served during the set,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,"which was not allowed,"
00:42:53,00:42:55,"and they ended up arresting as well George Carlin,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,who was upstairs and refused to give his ID
00:42:57,00:42:59,and started making a joke out of it
00:42:59,00:43:00,because he was quite drunk.
00:43:00,00:43:03,"So George Carlin ended up in the van,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,"the police van, with Lenny Bruce,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,and so he was there specifically for this moment.
00:43:07,00:43:09,Lenny told him he would wear his coat while he was on stage
00:43:09,00:43:12,because sometimes the police would just take him out
00:43:12,00:43:14,"immediately and he wouldn't be able to get his coat,"
00:43:14,00:43:16,and he loved his coat because it was made
00:43:16,00:43:18,from a really nice cashier
00:43:18,00:43:19,and he didn't want to be parted with it.
00:43:19,00:43:21,So that's why he wore it on stage all the time.
00:43:21,00:43:24,- I saw that he went to prison.
00:43:24,00:43:25,"They bailed him out, right?"
00:43:25,00:43:28,And he was back on stage by something like 1 a.m.
00:43:28,00:43:30,for the second show of the night.
00:43:30,00:43:33,"When he was on stage, he did a joke by saying,"
00:43:33,00:43:35,"""I better keep my coat on 'cause I may have to go out again."""
00:43:35,00:43:38,So he kind of made a point of the arrest as well.
00:43:38,00:43:38,- Yeah.
00:43:38,00:43:41,- Do we know how long into the set the policeman waited?
00:43:41,00:43:43,Did he wait for him to do all his favorite jokes
00:43:43,00:43:45,and then stand up or did he just give him 10 seconds?
00:43:45,00:43:47,- You wait until he said something really rude.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"- It was, yeah, it was the moment he said something rude."
00:43:49,00:43:51,"So Lenny Bruce is, if you haven't heard of him"
00:43:51,00:43:54,"as the listener of the show, he was a 1960s comedian."
00:43:54,00:43:56,"- The listener, we have more than one listener."
00:43:56,00:43:57,(laughing)
00:43:57,00:43:58,"- Sorry, I have one listener."
00:43:58,00:44:00,The rest of you have millions.
00:44:00,00:44:02,I've got one dedicated listener.
00:44:02,00:44:06,"He was basically, in a way, the first modern"
00:44:06,00:44:08,"stand-up comedian, and there were a lot of comedians"
00:44:08,00:44:10,"before him, obviously, and you can say people like"
00:44:10,00:44:12,Bob Hope and so on who would go around on stage
00:44:12,00:44:14,"telling jokes, but they were very much joke merchants."
00:44:14,00:44:17,They had a team of writers who were writing for them.
00:44:17,00:44:19,Lenny Bruce was the first person to really talk
00:44:19,00:44:21,about his personal life.
00:44:21,00:44:22,He used swear words.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"He talked like a real person, basically."
00:44:25,00:44:25,And that's--
00:44:25,00:44:28,- It was like stream of consciousness-y type stuff
00:44:28,00:44:30,"rather than just gag, gag, gag, right?"
00:44:30,00:44:32,"- Yeah, but they were written, it was written material"
00:44:32,00:44:35,"as well, but he was basically counter-culture America."
00:44:35,00:44:37,He was part of the beat people.
00:44:37,00:44:39,"So Jack Kerouac, who was mentioned before,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"very much part of that scene, and he opened up"
00:44:41,00:44:44,the whole industry of stand-up to this new way of doing it.
00:44:44,00:44:45,What came with that is he spoke about
00:44:45,00:44:47,very controversial topics.
00:44:47,00:44:50,"He spoke about religion, which he really didn't like."
00:44:50,00:44:52,"He used swear words on stage, which no one was doing"
00:44:52,00:44:55,"at this time, and so he was constantly being arrested"
00:44:55,00:44:59,"for these reasons, and he became a sort of martyr"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"to the whole of the comedy industry, because he--"
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Yeah.
00:45:03,00:45:04,- Sorry.
00:45:04,00:45:05,"- Well, no, we should say that he was pardoned as well,"
00:45:05,00:45:06,which is great news.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"So he was convicted of obscenity, but then he was pardoned."
00:45:08,00:45:10,"- In this one, right?"
00:45:10,00:45:13,"- Well, so this is when he was tried in 1964"
00:45:13,00:45:15,"for obscenity and prosecuted, but the good news is"
00:45:15,00:45:18,"that he was pardoned, and it was in 2003"
00:45:18,00:45:19,that he was pardoned.
00:45:19,00:45:19,- That's right.
00:45:19,00:45:22,"- He had been dead for nearly 40 years, but."
00:45:22,00:45:25,There was a petition to cancel it.
00:45:25,00:45:28,"So the governor of New York was George Pataki,"
00:45:28,00:45:31,who in 2003 granted this posthumous pardon.
00:45:31,00:45:33,The petition was brought by a couple of comedians
00:45:33,00:45:37,"I'd never heard of, called Tom Smothers and Dick Smothers,"
00:45:37,00:45:41,"known as the Smothers Brothers, who themselves were canceled"
00:45:41,00:45:44,"and properly canceled, 'cause they were very lefty,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,and that was obviously also pretty controversial.
00:45:46,00:45:49,"- Yeah, so he wasn't found guilty in the event"
00:45:49,00:45:50,that Dan was describing.
00:45:50,00:45:51,He was got off there.
00:45:51,00:45:55,His defense compared him to Aristophanes Rabele
00:45:55,00:45:58,"and Jonathan Swift in the court case,"
00:45:58,00:46:00,"and the jury agreed, and they let him off,"
00:46:00,00:46:03,and then he was later arrested quite a lot of times
00:46:03,00:46:04,"in lots of different places,"
00:46:04,00:46:06,"but in New York was the big famous one,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"which is what you're talking about, he got."
00:46:08,00:46:10,"- I think I agree with the judge, right?"
00:46:10,00:46:12,"I don't know Rabele, come on, you're not that pretentious,"
00:46:12,00:46:16,"but Aristophanes and Swift, kind of impenetrable,"
00:46:16,00:46:19,"desperate wannabe satirists, apparently genius,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,but actually not that fun to experience.
00:46:21,00:46:23,I would say it's quite a good description of Lenny Bruce.
00:46:23,00:46:24,- Wow. - For me.
00:46:24,00:46:25,"- Yeah, yeah, that's fine."
00:46:25,00:46:26,- For me.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"- Jonathan Swift is very funny,"
00:46:27,00:46:30,and some of the Aristophanes stuff is pretty funny.
00:46:30,00:46:33,"- I love the level, Anna, how can you be at a level"
00:46:33,00:46:36,where you're pretentious enough to know Aristophanes
00:46:36,00:46:37,"and Jonathan Swift, but no,"
00:46:37,00:46:40,"I'm not pretentious enough to know Rabele, come on."
00:46:40,00:46:43,"- Well, you all know that's the line, okay?"
00:46:43,00:46:45,You've crossed the line when you know Rabele.
00:46:45,00:46:48,"- I mean, he represented himself in court at various points,"
00:46:48,00:46:48,so that might've been the point
00:46:48,00:46:50,where he was being compared to Jonathan Swift
00:46:50,00:46:54,"and Aristophanes, so he fired his lawyer"
00:46:54,00:46:57,"halfway through this trial, the 1964 one."
00:46:57,00:46:59,And then the New York law journal
00:46:59,00:47:00,refused to publish the judgment
00:47:00,00:47:02,"because it contained offensive words, so."
00:47:02,00:47:03,- Right.
00:47:03,00:47:04,- And then just going back to the original one
00:47:04,00:47:05,"that you were talking about, Dan,"
00:47:05,00:47:08,I was reading the newspaper articles
00:47:08,00:47:10,"from the day and from the day after and stuff,"
00:47:10,00:47:12,"and he did his second show,"
00:47:12,00:47:15,"and then he went back to his hotel, the Clifft Hotel,"
00:47:15,00:47:16,and then he got kicked out of his hotel
00:47:16,00:47:19,because the hotel owner had heard about him being arrested
00:47:19,00:47:21,"and didn't want his like in his hotel,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,and so he just got kicked out into the street.
00:47:23,00:47:24,"And as a result from then on,"
00:47:24,00:47:27,he performed always with a small suitcase on stage.
00:47:27,00:47:29,(laughing)
00:47:29,00:47:34,"- He did like a spot of morphine, heroin, yes,"
00:47:34,00:47:36,and actually he was ejected from another hotel once
00:47:36,00:47:39,for blocking its toilet with heroin needles.
00:47:39,00:47:40,- Oh.
00:47:40,00:47:41,- Or for blocking its toilet with needles.
00:47:41,00:47:42,"- That's one of needles, isn't it?"
00:47:42,00:47:43,(laughing)
00:47:43,00:47:45,"It's not like toilet roll, it's like."
00:47:45,00:47:47,- I think maybe it only takes a couple of needles
00:47:47,00:47:49,"to block a loo, I've never, never tried it,"
00:47:49,00:47:51,"but there was another time he was, I promise."
00:47:51,00:47:53,(laughing)
00:47:53,00:47:54,"- We've been on tour with you,"
00:47:54,00:47:58,we know you are a needle toilet blocker.
00:47:58,00:48:00,The number of Premier Inns we've been unceremoniously kicked
00:48:00,00:48:01,out of.
00:48:01,00:48:04,"- I'm sorry about that, but I have changed."
00:48:04,00:48:08,"He was another thing I do on tour, actually."
00:48:08,00:48:09,He was kicked out of another hotel
00:48:09,00:48:13,for apparently conducting a nocturnal trio of blondes
00:48:13,00:48:17,"in an original composition, the chorus of which ran,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,"please fuck me, Lenny, in three-part harmony."
00:48:20,00:48:22,"- Oh, wow, in harmony."
00:48:22,00:48:23,- In harmony.
00:48:23,00:48:24,"- Actually, at a Premier In, you wouldn't be allowed"
00:48:24,00:48:26,"to do that, 'cause they have the good night's sleep policy."
00:48:26,00:48:28,(laughing)
00:48:28,00:48:31,"- Or the sign saying, shh, our corridors."
00:48:31,00:48:33,- That's why it's Lenny Henry who's the mascot
00:48:33,00:48:34,and not Lenny Bruce.
00:48:34,00:48:35,"- It was a top-up, wasn't it?"
00:48:35,00:48:38,(laughing)
00:48:38,00:48:40,"- But yeah, he had a big old sexual appetite"
00:48:40,00:48:43,and he married a stripper called Honey Harlow.
00:48:43,00:48:44,- Yes.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"- But as you say, Anna, like you don't think he's funny"
00:48:46,00:48:48,and a lot of people absolutely agree with you.
00:48:48,00:48:51,He has to be looked at as someone who is just the person
00:48:51,00:48:54,"who paved the way and who, you know, Richard Pryor,"
00:48:54,00:48:56,"who is seen by many as the funniest person ever,"
00:48:56,00:48:59,says that Lenny Bruce was the funniest person ever.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"George Carlin as well, Lenny Bruce was the funniest person"
00:49:01,00:49:02,ever.
00:49:02,00:49:03,"Modern day comedians like Mark Marron, Lenny Bruce,"
00:49:03,00:49:04,funniest person ever.
00:49:04,00:49:05,"- Yeah, I respect him a lot."
00:49:05,00:49:08,"- Michael McIntyre, you can see the influence so much"
00:49:08,00:49:09,in McIntyre's material.
00:49:09,00:49:12,"But they did, they did a, on the 50th."
00:49:12,00:49:14,- I like to just say I like Michael McIntyre.
00:49:14,00:49:15,I don't even know why I said that.
00:49:15,00:49:17,It's just the first day that came into my head.
00:49:17,00:49:18,- They're just not similar.
00:49:18,00:49:19,"- However much you like either of them,"
00:49:19,00:49:21,I don't think Michael McIntyre would claim
00:49:21,00:49:22,that he's taking after Lenny Bruce.
00:49:22,00:49:24,- I'm just saying if Michael McIntyre was beyond
00:49:24,00:49:27,"his BBC primetime show, I'm sorry."
00:49:27,00:49:28,(all laughing)
00:49:28,00:49:31,- But he does block a lot of hotel toilets
00:49:31,00:49:34,"with heroin needles, that's the McIntyre thing, isn't it?"
00:49:34,00:49:35,"It's kind of his trademark, yeah."
00:49:35,00:49:39,"- But on the 50th anniversary of his death,"
00:49:39,00:49:43,they did a screening of one of his recorded stand-up shows
00:49:43,00:49:46,"to an audience of fans and just to, you know,"
00:49:46,00:49:49,"commemorate him, it was 40 minutes of jokes"
00:49:49,00:49:52,and hardly anyone laughed according to the article.
00:49:52,00:49:55,"And that makes sense, he was a, he was a conscience."
00:49:55,00:49:57,"- He's the one that you go, when you're watching him,"
00:49:57,00:50:00,"you go, ah, you sort of smile and you're like, oh."
00:50:00,00:50:01,- I like Stuart Lee.
00:50:01,00:50:03,- That's certainly a bit of Stuart Lee to him.
00:50:03,00:50:04,(all laughing)
00:50:04,00:50:05,- Is there anyone left?
00:50:05,00:50:09,- Let's just destroy anyone we might work with in the future.
00:50:09,00:50:11,- There was a brilliant article in Playboy
00:50:11,00:50:15,"that he, that was quoting him in 1963"
00:50:15,00:50:19,and he was talking about when he was going on stage
00:50:19,00:50:21,and the owner decided to introduce him
00:50:21,00:50:24,but was really worried that he was gonna get a bad reaction.
00:50:24,00:50:25,"And so the owner said, ""Ladies and gentlemen,"
00:50:25,00:50:27,"the star of our show, Lenny Bruce,"
00:50:27,00:50:28,who incidentally is the next GI
00:50:28,00:50:30,"and a hell of a good performer, folks."
00:50:30,00:50:32,"And he's a great kidder, you know what I mean?"
00:50:32,00:50:33,It's just a bunch of silliness.
00:50:33,00:50:35,He doesn't mean what he says.
00:50:35,00:50:38,"The kids and the Pope and the Jewish religion, honestly."
00:50:38,00:50:40,"It's just a make-believe world, it's fine."
00:50:40,00:50:42,"He's a hell of a nice guy, folks."
00:50:42,00:50:44,And he was at a veterans' hospital today
00:50:44,00:50:45,doing a show for the boys.
00:50:45,00:50:49,"And here he is, by the way, his mom's out there tonight too."
00:50:49,00:50:50,She hasn't seen him in a couple of years
00:50:50,00:50:52,and she lives here in the town.
00:50:52,00:50:54,"Now, it jokes a joke, right, folks?"
00:50:54,00:50:55,What the hell?
00:50:55,00:50:57,I wish she'd try and cooperate.
00:50:57,00:50:59,And whoever has been sticking ice picks
00:50:59,00:51:01,"in the tires outside, that's not funny."
00:51:01,00:51:02,- Is this real?
00:51:02,00:51:03,That's real?
00:51:03,00:51:05,That's the best intro ever.
00:51:05,00:51:06,- That's really good.
00:51:06,00:51:09,- I feel like he must have written it for the video.
00:51:09,00:51:10,- That's so good.
00:51:10,00:51:12,"- His mom, interestingly, was his main inspiration."
00:51:12,00:51:14,And she was really awesome.
00:51:14,00:51:15,And she was this woman called Sally Ma.
00:51:15,00:51:17,"And she was a stand-up comedian,"
00:51:17,00:51:19,"well, before stand-up was a thing, really,"
00:51:19,00:51:20,in the '30s and '40s.
00:51:20,00:51:23,"And she did impersonations, I think,"
00:51:23,00:51:24,was part of her comedy.
00:51:24,00:51:25,"Like, she impersonated Humphrey Bogart"
00:51:25,00:51:27,and James Cagney and people like that.
00:51:27,00:51:29,And she--
00:51:29,00:51:31,- She introduced him on stage for his first ever show.
00:51:31,00:51:32,"- Oh, did she?"
00:51:32,00:51:35,"- Well, his first big break, he was in a radio show"
00:51:35,00:51:37,called Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts.
00:51:37,00:51:40,And she was the hype woman for him.
00:51:40,00:51:43,"- She was a manager, also, later in her career."
00:51:43,00:51:44,- Yes.
00:51:44,00:51:46,"- So she managed, who I did not know"
00:51:46,00:51:47,was a stand-up comedian.
00:51:47,00:51:49,But the man who played Mr. Miyagi
00:51:49,00:51:51,"from the Karate Kid movies, Pat Morito,"
00:51:51,00:51:53,was a stand-up before he became a sort of
00:51:53,00:51:54,more serious actor.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"And yeah, she managed him."
00:51:56,00:51:56,- Really?
00:51:56,00:51:57,- Yeah.
00:51:57,00:51:58,"- He had a brief act, didn't he?"
00:51:58,00:51:59,"Walks on, walks off."
00:51:59,00:52:00,- Beautiful.
00:52:00,00:52:02,That is beautiful.
00:52:02,00:52:05,"- Lenny Bruce, actually, he only ever performed"
00:52:05,00:52:06,once in the UK.
00:52:06,00:52:07,It was in London.
00:52:07,00:52:10,And it was on Greek Street in central London in Soho.
00:52:10,00:52:11,"And it was at the Establishment Club,"
00:52:11,00:52:15,which was created by Peter Cook of Beyond the Fringe.
00:52:15,00:52:19,"And it was, the Establishment was set up basically"
00:52:19,00:52:23,because they wanted to try and give acts the opportunity
00:52:23,00:52:25,to try the stuff that was censored.
00:52:25,00:52:27,"At this point in the UK, if you were performing,"
00:52:27,00:52:29,it was part of a theater show.
00:52:29,00:52:32,And the Lord Chamberlain had veto over every script
00:52:32,00:52:33,that would be performed.
00:52:33,00:52:34,"So they'd go through it and say,"
00:52:34,00:52:36,"""You can't say this and you can't say this."""
00:52:36,00:52:39,"But in private establishments, you were allowed to do that."
00:52:39,00:52:40,And so Peter Cook set up this place.
00:52:40,00:52:42,And that is how Lenny Bruce came to the UK
00:52:42,00:52:44,for his one and only trip
00:52:44,00:52:47,because he was deported the second time around.
00:52:47,00:52:49,He wasn't allowed in.
00:52:49,00:52:53,"And by all accounts, it was quite a bad run of gigs."
00:52:53,00:52:57,He was pretty ill at that point in terms of the drug taking.
00:52:57,00:53:00,This story you mentioned about the women and the syringes
00:53:00,00:53:02,"that was in London, where that happened."
00:53:02,00:53:05,"And Peter Cook himself, who was a massive fan of his,"
00:53:05,00:53:07,went and picked him up from the airport.
00:53:07,00:53:10,And he said that he just met this shambling guy
00:53:10,00:53:12,coming out at the arrivals.
00:53:12,00:53:14,He got into the car
00:53:14,00:53:17,"and he was holding a record player,"
00:53:17,00:53:19,a sort of miniature tape recorder.
00:53:19,00:53:21,And he insisted on playing his tapes
00:53:21,00:53:23,all the way on the journey back.
00:53:23,00:53:26,And the tapes consisted of nothing but airplane noises
00:53:26,00:53:28,and grunting and farting.
00:53:28,00:53:28,That was it.
00:53:28,00:53:31,And Peter Cook just saw what the hell is going on here.
00:53:31,00:53:33,"And yeah, and so he came and he performed in London."
00:53:33,00:53:35,- What was going on?
00:53:35,00:53:36,- He doesn't really know.
00:53:36,00:53:38,"Like Peter Cook, just basically what he had"
