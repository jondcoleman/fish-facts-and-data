00:00:00,00:00:04,Hi everyone James here now as you will have noticed the last few weeks
00:00:04,00:00:12,It is holiday season for us mostly because we have a brand new massive stonking UK and Ireland tour just about to happen
00:00:12,00:00:15,And we need to get as much rest as we can that before that happens
00:00:15,00:00:19,"By the way, you can get tickets for that by going to qi.com slash fish events"
00:00:19,00:00:26,"But anyway, what do we have for you this week? Well, we have another compilation the last one went down so well"
00:00:26,00:00:29,You all sent loads of really nice messages about how much you enjoyed it
00:00:29,00:00:33,So it's another hour of us being so silly
00:00:33,00:00:38,These are the times when everything got derailed a little bit too much so we couldn't fit it into the actual show
00:00:38,00:00:41,But I always gather them together because they're always so much fun
00:00:41,00:00:44,And I put them in a nice little package for you guys
00:00:44,00:00:50,We will be back again next week with a normal episode. It was recorded while I was away actually
00:00:50,00:00:57,It's another super special guest one that I particularly am quite upset that I wasn't there for because it's a really good friend of ours
00:00:57,00:01:00,Someone who's incredibly interesting and funny
00:01:00,00:01:05,I'm actually really really looking forward to listening to that one myself because I haven't heard it yet
00:01:05,00:01:08,"But anyway for the meantime, please do enjoy this compilation"
00:01:08,00:01:14,And we'll see you as a force them on the road or on this podcast feed very very soon
00:01:14,00:01:16,Okay on with the podcast
00:01:16,00:01:31,[Music]
00:01:31,00:01:36,Do you guys know um soldier boy soldier boy tell him you guys know he's a
00:01:36,00:01:40,"Come on guys. No, he's a rapper. No, he's a rapper"
00:01:40,00:01:45,"Okay, he's got a song called kiss me through the phone which gives a phone number"
00:01:45,00:01:52,Um halfway through it and a load of people decided to call it and it turns out to be a house in Oldham
00:01:52,00:01:58,Who according to the Guardian were getting a load of crank calls
00:01:58,00:02:01,But I don't need to tell you
00:02:01,00:02:05,Guys that that's a terrible missed opportunity because one of his main songs is called crank that
00:02:05,00:02:13,"So they so they should have called it crank calls crank that's calls. Yeah, probably okay"
00:02:15,00:02:18,I really misjudged my audience with this one
00:02:18,00:02:27,Who are you aiming at that feels like Dan might have had a prayer Anna hasn't heard anything since Cole Porter
00:02:27,00:02:35,"Uh, Britain's leading female table tennis player is this woman this girl called tin tin hoe"
00:02:35,00:02:41,And do you guys can you guess why she's called that she's got a quiff tin tin
00:02:42,00:02:45,"Um, that's why I was I was a small dog called snowy"
00:02:45,00:02:50,Confusingly it's not related to the character of tin tin. Wait. She hangs out with an old fisherman called captain haddock
00:02:50,00:02:56,"Again, it's not like a she has a she has a pair of twins that she hangs out with called the top"
00:02:56,00:03:03,"You can't just stop us making tin tin jokes, Anna immediately. You gotta live with her. Her father is called hershey"
00:03:03,00:03:09,Right as I have made quite clear. It's not related to tin tin and there must be other avenues you can pursue
00:03:10,00:03:12,"She's belgian, you know"
00:03:12,00:03:16,"I'm just gonna tell you okay. No, no, no, no, no. No, I feel like we're close. She's made of tin"
00:03:16,00:03:19,"Hey, he's found something different"
00:03:19,00:03:26,"But incorrect. No, it's because her dad is obsessed with table tennis and actually that's kind of weird"
00:03:26,00:03:32,"Sorry, hang on. It's coming. It's coming. I was so sure you're gonna say her dad is obsessed with tin tin"
00:03:32,00:03:38,I wish Anne brought this up
00:03:38,00:03:41,He's obsessed with table tennis
00:03:41,00:03:46,And the initials of table tennis are tt. So we called her tin tin
00:03:46,00:03:52,And in fact her brother is called ping and she said there was it was between her being called tin tin and her being called
00:03:52,00:03:57,Pong when she was born and so she says that she is delighted that
00:03:57,00:04:01,She didn't get bombed. You can't have two kids who call them ping and pong
00:04:01,00:04:04,The social services will get involved
00:04:04,00:04:07,"You think um, here's her stolen duck"
00:04:08,00:04:10,in 1860
00:04:10,00:04:19,Um during the second opium war the anglo-french looted and burned the summer palace and found five peakingese dogs
00:04:19,00:04:23,Um guarding a corpse of a lady and so they stole the dogs
00:04:23,00:04:27,And one of them was given to queen victoria who renamed her lootie
00:04:27,00:04:33,After all the all the looting that the british were doing wow in china at the time lol
00:04:34,00:04:42,Isn't that amazing that is quite open. I would have thought she would name it something like completely legal taking of stuff
00:04:42,00:04:49,"Wow, uh, pg woodhouse he collected peakingese dogs or he bred them or he you know, he had dozens of them"
00:04:49,00:04:56,"Did he steal them from he stole all of them from uh, china? Yeah, that's why his books have very low sales figures there"
00:04:56,00:05:02,"It's really interesting that peakingese um, like they're quite small aren't they but they almost look a bit like a lion"
00:05:03,00:05:05,Because they got like a mane kind of around their face
00:05:05,00:05:12,"Uh, and there were a few myths about where they came from according to one myth a lion fell in love with a marmoset"
00:05:12,00:05:17,And he begged the gods to shrink him in size so that he could have sex with the marmoset
00:05:17,00:05:22,And they did and that's where the peakingese came from
00:05:22,00:05:26,You think you can go the other way around you'd pray for a massive marmoset. Yeah
00:05:26,00:05:30,Expand the marmoset
00:05:30,00:05:32,"Actually, so I may shag it"
00:05:32,00:05:36,"No, I'd rather a tiny lion and take it back"
00:05:36,00:05:41,"There's another theory. Uh, this isn't a myth. There's another theory that buddhist monks"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"Um, like in buddhism a lion is a symbol of strength"
00:05:44,00:05:50,It's a symbol of wisdom and they want to have dogs that looks like a lion so they bred peakingese to look like lions
00:05:50,00:05:54,Which is true. We might never know
00:05:54,00:05:59,"There was a guy who was a stunt flyer back in the very early days of flight called, uh"
00:06:00,00:06:02,Al wilson and he hit golf balls off planes
00:06:02,00:06:09,Which is not as impressive as scoring a putt on concord except that he was standing on top of the plane at the time
00:06:09,00:06:15,So he would climb up onto the top of a biplane and just do amazing drives off it. No photos of him doing that
00:06:15,00:06:20,How is the air friction there not knocking the golf ball off the tee? I don't
00:06:20,00:06:26,Maybe he nailed the tee into the top of the biplane before
00:06:26,00:06:30,Clambering out but you'd have to nail the ball also onto the tee which
00:06:30,00:06:33,"Yes, maybe he did that too and then well then how did he hit it?"
00:06:33,00:06:36,maybe
00:06:36,00:06:45,"Maybe it was one of those velcro balls, you know that you throw at paddles, maybe he just velcroed it"
00:06:45,00:06:52,Except hang on he was in the 1920s and velcro hadn't been invented at the time
00:06:53,00:06:57,So maybe he is the unrecognized inventor of velcro
00:06:57,00:07:02,And we are giving him his moment of glory. Excellent. Well our wilson. Congratulations
00:07:02,00:07:07,Gibraltar named after jabel al-tariq
00:07:07,00:07:13,Who was the general who brought the islamic army from north africa into spain?
00:07:13,00:07:17,When spain became an islamic country in
00:07:17,00:07:20,Whenever that was the eighth century or whatever it was
00:07:21,00:07:29,But he was in charge of the whole army. They came over they landed in Gibraltar. They took over most of the iberian peninsula
00:07:29,00:07:36,There was him who was jabel al-tariq and there was another guy called musa who were in charge these two generals
00:07:36,00:07:44,And then for some reason in 714 they were both accused of misappropriation of funds
00:07:45,00:07:55,Sent back to damascus and they both died in complete obscurity. So they were the ones who brought the islamic invasion into spain
00:07:55,00:08:00,"And for the reason now that you know, there's a lot of islamic culture still there a lot of buildings and stuff"
00:08:00,00:08:04,"But yeah, they just got kicked out for nicking a load of money. Right. Wow"
00:08:04,00:08:11,Yeah fittingly it's known as a little bit of a tax haven now. So I suppose doing doing him proud
00:08:11,00:08:16,"The money nicker. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's the thing about money. It is very moorish"
00:08:16,00:08:25,Probably one of the most famous
00:08:25,00:08:29,fictional minerals in the world is kryptonite
00:08:29,00:08:30,I would argue
00:08:30,00:08:37,kryptonite was invented as an idea for being a thing of vulnerability for superman that would make him really sick
00:08:37,00:08:44,Because when the first radio series happened in america the actor who played superman who obviously had to be there all the time
00:08:44,00:08:49,Was desperate to have holidays and they couldn't have holidays because he's the main character
00:08:49,00:08:55,So if in a previous episode kryptonite was introduced like he was hidden behind a door where kryptonite was holding it closed
00:08:55,00:09:00,The actor bud collier could go on holiday and not have to be in the episodes
00:09:00,00:09:05,And the rest of the cast would be going poor superman. Where's he disappeared to but we all know he's behind the door
00:09:05,00:09:11,He can't say anything. Yeah. How boring were the episodes where superman wasn't in them?
00:09:11,00:09:17,What happens in those well just everyone going wonder where he is. Is he better? Have you seen him? Did you give him lemsip?
00:09:17,00:09:22,"Do you think lemsip works against kryptonite? Oh, yes, the only thing that's everything. Yeah"
00:09:22,00:09:26,"Um, it's so weird how long we went without dissecting human bodies"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"So we just we uh, I will claim responsibility. I've got at least three weeks"
00:09:34,00:09:37,So the first known dissections in the west at least were
00:09:37,00:09:41,Herophilus and Erasis stratus and this was a third century bc
00:09:41,00:09:45,And so this is quite revolutionary. They thought if we start cutting into human bodies
00:09:45,00:09:47,We can figure out how they work what the anatomy is
00:09:47,00:09:53,And they died and it immediately went out of fashion people said we don't actually need that. It's totally unnecessary
00:09:53,00:09:58,It's kind of gross. It's ungodly then the christians came along and they totally banned it
00:09:58,00:10:03,And we don't really think anyone dissected a human body for science for another 1600 years
00:10:03,00:10:10,Until about so about 1231 the holy roman emperor said actually we should start doing this and made a decree that medical students had to
00:10:10,00:10:13,And so there was this rush on bodies
00:10:13,00:10:17,And there was such a rush that there was a big old shortage the demand and supply didn't work out
00:10:17,00:10:21,And so there became a situation where by the 15th century in italy
00:10:21,00:10:27,medical students had to pay for the funerals of corpses
00:10:27,00:10:31,And that's that would be their way of saying look i'm going to pay you but you have to give me that corpse afterwards
00:10:32,00:10:34,So basically you get your funeral expenses paid by a doctor
00:10:34,00:10:39,"As long as they then cut you open. Yeah, but at the end of the funeral thing"
00:10:39,00:10:42,Plop you over their shoulder and walk off with you. It doesn't feel
00:10:42,00:10:47,I don't think they would do I think they'd wait for the curtains to go across before they did that
00:10:47,00:10:51,I don't think someone's walking a god. Are you done with that?
00:10:51,00:10:55,I paid good money for that
00:10:55,00:10:58,Have you guys heard of Jacqueline Oriol?
00:10:59,00:11:06,So she was the daughter-in-law of the president of france in the 1940s after the war
00:11:06,00:11:10,And she helped to decorate some of the rooms of the alice palace
00:11:10,00:11:15,After the war and she was known as one of the most elegant women in all of paris
00:11:15,00:11:21,And then in 1948 she thought fuck this the alice palace. It's fine. It doesn't need any more work
00:11:21,00:11:25,so she decided to become an aerobatic pilot and she
00:11:25,00:11:32,Got into a massive crash and crashed into the sen and she had to have 22 operations to rebuild her face
00:11:32,00:11:40,That was how bad the the crash was but then in 1953 she became one of the first ever test pilots to fly concorde
00:11:40,00:11:43,And she was the first woman to fly concorde. Really?
00:11:43,00:11:47,"Yeah, imagine that for a cv to go from like"
00:11:47,00:11:53,"Interior design in the palace in in paris and then to that. Yeah, that is incredible. Yeah"
00:11:53,00:11:57,But no one would believe you were the same person because you've got the rebuilt face
00:11:57,00:12:05,Oh my god. I'm just that's so right. It's not the same person. Is it no you've fallen for a really obvious
00:12:05,00:12:11,"All of it. Is it conn air where they change the face of uh, nicholas cage and stuff? Yeah, I think so. Yeah"
00:12:11,00:12:13,Is that face off face? Oh face off. Yes
00:12:13,00:12:18,It's this face off is the same plot as conn air isn't it apart from the face of coming off
00:12:18,00:12:23,"Yeah, I think face off and conn air the merging of the two is your story"
00:12:23,00:12:25,Your story that's right in the middle
00:12:25,00:12:31,I just have one more recent dog napping that I liked. This was a journalist in boston called juliana matzer
00:12:31,00:12:38,Did you see her? She was reporting on a dog that had been stolen in the local area kind of slow news day
00:12:38,00:12:41,She's speaking on camera about a missing german short head pointer
00:12:41,00:12:48,And she spots a man who matches the photos that have been put out the cctv photos of the dog been stolen
00:12:48,00:12:50,With the dog that looks like the dog
00:12:50,00:12:54,"So she goes up to him and she said hey, can I just pet your dog checks its collar"
00:12:54,00:12:59,It is low and behold the stolen dog. So on camera that you can watch it. It's very awkward interview
00:12:59,00:13:03,"She says is this your dog and he's like, um, no"
00:13:03,00:13:07,It's not it's been missing for a day for 24 hours
00:13:07,00:13:13,And she says why do you have it and he says I walked past a car and it was barking
00:13:13,00:13:17,And I thought it was the dog that I was supposed to be walking because I'm a dog walker
00:13:17,00:13:19,So one has got into a car
00:13:19,00:13:22,Maybe he was tired of walking
00:13:22,00:13:25,So I broke into the car
00:13:25,00:13:30,And I took it and she said why didn't you call the number of the person on the dog collar?
00:13:30,00:13:33,And he said I was sort of tribe at my phone broke and then I lost my phone
00:13:33,00:13:39,"Wow, wow mistake. This guy's had a horrible day. Well, that's an incredible story, Anna"
00:13:39,00:13:46,But also what the hell kind of tv station is doing news video packages about a lost dog within
00:13:47,00:13:49,24 hours
00:13:49,00:13:52,It's like I say slow news day in Boston
00:13:52,00:13:58,I should also say the verdict has not been returned on his guilt. I don't think so
00:13:58,00:14:01,jury is out
00:14:01,00:14:03,"Okay, jury's out"
00:14:03,00:14:06,"Well, good luck to him"
00:14:06,00:14:08,Can we get done for subjudiciousness?
00:14:08,00:14:14,I don't think so. Do you know where the american fear of sharks
00:14:14,00:14:18,Um throughout the general pop place comes from where it originated
00:14:18,00:14:23,"No, it was so it wasn't jaws it was before that jaws for sure"
00:14:23,00:14:27,"Okay, um so originating the fact that sharks eat people in the water"
00:14:27,00:14:31,But they don't tend to eat you if you live in montana or you know
00:14:31,00:14:36,"No, it basically comes we think probably from world war two"
00:14:36,00:14:40,"There were lots of stories, especially in the newspapers. Um, this did happen"
00:14:41,00:14:46,That planes would kind of crash in the water and then the sharks would get the get the people
00:14:46,00:14:51,But it didn't happen that often but the newspapers used to report that it was happening all the time
00:14:51,00:14:56,"um, but nevertheless the u.s. Military needed to come up with a way to stop"
00:14:56,00:15:02,Sharks attacking not just people who've crashed but also munitions. So if you're in a submarine
00:15:02,00:15:08,"You need to stop them from coming towards the munitions. So the office of strategic services, which was that kind of"
00:15:09,00:15:12,"Um office, which kind of came up with lots of wacky"
00:15:12,00:15:14,kind of dick dastardly plans
00:15:14,00:15:17,"Um, they hired someone called julia child"
00:15:17,00:15:23,As part of their team to try and work out the chef the chef. Yes. What?
00:15:23,00:15:25,So before she became a chef
00:15:25,00:15:32,She was a person who worked in the war to try and come up with ways to stop sharks from attacking people and munitions
00:15:32,00:15:36,And she tried things like clove oil horse urine nicotine
00:15:36,00:15:38,rotten shark
00:15:38,00:15:41,Uh asparagus she tried all these things to try and stop
00:15:41,00:15:46,Sharks from coming near them and in the end none of them really worked that well
00:15:46,00:15:49,And so they came up with this thing called shark chaser
00:15:49,00:15:54,Which was a little pill and you put it in the water and it would release like a dye into the water
00:15:54,00:15:58,So the shark wouldn't be able to see you so it wouldn't repel it
00:15:58,00:16:01,But it would stop it from being able to find you that is crazy
00:16:01,00:16:05,"God it's awful if you confuse a julia child recipe with one of her shark repellents, isn't it?"
00:16:06,00:16:12,"Well, she's for anyone who doesn't know her she was the one who basically brought french cuisine to americans"
00:16:12,00:16:18,"Um, so um, she was huge. She was massively famous. She had her own cooking show"
00:16:18,00:16:24,Didn't she one of the first people to do that? She was huge. Another good cv. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah amazing cv
00:16:24,00:16:27,And you're sure it wasn't someone with the face trans plant james
00:16:27,00:16:31,Nicholas cage
00:16:33,00:16:37,"Um, there is a uh, there was a thing in 2012"
00:16:37,00:16:45,Where bowing the plane company fixed their wi-fi on their planes using 9 000 kilos of potatoes
00:16:45,00:16:50,"Okay, so did they just happen to have so much potatoes on board the flight at the time or?"
00:16:50,00:16:56,I think they specially got them in and they got them in to pretend to be humans because
00:16:56,00:17:00,"They needed to test the wi-fi on their planes and where you get, you know"
00:17:01,00:17:03,Hot spots and then cold areas and you want to fix it all the way through
00:17:03,00:17:10,"Um, and it turns out that potatoes block internet signals in much the same way that human bodies do"
00:17:10,00:17:15,And so they got 9 000 kilos of potatoes and just sat them in the seats of the plane
00:17:15,00:17:22,and pretended that they were people and um and tested it that way and they didn't need paying and they didn't need feeding what?
00:17:22,00:17:28,"That's great. This is so weird. They have the same water content as humans like that kind of thing, right?"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"Yeah, I guess so and they're maybe about as dense as humans"
00:17:31,00:17:35,It reminds me of the time when I was on a plane and the wi-fi stopped working
00:17:35,00:17:39,And I asked them to turn it off and turn it back on again and they said we think this is the button
00:17:39,00:17:41,But we've never pressed this button on the plane before
00:17:41,00:17:46,"But I said let me come and have a look at it and I looked and I'm like, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the router button"
00:17:46,00:17:53,"Wow, sorry. They they took your advice. Yeah, random dude on the plane. Cool"
00:17:53,00:17:55,right
00:17:55,00:17:57,That's amazing
00:17:57,00:18:03,"Well, I had my um, it was the nfl draft for my fantasy football team and I really needed to go on the internet"
00:18:03,00:18:09,"Wow, right. What would change that's real confidence in your abilities than identifying a router"
00:18:09,00:18:12,What else is it gonna be? What a weird place to put the ejector seat?
00:18:12,00:18:21,"All the spontaneous combustion button, you never know. All planes have one. They always put it right next to the router"
00:18:25,00:18:27,And no more
00:18:27,00:18:31,Table tennis was a big thing in britain in the sort of early 20th century
00:18:31,00:18:34,I think it was kind of invented in the 1880s went under
00:18:34,00:18:41,"Came back in the 1920s and was popularized by this guy iver montague. Did you read about him? No, no"
00:18:41,00:18:43,he's that's disappointing because
00:18:43,00:18:45,It's gonna be a long section
00:18:45,00:18:53,Have you not noticed we've been doing this for eight years now and we always say no whenever someone says have you heard of this person?
00:18:53,00:18:58,"We always say no, otherwise it'd be a pretty yeah. Yeah, we've all done the research. I genuinely haven't though"
00:18:58,00:19:03,I've no idea about this seven or figure in table tennis. I thought I covered the basis. I haven't clearly
00:19:03,00:19:09,"Well, I've a surprise for you andy because iver montague is"
00:19:09,00:19:14,"The thank you grandfather of table tennis in britain, but he was also a spy"
00:19:14,00:19:17,so he's such an amazing character he
00:19:17,00:19:23,Founded the english table tennis federation and then he founded the international table tennis federation in 1926
00:19:23,00:19:27,"clever more spying opportunities internationally. Nice. Well, you joke"
00:19:27,00:19:34,But british intelligence was incredibly suspicious of him all the way through the war world war two because of his ping pong habit
00:19:34,00:19:39,"Yeah, because he kept standing in airports with two ping pong bats in his hands, didn't he?"
00:19:39,00:19:45,"Yeah, just redirecting planes into the english channel"
00:19:45,00:19:47,Um because they thought it was so weird
00:19:47,00:19:54,So there's a letter from an mi6 agent who writes to the agent in bulgaria
00:19:54,00:20:00,basically about all these letters that are being exchanged between iver montague and these two guys in bulgaria and
00:20:00,00:20:04,They're sort of discussing like intricate details of the game. They discuss bat weight
00:20:04,00:20:09,They discuss the spin on different balls and mi6 was convinced this was code
00:20:09,00:20:13,And so he wrote to this agent in bulgaria and said look you've got to investigate these two bulgarians
00:20:14,00:20:17,He said the reason for our interest will appear to you rather quaint
00:20:17,00:20:23,But the thing is they write interminably to iver montague about table tennis and trying out of table tennis balls
00:20:23,00:20:29,The agent in bulgaria investigated these guys and replied saying
00:20:29,00:20:34,It seems as though these guys are just perfectly solid individuals who spend their time testing table tennis balls
00:20:34,00:20:37,And and that was that wow seemed that way
00:20:37,00:20:42,It did cover the big reveal in the 60s was that he was in fact a soviet spy
00:20:43,00:20:45,Really?
00:20:45,00:20:50,"Yeah, so wait, wait, wait, but were they writing about table tennis balls as well. Do we know that element of the story?"
00:20:50,00:20:56,It's not clear. We know he loved table tennis. It doesn't seem to have been declassified whether or not this was code
00:20:56,00:21:00,So I don't know. He was really into the game and a spy. What do you think?
00:21:00,00:21:08,What do you think is the world record for slicing the most watermelons in half on your stomach with a sword in 60 seconds?
00:21:08,00:21:12,"Oh, no, no, no, I know I know the queen has this record"
00:21:13,00:21:15,I
00:21:15,00:21:20,It was a record beaten by friend of the show ashrita firman who?
00:21:20,00:21:28,His life's work is just to get as many random Guinness book of record things as possible 60 seconds on your belly with a sword
00:21:28,00:21:29,Slicing
00:21:29,00:21:33,Slicing them himself. He's slicing them himself. You're not allowed to wear any protection
00:21:33,00:21:39,So you're slicing down on a sword onto your stomach basically. Yep
00:21:39,00:21:42,"14. Oh, I see you're lying on your back"
00:21:42,00:21:44,And you're oh wow
00:21:44,00:21:49,"Um, it's someone placing the watermelons or do you have to reach someone would place them onto him each time?"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Okay, 14 sounds like a very sensible bet from our that's quite ambitious because you get to 13"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"And you think oh my god, I don't want to do the unlucky one. I'm holding a bloody sword"
00:21:56,00:22:00,I bet it's like really really fast to pass this 40s one. Yeah
00:22:00,00:22:03,I'm gonna say 23
00:22:03,00:22:10,"Oh, come on. Yeah, that's what I said. This guy's a record holder. Yeah. Well, that is really close. It's 26"
00:22:10,00:22:12,It's
00:22:12,00:22:18,And there was an interview with mr. Furman who said my first reaction is I relieved I didn't kill myself
00:22:18,00:22:26,"Um, do you know what you used to do in the 14th century in the Sahara if you got bitten by a snake?"
00:22:26,00:22:29,Come on guys. We've all done the research. We almost know this
00:22:29,00:22:33,"We know this. Yeah, it's so hard faking not knowing any of this"
00:22:35,00:22:41,What you would do is you would cut the throat of your camel and you would put your hand into the camel's stomach
00:22:41,00:22:46,And leave it there for the whole night and in theory that would suck out the poison and you would be fine
00:22:46,00:22:55,"Um, I learned this from there was an account of a traveler a Moroccan traveler called ibn batuta. He traveled more than"
00:22:55,00:22:57,Marco Polo who went 15
00:22:57,00:23:02,Thousand miles he went 72 thousand miles all the way around the world
00:23:02,00:23:07,It was an amazing traveler and when they went through the sahara. This was the trick that they used
00:23:07,00:23:11,"Unfortunately, it didn't really work and the guy had to have his fingers cut off anyway"
00:23:11,00:23:17,But it was worse for the camel. Let's face it. It was worse for the camel. Definitely. No one comes out of this well
00:23:17,00:23:19,I must say
00:23:19,00:23:23,Apart from possibly done because when I was reading this account
00:23:23,00:23:26,I read that when they ran out of water
00:23:26,00:23:31,They would kill an antelope and they would drink water from the entrails of the antelope
00:23:31,00:23:36,Which many many many years ago dad that I think said on this podcast and we all
00:23:36,00:23:40,Poo pooed it but this in the 14th century. This is what this traveler used to do
00:23:40,00:23:48,"Vindicated this is genuinely like five years later. We were just doing that thing where we pretended not to know the facts, you know"
00:23:48,00:23:51,We all knew it's true
00:23:51,00:23:56,One landlord was sacked for selling hay out of the back of the pub. So there were strict rules
00:23:56,00:24:02,"This was dora, right? This is dora who did this the old cow mystical old cow dora"
00:24:02,00:24:05,the defense of the realm acts which
00:24:05,00:24:09,Had loads of other fun rules as well as well as all this pub stuff
00:24:09,00:24:16,So you weren't allowed to light bonfires or fireworks or fly a kite. I think in case it was mistaken for
00:24:16,00:24:19,A bomb a zeppelin a zeppelin
00:24:19,00:24:23,"Yeah, you weren't allowed to whistle for a taxi in case that was mistaken for an air raid siren. What?"
00:24:24,00:24:26,How loud is your whistle
00:24:26,00:24:27,People whistled louder back then
00:24:27,00:24:32,"Famously, right? If um, you can mistake whistles for air raid sirens"
00:24:32,00:24:37,Then when the actual air raid siren went off were a load of taxi drivers driving around looking for these
00:24:37,00:24:43,"rides all time. It was absolutely tragic. Yeah, orange lights going on across london. Yeah"
00:24:43,00:24:45,All killed
00:24:45,00:24:51,The um doctor who theme tune was written by an australian composer called ron grainer the melody
00:24:52,00:24:58,"But actually the importance of it is the crazy effect, right? Yes, this amazing piece of electronic music"
00:24:58,00:25:06,And really when it was invented there wasn't really such thing as electronic music or the kind of was but it definitely wasn't popular
00:25:06,00:25:10,It wasn't done much and the mix was made by a musician called delia darbyshire
00:25:10,00:25:15,and she basically took each note of the melody and
00:25:16,00:25:22,sexually made it by taking a version of it played on some strings and then kind of speeding it up
00:25:22,00:25:28,Slowing it down splicing it was something else every single note was put together to come up with this amazing iconic theme tune
00:25:28,00:25:35,And delia darbyshire was brought up in coventry in 1940 and she said she was inspired to get into music
00:25:35,00:25:39,By the sound of the air raid sirens as the Germans were bombing coventry
00:25:39,00:25:45,And it was those kind of noises that got her interested in sounds and that eventually got her interested in music
00:25:46,00:25:48,So
00:25:48,00:26:00,I have actually been to a place which has a an annual tooth festival
00:26:00,00:26:02,Oh
00:26:02,00:26:05,Really? Well actually is it like one of buddhist teeth?
00:26:05,00:26:08,It's the temple of the tooth in candy in shrillanka
00:26:08,00:26:14,And the town is called candy and it is one of it's a tooth of the buddha dating to about 300 a d
00:26:15,00:26:19,You can't really see it when you go there when you're in the temple because it's in a casket
00:26:19,00:26:25,Which contains five progressively smaller caskets and in the smallest casket is the buddha's tooth and
00:26:25,00:26:29,It's an incredible brouhaha every year. I wasn't there at the time of the festival annoyingly
00:26:29,00:26:33,But there's drumming music as dancing as cannon fire
00:26:33,00:26:35,massive great elephants
00:26:35,00:26:41,"Many with their own biographies on wikipedia now the elephants really the elephant. Yeah, wow of the main elephants"
00:26:41,00:26:47,"They're called tuskers, you know, they have the great big tusks. They parade through the streets with the"
00:26:47,00:26:53,"Tooth container. I mean, it's a it's an amazing temple site. It's really I've been to another one"
00:26:53,00:26:59,"I've been to one in singapore, which is the same. Were you at the incisor or the canine or the molar?"
00:26:59,00:27:02,It was the wisdom. It was the wisdom of the buddha
00:27:02,00:27:08,Very nice my feeling is that that one and this is so far going off memory
00:27:08,00:27:13,"They might be completely wrong, but I think the tooth like really doesn't come comes out very very very rarely as in"
00:27:13,00:27:17,"You know, do you mean the candy one? No the one in in singapore?"
00:27:17,00:27:20,"Yeah, this one's right candy ones all over isn't it?"
00:27:20,00:27:25,But it must be so confusing for the elephants who are employed to carry this tooth all about town this tiny tooth
00:27:25,00:27:28,Looking at each other going if they've seen our teeth
00:27:28,00:27:30,look at
00:27:30,00:27:34,But they are they're celebrated for their massive tusks. They are
00:27:35,00:27:38,That's why that's why they're recruited for the job in elephant academy
00:27:38,00:27:43,"And the the crazy thing is that this is all in a place called candy, which is normally very bad for your teeth"
00:27:43,00:27:48,"Exactly, but I thought that's why they were having the festival so many teeth are falling out. They thought we've got to do something with these"
00:27:48,00:27:54,"Also, they always invite rob becker over to do an opening set, don't they? Because he's got such big teeth"
00:27:54,00:28:00,"He actually carries it through the streets if the elephant's not available. Yeah, and uh ester ransom for any older listeners"
00:28:01,00:28:05,Just like are we now doing a sort of choose your own podcast?
00:28:05,00:28:08,"Yeah, what about the tiktok generation who's got big teeth on tiktok?"
00:28:08,00:28:11,Right in nobody. They've all got perfect teeth
00:28:11,00:28:16,The idea that formaldehyde can preserve people was
00:28:16,00:28:19,discovered by a guy called third nand bloom
00:28:19,00:28:25,Uh blum and he was using formaldehyde as hoping to use it as an antiseptic
00:28:25,00:28:30,And he was kind of putting it on things and then he noticed that he put it on his fingers
00:28:30,00:28:33,And his fingers got really really hard when he put the formaldehyde on his fingers
00:28:33,00:28:39,"So he found it kind of by accident as I know that you love that kind of story and oh, yeah"
00:28:39,00:28:43,"Yeah, of course, did he stop at his fingers once you noticed that they went really really hard"
00:28:43,00:28:45,Did he proceed anywhere else?
00:28:45,00:28:48,I mean you would wouldn't you
00:28:48,00:28:52,If you noticed that putting formaldehyde on your fingers made you go really really hard
00:28:52,00:28:58,The cock is the obvious next exactly. It's a short step. Wow. What a what a world we could have had
00:28:59,00:29:02,"Yeah, where that was standard. You just pop and get some formaldehyde"
00:29:02,00:29:08,"Yeah, yeah, no, okay, I don't know if it would have flown off the shelves"
00:29:08,00:29:14,It wouldn't look great if medical students were getting boners because they were dissecting a body
00:29:14,00:29:23,In Peru if you go and eat potatoes and you go into the top of the andes and you go to a potato shop or a little stall
00:29:23,00:29:26,They might give you a little bag of clay
00:29:27,00:29:29,To eat with the potato
00:29:29,00:29:35,And you might put some water in the clay and make it into a little bit of a dip and then dip your potato in it
00:29:35,00:29:38,And then eat it because that's like one traditional way to eat potatoes in the andes
00:29:38,00:29:44,And the reason is that potatoes used to be poisonous. They come from the same
00:29:44,00:29:52,"The same family as like deadly nightshade and stuff, don't they and in the early days when they were first domesticated"
00:29:52,00:29:54,They were still a bit poisonous
00:29:54,00:29:57,But if you eat a little bit of clay while you're eating your potato
00:29:57,00:30:03,Then the clay will attach to these molecules called glyco alkaloids
00:30:03,00:30:05,And it will stop your body from processing them
00:30:05,00:30:08,Which means that they won't become poisonous anymore
00:30:08,00:30:12,And so there's still today it's a traditional way even though they're not poisonous anymore
00:30:12,00:30:18,You might still put your potatoes in a bit of clay. That's so cool. It is really clever and what's clever about it is
00:30:18,00:30:22,How do you learn that right? How do you decide? I'm going to put my potatoes in clay
00:30:22,00:30:30,And what they think is that humans saw parrots doing it or saw llamas doing it and copied the parrots or the llamas
00:30:30,00:30:36,"But hang on that just raises a second question. That is so annoying. Oh, yeah"
00:30:36,00:30:41,"We just learned it from the llamas. Well, how did the llamas learn how to do it? And how did the parrots learn?"
00:30:41,00:30:44,"Yeah, animals learn different things to us. That's you know"
00:30:45,00:30:50,But where did the learning start if we're if we're saying that our learning must have come from watching another animal do it
00:30:50,00:30:55,Their learning must have come from watching another animal and I don't believe the para originated it if anyone's a copier rather than
00:30:55,00:30:58,originator
00:30:58,00:31:00,You're right
00:31:00,00:31:02,I did look up if there was a
00:31:02,00:31:04,George the fifth potato
00:31:04,00:31:08,And I don't think there is because the king Edward is named after Edward the seventh specifically
00:31:08,00:31:10,But there are other things named after king Edward
00:31:10,00:31:12,so
00:31:12,00:31:14,There is poulard
00:31:14,00:31:19,Edward the seventh because he was a big eater basically and he was a famous gormand
00:31:19,00:31:22,So he had lots of dishes named after him by crawly chefs
00:31:22,00:31:25,Is that chefs from crawly?
00:31:25,00:31:31,"It is. Yeah. Yeah. He he always he always flew from gatwick. Yeah, he made sure to go by crawly on the way. Um"
00:31:31,00:31:38,Poulard Edward the seventh is chicken stuffed with foie gras which feels like the most decadent thing
00:31:38,00:31:43,I can possibly imagine eating. Have you guys heard of christina zanato?
00:31:43,00:31:45,Crustina or christina?
00:31:45,00:31:48,"No, crustina"
00:31:48,00:31:52,Like the why would you assume crostina? How many people even do you think it's crustina?
00:31:52,00:31:57,Because we're talking about the ocean and we were talking about I thought it might be a crustacea
00:31:57,00:31:59,The normal person's name christina
00:31:59,00:32:02,christina zanato
00:32:02,00:32:05,"Um, she is sometimes called the shark whisperer"
00:32:05,00:32:11,"Uh, she works in the bahamas and whenever any shark in the bahamas gets a hook in its mouth"
00:32:11,00:32:13,They go and see christina
00:32:13,00:32:19,"Wow, isn't that amazing? What does how's how's the word got out with shark? I don't know she put flies up"
00:32:19,00:32:21,I don't know how they know but
00:32:21,00:32:23,Ages and ages ago
00:32:23,00:32:26,There was a shark came up to her and she realized it had a hook in its mouth
00:32:26,00:32:28,And so she took it out
00:32:28,00:32:33,And now it does seem that whenever any shark one that she's never met before gets a hook in its mouth
00:32:33,00:32:40,They somehow know to go to her and get it fixed. They trust but not not when she's not when she's in land
00:32:40,00:32:42,"No, no when she's in a restaurant"
00:32:42,00:32:46,"Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Um, are you crustacean zanata?"
00:32:46,00:32:52,"She scuttles away sideways to finish her meal. Um, so"
00:32:52,00:32:57,"Well, you never know there are nine species of shark that can walk so you never know they could enter that restaurant"
00:32:57,00:33:03,That is so cool. But isn't it weird so she she spends loads of time in the water I guess and they just yeah
00:33:03,00:33:08,She's a diver and a researcher and stuff. She spends a lot of time looking at sharks and looking with sharks
00:33:08,00:33:15,But she just seems to have according to the article. I read she seems to have this reputation among sharks as being a person
00:33:15,00:33:17,They can trust if they get a hook in their mouth
00:33:17,00:33:20,That's incredible. Just insane
00:33:20,00:33:25,I once went to a restaurant in I can't remember where it was now. Um
00:33:26,00:33:32,"Mauritius, maybe I think and um, it was a floating restaurant and the sharks would swim around"
00:33:32,00:33:39,Where your tables were and the waiters would throw bits of meat into the water to kind of get them to come up and bite and stuff
00:33:39,00:33:41,And yeah
00:33:41,00:33:45,"I would not order the fish there order. What are sharks dislike? Yeah, toffee. Yeah"
00:33:45,00:33:52,Actually speaking of this there is a story that Isaac Newton and Edmund
00:33:53,00:33:58,"Halley of Halley's Comet fame am I saying that right? I think but yeah, we say you're kidding"
00:33:58,00:34:08,"I thought it was Hailey like Bill Hailey and the Comets. There we go. Um, there's a story that Newton and"
00:34:08,00:34:16,Halley Hawley once dissected. This is a nightmare to read out a dolphin in a coffee shop. It's actually a dolphin
00:34:16,00:34:22,There's a story that they dissected a dissected a dolphin in a coffee shop called the grecian coffee house
00:34:22,00:34:28,"And uh, I've traced it back and maddeningly. I think it's not true. So I'm just here to bust this myth wide open"
00:34:28,00:34:31,Was it a poppus?
00:34:31,00:34:38,It's a there's a diary of a member of the royal society called thorsby from june 1712 and it says
00:34:38,00:34:41,In and he says in his diary
00:34:41,00:34:46,attending the royal society where I found dr. Douglas dissecting a dolphin lately caught in the Thames
00:34:46,00:34:52,Where were present the president so Isaac Newton both the secretaries the two professors from oxford dr. Halley and keel with others
00:34:52,00:34:57,"Whose company we afterwards enjoyed at the grecian coffee house. Okay, so that to me implies"
00:34:57,00:35:02,They dissected the dolphin then they went for a coffee rather than dissecting the dolphin at the coffee house
00:35:02,00:35:05,"Which makes so much more sense. Yeah, that's the way to yeah"
00:35:05,00:35:11,They're not gonna let you into starbucks with a dead dolphin. Are they they're not going to give you a stamp on your card
00:35:11,00:35:17,I think it's still is a remarkable story that those two characters were dissecting a dolphin
00:35:17,00:35:23,In london. I mean that's that's pretty cool. That's the sort of three things. I didn't expect to be near each other
00:35:23,00:35:31,So that's quite good. Actually virginia wolf is another one who has a famous plaque situation going on right because she lived in the same house
00:35:31,00:35:32,of george bernard shore
00:35:32,00:35:36,So they it's I think it's one of the only places with two blue plaques on it
00:35:36,00:35:40,And they realized that wolf and shore their lives collided much later
00:35:40,00:35:45,So there's a letter from virginia old to george bernard shore in 1940
00:35:45,00:35:49,They'd only sort of met a couple of times. They'd stayed in the same country house in 1915
00:35:49,00:35:55,And it's so flirty. He was in his 80s at the time. She was about to commit suicide
00:35:55,00:35:57,and
00:35:57,00:35:59,I hear I hear romantic
00:35:59,00:36:02,Painted the romantic picture
00:36:02,00:36:04,He was in his 80s
00:36:04,00:36:06,She was on the brink of suicide
00:36:06,00:36:10,"Well, she sounded um, she sounded in a good mood in the letter. She said to him"
00:36:10,00:36:14,You have acted a lover's part in my life for the past 30 years
00:36:14,00:36:17,"Wow. Yeah, but presumably his work more than him"
00:36:17,00:36:22,But and he'd already confessed his love to her from another letter saying I fell in love with you the moment
00:36:22,00:36:28,"I saw you all over and she said if you ever drop your handkerchief near my house, you'd be welcome to come on"
00:36:28,00:36:30,I'll pick it up and we can hang out
00:36:30,00:36:35,"Sexy. Wow. Yeah, but they it was very jokey. By the way, they didn't actually fancy each other"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"Okay, it's sort of disliked him. Oh, wow"
00:36:37,00:36:41,"What? Okay, this is the roller coaster that you said this on"
00:36:41,00:36:48,It was pride and prejudice. They started off not like each other. She thought he was probably a fusty sexist old man
00:36:48,00:36:51,She said he had the mind of a disgustingly precocious child of two
00:36:51,00:36:55,And then they gradually warmed to each other over the course of their 40 year romance
00:36:55,00:37:00,And what was the thing about if he drops his handkerchief? Is that so she can look at his bum or what is that?
00:37:00,00:37:05,"So she can look at his bum. Well, if you drop your handkerchief, he has to bend over to pick it up"
00:37:05,00:37:08,"Mate, I didn't get that but now you've said that I think it is. Yes"
00:37:08,00:37:11,It's normally the lady dropping the handkerchief. That's what I thought. Was she saying if you
00:37:11,00:37:15,You old man drop your handkerchief. I think from what I remember that was the wording
00:37:15,00:37:20,She did like to invert gender norm sometimes Virginia Woolf. He's in his 80s as well. That's a hell of a bend
00:37:20,00:37:24,Maybe that's why she's offering to pick it up
00:37:24,00:37:33,Do you know what the standard dissection kit in America in the 19th century consisted of knife
00:37:34,00:37:40,"Yep knife. Um, you've got the knife. It's oh four seps. I'll give you that fork four seps sound similar"
00:37:40,00:37:43,I'll tell you a saw
00:37:43,00:37:50,"Store box. I bet it did. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there were scissors scissors because very useful for you know cutting through bits of stuff"
00:37:50,00:37:54,"Um, there were some hooks. There were some scalpels and there was a blowpipe"
00:37:54,00:37:57,"Oh, yeah"
00:37:57,00:38:03,"A blowpipe is just a pipe, isn't it really like a pipe blowing was it? Oh, no, it's not it's not just a pipe"
00:38:03,00:38:07,It's it's piped specifically designed to be blown into you wouldn't just blow into any old pipe. Can I guess a theory?
00:38:07,00:38:10,"Yeah, go was it a pipe that was um"
00:38:10,00:38:15,Used for people's bum bums to make sure they weren't dead
00:38:15,00:38:21,You know the thing where you blow into it in order to so it was just to make sure that your patient was actually dead
00:38:21,00:38:24,Can I make a guess?
00:38:24,00:38:27,"That may be right what dan said, but I was just thinking maybe"
00:38:27,00:38:32,We already know that a large portion of bodies that were dissected were dolphins
00:38:33,00:38:37,So did they put it in the blow hole the blowpipe? Very clever. Yes
00:38:37,00:38:41,I retract my suggestion and I put all my money on james's
00:38:41,00:38:43,I'll take down suggestion
00:38:43,00:38:50,"Anna, it's just as well. You did it was for the colon. It wasn't to test whether or not people were dead by the time"
00:38:50,00:38:55,"They're on the slab. They generally were dead, but it was to make the colon easier to see"
00:38:55,00:38:58,"What like during a section to inflate it. Yeah, exactly"
00:38:58,00:39:02,"Yeah, so it was for it was for the bottom. Make sure you blow it up suck"
00:39:03,00:39:09,"I'm sure it had a very strict instruction on the pipe, Britain. I probably also this site was lowing"
00:39:09,00:39:11,This I saw placing good to the anus
00:39:11,00:39:18,"Ultrasound with animals can be quite difficult. Um, I saw um, there was in london zoo"
00:39:18,00:39:22,They tried to do ultrasound on an acarpi and they had a real problem with that
00:39:22,00:39:26,Can you can you guess what the problem was with the acarpi ultrasound?
00:39:26,00:39:30,Can you describe an acarpi again? I can't quite it's like a deer
00:39:30,00:39:33,"Uh, oh so that means it might have antlers"
00:39:33,00:39:36,"Uh, acarpis. I don't really have antlers"
00:39:36,00:39:41,It's a bit bigger that it's like a mixture between a deer and a zebra. I would say you know acarpi
00:39:41,00:39:44,Has it got a lot of confusing orifices on its body and they didn't know where to
00:39:44,00:39:49,"Shove the you tend not to shove. Well, I might get to shoving things in a minute"
00:39:49,00:39:52,But with ultrasound the whole point of it is it's on the outside. You're absolutely right
00:39:52,00:39:56,I was thinking of an endoscopy and I don't know why because it's my fact and it's about not
00:39:56,00:39:58,"Don't forget that. Um, I'll tell you"
00:39:59,00:40:04,It's so well camouflaged that you can't see where it is to do the ultrasound because they're prey animals
00:40:04,00:40:09,It's no it's not that it's when you have an ultrasound you have to put this gel on
00:40:09,00:40:15,Which kind of helps the sound waves to come through and acarpis really love licking it off
00:40:15,00:40:18,So they really like the taste of it if you put it on there
00:40:18,00:40:23,There if you're a rhino and you want to look at the reproductive tracts of a rhino
00:40:23,00:40:27,They're so full of fat that um ultrasound doesn't really work
00:40:27,00:40:31,But you can do it by going up the bum. So that is kind of where you were coming from Andy
00:40:31,00:40:34,I think that's what you were thinking of certainly is where I was coming from. Yeah
00:40:34,00:40:40,"Also, that's a massive machine. Are you going into one of those machines because you can't build one of those for a rhino"
00:40:40,00:40:45,What an ultrasound an ultrasound isn't is just like you're firing some
00:40:45,00:40:49,Sound waves into the body. You're right. It's not like an MRI
00:40:49,00:40:53,"Yeah, you don't want to put a right in an MRI. You're right"
00:40:54,00:41:00,What we've ascertained is very few of us know the difference between an ultrasound and MRI and endoscopy
00:41:00,00:41:04,"Thank god, we're not doctors. Thank god. We're doing a relatively harmless job"
00:41:04,00:41:10,They are amazing trunks because there's no bone in them. There's a hell of a lot of muscles
00:41:10,00:41:15,they've got way more muscles in their trunk than we have as humans in our entire body and
00:41:15,00:41:21,It's it's just so weird because it doesn't show up on fossil records as a result
00:41:22,00:41:26,I just wonder how many animals in history that we have the fossil records of
00:41:26,00:41:32,"Actually, that's amazing appendage a big floppy trunk somewhere every single dinosaur could have a trunk"
00:41:32,00:41:37,"Yeah, t rex might have had a massive schnozzer right at the end actually and other like"
00:41:37,00:41:40,"Muscley appendages all over their bodies, right? Yes, I've done"
00:41:40,00:41:46,"Everything looked like a huge octopus in the olden days, but we've just got no record of the tentacles"
00:41:46,00:41:51,They did one experiment where um participants were asked to take part in ice cream tasting test
00:41:52,00:41:58,"Which I mean, what a great great study to take part in and they were asked to take part with someone else"
00:41:58,00:42:03,And that someone else would either be someone without a visible social stigma or someone with one
00:42:03,00:42:06,And the social stigma that they would have is they were either obese
00:42:06,00:42:09,Or they had a scar on their face a disfiguring scar on their face
00:42:09,00:42:14,And the person who was asked to do the study with them the ice cream tasting test
00:42:14,00:42:20,If the person without the social stigma ate shed loads of ice cream or hardly any then they'd copy them
00:42:21,00:42:26,But if it was the obese person or the person with the scar doing it then they wouldn't copy them
00:42:26,00:42:33,So they overcame that because I guess the idea is that you don't want to mimic someone who is has negative associations
00:42:33,00:42:39,I can see that with the ice cream like if you see and if the person saw an obese person
00:42:39,00:42:44,Eating an ice cream and had this kind of idea that obesity was wrong then wouldn't want to be like that
00:42:44,00:42:49,But the scar is really interesting. I would have thought that you wouldn't copy them if they were running with scissors for instance
00:42:50,00:42:53,"Yeah, if it's a scar often denotes"
00:42:53,00:42:55,perhaps being a pirate or
00:42:55,00:43:01,Or maybe a gangster and if a gangster was eating lots of ice cream and looking threatening at me
00:43:01,00:43:07,I would eat lots of ice cream too. Would you I wouldn't risk it in case he wanted mine as well. He obviously likes ice cream
00:43:07,00:43:11,But also interesting that what mimics people a lot
00:43:11,00:43:17,Parrots where the parrots live on the shoulders of pirates what the pirates have scars
00:43:18,00:43:23,This is falling apart this theory. I don't know what you're talking about. This has gone pretty loose
00:43:23,00:43:31,"You guys may remember the eu's wine lake and butter mountain, but I don't have all our listeners will"
00:43:31,00:43:33,Do you guys remember this?
00:43:33,00:43:38,So this is the idea that the eu creates too much of a certain product and they kind of
00:43:38,00:43:40,Store it so that the price doesn't go too low
00:43:41,00:43:46,"Exactly. Yeah, so there was a period where the eu countries in total were collectively producing"
00:43:46,00:43:52,"1.7 billion extra bottles of wine each year, which feels like an enormous overshoot to me"
00:43:52,00:43:56,And they paid farmers to turn it into ethanol
00:43:56,00:44:00,So you would go through the whole process of turning grapes into wine
00:44:00,00:44:05,"And then they would just convert it back into undrinkable pure alcohol, but they were incentivized to do so"
00:44:05,00:44:11,"And the butter mountain was similar. Yeah, what did they use the alcohol for like industrial stuff?"
00:44:11,00:44:18,"I guess. Yeah, it can be used as a fuel, can't it ethanol and um, and the butter think they just made a massive sort of slip slide"
00:44:18,00:44:22,All the way down the Iger
00:44:22,00:44:24,Yeah
00:44:24,00:44:31,"There was a beef mountain too, which is the unknown third element of the eu food surplus pyramid"
00:44:31,00:44:33,Beef mountain sounds disgusting
00:44:33,00:44:35,Welcome to beef mountain
00:44:35,00:44:37,Andy's theme park
00:44:37,00:44:40,I'm not queuing up for that
00:44:40,00:44:42,There's a big sausage swing boat
00:44:42,00:44:44,That's one of the rides
00:44:44,00:44:49,"Um, I was listening to a really great podcast about this whole history of the shang dynasty"
00:44:49,00:44:51,it was called chinese history podcast and
00:44:51,00:44:59,It was really interesting. There was a bit where the host of it put into context when this period was in time the supposed mythological
00:44:59,00:45:01,um
00:45:01,00:45:07,dynasty and it's 1600 bc to 1046 bc was the rough period so in that time
00:45:08,00:45:13,Tutankhamun and nefertiti were over in egypt. They were living the trojan war was happening
00:45:13,00:45:19,Moses and he stops what it's not funny. Is it because I said it's a tt
00:45:19,00:45:24,"It's funny. I'm not laughing. That is funny. I actually said titty, didn't I?"
00:45:24,00:45:27,"You did yeah, dan, and we didn't hear anything else after that"
00:45:27,00:45:36,"I was reading about mary beard the academic. Um, who died in 1956 I think or 58"
00:45:37,00:45:41,"Not our mary beard. No, no, no. This is mary ritter beard. Yeah, I know"
00:45:41,00:45:46,My heart stopped and then I thought what she'd been a ghost all this time
00:45:46,00:45:49,She's got so many great documentaries made because she was there
00:45:49,00:45:51,It's why she's why she knows so much about history
00:45:51,00:45:57,"Well, mary ritter married chal's austin beard in 1900"
00:45:57,00:46:05,And they were a really amazing couple of intellectuals and mary ritter beard wrote a load of articles
00:46:05,00:46:12,One of which was a study of the encyclopedia britannica to see how many women were in the encyclopedia britannica
00:46:12,00:46:14,And basically the answer was not many
00:46:14,00:46:21,She said she questioned in the article why there was no article on queen even though there was an article on kings
00:46:21,00:46:23,in the encyclopedia britannica
00:46:23,00:46:29,She said that there were no women included in the article on health and medicine
00:46:29,00:46:34,She said according to the article on songs no women sang in europe
00:46:35,00:46:43,Basically in history and the contributions of nuns choir compositions in singing from women is not recognized at all
00:46:43,00:46:46,And so she had a right go at the encyclopedia britannica
00:46:46,00:46:51,And I thought I'd check if she was in britannica today and her husband is and she is
00:46:51,00:46:54,As far as I can see
00:46:54,00:46:59,She's mentioned in the article on women's history. This is the online one. I'm not in the office
00:46:59,00:47:03,So I can't check the actual you've got them behind your head at the moment and so we could check them
00:47:03,00:47:09,"But yeah, as far as I can see she's not in britannica at the moment. Wow. So let's get her in. Yes, nary beard"
00:47:09,00:47:14,"That's great. I mean, that's not great that she's not in but that's great. That's"
00:47:14,00:47:17,"Oh, the story you told the story you told is great"
00:47:17,00:47:20,"Um, wow"
00:47:20,00:47:22,Shall I just see if she's in quickly?
00:47:22,00:47:28,"Yeah, so she chiles austin beard. I think he's in uh, he's in the online version for sure"
00:47:30,00:47:37,"If she died in 56, they're not gonna be what what year is that? I mean, you've got this way later than 1956"
00:47:37,00:47:39,This is the nuance like the pedia britannica
00:47:39,00:47:42,Not the old ones the founded 1768
00:47:42,00:47:46,"Yeah, 1991 fine, right beard. I'm a bittersweet"
00:47:46,00:47:51,"Bible, beryllium, berlin wool. This is a great podcast. This is such good content"
00:47:51,00:47:59,"And he reads the encyclopedia britannica, but only these titles my word beard chiles austin. Yes"
00:47:59,00:48:03,Then next article is on beard lycan. She's not there. Oh
00:48:03,00:48:06,It's disgrace not lycan mary
00:48:06,00:48:16,"I read an article about the origins of golf this was in the espm magazine, but they spoke to um, like"
00:48:16,00:48:18,proper historians from scotland
00:48:18,00:48:26,Because that's where people think it began and the idea is there's a bit of land in between the sea and the bit you can farm
00:48:26,00:48:31,Which is called the lynx because it links the two bits together and you would kind of keep sheep there
00:48:31,00:48:33,Or you keep rabbits there or stuff like that keep animals
00:48:33,00:48:37,But there's quite a boring job and so people would start hitting balls around
00:48:37,00:48:44,"And what this article said and I haven't checked it yet, but it was well sourced is that the bunkers"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"You know, there's like the sand traps that you get on a golf course"
00:48:46,00:48:51,They were formed by sheep who would hide behind little hillocks
00:48:51,00:48:57,Because the wind was so bad in that part of scotland and they would kind of lie down and over years and years and years
00:48:57,00:48:59,They would make deeper and deeper holes which would get filled with sand
00:48:59,00:49:04,And he said that the first greens so the greens where you're putting are really flat
00:49:04,00:49:07,And they're easy to just hit the ball along the ground
00:49:07,00:49:10,Reckons they could have been rabbit warrens
00:49:10,00:49:15,Because a rabbit warren would be the rabbit would put a hole in the ground for it to go into and then it would
00:49:15,00:49:21,Flatten around the area around the warren with its feet to make it flat and they reckon that that's how those might have started
00:49:22,00:49:27,Wow rabbits gave us golf. That's amazing. And who designed the golf clubs? Was that the badgers?
00:49:27,00:49:34,"That would have been the beavers, right who were making the dams and they just had spare bits of wood. There we go"
00:49:34,00:49:38,"That's um, I mean that's do you"
00:49:38,00:49:42,Do you hope that James? I don't believe it at all
00:49:42,00:49:47,But it was really well sourced and sometimes when things are unbelievable
00:49:47,00:49:53,But they're said by people who have authority. You kind of have to believe them a little bit. Absolutely plus that's making a really good disney film
00:49:53,00:50:02,"I mean, it's quite a boring disney film if the length of time that james is describing has to take place, you know"
00:50:02,00:50:07,It's just sheep laying down for a very long time
00:50:07,00:50:12,"I don't know if you watch that for like, okay, you have to watch that for a hundred years"
00:50:12,00:50:15,"But at the end of the movie you get a game of golf. That's exciting, isn't it?"
00:50:15,00:50:17,That is true. That will really perk things up. Yeah. Yeah
00:50:17,00:50:21,The one thing more boring than watching a sheep lie down for a hundred years
00:50:21,00:50:23,"Oh, shit, there's a game of golfing in this"
00:50:23,00:50:28,"Um, do you know the fastest eating mammal?"
00:50:28,00:50:36,"Uh, is it? I thought it was the star dosed mole. Star dosed mole. We did it so Anna we did this last week"
00:50:36,00:50:42,Can't it observe and um swallow a piece of prey in something like 120 milliseconds?
00:50:42,00:50:47,"Yeah, it's something like that and that's even quicker than a human can react to a red light out. Oh, yeah"
00:50:47,00:50:51,"That's about 670 milliseconds off the top of my head. Yeah, it's so top of the head top of the head"
00:50:51,00:50:56,If there will insist on recording episodes and I'm not there then it's going to happen
00:50:56,00:51:01,Isn't the organ on the front of a star dosed mole's face um 12 times more
00:51:01,00:51:08,"Um, what was sensitive sensitive sensitive than a clitoris. I believe so and it's easier to find. Yeah. Yeah"
00:51:09,00:51:12,And I'll tell you what since we recorded last week. I've tested that out and it's true
00:51:12,00:51:20,"Yeah, we did that last week. Sorry. Well, I'm going back on holiday then don't worry about it"
00:51:20,00:51:26,A giraffe would be a good thing to hang in a tree because you can sort of flop the neck over on one side
00:51:26,00:51:30,"And it's quite convenient. It's like its own coat hanger. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's nice"
00:51:30,00:51:34,"Yeah, you could eat it from either side. So you know that lady in the tramps we get he seen"
00:51:34,00:51:39,Imagine two of them gnawing their way up to a kiss the leopards and the giraffe
00:51:39,00:51:48,I don't want to be the one that ends up with just that scrawny neck and the other one gets the four legs and a body
00:51:48,00:51:51,I guess maybe it's a race to the body
00:51:51,00:51:53,"It's a closer race on the leg side, isn't it?"
00:51:53,00:51:57,There's not much meat on those legs is there
00:51:57,00:52:01,Although I don't I think the legs are longer than the neck actually and you've got to get through
00:52:01,00:52:06,"In the giraffe really come on. Yeah, I reckon legs are longer than the neck"
00:52:06,00:52:11,"I can't imagine things very well, but I'm surely a giraffe. It's famous for having a long neck"
00:52:11,00:52:17,"But and it's like there's this four legs. So if you stack the legs up on top of each other, they probably exceed the leg"
00:52:17,00:52:21,You mean a single leg is longer than a giraffe neck
00:52:21,00:52:28,"Okay, I I never never ever google in this podcast, but I'm going to do it now. What a giraffe looks like"
00:52:28,00:52:32,The only reason they're famous for the neck thing is because other animals don't have the long neck guys
00:52:32,00:52:38,Other animals have the long legs. So we don't go on about it. Sorry. Who here is voting that the neck is longer because I am
00:52:38,00:52:43,I'm saying front front legs longer. It's pretty close actually. Was it?
00:52:43,00:52:48,"Yeah, I mean, I'm not willing. I'm looking at google images and I'm not willing to make a call on it"
00:52:48,00:52:51,Oh my god. No. Yeah
00:52:51,00:52:55,"Okay, interesting. I'm looking at an illustration sure and then there's a bouncy castle one next to it"
00:52:55,00:53:00,Which has much shorter legs guys at the same length the average legs are six feet long the average neck is six feet long
00:53:00,00:53:04,"Sorry, I went to actual facts rather than pictures. I know I was supposed to do things"
00:53:04,00:53:08,What a coincidence that your legs are the same imagine
00:53:08,00:53:13,Would you rather have a neck that was the same length as your legs or legs that were the same length as your neck?
00:53:13,00:53:17,"Easy answer for a giraffe is what we're saying, right?"
00:53:17,00:53:25,"They've got it just right. Wow. Oh, that's nice. So nobody wins and nobody loses"
00:53:25,00:53:27,What a happy ending. What about the tail?
00:53:27,00:53:39,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts"
