1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
 - Hi, everybody. - One, two, one, two. Oh, sorry, Andy. I was just testing my mic.

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,280
 - Were you really good to test? - That's funny, because this happens every time we

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,920
 do this show, isn't it? - Weird, isn't it? Yeah, it's as if it's a systematic campaign

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,520
 to undermine me. - Or perhaps Andy should wait for us to test

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,200
 our mics. - All right. Maybe I'll just wait forever.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,240
 And I won't read any of the juicy, juicy stuff we've got in the fridge.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,800
 - No, read it. We love it. We love it. Come on.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,440
 - Hello, everybody. Welcome to Drop Us Align. This is our audience feedback/microphone testing

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,520
 segment. And we've got some cracking stuff. We've had Christmas in the inbox, so it's

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,640
 been very festive in there. What are you guys, do you know what? What are you guys fancy

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,720
 starting with? Do you fancy a correction? - Complaint. Complaint, please.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,560
 - Oh, great. Okay. Here's an eminent correction to start. This is from Noah Trudeau.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,720
 - Whoa. How closely related to the now disgraced foreign president?

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,240
 - He doesn't say, but he is the assistant professor of economics at Troy University.

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,320
 Is that in the 51st state of America? Or is it in... - It's in... It's in... It's actual

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,040
 Troy University. So most of their studies are about, like, should we take this big wooden

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,080
 horse in? Will it have a good effect on the city's economy? Long term, yes, probably.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,800
 No, no. Troy, Alabama. I didn't know that was Troy, Alabama.

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
 - Oh, sorry. It's in America. No, I didn't know that.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,480
 - Well, Noah says, "Long term, listen, a first time emailer, always thought my first

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,880
 email would be regarding economics, as I am a professor of economics. However, this is

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
 about riding a television." - Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,480
 - Right. Now, I have waded through a lot of this in the fin box. In episode 563, Brisbane,

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,280
 one of the facts related to the NEI-SS data from the United States, mentioned an injury

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,560
 sustained by a person who, while riding on a TV, when he ran into a turkey, lost control

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,840
 and ran into a tree. As someone who grew up in rural Alabama, this has to be a clerical

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,760
 error. I've had multiple friends involved in ATV, Brackett's all-terrain vehicle accidents,

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,120
 but have yet to account for anyone who has ridden a television into a tree. And amazingly,

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
 so we got a lot of emails about this. He's the only one who found the original report

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,000
 from 2014 and tracked down the specific entry about the 21-year-old man who was treated and

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,760
 hospitalized after fracturing a vertebrae. - Well done, Noah.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,920
 - Very nice. I do remember, because on the night in Brisbane, when we did this, I was

33
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,920
 reading this out, there was a bit of debate from the front row about whether or not it

34
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:57,840
 was a TV or an ATV. And that didn't make it to the edit, but I since, when I got back,

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
 I sometimes have dreams now about my facts and I wake up and I just have to get my phone

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,040
 out and double check things at like 3 a.m. And the article I got it from was either a

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,880
 Guardian or Independent in the UK, and it very specifically is ATV, a television.

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
 - Wow.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,680
 - Yeah, so I read what I'd sourced correctly, but I should have gone to find the 2014 article

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
 where a boy broke a vertebrae. - Wait, hang on. So the thing you read, it actually

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,280
 put a space between A and TV and the Guardian article. That is the Guardian, isn't it?

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,280
 - Well, one of those, I can bring it up while we're on here.

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,480
 - The Guardian for international listeners is renowned for their typos in print. And

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,840
 they're nicknamed the "Groundy Ed" and it's very funny.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
 - Very funny.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
 - Here's some.

47
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,680
 - And I just quickly, I just, I really don't want to write in. I just casually dropped in

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,360
 about Justin Trudeau being the ex-president and I don't want anyone to write in and explain

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,400
 that he's the Prime Minister. I get it. Okay, it was just, I misspoke momentarily.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,320
 - Yeah, and can I also say my 51st state joke was just a bit of satire. I don't actually

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,480
 think that America should take over Canada.

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,560
 - Well, we don't know though. This doesn't go out for another week. It might be by the

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
 time this airs.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,080
 - Maybe by the time this airs, Noah will have been installed as the kind of puppet vizier,

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
 all right, Canada.

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,960
 - I quite like that Noah studies at Troy. You've got a famous wooden object going into

57
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,240
 Troy and then you have a man who built a wooden structure to, it's, it's, it's a lot of, there's

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
 a lot going on there.

59
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,920
 - He probably, he probably gets that all the time. I sometimes worry we're too obvious

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,920
 with our jokes about people with great names. I don't think he will get that one all the

61
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
 time. That's brilliant.

62
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,160
 - All right, here's Amelia Brownstein. Brownstein, Brownstein. It's Amelia, right?

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
 - Is it Brownstein?

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,200
 - It's not Brownstein. Although this is relevant to the, to the subject of Amelia's email.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,880
 She said, I have worked in veterinary medicine for some years and the key takeaway from this,

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,600
 I want to make clear, do not pull string coming out of your animals butt.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 - Oh.

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,160
 - Oh, okay. Good. Public service.

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
 - Yeah.

70
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
 - Did we say that you should?

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
 - Do not pull string.

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
 - So this is the other thing.

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,720
 - I always thought, like my cat doesn't meow very much, but I thought if there was a string

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,040
 there that I pulled, she might go meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, like a toy.

75
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,720
 - Was that the thing on the show? Did we talk about a dog swallowing tinsel or something?

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,040
 - We talked about a dog swallowing tinsel and Dan wondered whether there has ever been

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,840
 an instance where a dog had tinsel coming out of its mouth and its rectum at the same

78
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
 time.

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
 - That's right.

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
 - And you could turn it into a spit roast.

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,480
 - Well, no, just you can put the dog on the tree and say, that is the tinsel.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
 - Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,760
 - Yeah. Well, anyway, look, Amelia makes very clear.

84
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,200
 This is really bad. It risks bowel strangulation, necrosis, gut contents leaking through the

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,080
 body cavity, which is bad news bears, she says. So don't do it.

86
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,720
 - So are you just supposed to leave a string hanging out of your dog's arse for its whole

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 life?

88
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,400
 - No. You're meant to contact a professional who will, I think, deal with it, which goes

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,960
 into a lot of detail about, you know, like twisting bowels and rather upsetting stuff.

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,480
 But basically, if you are lucky enough to have access to an endoscope, you always, always

91
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,800
 need to palpate the entire bowel. So just remember that. I think that's the take away.

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,520
 Palpate is a massaging along the length of something, you know, a bit like palpitations,

93
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,240
 but not quite. So anyway, be very, very careful.

94
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
 - Okay.

95
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
 - Noted.

96
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
 - Noted.

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
 - I reckon if you own an endoscope, you probably already know all this stuff.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,240
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right. Can you do a self-endoscopy? I bet you can, can't you?

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
 Of course you can.

100
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,960
 - Well, in theory, it's possible for sure. But...

101
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
 - Is it recommended?

102
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,960
 - No, I don't think so. I think get a professional, I would say.

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,080
 - Have they ever done a TV show where it's an endoscope going all the way through someone's

104
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
 body? Like, it's the journey of a piece of food?

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,520
 - I think it feels like that has been done. Yeah. I think that would be good.

106
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,640
 - Wasn't that what the Millennium Dome was? Do you remember in the Millennium Dome, you

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,080
 went through a whole, a person's digestive system, didn't you?

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
 - Did you?

109
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,400
 - I thought there was, I think you could go through the whole human body. That's like

110
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
 an endoscope.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,720
 - Yeah, you did. But that wasn't the same as what Andy was saying.

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
 - No, I'm pitching a TV show.

113
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,520
 - It's not exactly the same, no.

114
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,520
 - I think Endoscopy Live is a good TV show. And I think we all know TV is in the doldrums

115
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,720
 and need to make cheap TV these days.

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 - It's in the shit.

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
 - It's in the shit. You could do a different episode for every species. That's, like, immediate

118
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 100-year commission.

119
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 - All right.

120
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,160
 - Who would, which would be the human you would go for? Because if you're doing one

121
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,920
 episode for each species, you only have one chance to choose the perfect human to put

122
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
 a camera up.

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,400
 - That's got to be Atombrough, right?

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
 - Atombrough.

125
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,480
 - What? He doesn't eat the animals he observes.

126
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,960
 - That's the misconception, Anna. He does. He says, "I have to know."

127
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,000
 Okay. Here is an email from Andrew Conlon. Listen to the most recent bonus app. This

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
 is Drop the Line on Drop the Line.

129
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,920
 - The bit about specific tannoy instructions in M&S.

130
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,000
 - Oh, yeah. Code 4.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
 - Someone stood a poo in the changing room? Was that it?

132
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
 - Yeah.

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,560
 - Yeah. It reminded me of a specific code we had in a call centre. When we trained new

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,080
 staff, we had to give them the specific hand gesture to use if someone called the phone

135
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 line with a bomb threat. I can't remember exactly the gesture, but it evolved standing

136
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,520
 or making a fist. It was presumably quite confusing because it makes it look like you're

137
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
 celebrating.

138
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,480
 - Yeah. You've just landed a deal.

139
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,440
 - Yeah. I didn't give it much thought. I just assumed it was something all call centres

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,520
 did. Only listening to last week's bonus did I tweak it. It might be because we worked

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
 in Northern Ireland.

142
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
 - Oh.

143
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
 - Big fan.

144
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
 - Oh, God.

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
 - There you go.

146
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
 - There's a chance.

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
 - Yeah.

148
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
 - What gesture would you use, Andy?

149
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
 - For a bomb.

150
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,040
 - Let's say we're on a call right now. We're on a Zoom call. I don't think it's too much

151
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,720
 behind the scenes to say. If there's a bomb threat and you need to let us know, but you

152
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,280
 can't tell anyone out loud because you don't want to scare the other elves because you're

153
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
 in the QA office, what would you do?

154
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,480
 - I would do the classic. I would do my head exploding.

155
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,640
 - Yeah. But the problem is you work at QI, and that people do that all the time when

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
 they're told that you're right.

157
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 - You're right.

158
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 - You're right.

159
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,100
 - I feel like Andy's the worst person for this because he also comes from an improv background.

160
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,360
 So he would just be, I need to, you know, he'd be trying to use all the tricks that

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
 no one would know.

162
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,960
 - A suggestion for a kind of explosive, please.

163
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,680
 - Well, we didn't have to keep it secret, but we have had a bomb threat interrupt us

164
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,120
 during a recording, and it ends, it ends one of the fish shows from very long ago. And so

165
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,960
 what happened there was Alex just came through the door and went, we need to leave, there's

166
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
 a bomb.

167
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,800
 - With a belt strapped for himself, he said, I want to be on this show more.

168
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,320
 - I think what happened there, was it not that someone rang up and said that there's

169
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,960
 a bomb threat in your streets because they'd seen it on the news or something. And Alex

170
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,680
 looked out of the window and sure enough, there was no one there, apart from a load

171
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,320
 of police. And then he came and told us.

172
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
 - Yeah, it was all cornered off. And we just, they, they was...

173
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
 - It wasn't a real bomb.

174
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,240
 - It was a car that had been left there for a while.

175
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,480
 - Yeah, because my old, my old, my other, private eye, we have had a World War II bomb at the

176
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,880
 end of our street. And again, the whole street had to be evacuated and, you know...

177
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 - Who did you upset? Go ring.

178
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,040
 - Yeah, yeah. We're up to the minute with our sasa. We're constantly having to go with

179
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,540
 that girling guy.

180
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,480
 - Carina Diazza writes, great name. Just a quick one to add to the story of one of your

181
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,760
 listeners told about becoming sleepy when listening to fish. What a beginner. I've been listening

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,360
 to fish every single night since 2015, which awarded me the incredible skill of using the

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,680
 podcast as a general anaesthetic. So much so, Carina writes, I listened to it during

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,680
 the labor and birth of both my children when I am at the dentists and I use the Stephen

185
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,160
 Fry episode in particular to manage my fear of flying.

186
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,400
 - Wow. We could sell this to the NHS then or something.

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

188
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
 - Cool.

189
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,480
 - That's a good idea. That can go with endoscopy live.

190
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,120
 - They're, I don't know that they would work. Distraction does work against pain. There was

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,640
 the thing about if you swear a lot, then it stops things being as painful. So if you put

192
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,680
 your hand into some really, really cold water, you can keep it in for longer if you're swearing

193
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,160
 all the time. So maybe the person who listens just really hates us and is listening going,

194
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,720
 that was fucking easy. That's what gets rid of the pain. I don't know.

195
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 - That's true. There's the Billy Connolly study we spoke about once as well, where people

196
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,040
 were played Billy Connolly while their hand was in ice cold water, I think something like

197
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040
 that as well. And they could resist it for longer.

198
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
 - He's very sweary.

199
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 - Well, they were distracted.

200
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
 - Oh, sorry. They were distracted. It wasn't that he was swearing like a proxy swearing.

201
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,160
 Him swearing makes it easier for them to stand the pain. No. Okay. Got it. Got it.

202
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,280
 - Wait. So James is saying that you put your hand in ice cold water to withstand pain. And

203
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,960
 then you're saying you have to listen to Billy Connolly so close.

204
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
 - No, I'm saying this.

205
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
 - Is that ice cold water?

206
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
 - I'm saying there's two different...

207
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
 - So you have to listen to Billy Connolly.

208
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
 - There's two different...

209
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 - What?

210
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,920
 - I don't know. I know. But we're saying that basically if you're in pain, you have to put

211
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
 your hand in ice cold water.

212
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
 - No, no, no, no, no.

213
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
 - If you're able to do that, you have to listen to Billy Connolly.

214
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 - No, no, no, no.

215
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
 - Does that know what you were saying?

216
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,480
 - No, I wasn't. So the way that you... If you're in an experiment and you want to put someone

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
 in pain, you can't punch them in the face. So the way that you do it is you put their

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,720
 hand in ice cold water to make it painful.

219
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,600
 - I see. I thought you were saying that could distract you. If you're in labor, dunk your

220
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,520
 hand in ice cold water and that pain will distract you from the coming birth pain.

221
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,880
 - You look up, you look up, doctor takes off his mask. It's Billy Connolly. That's a good

222
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,140
 distraction from the pain, but it's hard to roll out nationally.

223
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,640
 - It is, yeah, yeah.

224
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,720
 - Yeah. Anyway, thank you, Karina. She says she does also enjoy the content while conscious.

225
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,840
 Here's this very medically themed show. This is an anonymous email. Just with the relevant...

226
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,360
 Actually, it's not irrelevant. It's just a good anecdote, but they have to remain anonymous

227
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
 because of the nature of the anecdote, which is what drew me to it.

228
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,400
 - This one really needs to stay private, says the writer. Don't even mention my forename

229
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,040
 if you read it out.

230
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,080
 - My son donated stem cells to a cancer patient, a woman in her 60s. The donation process was

231
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,880
 anonymous, but after her recovery, she requested to meet my son.

232
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,080
 - Okay.

233
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,000
 - When they met, she asked him if he has a seafood allergy because she has developed

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,760
 one since the transplant.

235
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,000
 - His part is, we don't know if he has a seafood allergy or not because we are strictly

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 kosher. So not only do we not know, we likely never will.

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 - That's interesting.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,160
 - That's so interesting. I'm surprised you didn't have to check a box or something on

239
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,320
 a form when you fill that out.

240
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,960
 - Yeah, I guess it's not.

241
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,880
 - As far as I remember, because I read a story about how someone inherited a peanut allergy,

242
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,920
 so you could basically transfer that, and they weren't 100% sure what was going on.

243
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,400
 It's like a science that's being looked into at the moment. It's my memory of it. Maybe

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
 they know more now.

245
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
 - I think that's right.

246
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,440
 - Do you remember one of you guys was sitting at the table with me in New Zealand when a

247
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,160
 lady came up and told us a story about her daughter having had a transplant, and is this

248
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,600
 ringing any bells? It's like a blood transfusion, which meant that when you do a test on her,

249
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,120
 she has different DNA.

250
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,640
 - She comes up as a different gender, I think, isn't she?

251
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,600
 - Yeah, she comes up as a different gender.

252
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,640
 - So that's usually a bone marrow transplant.

253
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,920
 - That's what it was.

254
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
 - Yeah.

255
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
 - Yeah.

256
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
 - How fascinating.

257
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,720
 - That's good. We've had loads of emails about the... Do you remember we did that section

258
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,000
 on the Spanish language, and they don't have a word for the differentiate between afternoon

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and evening?

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 - Sydney Opera House, that was.

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 - Parade.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 - Yeah.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 - Did the Opera House.

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 - Oh, yeah.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 - As Dad would say.

267
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 - Dad does his sexy stuff.

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 - Dad does stop saying it like that.

269
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,400
 - Well, we've got... Honestly, we've had almost as many emails about this as we did about

270
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,400
 writing on ATV, and that was a lot. But these are more varied. So Enrique Duran writes, "You

271
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,800
 didn't mention the hilarious and useful concept we rely on. Tare de noche." So Tare day is

272
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 afternoon slash evening, night is noche. And that sort of means evening, because you say

273
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,320
 nos vemos por la tarde, and you don't know... You can't do the afternoon, but you can do

274
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,000
 the evening. But you can say, "You're solo puede por la tarde noche. I'm available in

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 the afternoon evening."

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,120
 - It's funny how that Spanish accent started off really good, and then went west country

277
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
 right at the end.

278
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,200
 - Tare de noche. Oh, yeah. So that's a loophole there. You could just say the afternoon night.

279
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 - Yeah.

280
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,960
 - We'll say, "Oh, it's the evening." But Malen Unden from Sweden writes, "We're equally

281
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,360
 disturbed that in English you call everything before lunch the morning. Whereas for us,

282
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,680
 there is a split between morning, morgon, and for noon, formidag."

283
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,760
 - Again, the west country came out there at the end.

284
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,720
 - It felt like the ringzish morgon.

285
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,320
 - For morgon, formidag. So morning is morgon, and for noon, formidag.

286
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,560
 - Well, presumably that's just a few hours before noon. Like, when's the casting?

287
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,520
 - Right. I think that must be it. I don't know where the gutter goes.

288
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,640
 - It's probably, this is in Sweden, right?

289
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,880
 So in the summer, their mornings start really early so that you might as well split it up

290
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,840
 into more sections, whereas no one here gets up before nine o'clock.

291
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,680
 - What time do they get up there, Anna?

292
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
 - In Sweden?

293
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
 - Yeah.

294
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,200
 - I don't know, but if the sun comes up at three, you're probably going to get up at

295
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
 3.30, aren't you?

296
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
 - You've got paradins, don't you?

297
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
 - Well, I mean, if you don't.

298
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 - No, they don't.

299
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
 - Yeah, they don't.

300
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
 - You've got the Swedes.

301
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
 - It's weird.

302
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,760
 - And Malyn just adds this little final kick. Another issue with English is that you lack

303
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,680
 separate words for thin and warm socks.

304
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
 - Oh.

305
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 - Not necessary for us, mostly.

306
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,040
 - I mean, you could just use the adjective, cut you.

307
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
 - Yeah.

308
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
 - Well, yeah, yeah.

309
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
 - I guess that's what they say about afternoon and evening, isn't it?

310
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
 - Yeah.

311
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,040
 - You could just use the afternoon night adjective to distinguish night from afternoon night.

312
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
 - Yeah.

313
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
 - We all manage, don't we?

314
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
 - That's the new code.

315
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,360
 - Everyone gets by. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do think that's cool. Actually, I tried

316
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,120
 on our socks. Do you remember the fan made us some socks recently?

317
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
 - Oh, yeah.

318
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,800
 - But I wore my moss green socks. They were fantastic.

319
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 - Were they?

320
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 - They were so good.

321
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
 - Mine are really good.

322
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 - Yeah, really cozy.

323
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,400
 Anyway, we've had something about Dan. Do you want to hear this?

324
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
 - Yeah, sure.

325
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,720
 - It's good. Jamie Lerner Brecher. Loving the Taub Recordings. On the most recent episode,

326
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,800
 you all, as usual, made fun of Dan's accent and called his Spanish accent racist.

327
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,960
 - Can I just say, I think it was the general feel of the room

328
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,720
 of 3,000 people in Sydney who thought it was racist, rather than us individually.

329
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,480
 - Yes. Whereas I thought it was funny. So, yeah, but you do think racist things are

330
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
 funny, aren't you?

331
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,800
 - Well, that's not the point of the email, I guess.

332
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,960
 - When Dan does his actually racist accents, we cut them out. That's the thing.

333
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
 - Don't do that.

334
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,080
 - We wouldn't have left it in if it was one of his really racist ones.

335
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 - That's true.

336
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 - That's not true.

337
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 - It's not true.

338
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
 - Sorry.

339
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
 - I can't say that's true.

340
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,000
 - That's not true. To clarify, that's a joke.

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 - Really funny one.

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,720
 Jamie writes, "As someone who speaks Spanish, you are really missing out on making fun of

343
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,980
 Dan's actual Spanish accent. When he gave the translation for 'tos', 'de los pies',

344
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,880
 I had to listen to the English translation to figure out what the hell he was saying.

345
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,000
 I had literally no idea what he could possibly have said in Spanish, and I speak it. I think

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
 for something to come across as racist, there has to be a sort of idea of what culture or

347
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,560
 race the person is making fun of, and I can say in full honesty, I would have had zero

348
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,680
 idea that Dan was trying to speak Spanish. I played this part of the show back for my

349
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,920
 mum, and she had a good laugh about it too.

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 - Exaggerated.

351
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,640
 - It goes on. Before now, the worst Spanish accent I had heard was from Giles Brandrith,

352
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
 but Dan brought it to new heights.

353
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,400
 - Your Honor, I couldn't possibly be racist because I'm completely ignorant about the

354
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 race I'm talking about.

355
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 - So there you go. Off the hook.

356
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 - That's great.

357
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
 - Thank God I got my accent lessons from Giles Brandrith.

358
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,760
 - Oh, dear. A bit of sad news now, I'm afraid. We've got Sad Fish Corner. Emilia Victoria

359
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,360
 writes, "I was just listening to your 500th episode and went to look for pictures of Cassius

360
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
 to find out the awful news. Do you remember Cassius?"

361
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
 - The crocodile.

362
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 - Bingo.

363
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 - Oh, yeah.

364
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 - He was a big, big crocodile.

365
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 - Big one.

366
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 - Yeah. Biggest ever. Or no, we didn't know how old he was. Is that right?

367
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
 - That's right.

368
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
 - Or how big he was.

369
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 - We didn't know how big he was because he was so big, no one could get close enough

370
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
 to measure it.

371
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 - Well, we now know how big he is because he's died, sadly.

372
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
 - That was on the news, wasn't it, when he died quite extensively, I think.

373
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 - We were on tour at the time, so I missed it.

374
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
 - How big was he?

375
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 - He was very big. He was 5.48 meters long.

376
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 - Wow.

377
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 - And apparently they're waiting on necropsy results to know his age.

378
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 - Was he the one who was in Crocodile Dundee?

379
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 - I think, I don't know.

380
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 - I can't remember.

381
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 - I can't remember. Or was he in Live and Let Die, where, you know, Roger Moore jumps

382
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 over the crocodile. I don't remember.

383
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 - He doesn't jump over. He walks on his head as a stepping stone.

384
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
 - Oh.

385
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 - Have you seen that scene, James? It's one of the greatest movie scenes ever.

386
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,360
 He needs to get across a lake of crocodiles and all their heads are sticking out.

387
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,360
 And he literally, like a Takashi Castle style challenge, runs across their heads and gets

388
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
 to the other side. It's incredible.

389
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,360
 - So were they both real crocodiles in that scene?

390
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 - Yeah, they're real.

391
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
 - And it was real Roger Moore?

392
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
 - It wasn't real Roger Moore.

393
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 - Oh.

394
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 - Roger Moore was in his mid-70s by the time this film was filmed.

395
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
 It's a very brave stuntman.

396
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 - Am I right about that, Andy? That scene?

397
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
 - Yeah.

398
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 - I feel like I'm making that up now.

399
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
 - You can see the outtakes where the crocodiles are lashing around and they nearly get him.

400
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 - And he falls in at one point, doesn't he? Yeah, he kind of goes down.

401
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 - Does he actually stand on real-life crocodiles?

402
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
 - Yeah.

403
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
 - Oh, okay, but it's different time, isn't it?

404
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 - He's moving quickly across the... Oh, come on. You're not saying you wouldn't film that today, would you?

405
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 - What? Stomping on crocodiles?

406
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 - He's walking across their backs. They're very big and powerful.

407
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 - They like it.

408
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 - It's not a monster.

409
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
 - They like it. The oldest excuse.

410
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 - Maybe you wouldn't today. Maybe you wouldn't today.

411
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
 - They were asking for it. Did you see what they were wearing?

412
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 - Okay. I think we need to move on quickly.

413
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,360
 There's a little bit of parish business from Gina Chadderton who created the Zine that we talked about a few episodes ago.

414
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,360
 There's a little magazine of us. And she said, "I'm very glad you weren't all horribly offended by the Zine."

415
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
 I think you were, Anna, but that doesn't matter.

416
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 - Oh, well, I've quit. Yeah, I handed in my notice. It's three months.

417
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,360
 - And we gave it a little shout-out. And anyway, she has popped a free to download digital version of the Zine on her website.

418
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:15,360
 So it's georgerexcomics.com. George like the name George. Rex like Rex. Exactly.

419
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
 And it's on there and it's free to download. And it's good. It's funny.

420
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,360
 - Yeah. It'll let you do a little quiz to decide which member of NoSageSingersFish you are.

421
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,360
 - Yeah. And there's an episode name generator. It's brilliant. It's really good. So thank you very much, Gina.

422
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 We've had an email from a record holder who had a record that we talked about a few episodes ago.

423
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,360
 Oh, you guys actually, this is one of the ones I sadly had to miss. This is from Colton J. Proveas.

424
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,360
 Colton is a previous record holder of the longest baton.

425
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 - Oh. Wow.

426
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,360
 - Set in Mountain View, California by the Googler Orchestra. And the baton was 4.92 meters.

427
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,360
 And that was the one that was broken, I believe. And they apparently are determined to get it back.

428
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 The guy who made it Emmanuel Pacheco. Pacheco.

429
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 - What happened to it? Oh, get the record back. Sorry. They didn't have the baton stolen.

430
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,360
 - Oh, sorry. He says we likely won't challenge the new one that Brown have won.

431
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,360
 - Okay. That's confusing. That's a confusing pair of bits of information you gave us.

432
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 - No, sorry. I hadn't read. Sometimes I don't read all the way to the end. I like to surprise myself.

433
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 Although apparently Emmanuel does have an extension long enough to regain the record.

434
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
 So it feels like that's just something to wield.

435
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,360
 - I mean, if you just get two of these really long ones and sellotate them together, is that not just going to win?

436
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,360
 - I think it would be fine. It just has to be used to conduct a piece of music. It mustn't break during the performance.

437
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,360
 - Oh, there was all things about the bend. You know, there's a lot of details.

438
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 - That's true. Yes, but he does say it doesn't need to be a single solid piece.

439
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,360
 The one we use broke down into multiple pieces so it could be shoved in a ski bag and carried across the US-Canada border.

440
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,360
 - Smuggle them. Your ass would not be.

441
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 - When you say US-Canada border at time of recording.

442
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,360
 - Sorry. Yes. That's obviously a historical border which used to exist.

443
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 There's also Dave Taylor writes, "I know the subject of this email scenes worrying and believe me it is.

444
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
 I hate to open old wounds, but this is in regards to bassoon gate."

445
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,360
 - Oh, Jesus Christ.

446
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
 - Jesus. I do love it.

447
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,360
 - Go back to the first drop of the line if you need. Anyway, context.

448
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,360
 In 1999, the pianist Maria-Juaul Perez. I presume you're a fan of Dan.

449
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
 - Yeah, I've seen. I've watched her.

450
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
 - Have you?

451
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,360
 - Well, I know. This is a thing that I use as evidence where she can't remember the piece, right? Is that what's going to be around?

452
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
 - Oh my God, have you? Have you?

453
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,360
 - Andy. Andy. Dan is now the world expert on this subject.

454
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 - Absolutely. The amount of correspondence he's had.

455
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
 - I'm so sorry, Dan.

456
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,360
 - You're absolutely right. No, sorry. It was an open rehearsal. So it was like a rehearsal with an audience.

457
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,360
 And she had prepared a concerto, but the orchestra started it and she realized she had learnt the wrong piece.

458
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 And after a moment of panic, she managed to play the correct concerto completely from memory.

459
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,360
 And Dave writes, "This is evidence that classical musicians can perform complicated pieces of music from memory just as long as they put some bloody effort in."

460
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,360
 So there we go. So that's evidence on your side, Dan.

461
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,360
 - It's really worth watching, by the way, everyone listening. She's panicking like crazy and the conductor's next to her talking her down,

462
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,360
 just going, "You know it. You know this piece. Come on. You can do it."

463
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,360
 And then the moment comes and she just has to lean into it and it comes out perfectly. It's really beautiful.

464
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 - Wow.

465
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
 - Yeah, it's great.

466
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 - He pulls an enormous baton out of his ass.

467
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,360
 - Oh, dear. Thank you so much, everybody, for writing. We love getting the emails.

468
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,360
 It's podcast@qi.com. If something has happened in your life or you have a bit of bonus information that's relevant to what we've talked about,

469
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
 please do write in because it's great fun to chat.

470
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 Bye.

471
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,360
 - Great.

472
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
 - Did you tell them where to send the emails?

473
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,360
 - I did say podcast@qi.com. Glad to know you've paid scrupulous attention.

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,360
 - Sorry. You know what? There was a little bit of butter on my wire and I wondered where it came from.

475
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,360

476
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,360
 - That is nice to know. It is also a bit tragic to know how easily the audience's attention can be rested away from me.

477
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,360

478
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,360
 - I've been in constant pain for 12 years and nothing you've said has helped it.

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:50,360
 - Eventually I'll reach the end. It's like the worst magic trick ever.

481
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,360
 - Your clowning show is very, very blue, isn't it?

482
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 Right. Bye.
