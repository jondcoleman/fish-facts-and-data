WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560
 - Hi, everybody. - One, two, one, two. Oh, sorry, Andy. I was just testing my mic.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.280
 - Were you really good to test? - That's funny, because this happens every time we

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.920
 do this show, isn't it? - Weird, isn't it? Yeah, it's as if it's a systematic campaign

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.520
 to undermine me. - Or perhaps Andy should wait for us to test

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.200
 our mics. - All right. Maybe I'll just wait forever.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.240
 And I won't read any of the juicy, juicy stuff we've got in the fridge.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.800
 - No, read it. We love it. We love it. Come on.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.440
 - Hello, everybody. Welcome to Drop Us Align. This is our audience feedback/microphone testing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.520
 segment. And we've got some cracking stuff. We've had Christmas in the inbox, so it's

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.640
 been very festive in there. What are you guys, do you know what? What are you guys fancy

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720
 starting with? Do you fancy a correction? - Complaint. Complaint, please.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.560
 - Oh, great. Okay. Here's an eminent correction to start. This is from Noah Trudeau.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.720
 - Whoa. How closely related to the now disgraced foreign president?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.240
 - He doesn't say, but he is the assistant professor of economics at Troy University.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 Is that in the 51st state of America? Or is it in... - It's in... It's in... It's actual

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.040
 Troy University. So most of their studies are about, like, should we take this big wooden

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.080
 horse in? Will it have a good effect on the city's economy? Long term, yes, probably.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.800
 No, no. Troy, Alabama. I didn't know that was Troy, Alabama.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 - Oh, sorry. It's in America. No, I didn't know that.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.480
 - Well, Noah says, "Long term, listen, a first time emailer, always thought my first

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.880
 email would be regarding economics, as I am a professor of economics. However, this is

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 about riding a television." - Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.480
 - Right. Now, I have waded through a lot of this in the fin box. In episode 563, Brisbane,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.280
 one of the facts related to the NEI-SS data from the United States, mentioned an injury

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.560
 sustained by a person who, while riding on a TV, when he ran into a turkey, lost control

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.840
 and ran into a tree. As someone who grew up in rural Alabama, this has to be a clerical

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.760
 error. I've had multiple friends involved in ATV, Brackett's all-terrain vehicle accidents,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.120
 but have yet to account for anyone who has ridden a television into a tree. And amazingly,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.560
 so we got a lot of emails about this. He's the only one who found the original report

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.000
 from 2014 and tracked down the specific entry about the 21-year-old man who was treated and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.760
 hospitalized after fracturing a vertebrae. - Well done, Noah.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.920
 - Very nice. I do remember, because on the night in Brisbane, when we did this, I was

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.920
 reading this out, there was a bit of debate from the front row about whether or not it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.840
 was a TV or an ATV. And that didn't make it to the edit, but I since, when I got back,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.000
 I sometimes have dreams now about my facts and I wake up and I just have to get my phone

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.040
 out and double check things at like 3 a.m. And the article I got it from was either a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.880
 Guardian or Independent in the UK, and it very specifically is ATV, a television.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 - Wow.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.680
 - Yeah, so I read what I'd sourced correctly, but I should have gone to find the 2014 article

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.760
 where a boy broke a vertebrae. - Wait, hang on. So the thing you read, it actually

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.280
 put a space between A and TV and the Guardian article. That is the Guardian, isn't it?

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.280
 - Well, one of those, I can bring it up while we're on here.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.480
 - The Guardian for international listeners is renowned for their typos in print. And

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.840
 they're nicknamed the "Groundy Ed" and it's very funny.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840
 - Very funny.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 - Here's some.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.680
 - And I just quickly, I just, I really don't want to write in. I just casually dropped in

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.360
 about Justin Trudeau being the ex-president and I don't want anyone to write in and explain

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.400
 that he's the Prime Minister. I get it. Okay, it was just, I misspoke momentarily.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.320
 - Yeah, and can I also say my 51st state joke was just a bit of satire. I don't actually

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.480
 think that America should take over Canada.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.560
 - Well, we don't know though. This doesn't go out for another week. It might be by the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560
 time this airs.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.080
 - Maybe by the time this airs, Noah will have been installed as the kind of puppet vizier,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.640
 all right, Canada.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.960
 - I quite like that Noah studies at Troy. You've got a famous wooden object going into

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.240
 Troy and then you have a man who built a wooden structure to, it's, it's, it's a lot of, there's

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 a lot going on there.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.920
 - He probably, he probably gets that all the time. I sometimes worry we're too obvious

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.920
 with our jokes about people with great names. I don't think he will get that one all the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
 time. That's brilliant.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.160
 - All right, here's Amelia Brownstein. Brownstein, Brownstein. It's Amelia, right?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
 - Is it Brownstein?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.200
 - It's not Brownstein. Although this is relevant to the, to the subject of Amelia's email.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.880
 She said, I have worked in veterinary medicine for some years and the key takeaway from this,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.600
 I want to make clear, do not pull string coming out of your animals butt.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 - Oh.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.160
 - Oh, okay. Good. Public service.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160
 - Yeah.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 - Did we say that you should?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
 - Do not pull string.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160
 - So this is the other thing.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.720
 - I always thought, like my cat doesn't meow very much, but I thought if there was a string

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.040
 there that I pulled, she might go meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, like a toy.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.720
 - Was that the thing on the show? Did we talk about a dog swallowing tinsel or something?

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.040
 - We talked about a dog swallowing tinsel and Dan wondered whether there has ever been

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.840
 an instance where a dog had tinsel coming out of its mouth and its rectum at the same

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.840
 time.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840
 - That's right.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840
 - And you could turn it into a spit roast.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.480
 - Well, no, just you can put the dog on the tree and say, that is the tinsel.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.760
 - Yeah. Well, anyway, look, Amelia makes very clear.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.200
 This is really bad. It risks bowel strangulation, necrosis, gut contents leaking through the

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.080
 body cavity, which is bad news bears, she says. So don't do it.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.720
 - So are you just supposed to leave a string hanging out of your dog's arse for its whole

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 life?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.400
 - No. You're meant to contact a professional who will, I think, deal with it, which goes

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.960
 into a lot of detail about, you know, like twisting bowels and rather upsetting stuff.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.480
 But basically, if you are lucky enough to have access to an endoscope, you always, always

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.800
 need to palpate the entire bowel. So just remember that. I think that's the take away.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.520
 Palpate is a massaging along the length of something, you know, a bit like palpitations,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.240
 but not quite. So anyway, be very, very careful.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240
 - Okay.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 - Noted.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240
 - Noted.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.960
 - I reckon if you own an endoscope, you probably already know all this stuff.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.240
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right. Can you do a self-endoscopy? I bet you can, can't you?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 Of course you can.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.960
 - Well, in theory, it's possible for sure. But...

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 - Is it recommended?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.960
 - No, I don't think so. I think get a professional, I would say.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.080
 - Have they ever done a TV show where it's an endoscope going all the way through someone's

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.800
 body? Like, it's the journey of a piece of food?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.520
 - I think it feels like that has been done. Yeah. I think that would be good.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.640
 - Wasn't that what the Millennium Dome was? Do you remember in the Millennium Dome, you

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.080
 went through a whole, a person's digestive system, didn't you?

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080
 - Did you?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.400
 - I thought there was, I think you could go through the whole human body. That's like

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400
 an endoscope.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.720
 - Yeah, you did. But that wasn't the same as what Andy was saying.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.240
 - No, I'm pitching a TV show.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.520
 - It's not exactly the same, no.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.520
 - I think Endoscopy Live is a good TV show. And I think we all know TV is in the doldrums

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.720
 and need to make cheap TV these days.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720
 - It's in the shit.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.440
 - It's in the shit. You could do a different episode for every species. That's, like, immediate

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.440
 100-year commission.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440
 - All right.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.160
 - Who would, which would be the human you would go for? Because if you're doing one

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.920
 episode for each species, you only have one chance to choose the perfect human to put

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.920
 a camera up.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.400
 - That's got to be Atombrough, right?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400
 - Atombrough.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.480
 - What? He doesn't eat the animals he observes.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.960
 - That's the misconception, Anna. He does. He says, "I have to know."

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.000
 Okay. Here is an email from Andrew Conlon. Listen to the most recent bonus app. This

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.600
 is Drop the Line on Drop the Line.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.920
 - The bit about specific tannoy instructions in M&S.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.000
 - Oh, yeah. Code 4.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.120
 - Someone stood a poo in the changing room? Was that it?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120
 - Yeah.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.560
 - Yeah. It reminded me of a specific code we had in a call centre. When we trained new

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.080
 staff, we had to give them the specific hand gesture to use if someone called the phone

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.080
 line with a bomb threat. I can't remember exactly the gesture, but it evolved standing

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.520
 or making a fist. It was presumably quite confusing because it makes it look like you're

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520
 celebrating.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.480
 - Yeah. You've just landed a deal.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.440
 - Yeah. I didn't give it much thought. I just assumed it was something all call centres

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.520
 did. Only listening to last week's bonus did I tweak it. It might be because we worked

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.520
 in Northern Ireland.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520
 - Oh.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520
 - Big fan.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520
 - Oh, God.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520
 - There you go.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520
 - There's a chance.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520
 - Yeah.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520
 - What gesture would you use, Andy?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
 - For a bomb.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.040
 - Let's say we're on a call right now. We're on a Zoom call. I don't think it's too much

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.720
 behind the scenes to say. If there's a bomb threat and you need to let us know, but you

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.280
 can't tell anyone out loud because you don't want to scare the other elves because you're

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.240
 in the QA office, what would you do?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.480
 - I would do the classic. I would do my head exploding.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.640
 - Yeah. But the problem is you work at QI, and that people do that all the time when

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640
 they're told that you're right.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640
 - You're right.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640
 - You're right.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.100
 - I feel like Andy's the worst person for this because he also comes from an improv background.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.360
 So he would just be, I need to, you know, he'd be trying to use all the tricks that

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360
 no one would know.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.960
 - A suggestion for a kind of explosive, please.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.680
 - Well, we didn't have to keep it secret, but we have had a bomb threat interrupt us

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.120
 during a recording, and it ends, it ends one of the fish shows from very long ago. And so

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.960
 what happened there was Alex just came through the door and went, we need to leave, there's

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960
 a bomb.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.800
 - With a belt strapped for himself, he said, I want to be on this show more.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.320
 - I think what happened there, was it not that someone rang up and said that there's

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.960
 a bomb threat in your streets because they'd seen it on the news or something. And Alex

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.680
 looked out of the window and sure enough, there was no one there, apart from a load

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.320
 of police. And then he came and told us.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.680
 - Yeah, it was all cornered off. And we just, they, they was...

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.680
 - It wasn't a real bomb.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.240
 - It was a car that had been left there for a while.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.480
 - Yeah, because my old, my old, my other, private eye, we have had a World War II bomb at the

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.880
 end of our street. And again, the whole street had to be evacuated and, you know...

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 - Who did you upset? Go ring.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.040
 - Yeah, yeah. We're up to the minute with our sasa. We're constantly having to go with

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.540
 that girling guy.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.480
 - Carina Diazza writes, great name. Just a quick one to add to the story of one of your

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.760
 listeners told about becoming sleepy when listening to fish. What a beginner. I've been listening

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.360
 to fish every single night since 2015, which awarded me the incredible skill of using the

00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.680
 podcast as a general anaesthetic. So much so, Carina writes, I listened to it during

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.680
 the labor and birth of both my children when I am at the dentists and I use the Stephen

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.160
 Fry episode in particular to manage my fear of flying.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.400
 - Wow. We could sell this to the NHS then or something.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400
 - Cool.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.480
 - That's a good idea. That can go with endoscopy live.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.120
 - They're, I don't know that they would work. Distraction does work against pain. There was

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.640
 the thing about if you swear a lot, then it stops things being as painful. So if you put

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.680
 your hand into some really, really cold water, you can keep it in for longer if you're swearing

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.160
 all the time. So maybe the person who listens just really hates us and is listening going,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.720
 that was fucking easy. That's what gets rid of the pain. I don't know.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.720
 - That's true. There's the Billy Connolly study we spoke about once as well, where people

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.040
 were played Billy Connolly while their hand was in ice cold water, I think something like

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.040
 that as well. And they could resist it for longer.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.040
 - He's very sweary.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.040
 - Well, they were distracted.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 - Oh, sorry. They were distracted. It wasn't that he was swearing like a proxy swearing.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.160
 Him swearing makes it easier for them to stand the pain. No. Okay. Got it. Got it.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.280
 - Wait. So James is saying that you put your hand in ice cold water to withstand pain. And

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.960
 then you're saying you have to listen to Billy Connolly so close.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960
 - No, I'm saying this.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960
 - Is that ice cold water?

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.960
 - I'm saying there's two different...

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960
 - So you have to listen to Billy Connolly.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.960
 - There's two different...

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960
 - What?

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.920
 - I don't know. I know. But we're saying that basically if you're in pain, you have to put

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920
 your hand in ice cold water.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.920
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.920
 - If you're able to do that, you have to listen to Billy Connolly.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.920
 - No, no, no, no.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920
 - Does that know what you were saying?

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.480
 - No, I wasn't. So the way that you... If you're in an experiment and you want to put someone

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.720
 in pain, you can't punch them in the face. So the way that you do it is you put their

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.720
 hand in ice cold water to make it painful.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.600
 - I see. I thought you were saying that could distract you. If you're in labor, dunk your

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.520
 hand in ice cold water and that pain will distract you from the coming birth pain.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.880
 - You look up, you look up, doctor takes off his mask. It's Billy Connolly. That's a good

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.140
 distraction from the pain, but it's hard to roll out nationally.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.640
 - It is, yeah, yeah.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.720
 - Yeah. Anyway, thank you, Karina. She says she does also enjoy the content while conscious.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.840
 Here's this very medically themed show. This is an anonymous email. Just with the relevant...

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.360
 Actually, it's not irrelevant. It's just a good anecdote, but they have to remain anonymous

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.720
 because of the nature of the anecdote, which is what drew me to it.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.400
 - This one really needs to stay private, says the writer. Don't even mention my forename

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.040
 if you read it out.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.080
 - My son donated stem cells to a cancer patient, a woman in her 60s. The donation process was

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.880
 anonymous, but after her recovery, she requested to meet my son.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.080
 - Okay.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.000
 - When they met, she asked him if he has a seafood allergy because she has developed

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.760
 one since the transplant.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.000
 - His part is, we don't know if he has a seafood allergy or not because we are strictly

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 kosher. So not only do we not know, we likely never will.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 - That's interesting.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.160
 - That's so interesting. I'm surprised you didn't have to check a box or something on

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.320
 a form when you fill that out.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.960
 - Yeah, I guess it's not.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.880
 - As far as I remember, because I read a story about how someone inherited a peanut allergy,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.920
 so you could basically transfer that, and they weren't 100% sure what was going on.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.400
 It's like a science that's being looked into at the moment. It's my memory of it. Maybe

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400
 they know more now.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.200
 - I think that's right.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.440
 - Do you remember one of you guys was sitting at the table with me in New Zealand when a

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.160
 lady came up and told us a story about her daughter having had a transplant, and is this

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.600
 ringing any bells? It's like a blood transfusion, which meant that when you do a test on her,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.120
 she has different DNA.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.640
 - She comes up as a different gender, I think, isn't she?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.600
 - Yeah, she comes up as a different gender.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.640
 - So that's usually a bone marrow transplant.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.920
 - That's what it was.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.920
 - How fascinating.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.720
 - That's good. We've had loads of emails about the... Do you remember we did that section

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.000
 on the Spanish language, and they don't have a word for the differentiate between afternoon

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 and evening?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 - Sydney Opera House, that was.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 - Parade.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 - Yeah.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 - Did the Opera House.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 - Oh, yeah.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 - As Dad would say.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 - Dad does his sexy stuff.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 - Dad does stop saying it like that.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.400
 - Well, we've got... Honestly, we've had almost as many emails about this as we did about

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 writing on ATV, and that was a lot. But these are more varied. So Enrique Duran writes, "You

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.800
 didn't mention the hilarious and useful concept we rely on. Tare de noche." So Tare day is

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 afternoon slash evening, night is noche. And that sort of means evening, because you say

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.320
 nos vemos por la tarde, and you don't know... You can't do the afternoon, but you can do

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.000
 the evening. But you can say, "You're solo puede por la tarde noche. I'm available in

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 the afternoon evening."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.120
 - It's funny how that Spanish accent started off really good, and then went west country

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120
 right at the end.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.200
 - Tare de noche. Oh, yeah. So that's a loophole there. You could just say the afternoon night.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200
 - Yeah.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.960
 - We'll say, "Oh, it's the evening." But Malen Unden from Sweden writes, "We're equally

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.360
 disturbed that in English you call everything before lunch the morning. Whereas for us,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.680
 there is a split between morning, morgon, and for noon, formidag."

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.760
 - Again, the west country came out there at the end.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.720
 - It felt like the ringzish morgon.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:28.320
 - For morgon, formidag. So morning is morgon, and for noon, formidag.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.560
 - Well, presumably that's just a few hours before noon. Like, when's the casting?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.520
 - Right. I think that must be it. I don't know where the gutter goes.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.640
 - It's probably, this is in Sweden, right?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.880
 So in the summer, their mornings start really early so that you might as well split it up

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.840
 into more sections, whereas no one here gets up before nine o'clock.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.680
 - What time do they get up there, Anna?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680
 - In Sweden?

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.680
 - Yeah.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.200
 - I don't know, but if the sun comes up at three, you're probably going to get up at

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200
 3.30, aren't you?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200
 - You've got paradins, don't you?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.200
 - Well, I mean, if you don't.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200
 - No, they don't.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200
 - Yeah, they don't.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200
 - You've got the Swedes.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 - It's weird.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.760
 - And Malyn just adds this little final kick. Another issue with English is that you lack

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.680
 separate words for thin and warm socks.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.680
 - Oh.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.680
 - Not necessary for us, mostly.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.040
 - I mean, you could just use the adjective, cut you.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.040
 - Well, yeah, yeah.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.040
 - I guess that's what they say about afternoon and evening, isn't it?

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.040
 - You could just use the afternoon night adjective to distinguish night from afternoon night.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040
 - We all manage, don't we?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040
 - That's the new code.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.360
 - Everyone gets by. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do think that's cool. Actually, I tried

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.120
 on our socks. Do you remember the fan made us some socks recently?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120
 - Oh, yeah.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.800
 - But I wore my moss green socks. They were fantastic.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 - Were they?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 - They were so good.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.800
 - Mine are really good.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 - Yeah, really cozy.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.400
 Anyway, we've had something about Dan. Do you want to hear this?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
 - Yeah, sure.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.720
 - It's good. Jamie Lerner Brecher. Loving the Taub Recordings. On the most recent episode,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.800
 you all, as usual, made fun of Dan's accent and called his Spanish accent racist.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.960
 - Can I just say, I think it was the general feel of the room

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.720
 of 3,000 people in Sydney who thought it was racist, rather than us individually.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.480
 - Yes. Whereas I thought it was funny. So, yeah, but you do think racist things are

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.480
 funny, aren't you?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.800
 - Well, that's not the point of the email, I guess.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.960
 - When Dan does his actually racist accents, we cut them out. That's the thing.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960
 - Don't do that.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.080
 - We wouldn't have left it in if it was one of his really racist ones.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
 - That's true.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080
 - That's not true.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080
 - It's not true.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080
 - Sorry.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.080
 - I can't say that's true.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.000
 - That's not true. To clarify, that's a joke.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 - Really funny one.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.720
 Jamie writes, "As someone who speaks Spanish, you are really missing out on making fun of

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.980
 Dan's actual Spanish accent. When he gave the translation for 'tos', 'de los pies',

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.880
 I had to listen to the English translation to figure out what the hell he was saying.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.000
 I had literally no idea what he could possibly have said in Spanish, and I speak it. I think

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.280
 for something to come across as racist, there has to be a sort of idea of what culture or

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.560
 race the person is making fun of, and I can say in full honesty, I would have had zero

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.680
 idea that Dan was trying to speak Spanish. I played this part of the show back for my

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.920
 mum, and she had a good laugh about it too.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920
 - Exaggerated.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.640
 - It goes on. Before now, the worst Spanish accent I had heard was from Giles Brandrith,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.640
 but Dan brought it to new heights.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.400
 - Your Honor, I couldn't possibly be racist because I'm completely ignorant about the

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.400
 race I'm talking about.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.400
 - So there you go. Off the hook.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400
 - That's great.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.400
 - Thank God I got my accent lessons from Giles Brandrith.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:35.760
 - Oh, dear. A bit of sad news now, I'm afraid. We've got Sad Fish Corner. Emilia Victoria

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.360
 writes, "I was just listening to your 500th episode and went to look for pictures of Cassius

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.360
 to find out the awful news. Do you remember Cassius?"

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360
 - The crocodile.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.360
 - Bingo.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360
 - Oh, yeah.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360
 - He was a big, big crocodile.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360
 - Big one.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.360
 - Yeah. Biggest ever. Or no, we didn't know how old he was. Is that right?

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360
 - That's right.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360
 - Or how big he was.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.360
 - We didn't know how big he was because he was so big, no one could get close enough

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.360
 to measure it.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.360
 - Well, we now know how big he is because he's died, sadly.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.360
 - That was on the news, wasn't it, when he died quite extensively, I think.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.360
 - We were on tour at the time, so I missed it.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.360
 - How big was he?

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.360
 - He was very big. He was 5.48 meters long.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.360
 - Wow.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.360
 - And apparently they're waiting on necropsy results to know his age.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 - Was he the one who was in Crocodile Dundee?

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.360
 - I think, I don't know.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.360
 - I can't remember.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.360
 - I can't remember. Or was he in Live and Let Die, where, you know, Roger Moore jumps

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360
 over the crocodile. I don't remember.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.360
 - He doesn't jump over. He walks on his head as a stepping stone.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360
 - Oh.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.360
 - Have you seen that scene, James? It's one of the greatest movie scenes ever.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.360
 He needs to get across a lake of crocodiles and all their heads are sticking out.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.360
 And he literally, like a Takashi Castle style challenge, runs across their heads and gets

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.360
 to the other side. It's incredible.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.360
 - So were they both real crocodiles in that scene?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360
 - Yeah, they're real.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360
 - And it was real Roger Moore?

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.360
 - It wasn't real Roger Moore.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360
 - Oh.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.360
 - Roger Moore was in his mid-70s by the time this film was filmed.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.360
 It's a very brave stuntman.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.360
 - Am I right about that, Andy? That scene?

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.360
 - Yeah.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.360
 - I feel like I'm making that up now.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.360
 - You can see the outtakes where the crocodiles are lashing around and they nearly get him.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.360
 - And he falls in at one point, doesn't he? Yeah, he kind of goes down.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.360
 - Does he actually stand on real-life crocodiles?

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360
 - Yeah.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.360
 - Oh, okay, but it's different time, isn't it?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 - He's moving quickly across the... Oh, come on. You're not saying you wouldn't film that today, would you?

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.360
 - What? Stomping on crocodiles?

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.360
 - He's walking across their backs. They're very big and powerful.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360
 - They like it.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360
 - It's not a monster.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.360
 - They like it. The oldest excuse.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.360
 - Maybe you wouldn't today. Maybe you wouldn't today.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.360
 - They were asking for it. Did you see what they were wearing?

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.360
 - Okay. I think we need to move on quickly.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.360
 There's a little bit of parish business from Gina Chadderton who created the Zine that we talked about a few episodes ago.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.360
 There's a little magazine of us. And she said, "I'm very glad you weren't all horribly offended by the Zine."

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.360
 I think you were, Anna, but that doesn't matter.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.360
 - Oh, well, I've quit. Yeah, I handed in my notice. It's three months.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.360
 - And we gave it a little shout-out. And anyway, she has popped a free to download digital version of the Zine on her website.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:15.360
 So it's georgerexcomics.com. George like the name George. Rex like Rex. Exactly.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.360
 And it's on there and it's free to download. And it's good. It's funny.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.360
 - Yeah. It'll let you do a little quiz to decide which member of NoSageSingersFish you are.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:30.360
 - Yeah. And there's an episode name generator. It's brilliant. It's really good. So thank you very much, Gina.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.360
 We've had an email from a record holder who had a record that we talked about a few episodes ago.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 Oh, you guys actually, this is one of the ones I sadly had to miss. This is from Colton J. Proveas.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:48.360
 Colton is a previous record holder of the longest baton.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.360
 - Oh. Wow.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:58.360
 - Set in Mountain View, California by the Googler Orchestra. And the baton was 4.92 meters.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.360
 And that was the one that was broken, I believe. And they apparently are determined to get it back.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.360
 The guy who made it Emmanuel Pacheco. Pacheco.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.360
 - What happened to it? Oh, get the record back. Sorry. They didn't have the baton stolen.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.360
 - Oh, sorry. He says we likely won't challenge the new one that Brown have won.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.360
 - Okay. That's confusing. That's a confusing pair of bits of information you gave us.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.360
 - No, sorry. I hadn't read. Sometimes I don't read all the way to the end. I like to surprise myself.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.360
 Although apparently Emmanuel does have an extension long enough to regain the record.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.360
 So it feels like that's just something to wield.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.360
 - I mean, if you just get two of these really long ones and sellotate them together, is that not just going to win?

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.360
 - I think it would be fine. It just has to be used to conduct a piece of music. It mustn't break during the performance.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.360
 - Oh, there was all things about the bend. You know, there's a lot of details.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.360
 - That's true. Yes, but he does say it doesn't need to be a single solid piece.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.360
 The one we use broke down into multiple pieces so it could be shoved in a ski bag and carried across the US-Canada border.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.360
 - Smuggle them. Your ass would not be.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.360
 - When you say US-Canada border at time of recording.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:12.360
 - Sorry. Yes. That's obviously a historical border which used to exist.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.360
 There's also Dave Taylor writes, "I know the subject of this email scenes worrying and believe me it is.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.360
 I hate to open old wounds, but this is in regards to bassoon gate."

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.360
 - Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.360
 - Jesus. I do love it.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.360
 - Go back to the first drop of the line if you need. Anyway, context.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.360
 In 1999, the pianist Maria-Juaul Perez. I presume you're a fan of Dan.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.360
 - Yeah, I've seen. I've watched her.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.360
 - Have you?

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:44.360
 - Well, I know. This is a thing that I use as evidence where she can't remember the piece, right? Is that what's going to be around?

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.360
 - Oh my God, have you? Have you?

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.360
 - Andy. Andy. Dan is now the world expert on this subject.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.360
 - Absolutely. The amount of correspondence he's had.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.360
 - I'm so sorry, Dan.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.360
 - You're absolutely right. No, sorry. It was an open rehearsal. So it was like a rehearsal with an audience.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.360
 And she had prepared a concerto, but the orchestra started it and she realized she had learnt the wrong piece.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.360
 And after a moment of panic, she managed to play the correct concerto completely from memory.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:16.360
 And Dave writes, "This is evidence that classical musicians can perform complicated pieces of music from memory just as long as they put some bloody effort in."

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.360
 So there we go. So that's evidence on your side, Dan.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:26.360
 - It's really worth watching, by the way, everyone listening. She's panicking like crazy and the conductor's next to her talking her down,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.360
 just going, "You know it. You know this piece. Come on. You can do it."

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.360
 And then the moment comes and she just has to lean into it and it comes out perfectly. It's really beautiful.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360
 - Wow.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360
 - Yeah, it's great.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.360
 - He pulls an enormous baton out of his ass.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.360
 - Oh, dear. Thank you so much, everybody, for writing. We love getting the emails.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.360
 It's podcast@qi.com. If something has happened in your life or you have a bit of bonus information that's relevant to what we've talked about,

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.360
 please do write in because it's great fun to chat.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.360
 Bye.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.360
 - Great.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.360
 - Did you tell them where to send the emails?

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.360
 - I did say podcast@qi.com. Glad to know you've paid scrupulous attention.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:19.360
 - Sorry. You know what? There was a little bit of butter on my wire and I wondered where it came from.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.360
 And I remembered that I had a slice of toast before we came on.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.360
 - That is nice to know. It is also a bit tragic to know how easily the audience's attention can be rested away from me.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.360
 Like a small piece of butter on a wire. It's sufficient to...that'll do it.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.360
 - I've been in constant pain for 12 years and nothing you've said has helped it.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.360
 - That's because you've got Tinsel coming out of your arse, James. You've got to stop pulling it.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:50.360
 - Eventually I'll reach the end. It's like the worst magic trick ever.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.360
 - Your clowning show is very, very blue, isn't it?

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.360
 Right. Bye.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.360
