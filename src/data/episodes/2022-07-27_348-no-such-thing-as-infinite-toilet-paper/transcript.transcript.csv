00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:23,coming from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:25,00:00:28,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:30,00:00:31,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:31,00:00:34,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"My fact is that Sir Roger Penrose,"
00:00:42,00:00:44,"the mathematician who's just won the Nobel Prize,"
00:00:44,00:00:46,once designed a theoretically infinite
00:00:46,00:00:49,geometrical pattern called the Penrose Tiles.
00:00:49,00:00:52,He then sued a toilet paper company for stealing it
00:00:52,00:00:55,and creating a theoretically infinite toilet paper roll.
00:00:55,00:00:58,(laughing)
00:00:58,00:00:59,"Why would you need an infinite,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"well, I suppose everyone's hoarding toilet paper"
00:01:02,00:01:02,"at the moment, aren't they?"
00:01:02,00:01:03,- Exactly. - An infinite one
00:01:03,00:01:05,would be really useful.
00:01:05,00:01:06,"- Okay, so basically, Roger Penrose,"
00:01:06,00:01:08,"he's a brilliant, brilliant mathematician."
00:01:08,00:01:11,"In the 1970s, he invented this thing called Penrose Tiling,"
00:01:11,00:01:15,which basically combines two different rhomboids
00:01:15,00:01:17,that can be repeated ad infinitum.
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Never, this pattern never repeats itself."
00:01:19,00:01:20,It's really amazing.
00:01:20,00:01:22,He had just invented them for fun as well.
00:01:22,00:01:23,He does lots of stuff like this for fun.
00:01:23,00:01:26,He's fun as well as being a mathematician.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"But a few years later, in fact,"
00:01:30,00:01:31,"more than 20 years later actually,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,"after he invented it, his wife was in the supermarket"
00:01:34,00:01:35,and she saw some Kleenex loo paper
00:01:35,00:01:37,"and it looked just like his,"
00:01:37,00:01:38,"she thought, ""I know that pattern."""
00:01:38,00:01:41,And she bought some and she took it home.
00:01:41,00:01:44,"And the firm, the firm which owned Kleenex, Kimberly Clark,"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"they had come up with toilet paper, which copied it."
00:01:47,00:01:48,And he sued.
00:01:48,00:01:50,- Wow. - He sued.
00:01:50,00:01:51,- Successfully?
00:01:51,00:01:53,"- Well, he won't talk about what happened in court."
00:01:53,00:01:56,It was amicably settled outside of court.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- Yeah, but I think the condition was,"
00:01:58,00:02:01,you can't say Roger Pemrose that they gave you
00:02:01,00:02:02,"20 billion quid or whatever,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,whatever the time the sum was.
00:02:04,00:02:06,- If he asked for like one pence
00:02:06,00:02:08,"every time they used his pattern,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,"and this is a pattern that never, ever repeats infinitely,"
00:02:10,00:02:13,then he could just get all the money in the world.
00:02:13,00:02:15,The reason it's useful for a toilet paper
00:02:15,00:02:18,to have this pattern is you want your toilet paper
00:02:18,00:02:19,"to be quilted, right?"
00:02:19,00:02:21,And so it's gonna have a pattern going throughout it
00:02:21,00:02:24,where you have some bits that have got indentation
00:02:24,00:02:25,in some places that don't.
00:02:25,00:02:29,So let's imagine you have just a diamond
00:02:29,00:02:32,that goes throughout the entire roll.
00:02:32,00:02:34,So your diamond keeps coming up every now and then
00:02:34,00:02:36,and you have it on the whole roll.
00:02:36,00:02:39,"Once you wrap it around a toilet paper holder,"
00:02:39,00:02:41,then the diamonds in some places
00:02:41,00:02:42,are gonna be on top of each other.
00:02:42,00:02:44,And so it's gonna get thicker in those places
00:02:44,00:02:46,"and it's gonna be thinner in other places,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,which makes it less efficient to package.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"Now, if you have a pattern which never repeats,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,then it means that you're never gonna have
00:02:52,00:02:56,those kind of indentations that kind of go over each other.
00:02:56,00:02:58,So it makes it better for a type of toilet paper
00:02:58,00:03:00,if you want quilted toilet paper.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- Oh, wow."
00:03:02,00:03:04,"- It's basically the perfect toilet paper he invented,"
00:03:04,00:03:07,but he didn't see it that way.
00:03:07,00:03:09,"- Well, that's the thing with mathematics, isn't it?"
00:03:09,00:03:10,Like you just study maths for the sake of it
00:03:10,00:03:11,'cause it's beautiful
00:03:11,00:03:13,and 'cause the numbers do amazing things.
00:03:13,00:03:16,And you never know what the applications are gonna be.
00:03:16,00:03:17,You never know what it's gonna be.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"Maybe, you know, infinite amounts of energy"
00:03:20,00:03:22,for the entire world are just a quite a nice bit
00:03:22,00:03:23,of toilet paper.
00:03:23,00:03:26,- 'Cause he's denying the world the best version
00:03:26,00:03:28,of toilet paper that we could possibly have.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- He pretty much is.
00:03:29,00:03:31,This was quite a big case at the time.
00:03:31,00:03:35,"I mean, big, big for 1997, but like marketing week."
00:03:35,00:03:37,"- Wait, wasn't it for 1997?"
00:03:37,00:03:38,- Yeah.
00:03:38,00:03:39,"- No, sorry."
00:03:39,00:03:43,- We're called cases famously usually very small in 1997.
00:03:43,00:03:47,- I just couldn't think of much else that happened in 1997.
00:03:47,00:03:48,- Tony Blair came in in 1997.
00:03:48,00:03:49,- That's true.
00:03:49,00:03:50,- That's true.
00:03:50,00:03:52,- But I remember not really being on the front page
00:03:52,00:03:53,of the newspapers
00:03:53,00:03:56,'cause it was all about this toilet paper case.
00:03:56,00:03:59,"- The Hong Kong handover barely got a mention, didn't it?"
00:03:59,00:04:00,"- Okay, all right."
00:04:00,00:04:03,"Look, we can all name something that happened in 1997."
00:04:03,00:04:04,"Well done, everybody."
00:04:04,00:04:07,"But when it happened,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"there's a publication called ""Marketing Week"""
00:04:09,00:04:10,which writes all about this.
00:04:10,00:04:13,And they wrote this excoriating editorial.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"They said, and it was about quilted toilet paper."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"They said, ""The decline of our island kingdom"
00:04:18,00:04:21,dates almost precisely from our ceasing to use
00:04:21,00:04:24,"robust lavatory paper, shiny on one side and dull on the other"
00:04:24,00:04:27,and favoring scented absorbent toilet tissue.
00:04:27,00:04:31,A nation that dabs rather than stoically abrades its bottom
00:04:31,00:04:35,"has become a feat and can never be at peace with itself."""
00:04:35,00:04:39,"- Wow, do you think the bottoms are now a bit bigger"
00:04:39,00:04:40,than they used to be
00:04:40,00:04:43,because they're not slowly enroded away by toilet paper?
00:04:43,00:04:45,"- 100%, I do think that, yeah."
00:04:46,00:04:50,- But did it say toilet paper had turned fragrant?
00:04:50,00:04:51,'Cause we don't do that anymore.
00:04:51,00:04:54,- It did say scented absorbent toilet tissue.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"- Yeah, you see, when was that written?"
00:04:56,00:04:57,- '97.
00:04:57,00:04:58,- '97. - There you go.
00:04:58,00:04:59,So those days are gone.
00:04:59,00:05:01,I think the author of that would be proud
00:05:01,00:05:03,of where we've got to because it was a thing
00:05:03,00:05:06,"in the sort of '70s, '80s, '90s,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,"slightly fragrant toilet paper,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,often a really disgusting pastel color.
00:05:09,00:05:13,And we have reverted a bit to non-smelling loo roll
00:05:13,00:05:14,in pure white.
00:05:14,00:05:16,So I think we're working our way back
00:05:16,00:05:19,to the splintery twigs of the park in our defense.
00:05:19,00:05:24,"- These tiles that Penrose discovered,"
00:05:24,00:05:28,"according to our, all of our good friend, Will Bowen."
00:05:28,00:05:30,"So Will Bowen, who's one of the QILs,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,he studied mathematics at Oxford
00:05:32,00:05:35,and his teacher was Penrose.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"As in Penrose, he was the head of maths"
00:05:37,00:05:38,when Will was at university.
00:05:38,00:05:39,- Oh my goodness.
00:05:39,00:05:42,- And he says that Penrose broke his arm
00:05:42,00:05:45,and that he was in hospital 'cause it's quite a bad break.
00:05:45,00:05:48,And it was while he was kind of lay in hospital
00:05:48,00:05:49,convalescing that he realized
00:05:49,00:05:51,that these kind of tiles might exist.
00:05:51,00:05:52,And he came up with--
00:05:52,00:05:55,"- Oh, I thought, ""Sorry, Penrose broke his own arm."""
00:05:55,00:05:56,Not Will.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"I thought that was a, they had a big varbaral--"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"- He was a tough, he was a tough professor, but he was,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,he broke it in an infinite number of places.
00:06:03,00:06:08,"- Sorry, go on, Penrose is lying in hospital."
00:06:08,00:06:10,"- Yeah, he's lying in hospital"
00:06:10,00:06:12,and he just has this kind of idea
00:06:12,00:06:15,"that well, what if you can have testilating patterns"
00:06:15,00:06:18,so you can put squares all after each other
00:06:18,00:06:21,and they'll go together and there'll be no gaps in between.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"You can do the same with triangles,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,you can do the same with lots of different shapes.
00:06:24,00:06:27,But what he thought was what if you could make things
00:06:27,00:06:29,testilate but they never repeated
00:06:29,00:06:30,and he came up with this idea
00:06:30,00:06:33,of using these kind of pentagon things.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"But while he was in hospital, so it's kind of--"
00:06:35,00:06:38,- And it's that the pattern is that it testilates perfectly
00:06:38,00:06:41,"with these two different shapes, but it never,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,so there are no gaps and also you only use two shapes
00:06:44,00:06:45,"and they all, they repeat forever."
00:06:45,00:06:49,"- Yeah, usually the shapes known as kites and darts"
00:06:49,00:06:51,because that's kind of what they look like
00:06:51,00:06:54,"and you'll just keep putting one next to the other,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,"next to the other, next to the other with no gaps"
00:06:56,00:06:58,but no matter how many millions and millions of miles you go
00:06:58,00:07:01,you'll never have repeating pattern.
00:07:01,00:07:04,- And that was a revolution in actual floor tiling.
00:07:04,00:07:06,He's basically an interior designer.
00:07:06,00:07:08,Glorified interior designer.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"- Actually at the Mathematical Institutes of Oxford,"
00:07:11,00:07:14,one of the bits of paving is made of Penrose tiles.
00:07:14,00:07:15,- That's so nice. - Really?
00:07:15,00:07:16,"- Yeah, that makes sense. - That was really good."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"- He did, so he wasn't the first person,"
00:07:18,00:07:19,"I don't think, to come up with the idea"
00:07:19,00:07:23,of trying to have a never-repeasing pattern of tiling
00:07:23,00:07:26,but people were doing this in the 1960s
00:07:26,00:07:28,"and so people thought that in the end,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,a pattern of shapes that you're trying to fit together
00:07:31,00:07:33,"without any gaps as in tiled together,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,the shapes will always end up eventually repeating themselves
00:07:35,00:07:38,and then a bunch of mathematicians discovered
00:07:38,00:07:44,"that there's a specific set of 20,426 different shapes"
00:07:44,00:07:48,"that if you combine all of them, eventually they won't repeat."
00:07:48,00:07:50,"So they were like, ""Okay, as long as you've just got"
00:07:50,00:07:52,"over 20,000 different shapes, stick them all together,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"you'll never have the pattern repeating."""
00:07:54,00:07:57,"And all Penrose did was, took that figure down to two."
00:07:57,00:08:02,"And I don't know if he went down one by one,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"eradicating one shape after the other,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"but yeah, try this kites and darts thing."
00:08:07,00:08:09,- It's amazing that the mathematicians
00:08:09,00:08:11,"were doing this kind of thing, right?"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"It's really easy to understand concepts,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,just finding new shapes that fit next to each other.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"Obviously quite complicated mathematics,"
00:08:18,00:08:21,but you always think that mathematicians are just working
00:08:21,00:08:23,"with all sorts of numbers and symbols and stuff,"
00:08:23,00:08:25,not shapes like that.
00:08:25,00:08:26,That's why it's-- - Yeah.
00:08:26,00:08:28,- Have you guys ever heard of Marjorie Rice?
00:08:28,00:08:29,"- No, Marjorie Rice."
00:08:29,00:08:31,So there's a guy called Martin Gardner
00:08:31,00:08:32,who you might have heard of
00:08:32,00:08:35,and he did like a lot of columns.
00:08:35,00:08:37,He was like a popular mathematician
00:08:37,00:08:39,and he wrote once in one of his columns
00:08:39,00:08:41,that only certain types of pentagons
00:08:41,00:08:44,can perfectly tile on a flat surface.
00:08:44,00:08:46,And they were all known.
00:08:46,00:08:48,So there's only a few different types of pentagons
00:08:48,00:08:51,that can tessellate and we know what they all are.
00:08:51,00:08:53,"And this lady called Marjorie Rice,"
00:08:53,00:08:55,"she only had a high school education,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,"she was in America,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,"and she thought, ""I bet there's some more."""
00:08:59,00:09:01,"And so she started cutting things out,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,like cutting out these pentagons
00:09:03,00:09:05,and trying to find different pentagons
00:09:05,00:09:07,that would fit in this way.
00:09:07,00:09:10,And she worked on it all the way through a free time.
00:09:10,00:09:12,This was during the 1970s.
00:09:12,00:09:13,"All the time she had free,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,she would just try and come up with new ways
00:09:15,00:09:18,of working out pentagons that would be able to tessellate.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"And when her husband and her children came home,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,she would hide them 'cause she was so embarrassed
00:09:23,00:09:24,that this is what she was doing.
00:09:24,00:09:26,"And she came up with her own notation,"
00:09:26,00:09:30,her own mathematics that would describe these things.
00:09:30,00:09:32,And eventually she sent the results to Gardner
00:09:32,00:09:34,"and said, ""Look, I found all these new pentagons"
00:09:34,00:09:36,"""which will tessellate."""
00:09:36,00:09:40,"And he's like, ""Holy shit, this is like new maths."""
00:09:40,00:09:42,And you've only got high school education
00:09:42,00:09:44,and he sent it onto some experts.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"And they saw her notation and they were like,"
00:09:46,00:09:47,"""Oh, this just looks like gibberish."""
00:09:47,00:09:48,"But the more they looked at it,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,the more they realized that this was a new type of mathematics
00:09:51,00:09:54,that would tell you these new kind of pentagons
00:09:54,00:09:55,that will tessellate.
00:09:55,00:09:59,And she's discovered more than 50 pentagons that tessellate.
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Jesus.
00:10:00,00:10:02,- What do we do with that kind of information?
00:10:02,00:10:03,- Tiling.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- Outside.
00:10:04,00:10:05,- But it's literally just for tiling.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"It's, yeah, cool."
00:10:07,00:10:07,"- No, it's really not."
00:10:07,00:10:09,- There's other stuff.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"- There's really loads of things like,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,"for instance, the Penrose ones,"
00:10:11,00:10:14,they later discovered that you can now have crystals
00:10:14,00:10:17,which have this same non-repeating pattern.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"And those crystals have amazing properties,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,like they're amazing superconductors.
00:10:21,00:10:25,You can use them to put on like non-stick pans
00:10:25,00:10:26,and stuff like that.
00:10:26,00:10:27,So there's always loads of amazing things
00:10:27,00:10:28,that come out of these things
00:10:28,00:10:30,which you never think they're gonna come
00:10:30,00:10:32,because it's a new beautiful kind of maths.
00:10:32,00:10:34,"It's, there's always something useful."
00:10:34,00:10:36,"- Those crystals, they are so cool."
00:10:36,00:10:38,"So I think, okay, I'm probably gonna get this wrong"
00:10:38,00:10:39,"because it's quite complicated,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,but there was a crystallographer called Alan Mackay
00:10:41,00:10:43,who said that if you put atoms at the corners
00:10:43,00:10:44,of the Penrose tiles
00:10:44,00:10:47,"and then you bounce x-rays off those, right,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,the resulting reflections form the shape
00:10:49,00:10:50,of a perfect crystal.
00:10:50,00:10:51,- Right.
00:10:51,00:10:54,"- Okay, I think I understand that just about."
00:10:54,00:10:57,But that material was discovered
00:10:57,00:10:59,and called a quasi-crystal.
00:10:59,00:11:02,"So Penrose had basically invented a new,"
00:11:02,00:11:05,like inventing a new species of animal or plant.
00:11:05,00:11:06,And then that's discovered in the real world.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- Exactly, it's like you're an author"
00:11:09,00:11:12,and you just make up a new animal
00:11:12,00:11:14,and then they go around the corner and it's just there.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"It's so weird, completely mad."
00:11:17,00:11:19,- But I think this whole fitting shapes together thing
00:11:19,00:11:20,might be the back door into maths.
00:11:20,00:11:22,If anyone's looking for an easy way
00:11:22,00:11:23,to a Nobel Prize in maths.
00:11:23,00:11:28,Because there's this woman who doesn't even have an education.
00:11:28,00:11:30,Even we understand fitting shapes together.
00:11:30,00:11:32,Penrose came up with the basis of his idea
00:11:32,00:11:35,"when he was nine, he says."
00:11:35,00:11:37,"And you go, what can you do when you're nine?"
00:11:37,00:11:39,He said that he was having a chat with his dad
00:11:39,00:11:42,"and he asked, can you fit regular hexagons together"
00:11:42,00:11:43,to make a sphere?
00:11:43,00:11:45,"As you do, the standard kind of question you ask"
00:11:45,00:11:47,when you're nine years old.
00:11:47,00:11:48,"And his dad said,"
00:11:48,00:11:52,"his dad said, no, you can't fit regular hexagons"
00:11:52,00:11:53,together until they make a sphere.
00:11:53,00:11:55,You have to include some pentagons.
00:11:55,00:11:56,"And he said, that was the moment."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"He thought, that was a huge surprise to me."
00:11:58,00:12:00,And that's the moment I realized I had to go
00:12:00,00:12:02,into the business of fitting shapes together.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"And this is another one of those weird, true things."
00:12:04,00:12:06,And that's the easiest way to picture this
00:12:06,00:12:07,"is thinking of a football, right?"
00:12:07,00:12:09,"You know, football's are designed"
00:12:09,00:12:11,with little hexagonal shapes all over them.
00:12:11,00:12:14,But the only way you can make a footballer's sphere
00:12:14,00:12:17,is by having at least 12 pentagons hidden in there somewhere.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"So if you look at a football,"
00:12:19,00:12:23,"each pentagon has hexagons, five hexagons around it, isn't it?"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"- Yeah, that's a special kind of hatred"
00:12:25,00:12:26,"of Matt Parker, isn't it?"
00:12:26,00:12:27,The mathematician. - Yes.
00:12:27,00:12:28,- Our friend Matt Parker.
00:12:28,00:12:31,"Yeah, whenever he sees a picture of a football"
00:12:31,00:12:32,"on like a signpost or something,"
00:12:32,00:12:35,"if there's no pentagons on there, he gets furious."
00:12:35,00:12:37,- Yeah. - Really?
00:12:37,00:12:38,- Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"- Just on that, we should say that it may not be"
00:12:40,00:12:41,a complete backdoor to a Nobel Prize
00:12:41,00:12:46,because Penrose's Nobel Prize is for his work on black holes
00:12:46,00:12:49,where he used maths to prove that the formation
00:12:49,00:12:51,of black holes is an inevitable consequence
00:12:51,00:12:53,of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
00:12:53,00:12:55,So you can't just cut out some shapes
00:12:55,00:12:57,and then expect to win the Nobel Prize.
00:12:57,00:12:59,You have to prove black holes can exist.
00:12:59,00:13:03,- You can't just design a loo roll and hope for the best.
00:13:03,00:13:07,- So Roger Penrose is 89 years old
00:13:07,00:13:09,and he has just won this Nobel Prize.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"And for someone who's so incredibly clever,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,he was a bit thick about understanding
00:13:14,00:13:16,that there was an award on the way.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"He got a message from his PA saying that someone,"
00:13:19,00:13:23,a strange person had called up and asked for his number.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"And he says later on, that's when he should have,"
00:13:25,00:13:27,"you know, smelt a fish is his words."
00:13:27,00:13:28,He should have seen someone who's coming.
00:13:28,00:13:31,Then someone called him up from Sweden
00:13:31,00:13:33,and asked him to go on hold on the phone.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"So he waited and waited, but then he got bored."
00:13:35,00:13:37,So he hung up.
00:13:37,00:13:39,So the Nobel committee had to recall him
00:13:39,00:13:41,in order to give him his award.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"But yeah, just didn't spot it coming."
00:13:43,00:13:44,- That's so funny.
00:13:44,00:13:45,- Wow.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- Well, did you guys see the video of the people"
00:13:47,00:13:49,who won the Nobel Prize for Economics this year?
00:13:49,00:13:50,- No.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"- No, it's the greatest thing to come out of 2020,"
00:13:53,00:13:56,which I know is not a difficult competition.
00:13:56,00:13:57,- It's the Nobel Prize.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"- It's not like 1997, whoa, what a year."
00:13:59,00:14:01,(laughing)
00:14:01,00:14:03,"- The Nobel Prize for Economics went to these two people,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,"Robert Wilson and Paul Milgram,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,"who sort of redesigned auctions,"
00:14:07,00:14:10,which is apparently this revolutionary thing.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"And anyway, usually what happens with the Nobel's"
00:14:12,00:14:14,is they're decided in Sweden
00:14:14,00:14:16,and a lot of the winners are in America.
00:14:16,00:14:18,And so they call up Americans in the middle of the night.
00:14:18,00:14:20,And there's often stories of them being woken up
00:14:20,00:14:21,in the middle of the night.
00:14:21,00:14:22,So they called up these guys
00:14:22,00:14:24,"and they called Wilson, got through to him."
00:14:24,00:14:25,"Well, at first they couldn't get through"
00:14:25,00:14:28,'cause he switched his phone off thinking it was a nobody.
00:14:28,00:14:29,And so they called his wife
00:14:29,00:14:31,"and his wife woke up, Wilson, said,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"""Hey, it's the Nobel Committee."
00:14:33,00:14:34,"""I reckon I know what it's about."""
00:14:34,00:14:36,"So Wilson answered and was like, ""Thanks very much."""
00:14:36,00:14:38,"And then the Nobel Committee said,"
00:14:38,00:14:41,"""Hey, I don't suppose you know your partner"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"""from 30 years ago when you came up this idea,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,"""Paul Milgram, we can't get through to him."
00:14:45,00:14:48,"""Do you have any idea how we could?"""
00:14:48,00:14:51,"And Wilson said, ""Well, actually, we live opposite each other."
00:14:51,00:14:52,(laughing)
00:14:52,00:14:55,"""So you want me to go knock on his door?"""
00:14:55,00:15:00,And so there's CCTV footage from the door cam
00:15:00,00:15:02,of Paul Milgram's camera of this guy.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And he's in his 80s, Wilson."
00:15:04,00:15:05,"This guy banging on his door,"
00:15:05,00:15:06,like ringing on the doorbell.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"And he's like, ""Paul, Paul!"""
00:15:09,00:15:11,"Yeah, that's sort of like really bad connection."
00:15:11,00:15:13,And he's just woken up in the middle of the night.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"He's like, ""What?"
00:15:14,00:15:16,"""Yeah, you've won the Nobel Prize."
00:15:16,00:15:18,"""Yeah, can you answer your phone?"""
00:15:18,00:15:21,And it's just the most bizarre footage.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"I'm so annoyed, by the way, you told that story."
00:15:23,00:15:25,"'Cause when you said he was banging on the door,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"I was just about to jump in with,"
00:15:27,00:15:28,"""Did he have no bell?"""
00:15:28,00:15:31,"But then you went, or ringing the doorbell,"
00:15:31,00:15:32,"""Oh, no!"""
00:15:32,00:15:34,"Damn it, I completely screwed you over."
00:15:34,00:15:36,(upbeat music)
00:15:36,00:15:43,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:15:43,00:15:46,- My fact this week is that a Washington State's
00:15:46,00:15:48,Department of Agriculture recently lost track
00:15:48,00:15:51,of a single hornet they were trying to follow.
00:15:51,00:15:53,(laughing)
00:15:53,00:15:55,"Specifically, the Asian giant hornet,"
00:15:55,00:15:56,"also known as the murder hornet,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,which has been hanging out in Japan and China
00:15:58,00:16:01,"for a very long time, but arrived in America"
00:16:01,00:16:04,in October this year and caused absolute panic
00:16:04,00:16:06,"because it's an invasive species,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,"and also really hurts if you get stung by it,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,and it destroys bee species.
00:16:10,00:16:15,"So the State Department said we've got a catch one,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,and we've got a catch one that's gonna lead us back
00:16:17,00:16:19,"to the hive, to the nest."
00:16:19,00:16:22,"And so they came up with all these ideas of getting it,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,"so they caught one hornet, I think,"
00:16:24,00:16:28,"and attempted to super glue or double-sided sticky tape,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,"or tracking device to it, but that didn't work."
00:16:30,00:16:33,And eventually they trapped one by strapping a bit
00:16:33,00:16:35,"of dental floss around its stomach,"
00:16:35,00:16:38,"and attaching a tracking device to that, like a belt,"
00:16:38,00:16:41,"and then chasing it, trying to chase it down."
00:16:41,00:16:44,"But they lost it, disappeared, 'cause they fly,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"and they're fast, and they're hard to chase."
00:16:46,00:16:46,- Wow.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"- Well, they used Bluetooth."
00:16:48,00:16:50,That was one way they lost it.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"Yeah, in an early experiment,"
00:16:51,00:16:54,the transmitter they had attached to it
00:16:54,00:16:56,"was a Bluetooth one, and it only works over a few hundred feet."
00:16:56,00:17:00,"So if it gets out of your range, then you're stuffed."
00:17:00,00:17:01,- Yeah.
00:17:01,00:17:03,- The chief entomologist did also say
00:17:03,00:17:05,it actually does fly a lot faster
00:17:05,00:17:07,than we realized we could run.
00:17:07,00:17:10,"So yeah, it was based on having to keep up"
00:17:10,00:17:11,with this bit of signal.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"- You need a Judas insect, they call it,"
00:17:14,00:17:15,to lead you back to the hive.
00:17:15,00:17:17,This is what they say it is.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"So to get your hornet in the first place,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"you leave out some orange juice and some rice wine,"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"which they love, 'cause it's so sugary."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"And then you can trap it,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"and that's what it's called, the Judas insect."
00:17:27,00:17:30,"- It's interesting, 'cause they come over from,"
00:17:30,00:17:31,is it Japan or China or somewhere?
00:17:31,00:17:32,"From Japan, isn't it?"
00:17:32,00:17:33,- Both.
00:17:33,00:17:35,- Is that why they like rice wine?
00:17:35,00:17:36,"Like, 'cause they used to it in Japan."
00:17:36,00:17:41,- I do not know whether it's Japan-specific food.
00:17:41,00:17:43,I don't know whether the tastes of the insects are the same.
00:17:43,00:17:44,- You don't know?
00:17:44,00:17:47,"- It's good, I like it, I like the theory."
00:17:47,00:17:48,"So the big problem with these hornets, right,"
00:17:48,00:17:50,is that the bees and so on in America
00:17:50,00:17:52,"don't know how to deal with them at all,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,because they've not had them as part of their life.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"And the name, murder hornet,"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"is applied not because they're dangerous to humans,"
00:18:00,00:18:01,"they are dangerous to humans,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,but really it's applied properly
00:18:03,00:18:05,because of how dangerous they are to the bees.
00:18:05,00:18:07,They can go into their nests
00:18:07,00:18:10,and basically just decimate within minutes.
00:18:10,00:18:13,"They just rip heads off, arms off, everything off,"
00:18:13,00:18:15,and it's a blood bath in there.
00:18:15,00:18:18,They can kill 40 European bees in a minute.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"Like, these are absolutely the fastest."
00:18:20,00:18:23,"- So people do call them murder hornets,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,but entomologists are furious about that.
00:18:25,00:18:27,They do not like to call in these murder hornets
00:18:27,00:18:29,"because it's just, it's bad PR."
00:18:29,00:18:31,"They're just hornets, they're just animals."
00:18:31,00:18:33,"They're doing, you know, they're doing what hornets do."
00:18:33,00:18:35,"And like, okay, in America,"
00:18:35,00:18:37,"they are an invasive species and in Canada,"
00:18:37,00:18:41,"but in Japan, they use them to work against pests."
00:18:41,00:18:44,"As in if bees, if pests come into their fields,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,they can use these hornets to get rid of them.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- What kind of pests are you getting rid of though?
00:18:47,00:18:49,"- Well, I can only imagine it's lots of bees"
00:18:49,00:18:50,"'cause that seems to be what they do,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"but no, it isn't."
00:18:52,00:18:55,"I think hornets, these hornets, they eat all insects."
00:18:55,00:19:00,"So they do like the tasty North American bees quite a lot,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,"but if there are any other insects there,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,then they'll eat those as well.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"So the other name you can call them,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"I think in America, they're quite often called"
00:19:09,00:19:10,"giant Asian hornets,"
00:19:10,00:19:14,but there is an entomologist called Akito Kawahara
00:19:14,00:19:16,"who says that really you shouldn't call them that,"
00:19:16,00:19:19,either because Asian can have meanings
00:19:19,00:19:20,like Asian flu and stuff like that.
00:19:20,00:19:22,So you're kind of taking a bad thing
00:19:22,00:19:24,and you're giving it that epithet.
00:19:24,00:19:25,So you shouldn't really do that.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"So really just giant hornets or large hornets,"
00:19:28,00:19:33,"that's what he says, just call them big, big old hornets."
00:19:33,00:19:36,"- In Japan, they get called giant sparrow hornets,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,which is pretty terrifying.
00:19:37,00:19:39,But I think there's a weird thing
00:19:39,00:19:41,"because the murder hornet thing is,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,"in Japan, they're not called murder hornets"
00:19:43,00:19:45,or rather the word that gets applied to them
00:19:45,00:19:47,just kind of means killer hornets.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"And that's because in the Japanese language,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,"the word for kill and murder are the same, I think."
00:19:52,00:19:56,"So they don't, so the much more pejorative version"
00:19:56,00:19:58,"is the one that's made its way into English,"
00:19:58,00:20:01,the much more evocative name.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"Killer hornets, obviously also not a great name to have."
00:20:04,00:20:07,"- Well, they kill up to 50 people every year,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"like humans in Japan, especially."
00:20:10,00:20:11,"And they have this sting,"
00:20:11,00:20:14,"which if you're wearing a normal beekeeping suit,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,it's still strong enough to go through this beekeeping suit
00:20:17,00:20:18,and it can kill you.
00:20:18,00:20:23,So one of the world experts always wears a hazmat suit instead.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"- Well, I got, I was really excited to realize that we,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"after I found this fact,"
00:20:29,00:20:30,I was just looking through podcast emails
00:20:30,00:20:32,to see if anyone's ever mentioned hornets.
00:20:32,00:20:34,And we very recently got contacted
00:20:34,00:20:36,"by this guy called Konrad Berube,"
00:20:36,00:20:40,who is the guy who took out the first hornet nest
00:20:40,00:20:43,in North America when it arrived last year.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"So it came to Canada, it was in British Columbia."
00:20:45,00:20:49,And so he's this expert and he published this paper on it.
00:20:49,00:20:50,And one of the things he said is
00:20:50,00:20:51,"that when he's chasing them around,"
00:20:51,00:20:55,he wears a Kevlar vest and he wore two pairs of trousers.
00:20:55,00:20:57,He wears braces that are built
00:20:57,00:21:00,to ward against chainsaw injury.
00:21:00,00:21:02,And then he wears beekeeping gear.
00:21:02,00:21:04,He's still got stung quite a bit.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"And he said that it was extremely painful,"
00:21:06,00:21:07,but he's a beekeeper.
00:21:07,00:21:09,So he suspects that for normal people
00:21:09,00:21:10,"who aren't used to being stung,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,be real agony.
00:21:12,00:21:12,But isn't that cool?
00:21:12,00:21:14,"We've, a podcast fan is the guy"
00:21:14,00:21:17,who took out the first nest in North America.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"He also said, incidentally,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,that he would never use the M phrase.
00:21:22,00:21:23,"We doesn't like to use the M phrase,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,the murder hornet phrase.
00:21:25,00:21:26,You've got to be very politically correct
00:21:26,00:21:28,with these hornets attack.
00:21:28,00:21:31,"- That guy, did he hoover them up?"
00:21:31,00:21:32,'Cause they have vacuum cleaners
00:21:32,00:21:33,that they use for insect special ones.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"- Yes, I think it's might've been him."
00:21:36,00:21:38,"'Cause was this August, 2019,"
00:21:38,00:21:39,that they arrived in North America?
00:21:39,00:21:41,He said that the hornets were so big
00:21:41,00:21:44,that they wouldn't fit in the nozzle of his vacuum cleaner.
00:21:44,00:21:46,That is terrifying.
00:21:46,00:21:49,"- That was in the Vancouver area, I think,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,that first one last year.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"And they found the first one in the United States this year,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,which was in Washington.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"And again, they use the vacuum cleaner"
00:21:57,00:21:59,to suck that one away.
00:21:59,00:22:02,And it was done by an entomologist called Chris Looney.
00:22:02,00:22:03,- Nice.
00:22:03,00:22:05,- I hope he lived up to his name
00:22:05,00:22:09,"and just went in wearing boxer shorts, bare chest boots."
00:22:09,00:22:11,"- So Looney said, because we've been talking about"
00:22:11,00:22:13,how people are very scared of getting the sting
00:22:13,00:22:15,and how it can penetrate.
00:22:15,00:22:17,He's not so much scared of the sting.
00:22:17,00:22:21,What he's more petrified about is the squirty venom
00:22:21,00:22:23,that they're able to shoot at you.
00:22:23,00:22:25,And that's another thing that you need to worry about.
00:22:25,00:22:29,So they shoot venom at you and that can really burn.
00:22:29,00:22:32,"Like badly, it can give nerve damage to the eye."
00:22:32,00:22:34,"And so for him, that's the more intimidating thing"
00:22:34,00:22:36,than the sting itself that he's looking out for.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"- I have to say, it feels like entomologists"
00:22:38,00:22:40,"who keep saying, no, they're just large hornets"
00:22:40,00:22:43,are fighting a slightly losing battle here.
00:22:43,00:22:45,Do you know how you trap them
00:22:45,00:22:47,if you've got them in your home?
00:22:47,00:22:48,- I think I would move house.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"- Good luck in the estate agency stage, mate."
00:22:52,00:22:53,Good luck with the viewings.
00:22:53,00:22:56,- Under a bowl?
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- Well, you can use a bowl,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,but the thing you need to put in the bowl is prawns.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"They love prawns, especially during breeding season"
00:23:04,00:23:06,when they're going for a slightly more proteiny mix
00:23:06,00:23:07,in their diet.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"- Wait, but they surely, I know they're big,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,but they're not big enough or good enough at swimming
00:23:12,00:23:14,to be hunting prawns in the wild.
00:23:14,00:23:16,- I think they very rarely take down full prawns
00:23:16,00:23:18,"in the wild, but they do eat meat, don't they?"
00:23:18,00:23:22,"- I think a prawn is basically an insect of the sea, isn't it?"
00:23:22,00:23:25,"So maybe, you know, it has a similar taste to insects."
00:23:25,00:23:28,"I have eaten insects, but I've never eaten prawns,"
00:23:28,00:23:29,so I don't really know what prawns taste like.
00:23:29,00:23:32,"- See, that is the reverse of most people's experience of life."
00:23:32,00:23:34,"- Yes, it's true."
00:23:34,00:23:36,"- I've eaten prawns, but I don't think I've eaten insects."
00:23:36,00:23:37,"I swallowed the fly warts on my bike,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,but it wasn't the same.
00:23:39,00:23:41,- How did you get rid of that fly?
00:23:41,00:23:44,"- No, we can't go down this road, we don't have the time."
00:23:44,00:23:51,"In Japan, where they are not talked of as pejoratively,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,one of the reasons could be that the bees in Japan
00:23:53,00:23:56,"have evolved to deal with them much better, haven't they?"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"So they have this amazing way of killing them,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,which the European bees have not figured out.
00:24:00,00:24:04,So what Japanese honeybees do is if they see
00:24:04,00:24:06,"an Asian giant hornet coming towards them,"
00:24:06,00:24:07,"instead of going out to attack it,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,"which is what the European bees do when they get decimated,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,"they retreat back into their hive, the hornet comes in,"
00:24:13,00:24:16,"and then a massive crowd of them, so hundreds of bees,"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"swarm it, and then they vibrate around it,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,"giving this sort of giant hug,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"and they vibrate and vibrate and vibrate,"
00:24:22,00:24:26,"so it raises the temperature so much that the hornet dies,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,"and it has to be quite specific,"
00:24:28,00:24:33,"because a hornet dies, I think, at about 47.2 degrees C,"
00:24:33,00:24:37,and the bees will die if it gets about one or two degrees
00:24:37,00:24:38,hotter than that.
00:24:38,00:24:39,"- Oh, really?"
00:24:39,00:24:43,- They've got to be real thermostats in that situation.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"- 'Cause that's what our theme tune's about, isn't it, then?"
00:24:45,00:24:48,"- That's right, if anyone wants to find the full version"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"of our theme tune called Wasps,"
00:24:50,00:24:53,that is the story in the lyrics about how that happens.
00:24:53,00:24:55,"- Of course, yeah."
00:24:55,00:24:57,- Is it like a metaphor or something for lyrics then?
00:24:57,00:24:59,"I've realized, I've heard those lyrics, obviously,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,"hundreds of times, but I've never really thought."
00:25:00,00:25:03,"- Yeah, it's the idea, I mean, Ash Gardner,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"who wrote it will know better,"
00:25:04,00:25:07,but the way I always interpret it is that you need
00:25:07,00:25:10,"all of your friend bees to kill the hornet,"
00:25:10,00:25:12,you all need to come together and hold on to each other
00:25:12,00:25:15,"in order to get past this terrible foe,"
00:25:15,00:25:18,"and in the same way, humans, when we come together,"
00:25:18,00:25:19,we can achieve anything.
00:25:19,00:25:20,- Isn't that right?
00:25:20,00:25:22,- That's what I always thought of it.
00:25:22,00:25:23,- That's really nice.
00:25:23,00:25:26,"It's time we get together, show what we can do,"
00:25:26,00:25:27,you hold on to me and I'll hold on to you.
00:25:27,00:25:29,- And then we'll kill this hornet.
00:25:29,00:25:30,- Yeah.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- Down with the murder hornets, with past it."
00:25:32,00:25:39,- Japan has an annual wasp festival.
00:25:39,00:25:40,This is cool.
00:25:40,00:25:42,It's called the Kushihara Hebo Matsuri.
00:25:42,00:25:45,So Kushihara is the village and Hebo means wasp.
00:25:45,00:25:49,And you have to bring a wasp nest to the festival.
00:25:49,00:25:50,- What?
00:25:50,00:25:53,"- So the prize is for the heaviest wasp nest,"
00:25:53,00:25:56,but it's obviously quite hard to bring a wasp nest.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- Yeah.
00:25:57,00:25:58,- So this is how you do it.
00:25:58,00:26:00,You have to attach a bit of white paper
00:26:00,00:26:02,"to a tiny sliver of fish, right?"
00:26:02,00:26:05,"And the wasp, wasps of meat, that will swoop in"
00:26:05,00:26:09,and it'll grab the bit of fish and it flies off.
00:26:09,00:26:11,But you can see the paper 'cause you've attached
00:26:11,00:26:12,the paper to the fish.
00:26:12,00:26:14,So you follow this little bit of paper
00:26:14,00:26:17,"flying through the air, that takes you back to the nest."
00:26:17,00:26:20,"And then you have to carefully dig it out,"
00:26:20,00:26:23,feed the wasps raw meat to grow them
00:26:23,00:26:24,"so that they build a big, strong nest."
00:26:24,00:26:27,And then you eventually bring out this whole nest box
00:26:27,00:26:28,and you bring it to the festival.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"- Oh Christ, wow."
00:26:30,00:26:32,"- I think we should just say, for people at home,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,don't go near a wasp's nest.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"'Cause they are dangerous, aren't they?"
00:26:36,00:26:37,Wasp's nest.
00:26:37,00:26:38,You can get really badly stung.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"- Yeah, but if you really want to go to this festival,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,"I mean, who's headlining the Japanese festival?"
00:26:43,00:26:46,- It's just more giant wasps.
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Exactly.
00:26:47,00:26:48,"I was going to say, even bigger warning,"
00:26:48,00:26:50,do not go to the wasp festival.
00:26:50,00:26:52,Certainly don't get the train there on the day
00:26:52,00:26:54,that all the competitors are heading there as well.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"- In answer to your question,"
00:26:56,00:26:59,"who's headlining the wasp festival, I think it's Sting."
00:26:59,00:26:59,- Aye.
00:26:59,00:27:00,- Aye.
00:27:00,00:27:04,"- In the medieval times,"
00:27:04,00:27:09,a peasant who lived near the French village of Cambrai
00:27:09,00:27:13,dreamed that he got a divine revelation
00:27:13,00:27:16,from a swarm of bees entering his anus.
00:27:16,00:27:18,(laughing)
00:27:18,00:27:19,Yeah.
00:27:19,00:27:21,- Okay.
00:27:21,00:27:23,That is putting a positive spin
00:27:23,00:27:24,on what for most people would be
00:27:24,00:27:26,quite a negative experience.
00:27:26,00:27:27,(laughing)
00:27:27,00:27:29,- A swarm of bees went to his anus.
00:27:29,00:27:34,- Did he enter himself into that big wasp competition?
00:27:34,00:27:37,(laughing)
00:27:37,00:27:42,"To clarify, to clarify for a second."
00:27:42,00:27:45,I think he dreamed that a swarm of bees
00:27:45,00:27:50,went to his anus and that the bees in the dream
00:27:50,00:27:53,had given him a divine revelation about the evil clergy.
00:27:53,00:27:54,I don't think.
00:27:54,00:27:56,(laughing)
00:27:56,00:27:58,"But so, oh, okay."
00:27:58,00:28:00,So they spoke to him from within his anus.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"- Yes, inside the dream,"
00:28:02,00:28:05,they spoke to him by flying into his bosom
00:28:05,00:28:07,and they told him a divine revelation.
00:28:07,00:28:08,- Okay.
00:28:08,00:28:09,- Okay.
00:28:09,00:28:10,- No bees were harmed.
00:28:10,00:28:11,- It's not how you'd assume
00:28:11,00:28:12,"that God would communicate with you, is it?"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"But he does, he works in mysterious ones."
00:28:14,00:28:16,- Very mysterious.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- I think they had to coin that phrase
00:28:17,00:28:19,just for this specific revelation.
00:28:19,00:28:22,(upbeat music)
00:28:22,00:28:28,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:28:28,00:28:30,and that is James.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- Okay, my fact this week is that two years"
00:28:32,00:28:35,"after the release of the first James Bond movie,"
00:28:35,00:28:38,an actual British spy called James Bond
00:28:38,00:28:40,was discovered in Poland.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Incredible.
00:28:41,00:28:42,- That's so good.
00:28:42,00:28:45,"- Amazing, who would have thought it?"
00:28:45,00:28:46,- Was it a response to the films?
00:28:46,00:28:48,"Was it them saying, we're gonna name all us"
00:28:48,00:28:49,why is James Bond?
00:28:49,00:28:51,"- Oh, like Spartacus or something,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,that would have been exactly.
00:28:53,00:28:54,There's a suggestion of that.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"Now the thing is, this was in the Cold War"
00:28:56,00:28:58,"and we are learning more stuff,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,"like it gets declassified,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,but it's still kind of sketchy what people knew
00:29:02,00:29:04,and what people were doing and all that kind of things.
00:29:04,00:29:05,So we're kind of piecing things together.
00:29:05,00:29:07,But they found this file
00:29:07,00:29:09,that the Polish security service put together
00:29:09,00:29:10,during the Cold War about this guy
00:29:10,00:29:12,called James Albert Bond.
00:29:12,00:29:15,And he went to Poland
00:29:15,00:29:18,and ostentatiously started flirting with women
00:29:18,00:29:21,and hanging around nuclear power plants and stuff like that.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"I don't know exactly what he did,"
00:29:23,00:29:26,"but he was acting very, very obviously like a spy."
00:29:26,00:29:27,And there's a suggestion
00:29:27,00:29:30,"that the British might have sent him over,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,"deliberately given him that name,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"so that the Polish had to use their resources,"
00:29:35,00:29:36,"investigating him,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,while perhaps some other covert stuff was happening.
00:29:38,00:29:40,We don't know that.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"We don't know whether he was just on holiday in Poland,"
00:29:43,00:29:44,who just happened to be there.
00:29:44,00:29:47,And everyone's just kind of put one-on-one together
00:29:47,00:29:48,and got three.
00:29:48,00:29:49,His wife seems to think
00:29:49,00:29:51,that there might have been something going on.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"He's unfortunately not with us anymore,"
00:29:52,00:29:53,so we can't ask him.
00:29:53,00:29:55,So who knows?
00:29:55,00:29:58,"- So many, so many James Bonds out there."
00:29:58,00:30:01,"So there was a survey done by a website,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,"it's a census website,"
00:30:03,00:30:07,"which found 7,672 James Bonds in history,"
00:30:07,00:30:08,with all sorts of jobs.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"They were mostly dull, you know, clerks and things."
00:30:11,00:30:14,"There were some orchid growers though, that was fun."
00:30:14,00:30:16,"And in the 1920 census,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,there was someone who was called Goldfinger.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"Goldyfinger, Goldyfinger."
00:30:21,00:30:25,"- Goldyfinger, that's G-O-L-D-E, gold."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"- Ah, do we know what that person did?"
00:30:28,00:30:29,Were they a villain?
00:30:29,00:30:30,Was it a profession?
00:30:30,00:30:31,- I don't think so.
00:30:31,00:30:33,I don't know their profession.
00:30:33,00:30:34,"- There's a Wikipedia page,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,and obviously if you put James Bond in
00:30:36,00:30:38,"and you go for the Bond that's not the character,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,you get a few notable bonds.
00:30:39,00:30:43,"And so there's a few, there's a Speedway Racer,"
00:30:43,00:30:45,"there is a Naval Officer,"
00:30:45,00:30:45,"and there's a few other,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"and what's interesting is most of them,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,at some point in the article that says
00:30:49,00:30:51,their nickname was 007.
00:30:51,00:30:55,And I think every single one of them have the same nickname.
00:30:55,00:30:56,"Poor thing for their lives,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,if they were after the movies.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"But obviously the most notable one is the bird watcher,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"the ornithologist, James Bond,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,who the character was named after.
00:31:05,00:31:07,"- Yes, indeed."
00:31:07,00:31:10,"- They met, I think, didn't they, in the end?"
00:31:10,00:31:11,- They did.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"- And actually the James Bond, the bird watcher,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,"said he loved being James Bond,"
00:31:14,00:31:18,"because apparently it helped him get through passport control,"
00:31:18,00:31:19,which just made me think the passport control
00:31:19,00:31:22,in the '60s or whatever was quite a lot more lax.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"He was just saying, ""My name's James Bond."""
00:31:24,00:31:25,"- Do you think he gave them the passport,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,"and they saw the name,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,and he just tapped to the side of his nose
00:31:28,00:31:31,"and went, ""Better let me in, guys."""
00:31:31,00:31:33,"- Yeah, and all the security went,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,"""God, this must be a thing that they forgot to tell me about."""
00:31:36,00:31:37,I'll let him through.
00:31:37,00:31:40,- Ian Fleming once wrote to the other James Bond's wife
00:31:40,00:31:45,and said that apologizing that he'd stolen the husband's name.
00:31:45,00:31:48,"And he said, ""Perhaps one day your husband"
00:31:48,00:31:51,"""will discover a particularly horrible species of bird,"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"""which he would like to christen in an insulting fashion"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"""by calling it Ian Fleming."""
00:31:55,00:31:57,- Very nice.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"- There's a theory that, a very new theory,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,"that actually it wasn't based on James Bond,"
00:32:01,00:32:04,"the ornithologist, that was just a cover by Ian Fleming"
00:32:04,00:32:06,to protect the person it was based on.
00:32:06,00:32:10,"And this is because a new thing came to light in 2018,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,a guy called Stephen Phillips from Swansea
00:32:12,00:32:15,"was looking into his grandfather's records,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,and his grandfather's called James Bond.
00:32:17,00:32:20,And there were documents that had just been declassified
00:32:20,00:32:21,that showed that his grandfather
00:32:21,00:32:25,"was an SOE, a special operations executive agent"
00:32:25,00:32:26,in World War II.
00:32:26,00:32:30,"And he just signed the official secrets act just before D-Day,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,so he was clearly involved in that in some way.
00:32:32,00:32:35,"And so this guy, Stephen Phillips' grandson,"
00:32:35,00:32:38,reckons it's likely Ian Fleming would have met him
00:32:38,00:32:39,'cause they were both hanging out in the spy world
00:32:39,00:32:41,around that time.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"And then thought, James Bond, great name,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,I better not say I was inspired by this spy
00:32:46,00:32:48,'cause I don't want to spill the beans.
00:32:48,00:32:50,So I'll find another James Bond to claim it was based on
00:32:50,00:32:52,"instead, so that's the theory."
00:32:52,00:32:54,And the real James Bond ended up working
00:32:54,00:32:56,as a lollipop man in Swansea.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"So, that's the obvious trajectory."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"- That must have been such an exciting crossing,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,a pelican crossing for Crosshead.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Can you imagine?
00:33:05,00:33:08,"Gunfire, car chases."
00:33:08,00:33:09,- The lollipop was actually a bazooka
00:33:09,00:33:12,that he would have created in his beading car.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"- There's a guy called James Bond in Walsall,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,council worker in Walsall.
00:33:17,00:33:19,He used to be called David Fern.
00:33:19,00:33:21,And much like that guy who changed his name
00:33:21,00:33:23,"to Isle of Spam the other week,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,I don't know if you remember him.
00:33:25,00:33:28,David Fern from Walsall has changed his name
00:33:28,00:33:30,"to James Bond, but as a middle name,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,he's included all the Bond film titles.
00:33:33,00:33:36,This was in the newspapers in 2006.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"So, if he's ever stopped and they say, ""What's your name?"""
00:33:38,00:33:41,"He would say, ""The name's Bond."""
00:33:41,00:33:43,"James Dr. No from ""Russia with Love,"""
00:33:43,00:33:45,"Goldfinger, Thunderball, you only have them twice"
00:33:45,00:33:47,"on a Majesty's Secret Service, blah, blah, blah,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
00:33:49,00:33:52,"Die Another Day, Casino Real, Bond."
00:33:52,00:33:54,- Does he have to change his name again by Deadpool
00:33:54,00:33:56,every time a new film is released?
00:33:56,00:33:59,"- I think that's why they haven't released the new one yet,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,'cause he hasn't gotten around to it.
00:34:00,00:34:02,(laughing)
00:34:02,00:34:03,- Wow.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"- You really choose a path of embracing it,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"or really hating it, don't you?"
00:34:07,00:34:09,There was actually a documentary.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"Did you guys see, there's a documentary"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"called ""The Other Fellow,"" made by this bloke,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"called Matthew Bowyer, which is about other people"
00:34:15,00:34:18,"with the name James Bond, and it went around the world,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"interviewing them, and the vast majority"
00:34:20,00:34:22,basically find it incredibly annoying.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"There was one guy who said,"
00:34:23,00:34:26,"""The most annoying thing is that at least four times a week,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,"""people come up to him and sing the Bond theme tune,"
00:34:28,00:34:31,"""but easily half the time they attempt to do that,"
00:34:31,00:34:33,"""they sing the Mission Impossible theme tune instead."""
00:34:33,00:34:35,(laughing)
00:34:35,00:34:37,- Really?
00:34:37,00:34:39,"- There was a Canadian lawyer who was quite nice,"
00:34:39,00:34:42,"he was called James Bond, and he always hated it"
00:34:42,00:34:43,"'cause of all the jokes and stuff,"
00:34:43,00:34:46,and then eventually he got married the year before
00:34:46,00:34:49,"they made the documentary, and the guy he married said,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"""Look, there's no way I'm not calling you James Bond,"""
00:34:51,00:34:53,"so he always went by Jim, Jim Bond."
00:34:53,00:34:55,"He said, ""There's no way I'm not calling you James Bond,"""
00:34:55,00:34:58,"and so now he embraces it, and he calls his husband,"
00:34:58,00:35:01,"Moneypenny, and always orders Volcomartini,"
00:35:01,00:35:04,"shaken, not stirred, and I think that's the way to go."
00:35:04,00:35:08,"- So Sean Connery, obviously very sadly passed away recently,"
00:35:08,00:35:11,nice little James Bond connection from his earlier life
00:35:11,00:35:14,"is that Connery used to deliver milk, he was a milkman,"
00:35:14,00:35:17,"and he used to deliver milk to Fetty's school in the UK,"
00:35:17,00:35:21,and that is where the fictional James Bond went to.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"- Oh, no way! - That's insane."
00:35:23,00:35:25,"- Yeah, he was a model for fictional James Bond."
00:35:25,00:35:27,- I guess he would have been doing it
00:35:27,00:35:29,"'cause when was Connery born, 1930,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,he might have been doing it at the time
00:35:31,00:35:33,"when Bond was at that school,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,as in he might have been delivering it
00:35:35,00:35:37,to his fictional self without knowing it.
00:35:37,00:35:41,"- He has a sort of a billion jobs, didn't he?"
00:35:41,00:35:42,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:35:42,00:35:43,- It kind of implied that he couldn't stick it
00:35:43,00:35:47,"at a thing in a way, but one of the jobs that I like"
00:35:47,00:35:49,is the fact that he worked as a life drawing model
00:35:49,00:35:53,'cause it means that we have an almost entirely naked picture
00:35:53,00:35:56,"of Sean Connery in his very early days available,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,and bizarrely he worked as a life drawing model
00:35:58,00:36:01,"and the quite famous arts promoter and artist,"
00:36:01,00:36:04,"Richard DeMarco drew him, so you can see Sean Connery,"
00:36:04,00:36:08,"and he's wearing this sort of brown willysack,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,"like a tiny, what do you call, like a--"
00:36:10,00:36:12,- Like a posing pouch. - A posing pouch.
00:36:12,00:36:14,- A posing pouch. - Yeah.
00:36:14,00:36:16,I would call it a willysack if you like.
00:36:16,00:36:17,- It's a willysack.
00:36:17,00:36:19,- Are you sure it's a willysack
00:36:19,00:36:22,"and not just he's got very, very weird genitals?"
00:36:22,00:36:26,"- I couldn't say 100%, I didn't zoom in closely enough."
00:36:26,00:36:28,- It's worth taking a look.
00:36:28,00:36:30,"- Yeah, that sounds like the artists in the class"
00:36:30,00:36:31,"just got prudish when they got down there,"
00:36:31,00:36:33,"""Ugh, that will do."""
00:36:33,00:36:34,(all laughing)
00:36:34,00:36:36,"- Yeah, just a brown blur."
00:36:36,00:36:41,"- He was supposed to be Gandalf, wasn't he?"
00:36:41,00:36:43,The Lord of the Rings. - Really?
00:36:43,00:36:48,- But he was offered 15% of the box office receipts
00:36:48,00:36:51,which would have given him $450 million.
00:36:51,00:36:56,And he turned it down 'cause he didn't understand the script.
00:36:56,00:36:59,"And then they interviewed him later and he said,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"""I've read the book, I read the script,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,"""I saw the movie, I still don't understand it."""
00:37:03,00:37:06,(all laughing)
00:37:06,00:37:08,- 15%? - Yeah.
00:37:08,00:37:11,"- Instead, he made the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"
00:37:11,00:37:12,as his last film.
00:37:12,00:37:14,What a different film to go out on.
00:37:14,00:37:15,"- That was his last film, really."
00:37:15,00:37:17,"- Yeah, he retired after that because it,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,"I mean, it is a bit of a honker."
00:37:19,00:37:22,"- He was a member of the SMP,"
00:37:22,00:37:25,a sort of card carrying member
00:37:25,00:37:28,"and the membership number they gave him, 007."
00:37:28,00:37:29,- Amazing.
00:37:29,00:37:30,"- As if that wasn't used already,"
00:37:30,00:37:32,do they not even have seven members?
00:37:32,00:37:34,(all laughing)
00:37:34,00:37:36,- They had to kick an extremely long-serving
00:37:36,00:37:39,loyal person out in order to give it to them.
00:37:39,00:37:41,"- Margaret Thatcher was offered the passport 007,"
00:37:41,00:37:42,wasn't she?
00:37:42,00:37:43,"We might have said that before,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,"but she said, ""No, that's silly."""
00:37:45,00:37:47,And they gave it to someone incredibly boring
00:37:47,00:37:48,and said it was someone like him.
00:37:48,00:37:51,- Just some random lollipop man in Wales.
00:37:51,00:37:54,(all laughing)
00:37:54,00:37:54,- Was it Jeff?
00:37:54,00:37:56,"- I mean, that would make your day."
00:37:56,00:37:57,Was it Jeff?
00:37:57,00:37:57,Who did you say?
00:37:57,00:37:59,"- It was someone, who's the MP who said?"
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Jeff.
00:38:00,00:38:01,"- H, double O, N."
00:38:01,00:38:02,(all laughing)
00:38:02,00:38:03,- That's right.
00:38:03,00:38:05,(all laughing)
00:38:05,00:38:08,- He spent some time in his life sleeping in a coffin.
00:38:08,00:38:09,"- Oh, wow."
00:38:09,00:38:11,"Is that 'cause he worked,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,didn't he work as a funeral director
00:38:13,00:38:15,or a grave digger or something?
00:38:15,00:38:16,"- Oh, no, not nearly that senior."
00:38:16,00:38:18,He worked as a coffin polisher.
00:38:18,00:38:20,You've given him seven promotions.
00:38:20,00:38:22,(all laughing)
00:38:22,00:38:24,- I think he worked as a coffin polisher
00:38:24,00:38:25,because he was friends with this guy
00:38:25,00:38:30,"that he did bodybuilding with Mr. Scotland, Archie Brennan."
00:38:30,00:38:33,And Archie Brennan suggested he get into coffin polishing
00:38:33,00:38:34,to earn some extra money.
00:38:34,00:38:36,And there was an interview with someone
00:38:36,00:38:38,who was his old workmate in the warehouse
00:38:38,00:38:41,where they polished the coffins and made them.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"And it's this guy called Tommy Walk,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,"who said he noticed that Sean, young Sean,"
00:38:45,00:38:46,wasn't going home at night.
00:38:46,00:38:47,He was sleeping in the coffins.
00:38:47,00:38:50,So he was just having a bit of a rough time
00:38:50,00:38:51,at that period of his life.
00:38:51,00:38:54,- I think I'd be a bit worried about Mr. Universe
00:38:54,00:38:55,or Mr. Scotland polishing the coffins
00:38:55,00:38:58,'cause he'd be so strong he'd go right the way through it.
00:38:58,00:39:00,(all laughing)
00:39:00,00:39:03,- I love that you just corrected me
00:39:03,00:39:05,about giving a promotion to Sean Connery in that company.
00:39:05,00:39:07,And then immediately gave Mr. Scotland
00:39:07,00:39:09,the Mr. Universe title.
00:39:09,00:39:12,(all laughing)
00:39:12,00:39:13,"- Well, to Sean Connery,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,"Scotland was the universe, Dan."
00:39:15,00:39:18,So I think it's what he would have wanted me to say.
00:39:18,00:39:20,(upbeat music)
00:39:20,00:39:23,(upbeat music)
00:39:23,00:39:26,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:39:26,00:39:27,And that is my fact.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"My fact this week is in 1970,"
00:39:30,00:39:32,burglars managed to successfully get past
00:39:32,00:39:33,an unpickable door lock
00:39:33,00:39:36,and steal American government documents
00:39:36,00:39:38,by tacking a note to it a few hours beforehand
00:39:38,00:39:41,"that read, ""Please don't lock this door tonight."""
00:39:41,00:39:43,(all laughing)
00:39:43,00:39:46,"So this came from a really, really cool book"
00:39:46,00:39:48,"that was published called ""The Burglary"","
00:39:48,00:39:50,the discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's secrets
00:39:50,00:39:52,by Betty Medziger.
00:39:52,00:39:55,And the book talks about one of the great moments
00:39:55,00:39:57,of being able to expose the FBI
00:39:57,00:40:00,for some hidden secret operations
00:40:00,00:40:02,that they were conducting in America
00:40:02,00:40:04,by a group that were known as the Citizens Commission
00:40:04,00:40:06,"to investigate the FBI,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,random group of people who decided to make it their mission
00:40:09,00:40:12,to infiltrate the FBI and steal these documents.
00:40:12,00:40:15,But there was a whole scene of these sort of anti-war
00:40:15,00:40:16,and anti-government activists
00:40:16,00:40:18,"that had been operating in the States,"
00:40:18,00:40:21,going around and breaking into various buildings.
00:40:21,00:40:23,"And they broke into the FBI offices,"
00:40:23,00:40:25,"took a thousand classified documents,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,and they sent it to all the newspapers.
00:40:27,00:40:29,And the Washington Post were the first
00:40:29,00:40:31,to sort of publish them
00:40:31,00:40:32,and show that there was secret spying
00:40:32,00:40:35,that was going on under J. Edgar Hoover's government
00:40:35,00:40:37,and really kind of tore him down a lot.
00:40:37,00:40:41,"So yeah, this unpickable lock was just an earlier mission"
00:40:41,00:40:45,where they were trying to get some draft papers
00:40:45,00:40:47,for the Vietnam War and steal them
00:40:47,00:40:49,so people couldn't be drafted.
00:40:49,00:40:52,- And did the people in the offices explain
00:40:52,00:40:54,why they had read the note and decided
00:40:54,00:40:56,that that was a legit reason to leave the door open?
00:40:56,00:40:58,'Cause I can't think of a single ordinary circumstance
00:40:58,00:40:59,where you would request
00:40:59,00:41:01,that people don't lock a door overnight.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"- Yes, I would immediately obey the sign."
00:41:03,00:41:05,"If there was a sign on the door saying,"
00:41:05,00:41:06,"""Please don't lock this door,"""
00:41:06,00:41:08,"I think, ""Oh, well, someone has a good reason."""
00:41:08,00:41:09,- That is so good to know.
00:41:09,00:41:12,And I intend to take advantage of that in the future.
00:41:12,00:41:14,"- Was it that the cleaners maybe,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,the cleaners were coming around after the office was shut
00:41:16,00:41:17,"and they would normally lock up,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,but they thought that someone in the office
00:41:19,00:41:20,had left that note.
00:41:20,00:41:21,That might be it.
00:41:21,00:41:22,- Yeah.
00:41:22,00:41:23,"- I don't, yeah."
00:41:23,00:41:25,"- Well, they couldn't believe it worked, by the way."
00:41:25,00:41:26,"They got there and they're like, ""Oh my God."""
00:41:26,00:41:29,And they almost toyed with the idea
00:41:29,00:41:31,of leaving a thank you note on the door.
00:41:31,00:41:33,"And then they thought, ""No, that's going too far."""
00:41:33,00:41:35,They might recognize the handwriting.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"- I like that idea of leaving notes,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"burglars leaving notes generally,"
00:41:39,00:41:40,which they do sometimes do.
00:41:40,00:41:41,They sometimes leave apology notes.
00:41:41,00:41:43,It seems to be quite a common thing.
00:41:43,00:41:45,My friend's granny was actually robbed recently
00:41:45,00:41:46,"and they left an apology note saying,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,"""Sorry for stealing your stuff."""
00:41:48,00:41:49,"And there was one,"
00:41:49,00:41:52,"there was a really nice story this year,"
00:41:52,00:41:53,"in February in North Carolina,"
00:41:53,00:41:56,where someone who worked in a salon
00:41:56,00:41:57,came to the salon the next day.
00:41:57,00:41:58,"And it was clear someone had broken in,"
00:41:58,00:42:01,but couldn't find that anything had been taken.
00:42:01,00:42:03,"And then she found a note that said,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,"""As I left your salon with all the stuff I'd stolen,"
00:42:05,00:42:06,and then with the list of all the stuff
00:42:06,00:42:07,"this person has stolen,"
00:42:07,00:42:10,I had an epiphany of how hard you work for your business.
00:42:10,00:42:12,And I returned everything I've taken.
00:42:12,00:42:13,Here's everything I've returned.
00:42:13,00:42:14,Please forgive me.
00:42:14,00:42:16,"I'm ashamed to discuss it myself."""
00:42:16,00:42:17,- And then brought it all back.
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- See, that I think is better than leaving a note"
00:42:19,00:42:20,"which says, ""Sorry for stealing your stuff,"
00:42:20,00:42:23,"which I have gone ahead and done anyway."""
00:42:23,00:42:24,That's baloney.
00:42:24,00:42:27,- It feels like the apology is a little bit empty
00:42:27,00:42:28,"in the first one, doesn't it?"
00:42:28,00:42:29,"- Yeah, it does."
00:42:29,00:42:30,It absolutely does.
00:42:30,00:42:32,"I would leave a note saying, ""Sorry about the poo,"""
00:42:32,00:42:33,but they're not leaving the poo.
00:42:33,00:42:34,(laughing)
00:42:34,00:42:36,For the rest of their time there.
00:42:36,00:42:38,- Yeah.
00:42:38,00:42:39,"- Poos happen a lot, right?"
00:42:39,00:42:41,"Apparently, someone did a,"
00:42:41,00:42:44,they did a scientific paper on not leaving it
00:42:44,00:42:44,"as a dirty protest,"
00:42:44,00:42:47,but needing to have a poo while robbing a house.
00:42:47,00:42:50,"So there's a paper, which I haven't actually read."
00:42:50,00:42:50,I just saw it.
00:42:50,00:42:53,"It was called, ""The Scatological Rights of Bird Wars."""
00:42:53,00:42:55,And it showed that in a lot of cases
00:42:55,00:42:56,"where people were caught,"
00:42:56,00:43:00,they admitted to having a poo while doing the burglary.
00:43:00,00:43:02,"- Because you're quite stressed, it makes you want to go,"
00:43:02,00:43:04,but you can get caught by people
00:43:04,00:43:08,"finding the DNA of your inside your poo, don't they?"
00:43:08,00:43:09,- Yes.
00:43:09,00:43:10,- So do flush it is what you're saying.
00:43:10,00:43:13,- We'll take it home to be safe.
00:43:13,00:43:15,- To be truly safe.
00:43:15,00:43:18,- I was reading about the hamburgler in the news this year
00:43:18,00:43:20,and that was a man who stole some ham.
00:43:20,00:43:22,He was called Domingo Infante.
00:43:22,00:43:24,He was 34 years old in Spain.
00:43:24,00:43:26,And he went into a shop
00:43:26,00:43:29,and there was massive legs of Iberico ham.
00:43:29,00:43:32,"You know, those massive like cured ham legs."
00:43:32,00:43:35,"And he stole, I think like four or five of them,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,"but they're really heavy, those things."
00:43:37,00:43:39,"I don't know if you've ever picked one up,"
00:43:39,00:43:40,but they're super heavy.
00:43:40,00:43:43,And so he had to drag them home to his house
00:43:43,00:43:48,"leaving the trail of fat all the way to his front door,"
00:43:48,00:43:50,which they just followed.
00:43:50,00:43:51,And they knocked on the door
00:43:51,00:43:53,and he was living with his parents
00:43:53,00:43:55,"and they said, ""Have you got some hams here?"""
00:43:55,00:43:57,And eventually they had to admit that they did.
00:43:57,00:43:59,"- Oh my God, that is such an example"
00:43:59,00:44:01,of letting the best be the enemy of the good.
00:44:01,00:44:03,"Those hams last for ages, I bet,"
00:44:03,00:44:06,"'cause they're quite densely packed, aren't they?"
00:44:06,00:44:09,"If you had one of them, he probably would have been fine."
00:44:09,00:44:10,- They're expensive though.
00:44:10,00:44:12,I think he probably intended to sell them
00:44:12,00:44:13,rather than eat them.
00:44:13,00:44:16,I think 'cause each of those is like 100 quid
00:44:16,00:44:17,"or something, I reckon."
00:44:17,00:44:19,So he was just getting seven of them
00:44:19,00:44:20,and then he was going to sell them down the park.
00:44:20,00:44:21,- That's a really good point.
00:44:21,00:44:22,"'Cause cheese, obviously,"
00:44:22,00:44:24,that's why people steal cheese from the supermarket so much.
00:44:24,00:44:26,It's a relatively large amount of money
00:44:26,00:44:28,in a relatively small box.
00:44:28,00:44:29,- Yeah.
00:44:29,00:44:29,"- Yeah, if you're hungry,"
00:44:29,00:44:32,I don't think you'd steal a giant Iberico ham.
00:44:32,00:44:34,There are so many easier foodstuffs to feed
00:44:34,00:44:36,from dragging a pig down the street.
00:44:36,00:44:40,"- In our previous books of the year,"
00:44:40,00:44:44,we've often found that American police officers
00:44:44,00:44:46,like to give their bandits nicknames.
00:44:46,00:44:47,- Oh yeah.
00:44:47,00:44:48,- Do you remember that?
00:44:48,00:44:51,"Every year, whenever there's something that happens,"
00:44:51,00:44:52,"some crime in America,"
00:44:52,00:44:55,the cops always name them the something bandit.
00:44:55,00:44:58,So I Googled a few of those.
00:44:58,00:44:59,"In Chicago this year,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,there was a guy called the mummy bandits.
00:45:01,00:45:04,Do you know why they might have called him that?
00:45:04,00:45:07,- Did he wrap himself in toilet paper?
00:45:07,00:45:08,"- Pretty much, yeah."
00:45:08,00:45:11,He wrapped himself in gauze and scarves
00:45:11,00:45:15,so that none of the CCTV cameras would know who he was.
00:45:15,00:45:18,The powder puff bandit.
00:45:18,00:45:21,Do you know what they might have done?
00:45:21,00:45:22,- Is that something to do with the cartoon?
00:45:22,00:45:23,The powder puff girls?
00:45:23,00:45:25,"- Powder puff girls, no, it's nothing to do with that."
00:45:25,00:45:27,- I think they were the power puff girls.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"They weren't just makeup artists,"
00:45:28,00:45:31,the adventures of makeup artists.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- Yeah, it's a play on words."
00:45:33,00:45:35,"They're powerful, but they're also like powder puffs."
00:45:35,00:45:37,- What is a powder puff?
00:45:37,00:45:38,"- A powder puff is like, you know,"
00:45:38,00:45:40,"if you're putting makeup on,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,but it's like you kind of puff onto your face.
00:45:42,00:45:43,- Got it.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"- So it's like, they've got the powder in one half"
00:45:45,00:45:46,"of that mirror in the other, right?"
00:45:46,00:45:47,Maybe you have a brush and use it.
00:45:47,00:45:48,"Okay, all right."
00:45:48,00:45:50,Did they blow the very fine makeup powder
00:45:50,00:45:53,towards the CCTV cameras to hide their entry?
00:45:53,00:45:54,"- Great idea, no."
00:45:54,00:45:57,"- Oh, did they, did they using makeup?"
00:45:57,00:46:01,Did they paint someone else's face on their face?
00:46:01,00:46:02,- Great.
00:46:02,00:46:04,- It's actually the exact opposite of that.
00:46:05,00:46:09,- They painted their own face on someone else's face.
00:46:09,00:46:11,"- It's not the exact opposite of that,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,but it's something that's different.
00:46:13,00:46:17,"- What they did was, this was in Denver,"
00:46:17,00:46:19,"there's a guy called Hernandez,"
00:46:19,00:46:22,and he had extremely obvious facial tattoos.
00:46:22,00:46:26,And so he would use the foundation to cover those up
00:46:26,00:46:28,so that they wouldn't recognize him.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"- Brilliant, very clever."
00:46:30,00:46:31,"- There was a guy called,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,"this is quite easy to guess actually,"
00:46:33,00:46:35,but there was a guy in Albuquerque
00:46:35,00:46:37,called the birthday suit sign bandit.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"- If you know, did you hear about him?"
00:46:39,00:46:42,- Birthday suit sign bandit.
00:46:42,00:46:44,"- So something to do with nudity, right?"
00:46:44,00:46:46,His birthday.
00:46:46,00:46:48,- But then is he wearing a little sign over his penis
00:46:48,00:46:52,saying get action here or something like that?
00:46:52,00:46:54,- He's wearing Sean Connery's leathery glove.
00:46:54,00:46:59,- Now this was very simply a man caught naked on camera
00:46:59,00:47:02,stealing a Biden-Harris campaign sign
00:47:02,00:47:04,from a garden in Albuquerque.
00:47:04,00:47:06,- Oh.
00:47:06,00:47:07,- Flabber.
00:47:07,00:47:08,"- Anyway, that's some of those."
00:47:08,00:47:11,- Do you know how you'd burgle a house using a tortoise?
00:47:11,00:47:15,"- Wow, okay, so very slow getaway."
00:47:15,00:47:16,- Yes.
00:47:16,00:47:19,- Could you squeeze yourself under the shell
00:47:19,00:47:21,sort of between tortoise and shell?
00:47:21,00:47:23,"- No, that's not, that's a good method."
00:47:23,00:47:25,This is a gang of thieves in medieval Arabia
00:47:25,00:47:26,called the Banu Sasang.
00:47:26,00:47:28,"And in fact, they lasted hundreds of years."
00:47:28,00:47:29,It's kind of a very loose affiliation
00:47:29,00:47:32,"rather than a proper gang, like they want one entity."
00:47:32,00:47:35,"But supposedly they would bring a crowbar, a candle,"
00:47:35,00:47:38,"some stale bread, some beans, an iron spike, a drill,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,a bag of sand and a tortoise to your gang.
00:47:40,00:47:42,- I think that the drill and the iron stake and stuff
00:47:42,00:47:44,are a lot more important than the tortoise in this play.
00:47:44,00:47:47,"- No, no, no way."
00:47:47,00:47:50,"Okay, they do use the spike or the crowbar"
00:47:50,00:47:53,"to get in to access to the property, fine."
00:47:53,00:47:55,"But then they light the candle, which they've also brought,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,they stick it onto the tortoise
00:47:57,00:47:59,and they send the tortoise through the hole.
00:47:59,00:48:01,That way you can see what's in there.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"You can see if there's any stuff worth stealing, right?"
00:48:03,00:48:07,"Then you use the bag of sand,"
00:48:07,00:48:09,you throw that at the windows and see if anyone gets up.
00:48:09,00:48:12,"And if there's no one up, then you go in, right?"
00:48:12,00:48:15,"- Well, so if you're in the house and you wake up"
00:48:15,00:48:17,and you just hear a bit of banging outside
00:48:17,00:48:19,and you kind of go into your front room
00:48:19,00:48:21,"and there's a tortoise with a candle on its back,"
00:48:21,00:48:24,I still think you're going to be a bit suspicious.
00:48:24,00:48:26,- Straight back to bed for me.
00:48:26,00:48:29,"It's not a burglar, it's just the candle tortoise again."
00:48:29,00:48:31,"Also, with a note on his back saying,"
00:48:31,00:48:35,"""Please ignore me, I'm just a tortoise with a candle on my back."""
00:48:35,00:48:37,- Nothing to see here.
00:48:37,00:48:38,"- Well, I know what you're thinking."
00:48:38,00:48:40,What about the stale bread and the dried beans?
00:48:40,00:48:42,"- Sorry, that's what I was thinking, yeah."
00:48:42,00:48:44,So that's if you get in.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"So the operation tortoise has worked,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,"you've seen valuables, you're in the house,"
00:48:48,00:48:51,but then you can hear someone moving around in a nearby room.
00:48:51,00:48:54,"At that point, you noisily chew on the stale bread"
00:48:54,00:48:55,and the dried beans so that people think
00:48:55,00:48:57,it's just a cat eating a mouse.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"- Oh, right."
00:49:01,00:49:03,- Is that a Foley sound effect trick?
00:49:03,00:49:05,Is that how you simulate cat eating a mouse?
00:49:05,00:49:06,"- It is, absolutely, yeah."
00:49:06,00:49:07,- Stale bread and dried beans.
00:49:07,00:49:10,"- But we have got a cat, you might say."
00:49:10,00:49:12,"And then you're in trouble, I guess."
00:49:12,00:49:17,- Have you guys heard of George Leslie from America?
00:49:17,00:49:21,"Okay, so this is around the late 1800s."
00:49:21,00:49:26,And this is a guy who moved to New York City in 1869
00:49:26,00:49:27,"and he was a trained architect,"
00:49:27,00:49:30,but he decided to go into a life of crime.
00:49:30,00:49:34,And it is said that the gang that he created off the back of it
00:49:34,00:49:37,and the syndicate that he created off the back of it
00:49:37,00:49:40,were responsible for nearly 80% of all bank robberies
00:49:40,00:49:44,"in the US at that time, this one guy."
00:49:44,00:49:47,"So what he used to do, which was really interesting,"
00:49:47,00:49:51,"is he used to break into banks, not to rob them,"
00:49:51,00:49:55,but to walk around at night on his own and map them out.
00:49:55,00:49:58,"Then he would take his designs, 'cause he's an architect,"
00:49:58,00:50:00,he would go back to a warehouse that he owned
00:50:00,00:50:03,and build the bank in there
00:50:03,00:50:05,so that he and his fellow robbers could work out
00:50:05,00:50:07,the best way of getting through certain things
00:50:07,00:50:09,and certain doors and certain escape routes.
00:50:09,00:50:11,So he would recreate the entire interior of the bank.
00:50:11,00:50:14,"- Are you saying that he wrote ""Ocean's Eleven"""
00:50:14,00:50:17,"about 100 years before ""Ocean's Eleven""?"
00:50:17,00:50:18,"- Oh, I never saw that movie, but yeah."
00:50:18,00:50:19,- I think that's what they do.
00:50:19,00:50:20,- That's incredible.
00:50:20,00:50:21,"- Yeah, it's extraordinary."
00:50:21,00:50:22,"- Well, it is incredible."
00:50:22,00:50:24,"Apart from the people who wrote ""Ocean's Eleven"""
00:50:24,00:50:25,who probably just heard about this guy
00:50:25,00:50:27,and then stole it for their plot though.
00:50:27,00:50:31,"- Yes, I was saying the original guy is more impressive."
00:50:31,00:50:32,"- Yeah, I actually wasn't saying ""Ocean's Eleven"""
00:50:32,00:50:33,is an incredible film.
00:50:33,00:50:34,I think it's decent.
00:50:34,00:50:37,"It's certainly better than ""Ocean's Twelve""."
00:50:37,00:50:38,(laughing)
00:50:38,00:50:39,- What was he called?
00:50:39,00:50:40,- He was called George Leslie.
00:50:40,00:50:44,"And these were life-size, it's not like he did little models."
00:50:44,00:50:46,"- Well, of course you wouldn't use a tiny model."
00:50:46,00:50:49,Imagine how freaked out your gang is gonna be
00:50:49,00:50:51,if they get into the vault and it's huge.
00:50:51,00:50:52,They haven't trained for this.
00:50:52,00:50:55,(laughing)
00:50:55,00:50:56,- There was a burglar in 2014
00:50:56,00:51:00,who managed to delay 783 trains
00:51:00,00:51:03,as a result of his burglary.
00:51:03,00:51:04,Unbelievable.
00:51:04,00:51:08,So he'd cut open a curry stall near Charlton
00:51:08,00:51:10,and the police turned up and he panicked and fled.
00:51:10,00:51:12,"And then he got onto his motorbike,"
00:51:12,00:51:13,also stolen by the way.
00:51:13,00:51:16,So not even an unscrupulously acquired motorbike.
00:51:16,00:51:17,That didn't start.
00:51:17,00:51:19,He ran off and then he climbed up a tree.
00:51:19,00:51:22,But unfortunately the tree was kind of overhanging
00:51:22,00:51:25,the railway tracks at Charlton station.
00:51:25,00:51:28,"And he decided to stay up there for 17 hours,"
00:51:28,00:51:30,despite the police being there.
00:51:30,00:51:31,At that point the game is over
00:51:31,00:51:32,and I think you have to come down from the tree.
00:51:32,00:51:33,"- So, did the police,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,were the police stood under the tree at this time
00:51:35,00:51:37,saying you're gonna have to come down eventually?
00:51:37,00:51:39,"- Pretty much, yeah."
00:51:39,00:51:40,- Don't you call the fire engine at that point?
00:51:40,00:51:43,"- Yeah, say we've got a cat burglar stuck up in the tree."
00:51:43,00:51:45,(laughing)
00:51:45,00:51:46,- They always find their own way down.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"Don't worry, you don't actually need it."
00:51:48,00:51:49,(laughing)
00:51:49,00:51:52,(upbeat music)
00:51:52,00:51:53,"- Okay, that's it."
