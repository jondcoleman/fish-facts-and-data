00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.820
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.580
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.500
 coming from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.620
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.260
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.160
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.680
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.520
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.160
 My fact is that Sir Roger Penrose,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.780
 the mathematician who's just won the Nobel Prize,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.820
 once designed a theoretically infinite

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 geometrical pattern called the Penrose Tiles.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.600
 He then sued a toilet paper company for stealing it

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 and creating a theoretically infinite toilet paper roll.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.320
 (laughing)

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.800
 Why would you need an infinite,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080
 well, I suppose everyone's hoarding toilet paper

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.920
 at the moment, aren't they?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760
 - Exactly. - An infinite one

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.120
 would be really useful.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.760
 - Okay, so basically, Roger Penrose,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.440
 he's a brilliant, brilliant mathematician.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.680
 In the 1970s, he invented this thing called Penrose Tiling,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.400
 which basically combines two different rhomboids

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.040
 that can be repeated ad infinitum.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 Never, this pattern never repeats itself.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.840
 It's really amazing.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 He had just invented them for fun as well.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.960
 He does lots of stuff like this for fun.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 He's fun as well as being a mathematician.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.160
 But a few years later, in fact,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.640
 more than 20 years later actually,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.080
 after he invented it, his wife was in the supermarket

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.960
 and she saw some Kleenex loo paper

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 and it looked just like his,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960
 she thought, "I know that pattern."

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 And she bought some and she took it home.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.560
 And the firm, the firm which owned Kleenex, Kimberly Clark,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.360
 they had come up with toilet paper, which copied it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.880
 And he sued.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.220
 - Wow. - He sued.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.060
 - Successfully?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.720
 - Well, he won't talk about what happened in court.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.440
 It was amicably settled outside of court.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.800
 - Yeah, but I think the condition was,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.160
 you can't say Roger Pemrose that they gave you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.680
 20 billion quid or whatever,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.200
 whatever the time the sum was.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.360
 - If he asked for like one pence

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.200
 every time they used his pattern,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.600
 and this is a pattern that never, ever repeats infinitely,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.400
 then he could just get all the money in the world.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 The reason it's useful for a toilet paper

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.240
 to have this pattern is you want your toilet paper

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.920
 to be quilted, right?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 And so it's gonna have a pattern going throughout it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.520
 where you have some bits that have got indentation

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.920
 in some places that don't.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.880
 So let's imagine you have just a diamond

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.040
 that goes throughout the entire roll.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 So your diamond keeps coming up every now and then

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.240
 and you have it on the whole roll.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 Once you wrap it around a toilet paper holder,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.120
 then the diamonds in some places

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.800
 are gonna be on top of each other.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.840
 And so it's gonna get thicker in those places

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.480
 and it's gonna be thinner in other places,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.640
 which makes it less efficient to package.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.800
 Now, if you have a pattern which never repeats,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.600
 then it means that you're never gonna have

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.320
 those kind of indentations that kind of go over each other.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.760
 So it makes it better for a type of toilet paper

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.640
 if you want quilted toilet paper.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.480
 - Oh, wow.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 - It's basically the perfect toilet paper he invented,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.080
 but he didn't see it that way.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.000
 - Well, that's the thing with mathematics, isn't it?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.920
 Like you just study maths for the sake of it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 'cause it's beautiful

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.840
 and 'cause the numbers do amazing things.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.200
 And you never know what the applications are gonna be.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.840
 You never know what it's gonna be.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.360
 Maybe, you know, infinite amounts of energy

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.920
 for the entire world are just a quite a nice bit

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.840
 of toilet paper.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.960
 - 'Cause he's denying the world the best version

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.680
 of toilet paper that we could possibly have.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.800
 - He pretty much is.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.520
 This was quite a big case at the time.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.800
 I mean, big, big for 1997, but like marketing week.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.920
 - Wait, wasn't it for 1997?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.760
 - Yeah.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 - No, sorry.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.080
 - We're called cases famously usually very small in 1997.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.040
 - I just couldn't think of much else that happened in 1997.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.760
 - Tony Blair came in in 1997.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.600
 - That's true.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.440
 - That's true.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.880
 - But I remember not really being on the front page

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.720
 of the newspapers

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.520
 'cause it was all about this toilet paper case.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.360
 - The Hong Kong handover barely got a mention, didn't it?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.200
 - Okay, all right.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.320
 Look, we can all name something that happened in 1997.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 Well done, everybody.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.640
 But when it happened,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.480
 there's a publication called "Marketing Week"

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.640
 which writes all about this.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.600
 And they wrote this excoriating editorial.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.960
 They said, and it was about quilted toilet paper.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.600
 They said, "The decline of our island kingdom

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.240
 dates almost precisely from our ceasing to use

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.640
 robust lavatory paper, shiny on one side and dull on the other

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.320
 and favoring scented absorbent toilet tissue.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.880
 A nation that dabs rather than stoically abrades its bottom

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.200
 has become a feat and can never be at peace with itself."

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.720
 - Wow, do you think the bottoms are now a bit bigger

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.560
 than they used to be

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.440
 because they're not slowly enroded away by toilet paper?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.680
 - 100%, I do think that, yeah.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.000
 - But did it say toilet paper had turned fragrant?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.720
 'Cause we don't do that anymore.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.000
 - It did say scented absorbent toilet tissue.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.480
 - Yeah, you see, when was that written?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.720
 - '97.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.680
 - '97. - There you go.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.640
 So those days are gone.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.240
 I think the author of that would be proud

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.960
 of where we've got to because it was a thing

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.080
 in the sort of '70s, '80s, '90s,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.560
 slightly fragrant toilet paper,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.680
 often a really disgusting pastel color.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.120
 And we have reverted a bit to non-smelling loo roll

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.480
 in pure white.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.040
 So I think we're working our way back

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.320
 to the splintery twigs of the park in our defense.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.680
 - These tiles that Penrose discovered,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.040
 according to our, all of our good friend, Will Bowen.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 So Will Bowen, who's one of the QILs,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.880
 he studied mathematics at Oxford

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.320
 and his teacher was Penrose.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.440
 As in Penrose, he was the head of maths

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.640
 when Will was at university.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.480
 - Oh my goodness.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.360
 - And he says that Penrose broke his arm

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.680
 and that he was in hospital 'cause it's quite a bad break.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.000
 And it was while he was kind of lay in hospital

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760
 convalescing that he realized

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.960
 that these kind of tiles might exist.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.800
 And he came up with--

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.040
 - Oh, I thought, "Sorry, Penrose broke his own arm."

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040
 Not Will.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.280
 I thought that was a, they had a big varbaral--

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.200
 - He was a tough, he was a tough professor, but he was,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.440
 he broke it in an infinite number of places.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.800
 - Sorry, go on, Penrose is lying in hospital.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.080
 - Yeah, he's lying in hospital

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.040
 and he just has this kind of idea

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.880
 that well, what if you can have testilating patterns

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.720
 so you can put squares all after each other

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.600
 and they'll go together and there'll be no gaps in between.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.800
 You can do the same with triangles,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.920
 you can do the same with lots of different shapes.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.400
 But what he thought was what if you could make things

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000
 testilate but they never repeated

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.200
 and he came up with this idea

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.040
 of using these kind of pentagon things.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.160
 But while he was in hospital, so it's kind of--

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.640
 - And it's that the pattern is that it testilates perfectly

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.240
 with these two different shapes, but it never,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.000
 so there are no gaps and also you only use two shapes

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.560
 and they all, they repeat forever.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.000
 - Yeah, usually the shapes known as kites and darts

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.040
 because that's kind of what they look like

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.000
 and you'll just keep putting one next to the other,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 next to the other, next to the other with no gaps

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.680
 but no matter how many millions and millions of miles you go

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.560
 you'll never have repeating pattern.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.440
 - And that was a revolution in actual floor tiling.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.560
 He's basically an interior designer.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.400
 Glorified interior designer.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.040
 - Actually at the Mathematical Institutes of Oxford,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.200
 one of the bits of paving is made of Penrose tiles.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.040
 - That's so nice. - Really?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.560
 - Yeah, that makes sense. - That was really good.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.280
 - He did, so he wasn't the first person,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.680
 I don't think, to come up with the idea

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.800
 of trying to have a never-repeasing pattern of tiling

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.840
 but people were doing this in the 1960s

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.520
 and so people thought that in the end,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.000
 a pattern of shapes that you're trying to fit together

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 without any gaps as in tiled together,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.800
 the shapes will always end up eventually repeating themselves

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.280
 and then a bunch of mathematicians discovered

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.400
 that there's a specific set of 20,426 different shapes

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.280
 that if you combine all of them, eventually they won't repeat.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.160
 So they were like, "Okay, as long as you've just got

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.840
 over 20,000 different shapes, stick them all together,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.320
 you'll never have the pattern repeating."

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.880
 And all Penrose did was, took that figure down to two.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.920
 And I don't know if he went down one by one,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.400
 eradicating one shape after the other,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.840
 but yeah, try this kites and darts thing.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.720
 - It's amazing that the mathematicians

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.080
 were doing this kind of thing, right?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.760
 It's really easy to understand concepts,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.240
 just finding new shapes that fit next to each other.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.520
 Obviously quite complicated mathematics,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.400
 but you always think that mathematicians are just working

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.800
 with all sorts of numbers and symbols and stuff,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.120
 not shapes like that.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.520
 That's why it's-- - Yeah.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.800
 - Have you guys ever heard of Marjorie Rice?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
 - No, Marjorie Rice.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.840
 So there's a guy called Martin Gardner

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.800
 who you might have heard of

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.360
 and he did like a lot of columns.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.480
 He was like a popular mathematician

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.560
 and he wrote once in one of his columns

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.480
 that only certain types of pentagons

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.840
 can perfectly tile on a flat surface.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.520
 And they were all known.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.920
 So there's only a few different types of pentagons

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.640
 that can tessellate and we know what they all are.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.480
 And this lady called Marjorie Rice,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.840
 she only had a high school education,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.040
 she was in America,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.560
 and she thought, "I bet there's some more."

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.680
 And so she started cutting things out,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.960
 like cutting out these pentagons

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.840
 and trying to find different pentagons

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.440
 that would fit in this way.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.000
 And she worked on it all the way through a free time.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.080
 This was during the 1970s.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.240
 All the time she had free,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.640
 she would just try and come up with new ways

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.920
 of working out pentagons that would be able to tessellate.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.440
 And when her husband and her children came home,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.160
 she would hide them 'cause she was so embarrassed

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.640
 that this is what she was doing.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.800
 And she came up with her own notation,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.000
 her own mathematics that would describe these things.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.480
 And eventually she sent the results to Gardner

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.800
 and said, "Look, I found all these new pentagons

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.200
 "which will tessellate."

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.480
 And he's like, "Holy shit, this is like new maths."

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.480
 And you've only got high school education

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.400
 and he sent it onto some experts.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.160
 And they saw her notation and they were like,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.600
 "Oh, this just looks like gibberish."

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.720
 But the more they looked at it,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.960
 the more they realized that this was a new type of mathematics

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.280
 that would tell you these new kind of pentagons

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.400
 that will tessellate.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.360
 And she's discovered more than 50 pentagons that tessellate.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.200
 - Jesus.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.560
 - What do we do with that kind of information?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.400
 - Tiling.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.240
 - Outside.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.680
 - But it's literally just for tiling.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.000
 It's, yeah, cool.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.840
 - No, it's really not.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.040
 - There's other stuff.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.280
 - There's really loads of things like,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.840
 for instance, the Penrose ones,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.320
 they later discovered that you can now have crystals

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.320
 which have this same non-repeating pattern.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.680
 And those crystals have amazing properties,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.760
 like they're amazing superconductors.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.360
 You can use them to put on like non-stick pans

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.200
 and stuff like that.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.760
 So there's always loads of amazing things

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760
 that come out of these things

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.680
 which you never think they're gonna come

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.680
 because it's a new beautiful kind of maths.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.400
 It's, there's always something useful.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.200
 - Those crystals, they are so cool.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.040
 So I think, okay, I'm probably gonna get this wrong

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.200
 because it's quite complicated,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.400
 but there was a crystallographer called Alan Mackay

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.420
 who said that if you put atoms at the corners

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.680
 of the Penrose tiles

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.320
 and then you bounce x-rays off those, right,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.760
 the resulting reflections form the shape

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.960
 of a perfect crystal.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.800
 - Right.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.380
 - Okay, I think I understand that just about.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.920
 But that material was discovered

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.120
 and called a quasi-crystal.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.280
 So Penrose had basically invented a new,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.200
 like inventing a new species of animal or plant.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.880
 And then that's discovered in the real world.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.960
 - Exactly, it's like you're an author

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.200
 and you just make up a new animal

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.480
 and then they go around the corner and it's just there.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.300
 It's so weird, completely mad.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.280
 - But I think this whole fitting shapes together thing

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.600
 might be the back door into maths.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.160
 If anyone's looking for an easy way

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.920
 to a Nobel Prize in maths.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.120
 Because there's this woman who doesn't even have an education.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.480
 Even we understand fitting shapes together.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.960
 Penrose came up with the basis of his idea

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.140
 when he was nine, he says.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.000
 And you go, what can you do when you're nine?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.040
 He said that he was having a chat with his dad

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.960
 and he asked, can you fit regular hexagons together

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.960
 to make a sphere?

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.680
 As you do, the standard kind of question you ask

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.000
 when you're nine years old.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.440
 And his dad said,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.080
 his dad said, no, you can't fit regular hexagons

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.520
 together until they make a sphere.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.360
 You have to include some pentagons.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.560
 And he said, that was the moment.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.720
 He thought, that was a huge surprise to me.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.480
 And that's the moment I realized I had to go

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.480
 into the business of fitting shapes together.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.560
 And this is another one of those weird, true things.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.320
 And that's the easiest way to picture this

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.880
 is thinking of a football, right?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.240
 You know, football's are designed

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.960
 with little hexagonal shapes all over them.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.400
 But the only way you can make a footballer's sphere

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.920
 is by having at least 12 pentagons hidden in there somewhere.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.240
 So if you look at a football,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.040
 each pentagon has hexagons, five hexagons around it, isn't it?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.200
 - Yeah, that's a special kind of hatred

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.280
 of Matt Parker, isn't it?

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.540
 The mathematician. - Yes.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.560
 - Our friend Matt Parker.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.160
 Yeah, whenever he sees a picture of a football

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.540
 on like a signpost or something,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.660
 if there's no pentagons on there, he gets furious.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.420
 - Yeah. - Really?

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.260
 - Yeah.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.040
 - Just on that, we should say that it may not be

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.740
 a complete backdoor to a Nobel Prize

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.680
 because Penrose's Nobel Prize is for his work on black holes

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.940
 where he used maths to prove that the formation

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.700
 of black holes is an inevitable consequence

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.720
 of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.200
 So you can't just cut out some shapes

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.120
 and then expect to win the Nobel Prize.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.940
 You have to prove black holes can exist.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.740
 - You can't just design a loo roll and hope for the best.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.420
 - So Roger Penrose is 89 years old

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.740
 and he has just won this Nobel Prize.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.460
 And for someone who's so incredibly clever,

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.580
 he was a bit thick about understanding

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.480
 that there was an award on the way.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.100
 He got a message from his PA saying that someone,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.020
 a strange person had called up and asked for his number.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.380
 And he says later on, that's when he should have,

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.100
 you know, smelt a fish is his words.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.600
 He should have seen someone who's coming.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.080
 Then someone called him up from Sweden

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.480
 and asked him to go on hold on the phone.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.680
 So he waited and waited, but then he got bored.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.000
 So he hung up.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.680
 So the Nobel committee had to recall him

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.720
 in order to give him his award.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.320
 But yeah, just didn't spot it coming.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.160
 - That's so funny.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.000
 - Wow.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.600
 - Well, did you guys see the video of the people

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.720
 who won the Nobel Prize for Economics this year?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.560
 - No.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.480
 - No, it's the greatest thing to come out of 2020,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.240
 which I know is not a difficult competition.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.080
 - It's the Nobel Prize.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.320
 - It's not like 1997, whoa, what a year.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.040
 (laughing)

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.340
 - The Nobel Prize for Economics went to these two people,

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.420
 Robert Wilson and Paul Milgram,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.300
 who sort of redesigned auctions,

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.660
 which is apparently this revolutionary thing.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.940
 And anyway, usually what happens with the Nobel's

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.060
 is they're decided in Sweden

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.060
 and a lot of the winners are in America.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.500
 And so they call up Americans in the middle of the night.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.300
 And there's often stories of them being woken up

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.300
 in the middle of the night.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.860
 So they called up these guys

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.700
 and they called Wilson, got through to him.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.940
 Well, at first they couldn't get through

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.440
 'cause he switched his phone off thinking it was a nobody.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.680
 And so they called his wife

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.560
 and his wife woke up, Wilson, said,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.180
 "Hey, it's the Nobel Committee.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.840
 "I reckon I know what it's about."

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.800
 So Wilson answered and was like, "Thanks very much."

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.360
 And then the Nobel Committee said,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.520
 "Hey, I don't suppose you know your partner

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.400
 "from 30 years ago when you came up this idea,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.880
 "Paul Milgram, we can't get through to him.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.520
 "Do you have any idea how we could?"

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.820
 And Wilson said, "Well, actually, we live opposite each other.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.660
 (laughing)

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.260
 "So you want me to go knock on his door?"

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:00.100
 And so there's CCTV footage from the door cam

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.420
 of Paul Milgram's camera of this guy.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.180
 And he's in his 80s, Wilson.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.840
 This guy banging on his door,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.980
 like ringing on the doorbell.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.540
 And he's like, "Paul, Paul!"

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.900
 Yeah, that's sort of like really bad connection.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.540
 And he's just woken up in the middle of the night.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.380
 He's like, "What?

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.380
 "Yeah, you've won the Nobel Prize.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.220
 "Yeah, can you answer your phone?"

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.500
 And it's just the most bizarre footage.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.700
 I'm so annoyed, by the way, you told that story.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.420
 'Cause when you said he was banging on the door,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.180
 I was just about to jump in with,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.780
 "Did he have no bell?"

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.040
 But then you went, or ringing the doorbell,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.640
 "Oh, no!"

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.300
 Damn it, I completely screwed you over.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.880
 (upbeat music)

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:43.580
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.060
 - My fact this week is that a Washington State's

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.700
 Department of Agriculture recently lost track

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.300
 of a single hornet they were trying to follow.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.300
 (laughing)

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.260
 Specifically, the Asian giant hornet,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.860
 also known as the murder hornet,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.980
 which has been hanging out in Japan and China

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.220
 for a very long time, but arrived in America

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.300
 in October this year and caused absolute panic

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.180
 because it's an invasive species,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.600
 and also really hurts if you get stung by it,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.820
 and it destroys bee species.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.460
 So the State Department said we've got a catch one,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.700
 and we've got a catch one that's gonna lead us back

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.860
 to the hive, to the nest.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.020
 And so they came up with all these ideas of getting it,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.700
 so they caught one hornet, I think,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.540
 and attempted to super glue or double-sided sticky tape,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.740
 or tracking device to it, but that didn't work.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.260
 And eventually they trapped one by strapping a bit

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.580
 of dental floss around its stomach,

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.460
 and attaching a tracking device to that, like a belt,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.900
 and then chasing it, trying to chase it down.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.220
 But they lost it, disappeared, 'cause they fly,

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.060
 and they're fast, and they're hard to chase.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.900
 - Wow.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.060
 - Well, they used Bluetooth.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.620
 That was one way they lost it.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.980
 Yeah, in an early experiment,

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.140
 the transmitter they had attached to it

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.380
 was a Bluetooth one, and it only works over a few hundred feet.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.500
 So if it gets out of your range, then you're stuffed.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.340
 - Yeah.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.620
 - The chief entomologist did also say

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.620
 it actually does fly a lot faster

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.180
 than we realized we could run.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.020
 So yeah, it was based on having to keep up

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.500
 with this bit of signal.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.620
 - You need a Judas insect, they call it,

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.940
 to lead you back to the hive.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.620
 This is what they say it is.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.340
 So to get your hornet in the first place,

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.100
 you leave out some orange juice and some rice wine,

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.140
 which they love, 'cause it's so sugary.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.540
 And then you can trap it,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.860
 and that's what it's called, the Judas insect.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.220
 - It's interesting, 'cause they come over from,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.740
 is it Japan or China or somewhere?

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.580
 From Japan, isn't it?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.420
 - Both.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.220
 - Is that why they like rice wine?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.460
 Like, 'cause they used to it in Japan.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.180
 - I do not know whether it's Japan-specific food.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.580
 I don't know whether the tastes of the insects are the same.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.620
 - You don't know?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.020
 - It's good, I like it, I like the theory.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.620
 So the big problem with these hornets, right,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.740
 is that the bees and so on in America

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.260
 don't know how to deal with them at all,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.140
 because they've not had them as part of their life.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.700
 And the name, murder hornet,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.340
 is applied not because they're dangerous to humans,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.300
 they are dangerous to humans,

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.380
 but really it's applied properly

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.380
 because of how dangerous they are to the bees.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.380
 They can go into their nests

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.740
 and basically just decimate within minutes.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.780
 They just rip heads off, arms off, everything off,

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.940
 and it's a blood bath in there.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.780
 They can kill 40 European bees in a minute.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.620
 Like, these are absolutely the fastest.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.180
 - So people do call them murder hornets,

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.580
 but entomologists are furious about that.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.900
 They do not like to call in these murder hornets

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.940
 because it's just, it's bad PR.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.620
 They're just hornets, they're just animals.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.820
 They're doing, you know, they're doing what hornets do.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.260
 And like, okay, in America,

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.980
 they are an invasive species and in Canada,

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.660
 but in Japan, they use them to work against pests.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.060
 As in if bees, if pests come into their fields,

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.060
 they can use these hornets to get rid of them.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.820
 - What kind of pests are you getting rid of though?

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.700
 - Well, I can only imagine it's lots of bees

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.860
 'cause that seems to be what they do,

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.420
 but no, it isn't.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.380
 I think hornets, these hornets, they eat all insects.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.340
 So they do like the tasty North American bees quite a lot,

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.580
 but if there are any other insects there,

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.060
 then they'll eat those as well.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.500
 So the other name you can call them,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.140
 I think in America, they're quite often called

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.900
 giant Asian hornets,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.980
 but there is an entomologist called Akito Kawahara

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.580
 who says that really you shouldn't call them that,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.180
 either because Asian can have meanings

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.860
 like Asian flu and stuff like that.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.420
 So you're kind of taking a bad thing

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.100
 and you're giving it that epithet.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.580
 So you shouldn't really do that.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.860
 So really just giant hornets or large hornets,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.100
 that's what he says, just call them big, big old hornets.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.140
 - In Japan, they get called giant sparrow hornets,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.540
 which is pretty terrifying.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.820
 But I think there's a weird thing

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.740
 because the murder hornet thing is,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.460
 in Japan, they're not called murder hornets

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.660
 or rather the word that gets applied to them

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.500
 just kind of means killer hornets.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.180
 And that's because in the Japanese language,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.180
 the word for kill and murder are the same, I think.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.020
 So they don't, so the much more pejorative version

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.900
 is the one that's made its way into English,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.380
 the much more evocative name.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.500
 Killer hornets, obviously also not a great name to have.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.700
 - Well, they kill up to 50 people every year,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.340
 like humans in Japan, especially.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.860
 And they have this sting,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.460
 which if you're wearing a normal beekeeping suit,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.700
 it's still strong enough to go through this beekeeping suit

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.940
 and it can kill you.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.260
 So one of the world experts always wears a hazmat suit instead.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.780
 - Well, I got, I was really excited to realize that we,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.060
 after I found this fact,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.540
 I was just looking through podcast emails

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.740
 to see if anyone's ever mentioned hornets.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.340
 And we very recently got contacted

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.500
 by this guy called Konrad Berube,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.620
 who is the guy who took out the first hornet nest

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.340
 in North America when it arrived last year.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.780
 So it came to Canada, it was in British Columbia.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.260
 And so he's this expert and he published this paper on it.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.380
 And one of the things he said is

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.660
 that when he's chasing them around,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.580
 he wears a Kevlar vest and he wore two pairs of trousers.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.820
 He wears braces that are built

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.260
 to ward against chainsaw injury.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.220
 And then he wears beekeeping gear.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.120
 He's still got stung quite a bit.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.660
 And he said that it was extremely painful,

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.700
 but he's a beekeeper.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.460
 So he suspects that for normal people

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.980
 who aren't used to being stung,

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.020
 be real agony.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.860
 But isn't that cool?

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.820
 We've, a podcast fan is the guy

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.140
 who took out the first nest in North America.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.020
 He also said, incidentally,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.020
 that he would never use the M phrase.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.740
 We doesn't like to use the M phrase,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.260
 the murder hornet phrase.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.780
 You've got to be very politically correct

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.500
 with these hornets attack.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.180
 - That guy, did he hoover them up?

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.220
 'Cause they have vacuum cleaners

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.380
 that they use for insect special ones.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.440
 - Yes, I think it's might've been him.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.000
 'Cause was this August, 2019,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.400
 that they arrived in North America?

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.800
 He said that the hornets were so big

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.720
 that they wouldn't fit in the nozzle of his vacuum cleaner.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.760
 That is terrifying.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.880
 - That was in the Vancouver area, I think,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.040
 that first one last year.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.640
 And they found the first one in the United States this year,

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.000
 which was in Washington.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.800
 And again, they use the vacuum cleaner

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.360
 to suck that one away.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.680
 And it was done by an entomologist called Chris Looney.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.960
 - Nice.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.220
 - I hope he lived up to his name

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.180
 and just went in wearing boxer shorts, bare chest boots.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.740
 - So Looney said, because we've been talking about

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.860
 how people are very scared of getting the sting

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.620
 and how it can penetrate.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.580
 He's not so much scared of the sting.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.100
 What he's more petrified about is the squirty venom

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.340
 that they're able to shoot at you.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.580
 And that's another thing that you need to worry about.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.260
 So they shoot venom at you and that can really burn.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.020
 Like badly, it can give nerve damage to the eye.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.560
 And so for him, that's the more intimidating thing

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.600
 than the sting itself that he's looking out for.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.320
 - I have to say, it feels like entomologists

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.880
 who keep saying, no, they're just large hornets

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.140
 are fighting a slightly losing battle here.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.480
 Do you know how you trap them

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.080
 if you've got them in your home?

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.700
 - I think I would move house.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.600
 - Good luck in the estate agency stage, mate.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.880
 Good luck with the viewings.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.920
 - Under a bowl?

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.320
 - Well, you can use a bowl,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.720
 but the thing you need to put in the bowl is prawns.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.340
 They love prawns, especially during breeding season

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.740
 when they're going for a slightly more proteiny mix

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.880
 in their diet.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.020
 - Wait, but they surely, I know they're big,

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.300
 but they're not big enough or good enough at swimming

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.100
 to be hunting prawns in the wild.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.380
 - I think they very rarely take down full prawns

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.540
 in the wild, but they do eat meat, don't they?

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.100
 - I think a prawn is basically an insect of the sea, isn't it?

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.360
 So maybe, you know, it has a similar taste to insects.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.020
 I have eaten insects, but I've never eaten prawns,

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.820
 so I don't really know what prawns taste like.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.840
 - See, that is the reverse of most people's experience of life.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.160
 - Yes, it's true.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.280
 - I've eaten prawns, but I don't think I've eaten insects.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.680
 I swallowed the fly warts on my bike,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.080
 but it wasn't the same.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.160
 - How did you get rid of that fly?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.360
 - No, we can't go down this road, we don't have the time.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.160
 In Japan, where they are not talked of as pejoratively,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.400
 one of the reasons could be that the bees in Japan

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.000
 have evolved to deal with them much better, haven't they?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 So they have this amazing way of killing them,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.660
 which the European bees have not figured out.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.140
 So what Japanese honeybees do is if they see

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.060
 an Asian giant hornet coming towards them,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.500
 instead of going out to attack it,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.060
 which is what the European bees do when they get decimated,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.700
 they retreat back into their hive, the hornet comes in,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.500
 and then a massive crowd of them, so hundreds of bees,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.820
 swarm it, and then they vibrate around it,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.940
 giving this sort of giant hug,

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.700
 and they vibrate and vibrate and vibrate,

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.860
 so it raises the temperature so much that the hornet dies,

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.280
 and it has to be quite specific,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.280
 because a hornet dies, I think, at about 47.2 degrees C,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.200
 and the bees will die if it gets about one or two degrees

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.040
 hotter than that.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880
 - Oh, really?

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.360
 - They've got to be real thermostats in that situation.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.720
 - 'Cause that's what our theme tune's about, isn't it, then?

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.600
 - That's right, if anyone wants to find the full version

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.140
 of our theme tune called Wasps,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.280
 that is the story in the lyrics about how that happens.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280
 - Of course, yeah.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.660
 - Is it like a metaphor or something for lyrics then?

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.540
 I've realized, I've heard those lyrics, obviously,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.940
 hundreds of times, but I've never really thought.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.060
 - Yeah, it's the idea, I mean, Ash Gardner,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.180
 who wrote it will know better,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.940
 but the way I always interpret it is that you need

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.300
 all of your friend bees to kill the hornet,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.860
 you all need to come together and hold on to each other

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.900
 in order to get past this terrible foe,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.420
 and in the same way, humans, when we come together,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.980
 we can achieve anything.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.980
 - Isn't that right?

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.220
 - That's what I always thought of it.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.780
 - That's really nice.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.000
 It's time we get together, show what we can do,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.960
 you hold on to me and I'll hold on to you.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.480
 - And then we'll kill this hornet.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.560
 - Yeah.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.960
 - Down with the murder hornets, with past it.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:39.340
 - Japan has an annual wasp festival.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.180
 This is cool.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.640
 It's called the Kushihara Hebo Matsuri.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.400
 So Kushihara is the village and Hebo means wasp.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.900
 And you have to bring a wasp nest to the festival.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.720
 - What?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.520
 - So the prize is for the heaviest wasp nest,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.220
 but it's obviously quite hard to bring a wasp nest.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.060
 - Yeah.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.660
 - So this is how you do it.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.940
 You have to attach a bit of white paper

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.900
 to a tiny sliver of fish, right?

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.860
 And the wasp, wasps of meat, that will swoop in

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.060
 and it'll grab the bit of fish and it flies off.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.500
 But you can see the paper 'cause you've attached

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.340
 the paper to the fish.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.580
 So you follow this little bit of paper

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.060
 flying through the air, that takes you back to the nest.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.420
 And then you have to carefully dig it out,

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.060
 feed the wasps raw meat to grow them

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.800
 so that they build a big, strong nest.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.840
 And then you eventually bring out this whole nest box

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.960
 and you bring it to the festival.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.300
 - Oh Christ, wow.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.720
 - I think we should just say, for people at home,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.720
 don't go near a wasp's nest.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.280
 'Cause they are dangerous, aren't they?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.120
 Wasp's nest.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.800
 You can get really badly stung.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.040
 - Yeah, but if you really want to go to this festival,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.320
 I mean, who's headlining the Japanese festival?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.120
 - It's just more giant wasps.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.200
 - Exactly.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.840
 I was going to say, even bigger warning,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.200
 do not go to the wasp festival.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.040
 Certainly don't get the train there on the day

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.240
 that all the competitors are heading there as well.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.180
 - In answer to your question,

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.120
 who's headlining the wasp festival, I think it's Sting.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.960
 - Aye.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.800
 - Aye.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.380
 - In the medieval times,

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.380
 a peasant who lived near the French village of Cambrai

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.800
 dreamed that he got a divine revelation

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.420
 from a swarm of bees entering his anus.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.860
 (laughing)

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.700
 Yeah.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.020
 - Okay.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.120
 That is putting a positive spin

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.560
 on what for most people would be

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.040
 quite a negative experience.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.680
 (laughing)

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.980
 - A swarm of bees went to his anus.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.880
 - Did he enter himself into that big wasp competition?

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.140
 (laughing)

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.640
 To clarify, to clarify for a second.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.280
 I think he dreamed that a swarm of bees

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.520
 went to his anus and that the bees in the dream

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.740
 had given him a divine revelation about the evil clergy.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.740
 I don't think.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.900
 (laughing)

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.420
 But so, oh, okay.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.980
 So they spoke to him from within his anus.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.700
 - Yes, inside the dream,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.260
 they spoke to him by flying into his bosom

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.740
 and they told him a divine revelation.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.580
 - Okay.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.420
 - Okay.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.260
 - No bees were harmed.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.100
 - It's not how you'd assume

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.780
 that God would communicate with you, is it?

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.740
 But he does, he works in mysterious ones.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.340
 - Very mysterious.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.860
 - I think they had to coin that phrase

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.940
 just for this specific revelation.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.520
 (upbeat music)

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:28.680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.600
 and that is James.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that two years

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.600
 after the release of the first James Bond movie,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.340
 an actual British spy called James Bond

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.480
 was discovered in Poland.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.320
 - Incredible.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.480
 - That's so good.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.000
 - Amazing, who would have thought it?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.340
 - Was it a response to the films?

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.720
 Was it them saying, we're gonna name all us

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.540
 why is James Bond?

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.420
 - Oh, like Spartacus or something,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.300
 that would have been exactly.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.460
 There's a suggestion of that.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.500
 Now the thing is, this was in the Cold War

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.020
 and we are learning more stuff,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.420
 like it gets declassified,

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.420
 but it's still kind of sketchy what people knew

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.100
 and what people were doing and all that kind of things.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.980
 So we're kind of piecing things together.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.260
 But they found this file

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.260
 that the Polish security service put together

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.940
 during the Cold War about this guy

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.900
 called James Albert Bond.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.300
 And he went to Poland

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.620
 and ostentatiously started flirting with women

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.900
 and hanging around nuclear power plants and stuff like that.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.100
 I don't know exactly what he did,

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.540
 but he was acting very, very obviously like a spy.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.880
 And there's a suggestion

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.260
 that the British might have sent him over,

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.300
 deliberately given him that name,

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.000
 so that the Polish had to use their resources,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.200
 investigating him,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.560
 while perhaps some other covert stuff was happening.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.040
 We don't know that.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.180
 We don't know whether he was just on holiday in Poland,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.720
 who just happened to be there.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.480
 And everyone's just kind of put one-on-one together

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.780
 and got three.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.860
 His wife seems to think

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.180
 that there might have been something going on.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.780
 He's unfortunately not with us anymore,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.700
 so we can't ask him.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.660
 So who knows?

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.340
 - So many, so many James Bonds out there.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.980
 So there was a survey done by a website,

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.660
 it's a census website,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.820
 which found 7,672 James Bonds in history,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.780
 with all sorts of jobs.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.980
 They were mostly dull, you know, clerks and things.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.940
 There were some orchid growers though, that was fun.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.460
 And in the 1920 census,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.820
 there was someone who was called Goldfinger.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.980
 Goldyfinger, Goldyfinger.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.260
 - Goldyfinger, that's G-O-L-D-E, gold.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.680
 - Ah, do we know what that person did?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.520
 Were they a villain?

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.360
 Was it a profession?

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.200
 - I don't think so.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.240
 I don't know their profession.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.080
 - There's a Wikipedia page,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.120
 and obviously if you put James Bond in

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.360
 and you go for the Bond that's not the character,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.920
 you get a few notable bonds.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.040
 And so there's a few, there's a Speedway Racer,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.120
 there is a Naval Officer,

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.960
 and there's a few other,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.620
 and what's interesting is most of them,

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.620
 at some point in the article that says

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.740
 their nickname was 007.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.300
 And I think every single one of them have the same nickname.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.500
 Poor thing for their lives,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.080
 if they were after the movies.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.660
 But obviously the most notable one is the bird watcher,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.260
 the ornithologist, James Bond,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.540
 who the character was named after.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.500
 - Yes, indeed.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.180
 - They met, I think, didn't they, in the end?

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.020
 - They did.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.340
 - And actually the James Bond, the bird watcher,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.700
 said he loved being James Bond,

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.240
 because apparently it helped him get through passport control,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.640
 which just made me think the passport control

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.120
 in the '60s or whatever was quite a lot more lax.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.320
 He was just saying, "My name's James Bond."

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.840
 - Do you think he gave them the passport,

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.720
 and they saw the name,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.560
 and he just tapped to the side of his nose

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.080
 and went, "Better let me in, guys."

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.680
 - Yeah, and all the security went,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.400
 "God, this must be a thing that they forgot to tell me about."

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.360
 I'll let him through.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.640
 - Ian Fleming once wrote to the other James Bond's wife

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.640
 and said that apologizing that he'd stolen the husband's name.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.440
 And he said, "Perhaps one day your husband

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.460
 "will discover a particularly horrible species of bird,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.960
 "which he would like to christen in an insulting fashion

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.960
 "by calling it Ian Fleming."

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.800
 - Very nice.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.200
 - There's a theory that, a very new theory,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.760
 that actually it wasn't based on James Bond,

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.460
 the ornithologist, that was just a cover by Ian Fleming

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.780
 to protect the person it was based on.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.300
 And this is because a new thing came to light in 2018,

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.520
 a guy called Stephen Phillips from Swansea

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.880
 was looking into his grandfather's records,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.980
 and his grandfather's called James Bond.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.280
 And there were documents that had just been declassified

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.960
 that showed that his grandfather

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.120
 was an SOE, a special operations executive agent

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.500
 in World War II.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.080
 And he just signed the official secrets act just before D-Day,

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.700
 so he was clearly involved in that in some way.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.080
 And so this guy, Stephen Phillips' grandson,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.100
 reckons it's likely Ian Fleming would have met him

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.800
 'cause they were both hanging out in the spy world

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.100
 around that time.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.140
 And then thought, James Bond, great name,

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.300
 I better not say I was inspired by this spy

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.360
 'cause I don't want to spill the beans.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.660
 So I'll find another James Bond to claim it was based on

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.740
 instead, so that's the theory.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.700
 And the real James Bond ended up working

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.340
 as a lollipop man in Swansea.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.500
 So, that's the obvious trajectory.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.340
 - That must have been such an exciting crossing,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.660
 a pelican crossing for Crosshead.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.740
 Can you imagine?

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.060
 Gunfire, car chases.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.840
 - The lollipop was actually a bazooka

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.000
 that he would have created in his beading car.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.880
 - There's a guy called James Bond in Walsall,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.240
 council worker in Walsall.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.360
 He used to be called David Fern.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.840
 And much like that guy who changed his name

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.800
 to Isle of Spam the other week,

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.840
 I don't know if you remember him.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.080
 David Fern from Walsall has changed his name

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.400
 to James Bond, but as a middle name,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.800
 he's included all the Bond film titles.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.320
 This was in the newspapers in 2006.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.960
 So, if he's ever stopped and they say, "What's your name?"

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.100
 He would say, "The name's Bond."

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.540
 James Dr. No from "Russia with Love,"

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.700
 Goldfinger, Thunderball, you only have them twice

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.880
 on a Majesty's Secret Service, blah, blah, blah,

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.580
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.460
 Die Another Day, Casino Real, Bond.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.980
 - Does he have to change his name again by Deadpool

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.980
 every time a new film is released?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.180
 - I think that's why they haven't released the new one yet,

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.880
 'cause he hasn't gotten around to it.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.140
 (laughing)

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.300
 - Wow.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.600
 - You really choose a path of embracing it,

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.620
 or really hating it, don't you?

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.460
 There was actually a documentary.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.700
 Did you guys see, there's a documentary

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.780
 called "The Other Fellow," made by this bloke,

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.940
 called Matthew Bowyer, which is about other people

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.140
 with the name James Bond, and it went around the world,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.220
 interviewing them, and the vast majority

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.260
 basically find it incredibly annoying.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.460
 There was one guy who said,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.180
 "The most annoying thing is that at least four times a week,

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.700
 "people come up to him and sing the Bond theme tune,

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.420
 "but easily half the time they attempt to do that,

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.700
 "they sing the Mission Impossible theme tune instead."

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.960
 (laughing)

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.280
 - Really?

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.520
 - There was a Canadian lawyer who was quite nice,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.720
 he was called James Bond, and he always hated it

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.960
 'cause of all the jokes and stuff,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.620
 and then eventually he got married the year before

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.200
 they made the documentary, and the guy he married said,

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.320
 "Look, there's no way I'm not calling you James Bond,"

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.680
 so he always went by Jim, Jim Bond.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.920
 He said, "There's no way I'm not calling you James Bond,"

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.040
 and so now he embraces it, and he calls his husband,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.160
 Moneypenny, and always orders Volcomartini,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.720
 shaken, not stirred, and I think that's the way to go.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.780
 - So Sean Connery, obviously very sadly passed away recently,

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.620
 nice little James Bond connection from his earlier life

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.300
 is that Connery used to deliver milk, he was a milkman,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.580
 and he used to deliver milk to Fetty's school in the UK,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.460
 and that is where the fictional James Bond went to.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.660
 - Oh, no way! - That's insane.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.980
 - Yeah, he was a model for fictional James Bond.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.660
 - I guess he would have been doing it

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.380
 'cause when was Connery born, 1930,

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.000
 he might have been doing it at the time

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.640
 when Bond was at that school,

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.400
 as in he might have been delivering it

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.640
 to his fictional self without knowing it.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.140
 - He has a sort of a billion jobs, didn't he?

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.460
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.920
 - It kind of implied that he couldn't stick it

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.720
 at a thing in a way, but one of the jobs that I like

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.760
 is the fact that he worked as a life drawing model

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.080
 'cause it means that we have an almost entirely naked picture

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.360
 of Sean Connery in his very early days available,

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.280
 and bizarrely he worked as a life drawing model

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.180
 and the quite famous arts promoter and artist,

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.540
 Richard DeMarco drew him, so you can see Sean Connery,

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.220
 and he's wearing this sort of brown willysack,

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.460
 like a tiny, what do you call, like a--

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.660
 - Like a posing pouch. - A posing pouch.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.620
 - A posing pouch. - Yeah.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.500
 I would call it a willysack if you like.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.460
 - It's a willysack.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.060
 - Are you sure it's a willysack

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.340
 and not just he's got very, very weird genitals?

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.940
 - I couldn't say 100%, I didn't zoom in closely enough.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.360
 - It's worth taking a look.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.540
 - Yeah, that sounds like the artists in the class

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.920
 just got prudish when they got down there,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.200
 "Ugh, that will do."

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.040
 (all laughing)

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.260
 - Yeah, just a brown blur.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.200
 - He was supposed to be Gandalf, wasn't he?

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.160
 The Lord of the Rings. - Really?

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:48.160
 - But he was offered 15% of the box office receipts

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.680
 which would have given him $450 million.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.200
 And he turned it down 'cause he didn't understand the script.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.380
 And then they interviewed him later and he said,

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.220
 "I've read the book, I read the script,

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.880
 "I saw the movie, I still don't understand it."

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.020
 (all laughing)

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.140
 - 15%? - Yeah.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.380
 - Instead, he made the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.340
 as his last film.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.420
 What a different film to go out on.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.740
 - That was his last film, really.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.420
 - Yeah, he retired after that because it,

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.340
 I mean, it is a bit of a honker.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.360
 - He was a member of the SMP,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.140
 a sort of card carrying member

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.280
 and the membership number they gave him, 007.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.180
 - Amazing.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.760
 - As if that wasn't used already,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.540
 do they not even have seven members?

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.020
 (all laughing)

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.200
 - They had to kick an extremely long-serving

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.480
 loyal person out in order to give it to them.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.600
 - Margaret Thatcher was offered the passport 007,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.440
 wasn't she?

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.640
 We might have said that before,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.320
 but she said, "No, that's silly."

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.380
 And they gave it to someone incredibly boring

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.920
 and said it was someone like him.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.000
 - Just some random lollipop man in Wales.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.080
 (all laughing)

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.920
 - Was it Jeff?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.220
 - I mean, that would make your day.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.060
 Was it Jeff?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.900
 Who did you say?

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.560
 - It was someone, who's the MP who said?

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.400
 - Jeff.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.460
 - H, double O, N.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.420
 (all laughing)

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.260
 - That's right.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.300
 (all laughing)

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.820
 - He spent some time in his life sleeping in a coffin.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.660
 - Oh, wow.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.740
 Is that 'cause he worked,

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.860
 didn't he work as a funeral director

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.180
 or a grave digger or something?

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.820
 - Oh, no, not nearly that senior.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.220
 He worked as a coffin polisher.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.280
 You've given him seven promotions.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.420
 (all laughing)

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.260
 - I think he worked as a coffin polisher

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.840
 because he was friends with this guy

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.220
 that he did bodybuilding with Mr. Scotland, Archie Brennan.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.520
 And Archie Brennan suggested he get into coffin polishing

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.960
 to earn some extra money.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.520
 And there was an interview with someone

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.320
 who was his old workmate in the warehouse

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.640
 where they polished the coffins and made them.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.040
 And it's this guy called Tommy Walk,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.320
 who said he noticed that Sean, young Sean,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.240
 wasn't going home at night.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.840
 He was sleeping in the coffins.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.640
 So he was just having a bit of a rough time

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.640
 at that period of his life.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.060
 - I think I'd be a bit worried about Mr. Universe

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.840
 or Mr. Scotland polishing the coffins

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.160
 'cause he'd be so strong he'd go right the way through it.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.740
 (all laughing)

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.440
 - I love that you just corrected me

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.780
 about giving a promotion to Sean Connery in that company.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.720
 And then immediately gave Mr. Scotland

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.160
 the Mr. Universe title.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.760
 (all laughing)

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.680
 - Well, to Sean Connery,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.300
 Scotland was the universe, Dan.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.020
 So I think it's what he would have wanted me to say.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.600
 (upbeat music)

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.860
 (upbeat music)

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.240
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.620
 And that is my fact.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.140
 My fact this week is in 1970,

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.380
 burglars managed to successfully get past

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.860
 an unpickable door lock

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.020
 and steal American government documents

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.660
 by tacking a note to it a few hours beforehand

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.620
 that read, "Please don't lock this door tonight."

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.140
 (all laughing)

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.460
 So this came from a really, really cool book

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.280
 that was published called "The Burglary",

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.260
 the discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's secrets

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.160
 by Betty Medziger.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.240
 And the book talks about one of the great moments

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.800
 of being able to expose the FBI

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.400
 for some hidden secret operations

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.520
 that they were conducting in America

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.680
 by a group that were known as the Citizens Commission

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.360
 to investigate the FBI,

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.560
 random group of people who decided to make it their mission

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.080
 to infiltrate the FBI and steal these documents.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.040
 But there was a whole scene of these sort of anti-war

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.520
 and anti-government activists

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.480
 that had been operating in the States,

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.420
 going around and breaking into various buildings.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.580
 And they broke into the FBI offices,

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.740
 took a thousand classified documents,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.380
 and they sent it to all the newspapers.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.460
 And the Washington Post were the first

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.100
 to sort of publish them

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.980
 and show that there was secret spying

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.420
 that was going on under J. Edgar Hoover's government

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.300
 and really kind of tore him down a lot.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.460
 So yeah, this unpickable lock was just an earlier mission

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.380
 where they were trying to get some draft papers

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.780
 for the Vietnam War and steal them

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.280
 so people couldn't be drafted.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.080
 - And did the people in the offices explain

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.480
 why they had read the note and decided

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.640
 that that was a legit reason to leave the door open?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.680
 'Cause I can't think of a single ordinary circumstance

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680
 where you would request

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.400
 that people don't lock a door overnight.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.880
 - Yes, I would immediately obey the sign.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.120
 If there was a sign on the door saying,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.080
 "Please don't lock this door,"

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.160
 I think, "Oh, well, someone has a good reason."

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.120
 - That is so good to know.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.840
 And I intend to take advantage of that in the future.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.240
 - Was it that the cleaners maybe,

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.320
 the cleaners were coming around after the office was shut

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.520
 and they would normally lock up,

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.260
 but they thought that someone in the office

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.480
 had left that note.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.320
 That might be it.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.160
 - Yeah.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.000
 - I don't, yeah.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.080
 - Well, they couldn't believe it worked, by the way.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.880
 They got there and they're like, "Oh my God."

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.340
 And they almost toyed with the idea

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.200
 of leaving a thank you note on the door.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.640
 And then they thought, "No, that's going too far."

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.520
 They might recognize the handwriting.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.740
 - I like that idea of leaving notes,

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.260
 burglars leaving notes generally,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.220
 which they do sometimes do.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.920
 They sometimes leave apology notes.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.200
 It seems to be quite a common thing.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.140
 My friend's granny was actually robbed recently

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.560
 and they left an apology note saying,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.240
 "Sorry for stealing your stuff."

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.920
 And there was one,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.200
 there was a really nice story this year,

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.840
 in February in North Carolina,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.040
 where someone who worked in a salon

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.320
 came to the salon the next day.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.760
 And it was clear someone had broken in,

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.160
 but couldn't find that anything had been taken.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.360
 And then she found a note that said,

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.800
 "As I left your salon with all the stuff I'd stolen,

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.960
 and then with the list of all the stuff

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.920
 this person has stolen,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.760
 I had an epiphany of how hard you work for your business.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.560
 And I returned everything I've taken.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.640
 Here's everything I've returned.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.480
 Please forgive me.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.280
 I'm ashamed to discuss it myself."

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.600
 - And then brought it all back.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.320
 - See, that I think is better than leaving a note

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.960
 which says, "Sorry for stealing your stuff,

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.800
 which I have gone ahead and done anyway."

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.960
 That's baloney.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.400
 - It feels like the apology is a little bit empty

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.480
 in the first one, doesn't it?

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.320
 - Yeah, it does.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.400
 It absolutely does.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.160
 I would leave a note saying, "Sorry about the poo,"

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.600
 but they're not leaving the poo.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.960
 (laughing)

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.900
 For the rest of their time there.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.040
 - Yeah.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.200
 - Poos happen a lot, right?

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.040
 Apparently, someone did a,

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.000
 they did a scientific paper on not leaving it

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.840
 as a dirty protest,

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.680
 but needing to have a poo while robbing a house.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.040
 So there's a paper, which I haven't actually read.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.880
 I just saw it.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.120
 It was called, "The Scatological Rights of Bird Wars."

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.240
 And it showed that in a lot of cases

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.080
 where people were caught,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.160
 they admitted to having a poo while doing the burglary.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.560
 - Because you're quite stressed, it makes you want to go,

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.200
 but you can get caught by people

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.600
 finding the DNA of your inside your poo, don't they?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.440
 - Yes.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.960
 - So do flush it is what you're saying.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.640
 - We'll take it home to be safe.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.080
 - To be truly safe.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.120
 - I was reading about the hamburgler in the news this year

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.760
 and that was a man who stole some ham.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.800
 He was called Domingo Infante.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.960
 He was 34 years old in Spain.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.320
 And he went into a shop

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.080
 and there was massive legs of Iberico ham.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.580
 You know, those massive like cured ham legs.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.960
 And he stole, I think like four or five of them,

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.440
 but they're really heavy, those things.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.280
 I don't know if you've ever picked one up,

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.560
 but they're super heavy.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.600
 And so he had to drag them home to his house

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.560
 leaving the trail of fat all the way to his front door,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.600
 which they just followed.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.960
 And they knocked on the door

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.320
 and he was living with his parents

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.400
 and they said, "Have you got some hams here?"

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.760
 And eventually they had to admit that they did.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.800
 - Oh my God, that is such an example

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.520
 of letting the best be the enemy of the good.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.440
 Those hams last for ages, I bet,

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.520
 'cause they're quite densely packed, aren't they?

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.440
 If you had one of them, he probably would have been fine.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.400
 - They're expensive though.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.040
 I think he probably intended to sell them

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.160
 rather than eat them.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.240
 I think 'cause each of those is like 100 quid

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.080
 or something, I reckon.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.360
 So he was just getting seven of them

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.680
 and then he was going to sell them down the park.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.520
 - That's a really good point.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.360
 'Cause cheese, obviously,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.240
 that's why people steal cheese from the supermarket so much.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.280
 It's a relatively large amount of money

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.200
 in a relatively small box.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.040
 - Yeah.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:29.880
 - Yeah, if you're hungry,

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.200
 I don't think you'd steal a giant Iberico ham.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.920
 There are so many easier foodstuffs to feed

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.920
 from dragging a pig down the street.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.560
 - In our previous books of the year,

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.280
 we've often found that American police officers

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.800
 like to give their bandits nicknames.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.640
 - Oh yeah.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.960
 - Do you remember that?

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.000
 Every year, whenever there's something that happens,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.280
 some crime in America,

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.520
 the cops always name them the something bandit.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.400
 So I Googled a few of those.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.600
 In Chicago this year,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.400
 there was a guy called the mummy bandits.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.080
 Do you know why they might have called him that?

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.320
 - Did he wrap himself in toilet paper?

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.360
 - Pretty much, yeah.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.640
 He wrapped himself in gauze and scarves

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.400
 so that none of the CCTV cameras would know who he was.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.640
 The powder puff bandit.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.000
 Do you know what they might have done?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.440
 - Is that something to do with the cartoon?

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.480
 The powder puff girls?

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.720
 - Powder puff girls, no, it's nothing to do with that.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.280
 - I think they were the power puff girls.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.680
 They weren't just makeup artists,

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.040
 the adventures of makeup artists.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.200
 - Yeah, it's a play on words.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.720
 They're powerful, but they're also like powder puffs.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.320
 - What is a powder puff?

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.760
 - A powder puff is like, you know,

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.120
 if you're putting makeup on,

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.400
 but it's like you kind of puff onto your face.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.240
 - Got it.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.080
 - So it's like, they've got the powder in one half

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.160
 of that mirror in the other, right?

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.840
 Maybe you have a brush and use it.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.680
 Okay, all right.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.600
 Did they blow the very fine makeup powder

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.840
 towards the CCTV cameras to hide their entry?

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.880
 - Great idea, no.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.800
 - Oh, did they, did they using makeup?

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.040
 Did they paint someone else's face on their face?

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.080
 - Great.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.360
 - It's actually the exact opposite of that.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.600
 - They painted their own face on someone else's face.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.520
 - It's not the exact opposite of that,

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.880
 but it's something that's different.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:17.520
 - What they did was, this was in Denver,

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.160
 there's a guy called Hernandez,

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.680
 and he had extremely obvious facial tattoos.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.800
 And so he would use the foundation to cover those up

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.840
 so that they wouldn't recognize him.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.720
 - Brilliant, very clever.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.800
 - There was a guy called,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.880
 this is quite easy to guess actually,

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.320
 but there was a guy in Albuquerque

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.880
 called the birthday suit sign bandit.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.720
 - If you know, did you hear about him?

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.200
 - Birthday suit sign bandit.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.600
 - So something to do with nudity, right?

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.680
 His birthday.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.880
 - But then is he wearing a little sign over his penis

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.000
 saying get action here or something like that?

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.520
 - He's wearing Sean Connery's leathery glove.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.280
 - Now this was very simply a man caught naked on camera

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.280
 stealing a Biden-Harris campaign sign

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.040
 from a garden in Albuquerque.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.520
 - Oh.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.600
 - Flabber.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.840
 - Anyway, that's some of those.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.640
 - Do you know how you'd burgle a house using a tortoise?

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.480
 - Wow, okay, so very slow getaway.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.320
 - Yes.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.400
 - Could you squeeze yourself under the shell

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.080
 sort of between tortoise and shell?

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.400
 - No, that's not, that's a good method.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.680
 This is a gang of thieves in medieval Arabia

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.600
 called the Banu Sasang.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.000
 And in fact, they lasted hundreds of years.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.480
 It's kind of a very loose affiliation

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.760
 rather than a proper gang, like they want one entity.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.200
 But supposedly they would bring a crowbar, a candle,

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.160
 some stale bread, some beans, an iron spike, a drill,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.240
 a bag of sand and a tortoise to your gang.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.800
 - I think that the drill and the iron stake and stuff

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.960
 are a lot more important than the tortoise in this play.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.840
 - No, no, no way.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.400
 Okay, they do use the spike or the crowbar

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.000
 to get in to access to the property, fine.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.680
 But then they light the candle, which they've also brought,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.120
 they stick it onto the tortoise

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.120
 and they send the tortoise through the hole.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.120
 That way you can see what's in there.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.880
 You can see if there's any stuff worth stealing, right?

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.080
 Then you use the bag of sand,

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.760
 you throw that at the windows and see if anyone gets up.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.600
 And if there's no one up, then you go in, right?

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.400
 - Well, so if you're in the house and you wake up

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.120
 and you just hear a bit of banging outside

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.120
 and you kind of go into your front room

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.520
 and there's a tortoise with a candle on its back,

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.360
 I still think you're going to be a bit suspicious.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.760
 - Straight back to bed for me.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.120
 It's not a burglar, it's just the candle tortoise again.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.400
 Also, with a note on his back saying,

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.360
 "Please ignore me, I'm just a tortoise with a candle on my back."

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.200
 - Nothing to see here.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.480
 - Well, I know what you're thinking.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.480
 What about the stale bread and the dried beans?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.800
 - Sorry, that's what I was thinking, yeah.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.960
 So that's if you get in.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.760
 So the operation tortoise has worked,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.520
 you've seen valuables, you're in the house,

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.240
 but then you can hear someone moving around in a nearby room.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.000
 At that point, you noisily chew on the stale bread

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.920
 and the dried beans so that people think

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.760
 it's just a cat eating a mouse.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.000
 - Oh, right.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.280
 - Is that a Foley sound effect trick?

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.160
 Is that how you simulate cat eating a mouse?

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.320
 - It is, absolutely, yeah.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.480
 - Stale bread and dried beans.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.240
 - But we have got a cat, you might say.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.280
 And then you're in trouble, I guess.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.400
 - Have you guys heard of George Leslie from America?

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.320
 Okay, so this is around the late 1800s.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:26.320
 And this is a guy who moved to New York City in 1869

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.920
 and he was a trained architect,

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.560
 but he decided to go into a life of crime.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.920
 And it is said that the gang that he created off the back of it

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.160
 and the syndicate that he created off the back of it

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.560
 were responsible for nearly 80% of all bank robberies

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.160
 in the US at that time, this one guy.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.040
 So what he used to do, which was really interesting,

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.720
 is he used to break into banks, not to rob them,

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.400
 but to walk around at night on his own and map them out.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.080
 Then he would take his designs, 'cause he's an architect,

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.360
 he would go back to a warehouse that he owned

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.120
 and build the bank in there

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.880
 so that he and his fellow robbers could work out

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.720
 the best way of getting through certain things

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.360
 and certain doors and certain escape routes.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.920
 So he would recreate the entire interior of the bank.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.320
 - Are you saying that he wrote "Ocean's Eleven"

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.080
 about 100 years before "Ocean's Eleven"?

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.640
 - Oh, I never saw that movie, but yeah.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.480
 - I think that's what they do.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.520
 - That's incredible.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.800
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.640
 - Well, it is incredible.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.440
 Apart from the people who wrote "Ocean's Eleven"

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.920
 who probably just heard about this guy

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.760
 and then stole it for their plot though.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.040
 - Yes, I was saying the original guy is more impressive.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.760
 - Yeah, I actually wasn't saying "Ocean's Eleven"

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.800
 is an incredible film.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.760
 I think it's decent.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.080
 It's certainly better than "Ocean's Twelve".

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.360
 (laughing)

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.600
 - What was he called?

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.840
 - He was called George Leslie.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.440
 And these were life-size, it's not like he did little models.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.920
 - Well, of course you wouldn't use a tiny model.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.400
 Imagine how freaked out your gang is gonna be

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.240
 if they get into the vault and it's huge.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.680
 They haven't trained for this.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.160
 (laughing)

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.760
 - There was a burglar in 2014

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.840
 who managed to delay 783 trains

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.120
 as a result of his burglary.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.440
 Unbelievable.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.040
 So he'd cut open a curry stall near Charlton

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.240
 and the police turned up and he panicked and fled.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.360
 And then he got onto his motorbike,

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.840
 also stolen by the way.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.160
 So not even an unscrupulously acquired motorbike.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.160
 That didn't start.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.360
 He ran off and then he climbed up a tree.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.120
 But unfortunately the tree was kind of overhanging

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.200
 the railway tracks at Charlton station.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.680
 And he decided to stay up there for 17 hours,

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.000
 despite the police being there.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.320
 At that point the game is over

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.640
 and I think you have to come down from the tree.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.480
 - So, did the police,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.680
 were the police stood under the tree at this time

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.520
 saying you're gonna have to come down eventually?

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.040
 - Pretty much, yeah.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.800
 - Don't you call the fire engine at that point?

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.640
 - Yeah, say we've got a cat burglar stuck up in the tree.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.480
 (laughing)

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.720
