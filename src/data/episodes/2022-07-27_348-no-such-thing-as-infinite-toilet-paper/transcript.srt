00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,820
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,580
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,500
 coming from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,620
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,260
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,160
 and James Harkin, and once again,

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,680
 we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,520
 Starting with you, Andy.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,160
 My fact is that Sir Roger Penrose,

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,780
 the mathematician who's just won the Nobel Prize,

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,820
 once designed a theoretically infinite

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,440
 geometrical pattern called the Penrose Tiles.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,600
 He then sued a toilet paper company for stealing it

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,680
 and creating a theoretically infinite toilet paper roll.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
 (laughing)

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,800
 Why would you need an infinite,

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,080
 well, I suppose everyone's hoarding toilet paper

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
 at the moment, aren't they?

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
 - Exactly. - An infinite one

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,120
 would be really useful.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,760
 - Okay, so basically, Roger Penrose,

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,440
 he's a brilliant, brilliant mathematician.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,680
 In the 1970s, he invented this thing called Penrose Tiling,

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,400
 which basically combines two different rhomboids

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,040
 that can be repeated ad infinitum.

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
 Never, this pattern never repeats itself.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,840
 It's really amazing.

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,240
 He had just invented them for fun as well.

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,960
 He does lots of stuff like this for fun.

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,280
 He's fun as well as being a mathematician.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,160
 But a few years later, in fact,

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
 more than 20 years later actually,

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,080
 after he invented it, his wife was in the supermarket

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,960
 and she saw some Kleenex loo paper

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,200
 and it looked just like his,

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
 she thought, "I know that pattern."

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,960
 And she bought some and she took it home.

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,560
 And the firm, the firm which owned Kleenex, Kimberly Clark,

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,360
 they had come up with toilet paper, which copied it.

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
 And he sued.

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,220
 - Wow. - He sued.

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,060
 - Successfully?

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,720
 - Well, he won't talk about what happened in court.

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,440
 It was amicably settled outside of court.

48
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,800
 - Yeah, but I think the condition was,

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,160
 you can't say Roger Pemrose that they gave you

50
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,680
 20 billion quid or whatever,

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
 whatever the time the sum was.

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,360
 - If he asked for like one pence

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,200
 every time they used his pattern,

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,600
 and this is a pattern that never, ever repeats infinitely,

55
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,400
 then he could just get all the money in the world.

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 The reason it's useful for a toilet paper

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,240
 to have this pattern is you want your toilet paper

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,920
 to be quilted, right?

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
 And so it's gonna have a pattern going throughout it

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,520
 where you have some bits that have got indentation

61
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
 in some places that don't.

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,880
 So let's imagine you have just a diamond

63
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,040
 that goes throughout the entire roll.

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,640
 So your diamond keeps coming up every now and then

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,240
 and you have it on the whole roll.

66
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,240
 Once you wrap it around a toilet paper holder,

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,120
 then the diamonds in some places

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800
 are gonna be on top of each other.

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,840
 And so it's gonna get thicker in those places

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,480
 and it's gonna be thinner in other places,

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
 which makes it less efficient to package.

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
 Now, if you have a pattern which never repeats,

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
 then it means that you're never gonna have

74
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,320
 those kind of indentations that kind of go over each other.

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,760
 So it makes it better for a type of toilet paper

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,640
 if you want quilted toilet paper.

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,480
 - Oh, wow.

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,680
 - It's basically the perfect toilet paper he invented,

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
 but he didn't see it that way.

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
 - Well, that's the thing with mathematics, isn't it?

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,920
 Like you just study maths for the sake of it

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
 'cause it's beautiful

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
 and 'cause the numbers do amazing things.

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,200
 And you never know what the applications are gonna be.

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,840
 You never know what it's gonna be.

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,360
 Maybe, you know, infinite amounts of energy

87
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
 for the entire world are just a quite a nice bit

88
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,840
 of toilet paper.

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,960
 - 'Cause he's denying the world the best version

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,680
 of toilet paper that we could possibly have.

91
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
 - He pretty much is.

92
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,520
 This was quite a big case at the time.

93
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,800
 I mean, big, big for 1997, but like marketing week.

94
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,920
 - Wait, wasn't it for 1997?

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,760
 - Yeah.

96
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
 - No, sorry.

97
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,080
 - We're called cases famously usually very small in 1997.

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,040
 - I just couldn't think of much else that happened in 1997.

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,760
 - Tony Blair came in in 1997.

100
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,600
 - That's true.

101
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,440
 - That's true.

102
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
 - But I remember not really being on the front page

103
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,720
 of the newspapers

104
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,520
 'cause it was all about this toilet paper case.

105
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,360
 - The Hong Kong handover barely got a mention, didn't it?

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
 - Okay, all right.

107
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,320
 Look, we can all name something that happened in 1997.

108
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 Well done, everybody.

109
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,640
 But when it happened,

110
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,480
 there's a publication called "Marketing Week"

111
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,640
 which writes all about this.

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,600
 And they wrote this excoriating editorial.

113
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,960
 They said, and it was about quilted toilet paper.

114
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,600
 They said, "The decline of our island kingdom

115
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,240
 dates almost precisely from our ceasing to use

116
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,640
 robust lavatory paper, shiny on one side and dull on the other

117
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,320
 and favoring scented absorbent toilet tissue.

118
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,880
 A nation that dabs rather than stoically abrades its bottom

119
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,200
 has become a feat and can never be at peace with itself."

120
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,720
 - Wow, do you think the bottoms are now a bit bigger

121
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
 than they used to be

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
 because they're not slowly enroded away by toilet paper?

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
 - 100%, I do think that, yeah.

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
 - But did it say toilet paper had turned fragrant?

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
 'Cause we don't do that anymore.

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,000
 - It did say scented absorbent toilet tissue.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,480
 - Yeah, you see, when was that written?

128
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
 - '97.

129
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
 - '97. - There you go.

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
 So those days are gone.

131
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,240
 I think the author of that would be proud

132
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,960
 of where we've got to because it was a thing

133
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,080
 in the sort of '70s, '80s, '90s,

134
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,560
 slightly fragrant toilet paper,

135
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,680
 often a really disgusting pastel color.

136
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,120
 And we have reverted a bit to non-smelling loo roll

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,480
 in pure white.

138
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,040
 So I think we're working our way back

139
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,320
 to the splintery twigs of the park in our defense.

140
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,680
 - These tiles that Penrose discovered,

141
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,040
 according to our, all of our good friend, Will Bowen.

142
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
 So Will Bowen, who's one of the QILs,

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,880
 he studied mathematics at Oxford

144
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,320
 and his teacher was Penrose.

145
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,440
 As in Penrose, he was the head of maths

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
 when Will was at university.

147
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
 - Oh my goodness.

148
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,360
 - And he says that Penrose broke his arm

149
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,680
 and that he was in hospital 'cause it's quite a bad break.

150
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
 And it was while he was kind of lay in hospital

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,760
 convalescing that he realized

152
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,960
 that these kind of tiles might exist.

153
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
 And he came up with--

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,040
 - Oh, I thought, "Sorry, Penrose broke his own arm."

155
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
 Not Will.

156
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,280
 I thought that was a, they had a big varbaral--

157
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,200
 - He was a tough, he was a tough professor, but he was,

158
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,440
 he broke it in an infinite number of places.

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,800
 - Sorry, go on, Penrose is lying in hospital.

160
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
 - Yeah, he's lying in hospital

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,040
 and he just has this kind of idea

162
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,880
 that well, what if you can have testilating patterns

163
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,720
 so you can put squares all after each other

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
 and they'll go together and there'll be no gaps in between.

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
 You can do the same with triangles,

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,920
 you can do the same with lots of different shapes.

167
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,400
 But what he thought was what if you could make things

168
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
 testilate but they never repeated

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
 and he came up with this idea

170
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,040
 of using these kind of pentagon things.

171
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,160
 But while he was in hospital, so it's kind of--

172
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,640
 - And it's that the pattern is that it testilates perfectly

173
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,240
 with these two different shapes, but it never,

174
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
 so there are no gaps and also you only use two shapes

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,560
 and they all, they repeat forever.

176
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,000
 - Yeah, usually the shapes known as kites and darts

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,040
 because that's kind of what they look like

178
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,000
 and you'll just keep putting one next to the other,

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 next to the other, next to the other with no gaps

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,680
 but no matter how many millions and millions of miles you go

181
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,560
 you'll never have repeating pattern.

182
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,440
 - And that was a revolution in actual floor tiling.

183
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,560
 He's basically an interior designer.

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
 Glorified interior designer.

185
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,040
 - Actually at the Mathematical Institutes of Oxford,

186
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,200
 one of the bits of paving is made of Penrose tiles.

187
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
 - That's so nice. - Really?

188
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,560
 - Yeah, that makes sense. - That was really good.

189
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
 - He did, so he wasn't the first person,

190
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,680
 I don't think, to come up with the idea

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,800
 of trying to have a never-repeasing pattern of tiling

192
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,840
 but people were doing this in the 1960s

193
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,520
 and so people thought that in the end,

194
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,000
 a pattern of shapes that you're trying to fit together

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 without any gaps as in tiled together,

196
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,800
 the shapes will always end up eventually repeating themselves

197
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,280
 and then a bunch of mathematicians discovered

198
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,400
 that there's a specific set of 20,426 different shapes

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,280
 that if you combine all of them, eventually they won't repeat.

200
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,160
 So they were like, "Okay, as long as you've just got

201
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,840
 over 20,000 different shapes, stick them all together,

202
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,320
 you'll never have the pattern repeating."

203
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,880
 And all Penrose did was, took that figure down to two.

204
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,920
 And I don't know if he went down one by one,

205
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,400
 eradicating one shape after the other,

206
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,840
 but yeah, try this kites and darts thing.

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,720
 - It's amazing that the mathematicians

208
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
 were doing this kind of thing, right?

209
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,760
 It's really easy to understand concepts,

210
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,240
 just finding new shapes that fit next to each other.

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,520
 Obviously quite complicated mathematics,

212
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,400
 but you always think that mathematicians are just working

213
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
 with all sorts of numbers and symbols and stuff,

214
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,120
 not shapes like that.

215
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
 That's why it's-- - Yeah.

216
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,800
 - Have you guys ever heard of Marjorie Rice?

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 - No, Marjorie Rice.

218
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,840
 So there's a guy called Martin Gardner

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,800
 who you might have heard of

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,360
 and he did like a lot of columns.

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,480
 He was like a popular mathematician

222
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,560
 and he wrote once in one of his columns

223
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,480
 that only certain types of pentagons

224
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,840
 can perfectly tile on a flat surface.

225
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,520
 And they were all known.

226
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,920
 So there's only a few different types of pentagons

227
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,640
 that can tessellate and we know what they all are.

228
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,480
 And this lady called Marjorie Rice,

229
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,840
 she only had a high school education,

230
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
 she was in America,

231
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,560
 and she thought, "I bet there's some more."

232
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,680
 And so she started cutting things out,

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,960
 like cutting out these pentagons

234
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,840
 and trying to find different pentagons

235
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,440
 that would fit in this way.

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,000
 And she worked on it all the way through a free time.

237
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
 This was during the 1970s.

238
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,240
 All the time she had free,

239
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,640
 she would just try and come up with new ways

240
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,920
 of working out pentagons that would be able to tessellate.

241
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,440
 And when her husband and her children came home,

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,160
 she would hide them 'cause she was so embarrassed

243
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,640
 that this is what she was doing.

244
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
 And she came up with her own notation,

245
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,000
 her own mathematics that would describe these things.

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,480
 And eventually she sent the results to Gardner

247
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,800
 and said, "Look, I found all these new pentagons

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,200
 "which will tessellate."

249
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,480
 And he's like, "Holy shit, this is like new maths."

250
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
 And you've only got high school education

251
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,400
 and he sent it onto some experts.

252
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
 And they saw her notation and they were like,

253
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
 "Oh, this just looks like gibberish."

254
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
 But the more they looked at it,

255
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,960
 the more they realized that this was a new type of mathematics

256
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,280
 that would tell you these new kind of pentagons

257
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,400
 that will tessellate.

258
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,360
 And she's discovered more than 50 pentagons that tessellate.

259
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
 - Jesus.

260
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,560
 - What do we do with that kind of information?

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,400
 - Tiling.

262
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,240
 - Outside.

263
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
 - But it's literally just for tiling.

264
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's, yeah, cool.

265
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,840
 - No, it's really not.

266
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,040
 - There's other stuff.

267
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,280
 - There's really loads of things like,

268
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
 for instance, the Penrose ones,

269
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,320
 they later discovered that you can now have crystals

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
 which have this same non-repeating pattern.

271
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,680
 And those crystals have amazing properties,

272
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
 like they're amazing superconductors.

273
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
 You can use them to put on like non-stick pans

274
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
 and stuff like that.

275
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,760
 So there's always loads of amazing things

276
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
 that come out of these things

277
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,680
 which you never think they're gonna come

278
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
 because it's a new beautiful kind of maths.

279
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,400
 It's, there's always something useful.

280
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
 - Those crystals, they are so cool.

281
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,040
 So I think, okay, I'm probably gonna get this wrong

282
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,200
 because it's quite complicated,

283
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,400
 but there was a crystallographer called Alan Mackay

284
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,420
 who said that if you put atoms at the corners

285
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,680
 of the Penrose tiles

286
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,320
 and then you bounce x-rays off those, right,

287
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,760
 the resulting reflections form the shape

288
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,960
 of a perfect crystal.

289
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
 - Right.

290
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,380
 - Okay, I think I understand that just about.

291
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,920
 But that material was discovered

292
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
 and called a quasi-crystal.

293
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,280
 So Penrose had basically invented a new,

294
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,200
 like inventing a new species of animal or plant.

295
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
 And then that's discovered in the real world.

296
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,960
 - Exactly, it's like you're an author

297
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,200
 and you just make up a new animal

298
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,480
 and then they go around the corner and it's just there.

299
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,300
 It's so weird, completely mad.

300
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,280
 - But I think this whole fitting shapes together thing

301
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,600
 might be the back door into maths.

302
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,160
 If anyone's looking for an easy way

303
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
 to a Nobel Prize in maths.

304
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,120
 Because there's this woman who doesn't even have an education.

305
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,480
 Even we understand fitting shapes together.

306
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,960
 Penrose came up with the basis of his idea

307
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,140
 when he was nine, he says.

308
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,000
 And you go, what can you do when you're nine?

309
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,040
 He said that he was having a chat with his dad

310
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,960
 and he asked, can you fit regular hexagons together

311
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
 to make a sphere?

312
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,680
 As you do, the standard kind of question you ask

313
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,000
 when you're nine years old.

314
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,440
 And his dad said,

315
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,080
 his dad said, no, you can't fit regular hexagons

316
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
 together until they make a sphere.

317
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,360
 You have to include some pentagons.

318
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
 And he said, that was the moment.

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
 He thought, that was a huge surprise to me.

320
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
 And that's the moment I realized I had to go

321
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 into the business of fitting shapes together.

322
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
 And this is another one of those weird, true things.

323
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
 And that's the easiest way to picture this

324
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,880
 is thinking of a football, right?

325
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,240
 You know, football's are designed

326
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,960
 with little hexagonal shapes all over them.

327
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,400
 But the only way you can make a footballer's sphere

328
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,920
 is by having at least 12 pentagons hidden in there somewhere.

329
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,240
 So if you look at a football,

330
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,040
 each pentagon has hexagons, five hexagons around it, isn't it?

331
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
 - Yeah, that's a special kind of hatred

332
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,280
 of Matt Parker, isn't it?

333
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,540
 The mathematician. - Yes.

334
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,560
 - Our friend Matt Parker.

335
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,160
 Yeah, whenever he sees a picture of a football

336
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,540
 on like a signpost or something,

337
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,660
 if there's no pentagons on there, he gets furious.

338
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,420
 - Yeah. - Really?

339
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,260
 - Yeah.

340
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,040
 - Just on that, we should say that it may not be

341
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,740
 a complete backdoor to a Nobel Prize

342
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,680
 because Penrose's Nobel Prize is for his work on black holes

343
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,940
 where he used maths to prove that the formation

344
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,700
 of black holes is an inevitable consequence

345
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,720
 of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

346
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,200
 So you can't just cut out some shapes

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
 and then expect to win the Nobel Prize.

348
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,940
 You have to prove black holes can exist.

349
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,740
 - You can't just design a loo roll and hope for the best.

350
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,420
 - So Roger Penrose is 89 years old

351
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,740
 and he has just won this Nobel Prize.

352
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,460
 And for someone who's so incredibly clever,

353
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,580
 he was a bit thick about understanding

354
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,480
 that there was an award on the way.

355
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,100
 He got a message from his PA saying that someone,

356
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,020
 a strange person had called up and asked for his number.

357
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,380
 And he says later on, that's when he should have,

358
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,100
 you know, smelt a fish is his words.

359
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,600
 He should have seen someone who's coming.

360
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,080
 Then someone called him up from Sweden

361
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,480
 and asked him to go on hold on the phone.

362
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,680
 So he waited and waited, but then he got bored.

363
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
 So he hung up.

364
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,680
 So the Nobel committee had to recall him

365
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,720
 in order to give him his award.

366
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,320
 But yeah, just didn't spot it coming.

367
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,160
 - That's so funny.

368
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
 - Wow.

369
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,600
 - Well, did you guys see the video of the people

370
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,720
 who won the Nobel Prize for Economics this year?

371
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
 - No.

372
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,480
 - No, it's the greatest thing to come out of 2020,

373
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,240
 which I know is not a difficult competition.

374
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,080
 - It's the Nobel Prize.

375
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,320
 - It's not like 1997, whoa, what a year.

376
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,040
 (laughing)

377
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,340
 - The Nobel Prize for Economics went to these two people,

378
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,420
 Robert Wilson and Paul Milgram,

379
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,300
 who sort of redesigned auctions,

380
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,660
 which is apparently this revolutionary thing.

381
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,940
 And anyway, usually what happens with the Nobel's

382
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,060
 is they're decided in Sweden

383
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
 and a lot of the winners are in America.

384
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,500
 And so they call up Americans in the middle of the night.

385
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,300
 And there's often stories of them being woken up

386
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
 in the middle of the night.

387
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,860
 So they called up these guys

388
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,700
 and they called Wilson, got through to him.

389
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,940
 Well, at first they couldn't get through

390
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,440
 'cause he switched his phone off thinking it was a nobody.

391
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
 And so they called his wife

392
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,560
 and his wife woke up, Wilson, said,

393
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,180
 "Hey, it's the Nobel Committee.

394
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,840
 "I reckon I know what it's about."

395
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,800
 So Wilson answered and was like, "Thanks very much."

396
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,360
 And then the Nobel Committee said,

397
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,520
 "Hey, I don't suppose you know your partner

398
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,400
 "from 30 years ago when you came up this idea,

399
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,880
 "Paul Milgram, we can't get through to him.

400
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,520
 "Do you have any idea how we could?"

401
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,820
 And Wilson said, "Well, actually, we live opposite each other.

402
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,660
 (laughing)

403
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,260
 "So you want me to go knock on his door?"

404
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,100
 And so there's CCTV footage from the door cam

405
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,420
 of Paul Milgram's camera of this guy.

406
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,180
 And he's in his 80s, Wilson.

407
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,840
 This guy banging on his door,

408
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,980
 like ringing on the doorbell.

409
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,540
 And he's like, "Paul, Paul!"

410
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,900
 Yeah, that's sort of like really bad connection.

411
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,540
 And he's just woken up in the middle of the night.

412
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,380
 He's like, "What?

413
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,380
 "Yeah, you've won the Nobel Prize.

414
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,220
 "Yeah, can you answer your phone?"

415
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,500
 And it's just the most bizarre footage.

416
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,700
 I'm so annoyed, by the way, you told that story.

417
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,420
 'Cause when you said he was banging on the door,

418
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,180
 I was just about to jump in with,

419
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,780
 "Did he have no bell?"

420
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,040
 But then you went, or ringing the doorbell,

421
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
 "Oh, no!"

422
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,300
 Damn it, I completely screwed you over.

423
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,880
 (upbeat music)

424
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,580
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

425
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,060
 - My fact this week is that a Washington State's

426
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,700
 Department of Agriculture recently lost track

427
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,300
 of a single hornet they were trying to follow.

428
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
 (laughing)

429
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,260
 Specifically, the Asian giant hornet,

430
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,860
 also known as the murder hornet,

431
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,980
 which has been hanging out in Japan and China

432
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,220
 for a very long time, but arrived in America

433
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,300
 in October this year and caused absolute panic

434
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,180
 because it's an invasive species,

435
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,600
 and also really hurts if you get stung by it,

436
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,820
 and it destroys bee species.

437
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,460
 So the State Department said we've got a catch one,

438
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,700
 and we've got a catch one that's gonna lead us back

439
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,860
 to the hive, to the nest.

440
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,020
 And so they came up with all these ideas of getting it,

441
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,700
 so they caught one hornet, I think,

442
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,540
 and attempted to super glue or double-sided sticky tape,

443
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,740
 or tracking device to it, but that didn't work.

444
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,260
 And eventually they trapped one by strapping a bit

445
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,580
 of dental floss around its stomach,

446
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,460
 and attaching a tracking device to that, like a belt,

447
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,900
 and then chasing it, trying to chase it down.

448
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,220
 But they lost it, disappeared, 'cause they fly,

449
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,060
 and they're fast, and they're hard to chase.

450
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,900
 - Wow.

451
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,060
 - Well, they used Bluetooth.

452
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,620
 That was one way they lost it.

453
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,980
 Yeah, in an early experiment,

454
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,140
 the transmitter they had attached to it

455
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,380
 was a Bluetooth one, and it only works over a few hundred feet.

456
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,500
 So if it gets out of your range, then you're stuffed.

457
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,340
 - Yeah.

458
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,620
 - The chief entomologist did also say

459
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,620
 it actually does fly a lot faster

460
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,180
 than we realized we could run.

461
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,020
 So yeah, it was based on having to keep up

462
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,500
 with this bit of signal.

463
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,620
 - You need a Judas insect, they call it,

464
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,940
 to lead you back to the hive.

465
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,620
 This is what they say it is.

466
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,340
 So to get your hornet in the first place,

467
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,100
 you leave out some orange juice and some rice wine,

468
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,140
 which they love, 'cause it's so sugary.

469
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,540
 And then you can trap it,

470
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,860
 and that's what it's called, the Judas insect.

471
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,220
 - It's interesting, 'cause they come over from,

472
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,740
 is it Japan or China or somewhere?

473
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,580
 From Japan, isn't it?

474
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,420
 - Both.

475
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,220
 - Is that why they like rice wine?

476
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,460
 Like, 'cause they used to it in Japan.

477
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,180
 - I do not know whether it's Japan-specific food.

478
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,580
 I don't know whether the tastes of the insects are the same.

479
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,620
 - You don't know?

480
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,020
 - It's good, I like it, I like the theory.

481
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,620
 So the big problem with these hornets, right,

482
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,740
 is that the bees and so on in America

483
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,260
 don't know how to deal with them at all,

484
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,140
 because they've not had them as part of their life.

485
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,700
 And the name, murder hornet,

486
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,340
 is applied not because they're dangerous to humans,

487
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,300
 they are dangerous to humans,

488
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,380
 but really it's applied properly

489
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
 because of how dangerous they are to the bees.

490
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,380
 They can go into their nests

491
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,740
 and basically just decimate within minutes.

492
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,780
 They just rip heads off, arms off, everything off,

493
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,940
 and it's a blood bath in there.

494
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,780
 They can kill 40 European bees in a minute.

495
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,620
 Like, these are absolutely the fastest.

496
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,180
 - So people do call them murder hornets,

497
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,580
 but entomologists are furious about that.

498
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,900
 They do not like to call in these murder hornets

499
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,940
 because it's just, it's bad PR.

500
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,620
 They're just hornets, they're just animals.

501
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,820
 They're doing, you know, they're doing what hornets do.

502
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,260
 And like, okay, in America,

503
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,980
 they are an invasive species and in Canada,

504
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,660
 but in Japan, they use them to work against pests.

505
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,060
 As in if bees, if pests come into their fields,

506
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,060
 they can use these hornets to get rid of them.

507
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,820
 - What kind of pests are you getting rid of though?

508
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,700
 - Well, I can only imagine it's lots of bees

509
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,860
 'cause that seems to be what they do,

510
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,420
 but no, it isn't.

511
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,380
 I think hornets, these hornets, they eat all insects.

512
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,340
 So they do like the tasty North American bees quite a lot,

513
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,580
 but if there are any other insects there,

514
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,060
 then they'll eat those as well.

515
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,500
 So the other name you can call them,

516
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,140
 I think in America, they're quite often called

517
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,900
 giant Asian hornets,

518
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,980
 but there is an entomologist called Akito Kawahara

519
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,580
 who says that really you shouldn't call them that,

520
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,180
 either because Asian can have meanings

521
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,860
 like Asian flu and stuff like that.

522
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,420
 So you're kind of taking a bad thing

523
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,100
 and you're giving it that epithet.

524
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,580
 So you shouldn't really do that.

525
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,860
 So really just giant hornets or large hornets,

526
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,100
 that's what he says, just call them big, big old hornets.

527
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,140
 - In Japan, they get called giant sparrow hornets,

528
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,540
 which is pretty terrifying.

529
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,820
 But I think there's a weird thing

530
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,740
 because the murder hornet thing is,

531
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,460
 in Japan, they're not called murder hornets

532
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,660
 or rather the word that gets applied to them

533
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,500
 just kind of means killer hornets.

534
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,180
 And that's because in the Japanese language,

535
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,180
 the word for kill and murder are the same, I think.

536
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,020
 So they don't, so the much more pejorative version

537
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,900
 is the one that's made its way into English,

538
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,380
 the much more evocative name.

539
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,500
 Killer hornets, obviously also not a great name to have.

540
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,700
 - Well, they kill up to 50 people every year,

541
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,340
 like humans in Japan, especially.

542
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,860
 And they have this sting,

543
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,460
 which if you're wearing a normal beekeeping suit,

544
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,700
 it's still strong enough to go through this beekeeping suit

545
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,940
 and it can kill you.

546
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,260
 So one of the world experts always wears a hazmat suit instead.

547
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,780
 - Well, I got, I was really excited to realize that we,

548
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,060
 after I found this fact,

549
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,540
 I was just looking through podcast emails

550
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,740
 to see if anyone's ever mentioned hornets.

551
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,340
 And we very recently got contacted

552
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,500
 by this guy called Konrad Berube,

553
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,620
 who is the guy who took out the first hornet nest

554
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,340
 in North America when it arrived last year.

555
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,780
 So it came to Canada, it was in British Columbia.

556
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,260
 And so he's this expert and he published this paper on it.

557
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,380
 And one of the things he said is

558
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,660
 that when he's chasing them around,

559
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,580
 he wears a Kevlar vest and he wore two pairs of trousers.

560
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,820
 He wears braces that are built

561
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,260
 to ward against chainsaw injury.

562
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,220
 And then he wears beekeeping gear.

563
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,120
 He's still got stung quite a bit.

564
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,660
 And he said that it was extremely painful,

565
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,700
 but he's a beekeeper.

566
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,460
 So he suspects that for normal people

567
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,980
 who aren't used to being stung,

568
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,020
 be real agony.

569
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,860
 But isn't that cool?

570
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,820
 We've, a podcast fan is the guy

571
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,140
 who took out the first nest in North America.

572
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,020
 He also said, incidentally,

573
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,020
 that he would never use the M phrase.

574
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,740
 We doesn't like to use the M phrase,

575
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,260
 the murder hornet phrase.

576
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,780
 You've got to be very politically correct

577
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,500
 with these hornets attack.

578
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,180
 - That guy, did he hoover them up?

579
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,220
 'Cause they have vacuum cleaners

580
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,380
 that they use for insect special ones.

581
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,440
 - Yes, I think it's might've been him.

582
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,000
 'Cause was this August, 2019,

583
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,400
 that they arrived in North America?

584
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,800
 He said that the hornets were so big

585
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,720
 that they wouldn't fit in the nozzle of his vacuum cleaner.

586
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,760
 That is terrifying.

587
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,880
 - That was in the Vancouver area, I think,

588
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,040
 that first one last year.

589
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,640
 And they found the first one in the United States this year,

590
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
 which was in Washington.

591
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,800
 And again, they use the vacuum cleaner

592
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,360
 to suck that one away.

593
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,680
 And it was done by an entomologist called Chris Looney.

594
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,960
 - Nice.

595
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,220
 - I hope he lived up to his name

596
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,180
 and just went in wearing boxer shorts, bare chest boots.

597
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,740
 - So Looney said, because we've been talking about

598
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,860
 how people are very scared of getting the sting

599
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,620
 and how it can penetrate.

600
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,580
 He's not so much scared of the sting.

601
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,100
 What he's more petrified about is the squirty venom

602
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,340
 that they're able to shoot at you.

603
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,580
 And that's another thing that you need to worry about.

604
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,260
 So they shoot venom at you and that can really burn.

605
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,020
 Like badly, it can give nerve damage to the eye.

606
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,560
 And so for him, that's the more intimidating thing

607
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,600
 than the sting itself that he's looking out for.

608
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,320
 - I have to say, it feels like entomologists

609
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
 who keep saying, no, they're just large hornets

610
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,140
 are fighting a slightly losing battle here.

611
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,480
 Do you know how you trap them

612
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
 if you've got them in your home?

613
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,700
 - I think I would move house.

614
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,600
 - Good luck in the estate agency stage, mate.

615
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
 Good luck with the viewings.

616
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,920
 - Under a bowl?

617
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,320
 - Well, you can use a bowl,

618
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,720
 but the thing you need to put in the bowl is prawns.

619
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,340
 They love prawns, especially during breeding season

620
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,740
 when they're going for a slightly more proteiny mix

621
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,880
 in their diet.

622
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,020
 - Wait, but they surely, I know they're big,

623
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,300
 but they're not big enough or good enough at swimming

624
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
 to be hunting prawns in the wild.

625
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,380
 - I think they very rarely take down full prawns

626
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,540
 in the wild, but they do eat meat, don't they?

627
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,100
 - I think a prawn is basically an insect of the sea, isn't it?

628
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,360
 So maybe, you know, it has a similar taste to insects.

629
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,020
 I have eaten insects, but I've never eaten prawns,

630
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
 so I don't really know what prawns taste like.

631
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,840
 - See, that is the reverse of most people's experience of life.

632
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
 - Yes, it's true.

633
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,280
 - I've eaten prawns, but I don't think I've eaten insects.

634
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,680
 I swallowed the fly warts on my bike,

635
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,080
 but it wasn't the same.

636
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,160
 - How did you get rid of that fly?

637
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,360
 - No, we can't go down this road, we don't have the time.

638
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,160
 In Japan, where they are not talked of as pejoratively,

639
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,400
 one of the reasons could be that the bees in Japan

640
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,000
 have evolved to deal with them much better, haven't they?

641
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 So they have this amazing way of killing them,

642
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,660
 which the European bees have not figured out.

643
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,140
 So what Japanese honeybees do is if they see

644
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,060
 an Asian giant hornet coming towards them,

645
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,500
 instead of going out to attack it,

646
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,060
 which is what the European bees do when they get decimated,

647
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,700
 they retreat back into their hive, the hornet comes in,

648
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,500
 and then a massive crowd of them, so hundreds of bees,

649
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,820
 swarm it, and then they vibrate around it,

650
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,940
 giving this sort of giant hug,

651
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,700
 and they vibrate and vibrate and vibrate,

652
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,860
 so it raises the temperature so much that the hornet dies,

653
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,280
 and it has to be quite specific,

654
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,280
 because a hornet dies, I think, at about 47.2 degrees C,

655
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,200
 and the bees will die if it gets about one or two degrees

656
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
 hotter than that.

657
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,880
 - Oh, really?

658
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,360
 - They've got to be real thermostats in that situation.

659
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,720
 - 'Cause that's what our theme tune's about, isn't it, then?

660
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,600
 - That's right, if anyone wants to find the full version

661
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,140
 of our theme tune called Wasps,

662
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,280
 that is the story in the lyrics about how that happens.

663
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
 - Of course, yeah.

664
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,660
 - Is it like a metaphor or something for lyrics then?

665
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,540
 I've realized, I've heard those lyrics, obviously,

666
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,940
 hundreds of times, but I've never really thought.

667
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,060
 - Yeah, it's the idea, I mean, Ash Gardner,

668
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,180
 who wrote it will know better,

669
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,940
 but the way I always interpret it is that you need

670
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,300
 all of your friend bees to kill the hornet,

671
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,860
 you all need to come together and hold on to each other

672
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,900
 in order to get past this terrible foe,

673
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,420
 and in the same way, humans, when we come together,

674
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,980
 we can achieve anything.

675
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
 - Isn't that right?

676
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,220
 - That's what I always thought of it.

677
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,780
 - That's really nice.

678
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,000
 It's time we get together, show what we can do,

679
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,960
 you hold on to me and I'll hold on to you.

680
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,480
 - And then we'll kill this hornet.

681
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,560
 - Yeah.

682
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,960
 - Down with the murder hornets, with past it.

683
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,340
 - Japan has an annual wasp festival.

684
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,180
 This is cool.

685
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,640
 It's called the Kushihara Hebo Matsuri.

686
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,400
 So Kushihara is the village and Hebo means wasp.

687
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,900
 And you have to bring a wasp nest to the festival.

688
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,720
 - What?

689
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,520
 - So the prize is for the heaviest wasp nest,

690
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,220
 but it's obviously quite hard to bring a wasp nest.

691
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,060
 - Yeah.

692
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,660
 - So this is how you do it.

693
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,940
 You have to attach a bit of white paper

694
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,900
 to a tiny sliver of fish, right?

695
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,860
 And the wasp, wasps of meat, that will swoop in

696
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,060
 and it'll grab the bit of fish and it flies off.

697
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,500
 But you can see the paper 'cause you've attached

698
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,340
 the paper to the fish.

699
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,580
 So you follow this little bit of paper

700
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,060
 flying through the air, that takes you back to the nest.

701
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,420
 And then you have to carefully dig it out,

702
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,060
 feed the wasps raw meat to grow them

703
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,800
 so that they build a big, strong nest.

704
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,840
 And then you eventually bring out this whole nest box

705
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
 and you bring it to the festival.

706
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,300
 - Oh Christ, wow.

707
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,720
 - I think we should just say, for people at home,

708
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
 don't go near a wasp's nest.

709
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,280
 'Cause they are dangerous, aren't they?

710
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,120
 Wasp's nest.

711
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,800
 You can get really badly stung.

712
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,040
 - Yeah, but if you really want to go to this festival,

713
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,320
 I mean, who's headlining the Japanese festival?

714
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,120
 - It's just more giant wasps.

715
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
 - Exactly.

716
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,840
 I was going to say, even bigger warning,

717
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,200
 do not go to the wasp festival.

718
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,040
 Certainly don't get the train there on the day

719
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,240
 that all the competitors are heading there as well.

720
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,180
 - In answer to your question,

721
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,120
 who's headlining the wasp festival, I think it's Sting.

722
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,960
 - Aye.

723
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,800
 - Aye.

724
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,380
 - In the medieval times,

725
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,380
 a peasant who lived near the French village of Cambrai

726
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,800
 dreamed that he got a divine revelation

727
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,420
 from a swarm of bees entering his anus.

728
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,860
 (laughing)

729
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,700
 Yeah.

730
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,020
 - Okay.

731
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,120
 That is putting a positive spin

732
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,560
 on what for most people would be

733
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,040
 quite a negative experience.

734
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
 (laughing)

735
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,980
 - A swarm of bees went to his anus.

736
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,880
 - Did he enter himself into that big wasp competition?

737
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,140
 (laughing)

738
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,640
 To clarify, to clarify for a second.

739
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,280
 I think he dreamed that a swarm of bees

740
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,520
 went to his anus and that the bees in the dream

741
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,740
 had given him a divine revelation about the evil clergy.

742
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
 I don't think.

743
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,900
 (laughing)

744
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,420
 But so, oh, okay.

745
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,980
 So they spoke to him from within his anus.

746
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,700
 - Yes, inside the dream,

747
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,260
 they spoke to him by flying into his bosom

748
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,740
 and they told him a divine revelation.

749
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,580
 - Okay.

750
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,420
 - Okay.

751
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
 - No bees were harmed.

752
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,100
 - It's not how you'd assume

753
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,780
 that God would communicate with you, is it?

754
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,740
 But he does, he works in mysterious ones.

755
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,340
 - Very mysterious.

756
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,860
 - I think they had to coin that phrase

757
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,940
 just for this specific revelation.

758
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,520
 (upbeat music)

759
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

760
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,600
 and that is James.

761
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that two years

762
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,600
 after the release of the first James Bond movie,

763
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,340
 an actual British spy called James Bond

764
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,480
 was discovered in Poland.

765
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,320
 - Incredible.

766
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,480
 - That's so good.

767
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,000
 - Amazing, who would have thought it?

768
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,340
 - Was it a response to the films?

769
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,720
 Was it them saying, we're gonna name all us

770
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,540
 why is James Bond?

771
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,420
 - Oh, like Spartacus or something,

772
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,300
 that would have been exactly.

773
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,460
 There's a suggestion of that.

774
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,500
 Now the thing is, this was in the Cold War

775
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,020
 and we are learning more stuff,

776
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,420
 like it gets declassified,

777
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,420
 but it's still kind of sketchy what people knew

778
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,100
 and what people were doing and all that kind of things.

779
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,980
 So we're kind of piecing things together.

780
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,260
 But they found this file

781
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,260
 that the Polish security service put together

782
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,940
 during the Cold War about this guy

783
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,900
 called James Albert Bond.

784
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,300
 And he went to Poland

785
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,620
 and ostentatiously started flirting with women

786
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,900
 and hanging around nuclear power plants and stuff like that.

787
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,100
 I don't know exactly what he did,

788
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,540
 but he was acting very, very obviously like a spy.

789
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,880
 And there's a suggestion

790
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,260
 that the British might have sent him over,

791
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,300
 deliberately given him that name,

792
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,000
 so that the Polish had to use their resources,

793
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
 investigating him,

794
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,560
 while perhaps some other covert stuff was happening.

795
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,040
 We don't know that.

796
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,180
 We don't know whether he was just on holiday in Poland,

797
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,720
 who just happened to be there.

798
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,480
 And everyone's just kind of put one-on-one together

799
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,780
 and got three.

800
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,860
 His wife seems to think

801
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,180
 that there might have been something going on.

802
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,780
 He's unfortunately not with us anymore,

803
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,700
 so we can't ask him.

804
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,660
 So who knows?

805
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,340
 - So many, so many James Bonds out there.

806
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,980
 So there was a survey done by a website,

807
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,660
 it's a census website,

808
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,820
 which found 7,672 James Bonds in history,

809
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,780
 with all sorts of jobs.

810
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,980
 They were mostly dull, you know, clerks and things.

811
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,940
 There were some orchid growers though, that was fun.

812
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,460
 And in the 1920 census,

813
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,820
 there was someone who was called Goldfinger.

814
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,980
 Goldyfinger, Goldyfinger.

815
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,260
 - Goldyfinger, that's G-O-L-D-E, gold.

816
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,680
 - Ah, do we know what that person did?

817
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,520
 Were they a villain?

818
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,360
 Was it a profession?

819
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,200
 - I don't think so.

820
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,240
 I don't know their profession.

821
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,080
 - There's a Wikipedia page,

822
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,120
 and obviously if you put James Bond in

823
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,360
 and you go for the Bond that's not the character,

824
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,920
 you get a few notable bonds.

825
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,040
 And so there's a few, there's a Speedway Racer,

826
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,120
 there is a Naval Officer,

827
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,960
 and there's a few other,

828
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,620
 and what's interesting is most of them,

829
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
 at some point in the article that says

830
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,740
 their nickname was 007.

831
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,300
 And I think every single one of them have the same nickname.

832
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,500
 Poor thing for their lives,

833
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,080
 if they were after the movies.

834
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,660
 But obviously the most notable one is the bird watcher,

835
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,260
 the ornithologist, James Bond,

836
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,540
 who the character was named after.

837
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,500
 - Yes, indeed.

838
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,180
 - They met, I think, didn't they, in the end?

839
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,020
 - They did.

840
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,340
 - And actually the James Bond, the bird watcher,

841
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,700
 said he loved being James Bond,

842
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,240
 because apparently it helped him get through passport control,

843
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,640
 which just made me think the passport control

844
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,120
 in the '60s or whatever was quite a lot more lax.

845
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,320
 He was just saying, "My name's James Bond."

846
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,840
 - Do you think he gave them the passport,

847
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,720
 and they saw the name,

848
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,560
 and he just tapped to the side of his nose

849
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,080
 and went, "Better let me in, guys."

850
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,680
 - Yeah, and all the security went,

851
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,400
 "God, this must be a thing that they forgot to tell me about."

852
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,360
 I'll let him through.

853
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
 - Ian Fleming once wrote to the other James Bond's wife

854
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,640
 and said that apologizing that he'd stolen the husband's name.

855
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,440
 And he said, "Perhaps one day your husband

856
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,460
 "will discover a particularly horrible species of bird,

857
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,960
 "which he would like to christen in an insulting fashion

858
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
 "by calling it Ian Fleming."

859
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,800
 - Very nice.

860
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,200
 - There's a theory that, a very new theory,

861
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,760
 that actually it wasn't based on James Bond,

862
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,460
 the ornithologist, that was just a cover by Ian Fleming

863
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,780
 to protect the person it was based on.

864
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,300
 And this is because a new thing came to light in 2018,

865
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,520
 a guy called Stephen Phillips from Swansea

866
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,880
 was looking into his grandfather's records,

867
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,980
 and his grandfather's called James Bond.

868
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,280
 And there were documents that had just been declassified

869
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,960
 that showed that his grandfather

870
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,120
 was an SOE, a special operations executive agent

871
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,500
 in World War II.

872
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,080
 And he just signed the official secrets act just before D-Day,

873
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,700
 so he was clearly involved in that in some way.

874
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,080
 And so this guy, Stephen Phillips' grandson,

875
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,100
 reckons it's likely Ian Fleming would have met him

876
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,800
 'cause they were both hanging out in the spy world

877
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,100
 around that time.

878
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,140
 And then thought, James Bond, great name,

879
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,300
 I better not say I was inspired by this spy

880
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,360
 'cause I don't want to spill the beans.

881
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,660
 So I'll find another James Bond to claim it was based on

882
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,740
 instead, so that's the theory.

883
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,700
 And the real James Bond ended up working

884
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,340
 as a lollipop man in Swansea.

885
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,500
 So, that's the obvious trajectory.

886
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,340
 - That must have been such an exciting crossing,

887
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,660
 a pelican crossing for Crosshead.

888
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,740
 Can you imagine?

889
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,060
 Gunfire, car chases.

890
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,840
 - The lollipop was actually a bazooka

891
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,000
 that he would have created in his beading car.

892
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,880
 - There's a guy called James Bond in Walsall,

893
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,240
 council worker in Walsall.

894
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,360
 He used to be called David Fern.

895
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,840
 And much like that guy who changed his name

896
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,800
 to Isle of Spam the other week,

897
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,840
 I don't know if you remember him.

898
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,080
 David Fern from Walsall has changed his name

899
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,400
 to James Bond, but as a middle name,

900
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,800
 he's included all the Bond film titles.

901
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,320
 This was in the newspapers in 2006.

902
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,960
 So, if he's ever stopped and they say, "What's your name?"

903
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,100
 He would say, "The name's Bond."

904
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,540
 James Dr. No from "Russia with Love,"

905
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,700
 Goldfinger, Thunderball, you only have them twice

906
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,880
 on a Majesty's Secret Service, blah, blah, blah,

907
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,580
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

908
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,460
 Die Another Day, Casino Real, Bond.

909
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,980
 - Does he have to change his name again by Deadpool

910
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,980
 every time a new film is released?

911
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,180
 - I think that's why they haven't released the new one yet,

912
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,880
 'cause he hasn't gotten around to it.

913
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,140
 (laughing)

914
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,300
 - Wow.

915
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,600
 - You really choose a path of embracing it,

916
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,620
 or really hating it, don't you?

917
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,460
 There was actually a documentary.

918
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,700
 Did you guys see, there's a documentary

919
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,780
 called "The Other Fellow," made by this bloke,

920
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,940
 called Matthew Bowyer, which is about other people

921
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,140
 with the name James Bond, and it went around the world,

922
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,220
 interviewing them, and the vast majority

923
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,260
 basically find it incredibly annoying.

924
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,460
 There was one guy who said,

925
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,180
 "The most annoying thing is that at least four times a week,

926
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,700
 "people come up to him and sing the Bond theme tune,

927
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,420
 "but easily half the time they attempt to do that,

928
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,700
 "they sing the Mission Impossible theme tune instead."

929
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,960
 (laughing)

930
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,280
 - Really?

931
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,520
 - There was a Canadian lawyer who was quite nice,

932
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,720
 he was called James Bond, and he always hated it

933
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,960
 'cause of all the jokes and stuff,

934
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,620
 and then eventually he got married the year before

935
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,200
 they made the documentary, and the guy he married said,

936
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,320
 "Look, there's no way I'm not calling you James Bond,"

937
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,680
 so he always went by Jim, Jim Bond.

938
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,920
 He said, "There's no way I'm not calling you James Bond,"

939
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,040
 and so now he embraces it, and he calls his husband,

940
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,160
 Moneypenny, and always orders Volcomartini,

941
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,720
 shaken, not stirred, and I think that's the way to go.

942
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,780
 - So Sean Connery, obviously very sadly passed away recently,

943
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,620
 nice little James Bond connection from his earlier life

944
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,300
 is that Connery used to deliver milk, he was a milkman,

945
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,580
 and he used to deliver milk to Fetty's school in the UK,

946
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,460
 and that is where the fictional James Bond went to.

947
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,660
 - Oh, no way! - That's insane.

948
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,980
 - Yeah, he was a model for fictional James Bond.

949
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,660
 - I guess he would have been doing it

950
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,380
 'cause when was Connery born, 1930,

951
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,000
 he might have been doing it at the time

952
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,640
 when Bond was at that school,

953
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,400
 as in he might have been delivering it

954
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,640
 to his fictional self without knowing it.

955
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,140
 - He has a sort of a billion jobs, didn't he?

956
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,460
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

957
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,920
 - It kind of implied that he couldn't stick it

958
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,720
 at a thing in a way, but one of the jobs that I like

959
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,760
 is the fact that he worked as a life drawing model

960
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,080
 'cause it means that we have an almost entirely naked picture

961
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,360
 of Sean Connery in his very early days available,

962
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,280
 and bizarrely he worked as a life drawing model

963
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,180
 and the quite famous arts promoter and artist,

964
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,540
 Richard DeMarco drew him, so you can see Sean Connery,

965
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,220
 and he's wearing this sort of brown willysack,

966
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,460
 like a tiny, what do you call, like a--

967
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,660
 - Like a posing pouch. - A posing pouch.

968
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,620
 - A posing pouch. - Yeah.

969
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,500
 I would call it a willysack if you like.

970
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,460
 - It's a willysack.

971
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,060
 - Are you sure it's a willysack

972
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,340
 and not just he's got very, very weird genitals?

973
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,940
 - I couldn't say 100%, I didn't zoom in closely enough.

974
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,360
 - It's worth taking a look.

975
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,540
 - Yeah, that sounds like the artists in the class

976
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,920
 just got prudish when they got down there,

977
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
 "Ugh, that will do."

978
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,040
 (all laughing)

979
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,260
 - Yeah, just a brown blur.

980
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,200
 - He was supposed to be Gandalf, wasn't he?

981
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,160
 The Lord of the Rings. - Really?

982
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,160
 - But he was offered 15% of the box office receipts

983
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,680
 which would have given him $450 million.

984
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,200
 And he turned it down 'cause he didn't understand the script.

985
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,380
 And then they interviewed him later and he said,

986
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,220
 "I've read the book, I read the script,

987
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,880
 "I saw the movie, I still don't understand it."

988
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,020
 (all laughing)

989
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,140
 - 15%? - Yeah.

990
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,380
 - Instead, he made the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

991
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,340
 as his last film.

992
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,420
 What a different film to go out on.

993
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,740
 - That was his last film, really.

994
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,420
 - Yeah, he retired after that because it,

995
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,340
 I mean, it is a bit of a honker.

996
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,360
 - He was a member of the SMP,

997
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,140
 a sort of card carrying member

998
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,280
 and the membership number they gave him, 007.

999
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,180
 - Amazing.

1000
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,760
 - As if that wasn't used already,

1001
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,540
 do they not even have seven members?

1002
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,020
 (all laughing)

1003
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,200
 - They had to kick an extremely long-serving

1004
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,480
 loyal person out in order to give it to them.

1005
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,600
 - Margaret Thatcher was offered the passport 007,

1006
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,440
 wasn't she?

1007
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,640
 We might have said that before,

1008
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,320
 but she said, "No, that's silly."

1009
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,380
 And they gave it to someone incredibly boring

1010
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,920
 and said it was someone like him.

1011
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,000
 - Just some random lollipop man in Wales.

1012
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,080
 (all laughing)

1013
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,920
 - Was it Jeff?

1014
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,220
 - I mean, that would make your day.

1015
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,060
 Was it Jeff?

1016
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,900
 Who did you say?

1017
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,560
 - It was someone, who's the MP who said?

1018
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
 - Jeff.

1019
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,460
 - H, double O, N.

1020
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,420
 (all laughing)

1021
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,260
 - That's right.

1022
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,300
 (all laughing)

1023
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,820
 - He spent some time in his life sleeping in a coffin.

1024
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,660
 - Oh, wow.

1025
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,740
 Is that 'cause he worked,

1026
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,860
 didn't he work as a funeral director

1027
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,180
 or a grave digger or something?

1028
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,820
 - Oh, no, not nearly that senior.

1029
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,220
 He worked as a coffin polisher.

1030
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,280
 You've given him seven promotions.

1031
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,420
 (all laughing)

1032
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,260
 - I think he worked as a coffin polisher

1033
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,840
 because he was friends with this guy

1034
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,220
 that he did bodybuilding with Mr. Scotland, Archie Brennan.

1035
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,520
 And Archie Brennan suggested he get into coffin polishing

1036
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
 to earn some extra money.

1037
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,520
 And there was an interview with someone

1038
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,320
 who was his old workmate in the warehouse

1039
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,640
 where they polished the coffins and made them.

1040
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
 And it's this guy called Tommy Walk,

1041
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,320
 who said he noticed that Sean, young Sean,

1042
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,240
 wasn't going home at night.

1043
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,840
 He was sleeping in the coffins.

1044
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,640
 So he was just having a bit of a rough time

1045
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
 at that period of his life.

1046
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,060
 - I think I'd be a bit worried about Mr. Universe

1047
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,840
 or Mr. Scotland polishing the coffins

1048
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,160
 'cause he'd be so strong he'd go right the way through it.

1049
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,740
 (all laughing)

1050
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,440
 - I love that you just corrected me

1051
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,780
 about giving a promotion to Sean Connery in that company.

1052
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,720
 And then immediately gave Mr. Scotland

1053
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,160
 the Mr. Universe title.

1054
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,760
 (all laughing)

1055
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,680
 - Well, to Sean Connery,

1056
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,300
 Scotland was the universe, Dan.

1057
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,020
 So I think it's what he would have wanted me to say.

1058
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,600
 (upbeat music)

1059
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,860
 (upbeat music)

1060
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,240
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1061
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,620
 And that is my fact.

1062
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,140
 My fact this week is in 1970,

1063
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,380
 burglars managed to successfully get past

1064
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,860
 an unpickable door lock

1065
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,020
 and steal American government documents

1066
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,660
 by tacking a note to it a few hours beforehand

1067
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,620
 that read, "Please don't lock this door tonight."

1068
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,140
 (all laughing)

1069
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,460
 So this came from a really, really cool book

1070
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,280
 that was published called "The Burglary",

1071
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,260
 the discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's secrets

1072
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,160
 by Betty Medziger.

1073
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,240
 And the book talks about one of the great moments

1074
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,800
 of being able to expose the FBI

1075
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
 for some hidden secret operations

1076
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,520
 that they were conducting in America

1077
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,680
 by a group that were known as the Citizens Commission

1078
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,360
 to investigate the FBI,

1079
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,560
 random group of people who decided to make it their mission

1080
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,080
 to infiltrate the FBI and steal these documents.

1081
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,040
 But there was a whole scene of these sort of anti-war

1082
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,520
 and anti-government activists

1083
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,480
 that had been operating in the States,

1084
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,420
 going around and breaking into various buildings.

1085
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,580
 And they broke into the FBI offices,

1086
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,740
 took a thousand classified documents,

1087
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,380
 and they sent it to all the newspapers.

1088
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,460
 And the Washington Post were the first

1089
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,100
 to sort of publish them

1090
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,980
 and show that there was secret spying

1091
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,420
 that was going on under J. Edgar Hoover's government

1092
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,300
 and really kind of tore him down a lot.

1093
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,460
 So yeah, this unpickable lock was just an earlier mission

1094
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,380
 where they were trying to get some draft papers

1095
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,780
 for the Vietnam War and steal them

1096
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,280
 so people couldn't be drafted.

1097
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,080
 - And did the people in the offices explain

1098
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,480
 why they had read the note and decided

1099
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,640
 that that was a legit reason to leave the door open?

1100
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,680
 'Cause I can't think of a single ordinary circumstance

1101
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
 where you would request

1102
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,400
 that people don't lock a door overnight.

1103
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,880
 - Yes, I would immediately obey the sign.

1104
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,120
 If there was a sign on the door saying,

1105
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,080
 "Please don't lock this door,"

1106
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,160
 I think, "Oh, well, someone has a good reason."

1107
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,120
 - That is so good to know.

1108
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,840
 And I intend to take advantage of that in the future.

1109
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,240
 - Was it that the cleaners maybe,

1110
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,320
 the cleaners were coming around after the office was shut

1111
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,520
 and they would normally lock up,

1112
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,260
 but they thought that someone in the office

1113
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,480
 had left that note.

1114
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,320
 That might be it.

1115
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,160
 - Yeah.

1116
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,000
 - I don't, yeah.

1117
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,080
 - Well, they couldn't believe it worked, by the way.

1118
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,880
 They got there and they're like, "Oh my God."

1119
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,340
 And they almost toyed with the idea

1120
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,200
 of leaving a thank you note on the door.

1121
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,640
 And then they thought, "No, that's going too far."

1122
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,520
 They might recognize the handwriting.

1123
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,740
 - I like that idea of leaving notes,

1124
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,260
 burglars leaving notes generally,

1125
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,220
 which they do sometimes do.

1126
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,920
 They sometimes leave apology notes.

1127
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
 It seems to be quite a common thing.

1128
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,140
 My friend's granny was actually robbed recently

1129
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,560
 and they left an apology note saying,

1130
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,240
 "Sorry for stealing your stuff."

1131
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,920
 And there was one,

1132
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,200
 there was a really nice story this year,

1133
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,840
 in February in North Carolina,

1134
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,040
 where someone who worked in a salon

1135
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,320
 came to the salon the next day.

1136
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,760
 And it was clear someone had broken in,

1137
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,160
 but couldn't find that anything had been taken.

1138
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,360
 And then she found a note that said,

1139
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,800
 "As I left your salon with all the stuff I'd stolen,

1140
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,960
 and then with the list of all the stuff

1141
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,920
 this person has stolen,

1142
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,760
 I had an epiphany of how hard you work for your business.

1143
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
 And I returned everything I've taken.

1144
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,640
 Here's everything I've returned.

1145
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,480
 Please forgive me.

1146
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,280
 I'm ashamed to discuss it myself."

1147
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,600
 - And then brought it all back.

1148
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,320
 - See, that I think is better than leaving a note

1149
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,960
 which says, "Sorry for stealing your stuff,

1150
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,800
 which I have gone ahead and done anyway."

1151
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,960
 That's baloney.

1152
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,400
 - It feels like the apology is a little bit empty

1153
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,480
 in the first one, doesn't it?

1154
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,320
 - Yeah, it does.

1155
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,400
 It absolutely does.

1156
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
 I would leave a note saying, "Sorry about the poo,"

1157
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,600
 but they're not leaving the poo.

1158
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,960
 (laughing)

1159
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,900
 For the rest of their time there.

1160
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,040
 - Yeah.

1161
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,200
 - Poos happen a lot, right?

1162
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,040
 Apparently, someone did a,

1163
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,000
 they did a scientific paper on not leaving it

1164
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,840
 as a dirty protest,

1165
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,680
 but needing to have a poo while robbing a house.

1166
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,040
 So there's a paper, which I haven't actually read.

1167
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,880
 I just saw it.

1168
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,120
 It was called, "The Scatological Rights of Bird Wars."

1169
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,240
 And it showed that in a lot of cases

1170
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,080
 where people were caught,

1171
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,160
 they admitted to having a poo while doing the burglary.

1172
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,560
 - Because you're quite stressed, it makes you want to go,

1173
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,200
 but you can get caught by people

1174
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,600
 finding the DNA of your inside your poo, don't they?

1175
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,440
 - Yes.

1176
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,960
 - So do flush it is what you're saying.

1177
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,640
 - We'll take it home to be safe.

1178
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,080
 - To be truly safe.

1179
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,120
 - I was reading about the hamburgler in the news this year

1180
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,760
 and that was a man who stole some ham.

1181
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,800
 He was called Domingo Infante.

1182
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,960
 He was 34 years old in Spain.

1183
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,320
 And he went into a shop

1184
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,080
 and there was massive legs of Iberico ham.

1185
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,580
 You know, those massive like cured ham legs.

1186
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,960
 And he stole, I think like four or five of them,

1187
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,440
 but they're really heavy, those things.

1188
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,280
 I don't know if you've ever picked one up,

1189
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,560
 but they're super heavy.

1190
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,600
 And so he had to drag them home to his house

1191
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,560
 leaving the trail of fat all the way to his front door,

1192
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,600
 which they just followed.

1193
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,960
 And they knocked on the door

1194
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,320
 and he was living with his parents

1195
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,400
 and they said, "Have you got some hams here?"

1196
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,760
 And eventually they had to admit that they did.

1197
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,800
 - Oh my God, that is such an example

1198
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,520
 of letting the best be the enemy of the good.

1199
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,440
 Those hams last for ages, I bet,

1200
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,520
 'cause they're quite densely packed, aren't they?

1201
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,440
 If you had one of them, he probably would have been fine.

1202
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,400
 - They're expensive though.

1203
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,040
 I think he probably intended to sell them

1204
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,160
 rather than eat them.

1205
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,240
 I think 'cause each of those is like 100 quid

1206
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,080
 or something, I reckon.

1207
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,360
 So he was just getting seven of them

1208
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,680
 and then he was going to sell them down the park.

1209
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,520
 - That's a really good point.

1210
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,360
 'Cause cheese, obviously,

1211
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,240
 that's why people steal cheese from the supermarket so much.

1212
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,280
 It's a relatively large amount of money

1213
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,200
 in a relatively small box.

1214
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,040
 - Yeah.

1215
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,880
 - Yeah, if you're hungry,

1216
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,200
 I don't think you'd steal a giant Iberico ham.

1217
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,920
 There are so many easier foodstuffs to feed

1218
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,920
 from dragging a pig down the street.

1219
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,560
 - In our previous books of the year,

1220
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,280
 we've often found that American police officers

1221
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,800
 like to give their bandits nicknames.

1222
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,640
 - Oh yeah.

1223
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,960
 - Do you remember that?

1224
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,000
 Every year, whenever there's something that happens,

1225
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,280
 some crime in America,

1226
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,520
 the cops always name them the something bandit.

1227
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,400
 So I Googled a few of those.

1228
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,600
 In Chicago this year,

1229
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,400
 there was a guy called the mummy bandits.

1230
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,080
 Do you know why they might have called him that?

1231
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,320
 - Did he wrap himself in toilet paper?

1232
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,360
 - Pretty much, yeah.

1233
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,640
 He wrapped himself in gauze and scarves

1234
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,400
 so that none of the CCTV cameras would know who he was.

1235
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,640
 The powder puff bandit.

1236
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,000
 Do you know what they might have done?

1237
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,440
 - Is that something to do with the cartoon?

1238
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,480
 The powder puff girls?

1239
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,720
 - Powder puff girls, no, it's nothing to do with that.

1240
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,280
 - I think they were the power puff girls.

1241
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,680
 They weren't just makeup artists,

1242
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,040
 the adventures of makeup artists.

1243
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,200
 - Yeah, it's a play on words.

1244
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,720
 They're powerful, but they're also like powder puffs.

1245
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,320
 - What is a powder puff?

1246
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,760
 - A powder puff is like, you know,

1247
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,120
 if you're putting makeup on,

1248
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,400
 but it's like you kind of puff onto your face.

1249
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,240
 - Got it.

1250
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,080
 - So it's like, they've got the powder in one half

1251
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,160
 of that mirror in the other, right?

1252
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,840
 Maybe you have a brush and use it.

1253
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,680
 Okay, all right.

1254
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,600
 Did they blow the very fine makeup powder

1255
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,840
 towards the CCTV cameras to hide their entry?

1256
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,880
 - Great idea, no.

1257
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,800
 - Oh, did they, did they using makeup?

1258
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,040
 Did they paint someone else's face on their face?

1259
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,080
 - Great.

1260
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,360
 - It's actually the exact opposite of that.

1261
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,600
 - They painted their own face on someone else's face.

1262
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,520
 - It's not the exact opposite of that,

1263
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,880
 but it's something that's different.

1264
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,520
 - What they did was, this was in Denver,

1265
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,160
 there's a guy called Hernandez,

1266
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,680
 and he had extremely obvious facial tattoos.

1267
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,800
 And so he would use the foundation to cover those up

1268
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,840
 so that they wouldn't recognize him.

1269
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,720
 - Brilliant, very clever.

1270
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,800
 - There was a guy called,

1271
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,880
 this is quite easy to guess actually,

1272
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,320
 but there was a guy in Albuquerque

1273
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,880
 called the birthday suit sign bandit.

1274
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,720
 - If you know, did you hear about him?

1275
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,200
 - Birthday suit sign bandit.

1276
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,600
 - So something to do with nudity, right?

1277
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,680
 His birthday.

1278
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,880
 - But then is he wearing a little sign over his penis

1279
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,000
 saying get action here or something like that?

1280
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,520
 - He's wearing Sean Connery's leathery glove.

1281
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,280
 - Now this was very simply a man caught naked on camera

1282
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,280
 stealing a Biden-Harris campaign sign

1283
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,040
 from a garden in Albuquerque.

1284
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,520
 - Oh.

1285
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,600
 - Flabber.

1286
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,840
 - Anyway, that's some of those.

1287
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,640
 - Do you know how you'd burgle a house using a tortoise?

1288
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,480
 - Wow, okay, so very slow getaway.

1289
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,320
 - Yes.

1290
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,400
 - Could you squeeze yourself under the shell

1291
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,080
 sort of between tortoise and shell?

1292
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,400
 - No, that's not, that's a good method.

1293
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,680
 This is a gang of thieves in medieval Arabia

1294
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,600
 called the Banu Sasang.

1295
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,000
 And in fact, they lasted hundreds of years.

1296
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,480
 It's kind of a very loose affiliation

1297
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,760
 rather than a proper gang, like they want one entity.

1298
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,200
 But supposedly they would bring a crowbar, a candle,

1299
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,160
 some stale bread, some beans, an iron spike, a drill,

1300
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,240
 a bag of sand and a tortoise to your gang.

1301
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,800
 - I think that the drill and the iron stake and stuff

1302
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,960
 are a lot more important than the tortoise in this play.

1303
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,840
 - No, no, no way.

1304
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,400
 Okay, they do use the spike or the crowbar

1305
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,000
 to get in to access to the property, fine.

1306
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,680
 But then they light the candle, which they've also brought,

1307
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,120
 they stick it onto the tortoise

1308
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,120
 and they send the tortoise through the hole.

1309
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,120
 That way you can see what's in there.

1310
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,880
 You can see if there's any stuff worth stealing, right?

1311
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,080
 Then you use the bag of sand,

1312
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,760
 you throw that at the windows and see if anyone gets up.

1313
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,600
 And if there's no one up, then you go in, right?

1314
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,400
 - Well, so if you're in the house and you wake up

1315
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,120
 and you just hear a bit of banging outside

1316
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,120
 and you kind of go into your front room

1317
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,520
 and there's a tortoise with a candle on its back,

1318
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,360
 I still think you're going to be a bit suspicious.

1319
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,760
 - Straight back to bed for me.

1320
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,120
 It's not a burglar, it's just the candle tortoise again.

1321
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,400
 Also, with a note on his back saying,

1322
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,360
 "Please ignore me, I'm just a tortoise with a candle on my back."

1323
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,200
 - Nothing to see here.

1324
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,480
 - Well, I know what you're thinking.

1325
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
 What about the stale bread and the dried beans?

1326
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,800
 - Sorry, that's what I was thinking, yeah.

1327
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,960
 So that's if you get in.

1328
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,760
 So the operation tortoise has worked,

1329
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,520
 you've seen valuables, you're in the house,

1330
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,240
 but then you can hear someone moving around in a nearby room.

1331
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,000
 At that point, you noisily chew on the stale bread

1332
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,920
 and the dried beans so that people think

1333
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,760
 it's just a cat eating a mouse.

1334
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,000
 - Oh, right.

1335
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,280
 - Is that a Foley sound effect trick?

1336
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,160
 Is that how you simulate cat eating a mouse?

1337
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,320
 - It is, absolutely, yeah.

1338
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,480
 - Stale bread and dried beans.

1339
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,240
 - But we have got a cat, you might say.

1340
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,280
 And then you're in trouble, I guess.

1341
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,400
 - Have you guys heard of George Leslie from America?

1342
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,320
 Okay, so this is around the late 1800s.

1343
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,320
 And this is a guy who moved to New York City in 1869

1344
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,920
 and he was a trained architect,

1345
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,560
 but he decided to go into a life of crime.

1346
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,920
 And it is said that the gang that he created off the back of it

1347
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,160
 and the syndicate that he created off the back of it

1348
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,560
 were responsible for nearly 80% of all bank robberies

1349
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,160
 in the US at that time, this one guy.

1350
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,040
 So what he used to do, which was really interesting,

1351
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,720
 is he used to break into banks, not to rob them,

1352
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,400
 but to walk around at night on his own and map them out.

1353
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,080
 Then he would take his designs, 'cause he's an architect,

1354
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,360
 he would go back to a warehouse that he owned

1355
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,120
 and build the bank in there

1356
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,880
 so that he and his fellow robbers could work out

1357
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,720
 the best way of getting through certain things

1358
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,360
 and certain doors and certain escape routes.

1359
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,920
 So he would recreate the entire interior of the bank.

1360
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,320
 - Are you saying that he wrote "Ocean's Eleven"

1361
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,080
 about 100 years before "Ocean's Eleven"?

1362
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,640
 - Oh, I never saw that movie, but yeah.

1363
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,480
 - I think that's what they do.

1364
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,520
 - That's incredible.

1365
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,800
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary.

1366
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,640
 - Well, it is incredible.

1367
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,440
 Apart from the people who wrote "Ocean's Eleven"

1368
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,920
 who probably just heard about this guy

1369
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,760
 and then stole it for their plot though.

1370
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,040
 - Yes, I was saying the original guy is more impressive.

1371
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,760
 - Yeah, I actually wasn't saying "Ocean's Eleven"

1372
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,800
 is an incredible film.

1373
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,760
 I think it's decent.

1374
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,080
 It's certainly better than "Ocean's Twelve".

1375
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,360
 (laughing)

1376
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,600
 - What was he called?

1377
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,840
 - He was called George Leslie.

1378
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,440
 And these were life-size, it's not like he did little models.

1379
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,920
 - Well, of course you wouldn't use a tiny model.

1380
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,400
 Imagine how freaked out your gang is gonna be

1381
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,240
 if they get into the vault and it's huge.

1382
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,680
 They haven't trained for this.

1383
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,160
 (laughing)

1384
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,760
 - There was a burglar in 2014

1385
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,840
 who managed to delay 783 trains

1386
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,120
 as a result of his burglary.

1387
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,440
 Unbelievable.

1388
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,040
 So he'd cut open a curry stall near Charlton

1389
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,240
 and the police turned up and he panicked and fled.

1390
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,360
 And then he got onto his motorbike,

1391
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,840
 also stolen by the way.

1392
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,160
 So not even an unscrupulously acquired motorbike.

1393
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
 That didn't start.

1394
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,360
 He ran off and then he climbed up a tree.

1395
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,120
 But unfortunately the tree was kind of overhanging

1396
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,200
 the railway tracks at Charlton station.

1397
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,680
 And he decided to stay up there for 17 hours,

1398
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,000
 despite the police being there.

1399
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,320
 At that point the game is over

1400
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,640
 and I think you have to come down from the tree.

1401
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,480
 - So, did the police,

1402
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,680
 were the police stood under the tree at this time

1403
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,520
 saying you're gonna have to come down eventually?

1404
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,040
 - Pretty much, yeah.

1405
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,800
 - Don't you call the fire engine at that point?

1406
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,640
 - Yeah, say we've got a cat burglar stuck up in the tree.

1407
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,480
 (laughing)

1408
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,720
 - They always find their own way down.

1409
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,720
 Don't worry, you don't actually need it.

1410
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,560
 (laughing)

1411
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,240
 (upbeat music)

1412
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,360
 - Okay, that's it.

1413
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,400
