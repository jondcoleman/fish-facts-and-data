00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:15,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:30,00:00:33,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:39,00:00:43,"My fact this week is that the author, George Elliott,"
00:00:43,00:00:44,had a massive head.
00:00:44,00:00:46,(laughing)
00:00:46,00:00:48,- That's very similar to another fact
00:00:48,00:00:49,that we've had a few years ago.
00:00:49,00:00:52,- This is sort of a sequel fact.
00:00:52,00:00:53,"So for fans of the show,"
00:00:53,00:00:56,"you might have remembered in episode 265,"
00:00:56,00:00:59,we delivered the jaw-breaking news that George Elliott
00:00:59,00:01:00,had a secret.
00:01:00,00:01:01,- Jaw-slapping news.
00:01:01,00:01:02,- Jaw-dropping news.
00:01:02,00:01:05,"- Yeah, the jaw-breaking news."
00:01:05,00:01:07,- My facts are really aggressive.
00:01:07,00:01:09,- The FEMA snapping news coming to you.
00:01:09,00:01:11,So what was the news we delivered then?
00:01:11,00:01:15,"- So the jaw-dropping news, no breakage,"
00:01:15,00:01:18,"is that 50 years after she died, for 50 years,"
00:01:18,00:01:20,"was the fact that she had a massive hand,"
00:01:20,00:01:21,"but that was a secret,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,and the family denied her having it.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"Anyway, so this was written in a book,"
00:01:25,00:01:27,which was back in the 1840s.
00:01:27,00:01:28,So there was a biography that was put together
00:01:28,00:01:31,"of George Elliott by a writer called Matilda Blind,"
00:01:31,00:01:33,or Mathilda Blind.
00:01:33,00:01:35,I can't get the exact pronouncement.
00:01:35,00:01:36,- Could be Blinde as well.
00:01:36,00:01:37,- Could be what?
00:01:37,00:01:37,- Could be Blinde.
00:01:37,00:01:39,- It's probably Matilde Blinde.
00:01:39,00:01:41,- Matilde Blinde.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"And so Matilde Blinde wrote a biography of her,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,and she went round.
00:01:44,00:01:45,- She's South African.
00:01:45,00:01:46,- Matilde Blinde.
00:01:46,00:01:48,(laughing)
00:01:48,00:01:49,- She's a Kiwi.
00:01:49,00:01:50,(laughing)
00:01:50,00:01:52,"- Sorry, she wrote an autobiography."
00:01:52,00:01:53,- She wrote a biography.
00:01:53,00:01:54,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"- A biography, and during the research period,"
00:01:56,00:01:59,"she went to the farm where George Elliott used to live,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,"and there was a couple there called the Braes,"
00:02:01,00:02:04,and it was Mrs. Cara Brae who told everyone
00:02:04,00:02:06,that she had this big hand.
00:02:06,00:02:07,"However, when I was reading the book recently,"
00:02:07,00:02:10,I also discovered that her husband became obsessed
00:02:10,00:02:12,with George Elliott because he noticed
00:02:12,00:02:14,that she also had a ginormous head.
00:02:14,00:02:15,- Was she just huge?
00:02:15,00:02:16,- Was she a giant?
00:02:16,00:02:17,- Was she a giant?
00:02:17,00:02:18,"- No, she wasn't that big,"
00:02:18,00:02:20,but I think that's why they were astounded
00:02:20,00:02:21,by the size of her head.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"She was taller than average, I think."
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- Yeah, but you're not just dragging out"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"for when you don't have a fact next time,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,'cause George Elliott had a massive elbow.
00:02:29,00:02:31,(laughing)
00:02:31,00:02:32,- It's quite possible we will be back
00:02:32,00:02:35,at 100 episodes time with another feature.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"So Mrs. Brae wrote of her,"
00:02:37,00:02:39,"she said she had her head was massive,"
00:02:39,00:02:40,"her feature is powerful and rugged,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"her mouth large but shapely,"
00:02:42,00:02:45,"the jaw singularly square for a woman,"
00:02:45,00:02:48,"unbreakable at the sound of a powerful fact, I imagine."
00:02:48,00:02:51,"And so Mr. Brae said,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"""I need to get your head turned into a cast,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"""I need to take you to London,"
00:02:55,00:02:57,"""and so we can go and we can do phrenology on it"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"""and see how it's going to ring."""
00:02:59,00:03:01,- So phrenology is where you look at the shape
00:03:01,00:03:03,of someone's head and you can tell their personality.
00:03:03,00:03:04,"- Exactly, that's right."
00:03:04,00:03:06,It was very popular back in those days
00:03:06,00:03:09,when people started trying to work out
00:03:09,00:03:12,how the brain functioned and maybe certain bits of our brain.
00:03:12,00:03:13,- Well they couldn't do palm reading on her
00:03:13,00:03:14,'cause it'd be like going through Ella
00:03:14,00:03:16,and showing to Tom Perdue.
00:03:16,00:03:19,(laughing)
00:03:19,00:03:20,"- It sounds amazing, the report."
00:03:20,00:03:22,"So her head was, it was measured by a doctor"
00:03:22,00:03:24,called James DeVille and then it was analyzed
00:03:24,00:03:26,by George Coombe who was one of the leaders
00:03:26,00:03:28,of the phrenological movement in the whole country.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"So, you know--"
00:03:29,00:03:31,- She would have needed a very big Coombe.
00:03:31,00:03:32,- Oh my gosh.
00:03:32,00:03:33,(laughing)
00:03:33,00:03:36,"- And when he first saw the cast of her head,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"Coombe, 'cause he was doing the analysis,"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"he was in the lab, I don't think I had a lab."
00:03:40,00:03:42,"But anyway, he took the cast for a man's head,"
00:03:42,00:03:46,"that's how huge it was, 22 and a quarter inches."
00:03:46,00:03:49,- How much bigger are men's heads than women's heads?
00:03:49,00:03:50,- Statistically speaking.
00:03:50,00:03:54,- My head is five centimeters bigger than George Eliot's.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"- But that's good, so this is just a bit bigger"
00:03:57,00:03:58,than George Eliot's head.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"- Yeah, yeah, so if anyone sees me in the pub"
00:04:01,00:04:03,"and you're like, oh that's James from the podcast,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,imagine my head but five centimeters smaller
00:04:06,00:04:07,and that'll be George Eliot's head.
00:04:07,00:04:09,- It's like she's there.
00:04:09,00:04:11,"- So this is actually, now your fact has become"
00:04:11,00:04:13,kind of an insult to James 'cause what you're saying
00:04:13,00:04:15,is James Harkin has a really massive head.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"- Compared to, but then men don't have larger heads"
00:04:19,00:04:21,"in general than women, I think."
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- That's true, except for Andy, apparently."
00:04:23,00:04:24,- I'm just looking at Andy's head.
00:04:24,00:04:25,- Which Anna was saying at the top of the show.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- Yeah, I'm not very comfortable"
00:04:26,00:04:29,with this line of inquiry.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Have you ever, if just listening at home,"
00:04:30,00:04:31,have you ever seen a matchstick?
00:04:31,00:04:36,- Imagine the head was a bit smaller.
00:04:36,00:04:39,- It actually goes in from the match shaft.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"- Australians, you might know them as dick heads,"
00:04:41,00:04:41,those matches.
00:04:41,00:04:42,- That's right.
00:04:42,00:04:44,"- Yeah, and funnily, at school,"
00:04:44,00:04:48,a lot of the kids were Australian matchmen.
00:04:48,00:04:53,"No, but so she was analysed by this phrenologist."
00:04:53,00:04:58,"So it said that her temperament was nervous lymphatic,"
00:04:58,00:05:01,which means active without endurance.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"And lo and behold, it turned out that she worked"
00:05:03,00:05:05,from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"So she was active, but didn't have endurance."
00:05:08,00:05:10,And intellectual and all of this.
00:05:10,00:05:12,- And she visited this guy over the years.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Kume, she didn't just have her head sent to him"
00:05:15,00:05:16,via the casting.
00:05:16,00:05:19,She actually was in his presence a few times.
00:05:19,00:05:19,"Well, that's what happened."
00:05:19,00:05:21,You would make the cast of the head
00:05:21,00:05:22,and you would send it to phrenologists
00:05:22,00:05:25,who were keen to sort of measure the bumps and so on.
00:05:25,00:05:26,- You just need to be very careful
00:05:26,00:05:28,that you do specify cast before someone soars
00:05:28,00:05:31,off their own head and turns it into a package.
00:05:31,00:05:32,"- Okay, here's the thing I don't get."
00:05:32,00:05:33,What about your hair?
00:05:33,00:05:35,"So if you've got a huge hair,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,that will surely obscure the lumps and bumps on your head.
00:05:37,00:05:38,- But you feel the bumps.
00:05:38,00:05:39,You're not looking for the bumps.
00:05:39,00:05:41,- But this is one of the things that opponents
00:05:41,00:05:44,"of phrenology said, you know, this is why it's nonsense."
00:05:44,00:05:46,So Oliver Wendell Holmes.
00:05:46,00:05:47,- Oh yeah.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- Wait, who was he again?"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"- I think he was a writer and a doctor, I think."
00:05:51,00:05:53,"- He was a celeb, Victorian celeb."
00:05:53,00:05:55,"- I just double checked 'cause in my head I went,"
00:05:55,00:05:55,"oh, Sherlock's brother."
00:05:55,00:05:57,And then I realized not a real answer.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"- Definitely not, no, no, no."
00:05:59,00:06:00,But he wrote this.
00:06:00,00:06:03,"He said, could you tell how much money there is in a safe"
00:06:03,00:06:05,by kneading its knobs with your fingers
00:06:05,00:06:07,when a man fumbles about my forehead
00:06:07,00:06:09,"and talks about the organs of individuality, size, et cetera."
00:06:09,00:06:11,I trust him as much as I should
00:06:11,00:06:13,if he felt the outside of my strongbox
00:06:13,00:06:15,and told me there was a $5 or a $10 bill
00:06:15,00:06:18,"under this or that particular rivet, which is fair."
00:06:18,00:06:19,"- Well, yeah."
00:06:19,00:06:20,"- So even at the time, people did say--"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"- It was a long way of saying, this is bullshit."
00:06:22,00:06:23,- Yeah. - Isn't it?
00:06:23,00:06:23,- Yeah.
00:06:23,00:06:26,- Why is it keeping such small value bills in a safe box?
00:06:26,00:06:28,"- Jesus, the point, maybe he's on holiday."
00:06:28,00:06:29,- Even back then.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"- It's just the 1700s, that's worth a lot."
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- See, is it 1800s, isn't it?"
00:06:33,00:06:36,"- I think so, yeah, yeah, that was his manner."
00:06:36,00:06:38,"- The idea was that, you know, you could have,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,your eyeballs almost pushed out even.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"And this, in fact, was the first, you know,"
00:06:42,00:06:43,the first instance of it.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"So, phrenology was coined,"
00:06:45,00:06:48,the idea of it was coined by Franz Joseph Gaul.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"And he said that he came up with the idea,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,"or he realized it was the truth,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,when he noticed that classmates in his class
00:06:55,00:06:58,could memorize these massive long bits of text.
00:06:58,00:07:00,And the ones that could memorize it had quite bulging eyes.
00:07:00,00:07:03,He said they had big salient eyes.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"And he said, this must mean that the organ of verbal memory"
00:07:06,00:07:08,is sitting right behind your eyes.
00:07:08,00:07:09,"And if you're really gonna remember yourself,"
00:07:09,00:07:10,it's pushing them out.
00:07:10,00:07:13,So I don't know if your eyes just drop out of your face
00:07:13,00:07:14,entirely if you've got a really good memory.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"But then, yeah, he's the father of it, really, wasn't he?"
00:07:17,00:07:17,- Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"- The thing I liked about it, though,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,is he wasn't this Gaul character.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"He wasn't onto the wrong idea, really."
00:07:23,00:07:24,Because all he--
00:07:24,00:07:25,"- No, that's all right."
00:07:25,00:07:26,I think-- - I think--
00:07:26,00:07:27,- Wait a sec.
00:07:27,00:07:28,- I think the way that--
00:07:28,00:07:30,"- Well, I mean, it was definitely all bullshit."
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- Yeah, yeah, absolutely, but, you know,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,modern day brain understanding
00:07:34,00:07:36,is that certain bits of the brain
00:07:36,00:07:38,"are compartmentalized to certain things,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"like music and so on, and emotions,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"and right-thinking, left-thinking, and all that."
00:07:42,00:07:43,- He didn't come up with that idea.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"So someone else had come up with that idea,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"and he thought, oh, well, what if I took that idea"
00:07:47,00:07:49,and then made the bump thing a thing?
00:07:49,00:07:51,"- Right, I could just see that."
00:07:51,00:07:51,"If I was around at that time,"
00:07:51,00:07:52,I definitely would have believed it.
00:07:52,00:07:54,It just sounds so obviously.
00:07:54,00:07:55,"- Yeah, well, obviously, yeah."
00:07:55,00:07:56,- I think you would have as well.
00:07:56,00:07:57,"- Yeah, you would."
00:07:57,00:07:58,"- I mean, it's just quite--"
00:07:58,00:07:59,- I think I wouldn't.
00:07:59,00:08:00,- It's very hard to put yourself in there.
00:08:00,00:08:03,"- My organ of credulousness is tiny, actually."
00:08:03,00:08:04,(laughing)
00:08:04,00:08:05,- Yeah.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"- Phrenology is basically astrology, isn't it?"
00:08:06,00:08:08,Or it was sort of a version of astrology
00:08:08,00:08:10,in that it seemed to tell people things
00:08:10,00:08:12,"that were vague enough that they could go,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"yeah, that sounds exactly like me."
00:08:14,00:08:15,- Barnum statements.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"- It mostly wasn't, the reports you got"
00:08:17,00:08:19,from a phrenologist were very rarely.
00:08:19,00:08:20,You're a wanker.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"It was always, oh, you've got a nice organ over there,"
00:08:22,00:08:23,"some organ there, and I don't think,"
00:08:23,00:08:25,"I don't think they've often said,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,"""You've got the organ of the killer."""
00:08:27,00:08:28,"- No, but they told everyone else."
00:08:28,00:08:30,"Actually, they did."
00:08:30,00:08:33,- But it was used to suggest that other races were lower.
00:08:33,00:08:35,It was used in a very racist sense.
00:08:35,00:08:36,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:36,00:08:37,- And people believed it.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"Yeah, eugenicists."
00:08:38,00:08:39,"- To be honest, it was mostly used"
00:08:39,00:08:41,to whatever your belief was.
00:08:41,00:08:42,- Yeah.
00:08:42,00:08:44,- It was used to kind of strengthen that.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"So for instance, there was a woman called Mrs. Hamilton."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"She was known as, she was from Ayrshire,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,and she would go around talking about phrenology.
00:08:51,00:08:54,But she said that because the bumps on a woman's head
00:08:54,00:08:57,"were generally the same as the bumps on a man's head,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,this proved that women had exactly the same
00:08:59,00:09:01,intellectual capacity as men's.
00:09:01,00:09:02,"And she went around saying,"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"""Yeah, well, you know, this proves feminism."""
00:09:05,00:09:06,"See, I knew it was bullshit,"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"but that is the nail in the coffin of phrenology there,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,isn't it?
00:09:09,00:09:10,(laughing)
00:09:10,00:09:11,What the hell's the odd about?
00:09:11,00:09:13,Alderman got phrenologized.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"John James Alderman, the big bird man,"
00:09:15,00:09:16,did all the bird sketches and stuff.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"And actually, he was huge."
00:09:17,00:09:18,- He wasn't a bird man.
00:09:18,00:09:19,He was a man who studied birds.
00:09:19,00:09:21,- He's a man who studied birds.
00:09:21,00:09:22,"- Easily, yeah."
00:09:22,00:09:24,- The naturalist who was sort of the leading authority
00:09:24,00:09:25,"on birds that time,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,and his books were beautiful drawings.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"And he wrote in his diary,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,"""I was astounded when I had my reading,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,'cause they said that I must be a strong and constant lover.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"An affectionate father,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,I would have made a great general
00:09:38,00:09:40,that I was extraordinarily generous.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"I know all these to be facts,"
00:09:42,00:09:44,"so I'm amazed that they discovered them."""
00:09:44,00:09:45,(laughing)
00:09:45,00:09:47,- I'm amazed at the person who you're paying
00:09:47,00:09:48,"to do your phrenology said,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"""Oh, it apparently says you're very generous."""
00:09:50,00:09:52,(laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:53,- Yeah.
00:09:53,00:09:56,- You guys remember Aaron Burr?
00:09:56,00:09:57,- Yeah.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"- Oh, Burr and Hamilton."
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Of musical fame.
00:10:00,00:10:00,- Vice President of America.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"- Well, Aaron Burr was cast."
00:10:02,00:10:04,"His head was cast, but after his death."
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Ah, okay."
00:10:05,00:10:07,- And they found that he had lots of secretiveness
00:10:07,00:10:08,and destructiveness.
00:10:08,00:10:10,- Did he die in the duel?
00:10:10,00:10:11,- No.
00:10:11,00:10:12,"- No, he lived, he survived the duel"
00:10:12,00:10:13,"and then ran away, I think."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"- Yeah, he died on his deathbed many, many years ago."
00:10:16,00:10:17,(laughing)
00:10:17,00:10:17,"- Oh, he died on his deathbed."
00:10:17,00:10:18,- That was such a mistake.
00:10:18,00:10:19,- He should never have gone there.
00:10:19,00:10:20,- He didn't die on the duel.
00:10:20,00:10:21,"- When you're in John Lewis,"
00:10:21,00:10:22,don't pick the deathbed.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"- Hi, I'm looking for a deathbed."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- Yeah, are you sure?"
00:10:26,00:10:27,(laughing)
00:10:27,00:10:29,"- Some celebrity fans, just quickly?"
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- Oh, yeah."
00:10:30,00:10:31,"- Oh, modern day ones?"
00:10:31,00:10:32,- No.
00:10:32,00:10:33,(laughing)
00:10:33,00:10:36,- Not Kim Kardashian or...
00:10:36,00:10:38,"- No, Arthur Conan Doyle?"
00:10:38,00:10:39,"- Yeah, of course."
00:10:39,00:10:43,"- I mean, Arthur Conan Doyle, absolutely everything."
00:10:43,00:10:44,- I wish I'd been friends with him.
00:10:44,00:10:45,The pranking you could have got
00:10:45,00:10:47,"down Arthur Conan Doyle, that's been epic."
00:10:47,00:10:49,(laughing)
00:10:49,00:10:51,"- Queen Victoria as well, and Prince Albert."
00:10:51,00:10:54,They had studies done by George Cuny.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"- How do you say, Andy?"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"When you say some celebrities,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,I thank God you're not bucking Celebrity Love Island.
00:10:59,00:11:00,(laughing)
00:11:00,00:11:03,"Well, I've got as Queen Victoria and..."
00:11:03,00:11:04,- You'd want to see it.
00:11:04,00:11:06,- You'd want to see it.
00:11:06,00:11:06,- Dead.
00:11:06,00:11:08,(laughing)
00:11:08,00:11:09,- Was there a deathbed in there?
00:11:09,00:11:10,(laughing)
00:11:10,00:11:12,"- Shit, love the deathbed."
00:11:12,00:11:15,"Anyway, they appointed him."
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Barack Obama?
00:11:16,00:11:18,"- Oh, find someone living for I don't see."
00:11:18,00:11:20,"- End that sentence, James."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"- Yeah, sorry, he's into..."
00:11:22,00:11:23,"- No, no, you don't let me finish my sentence."
00:11:23,00:11:24,"- Oh, sorry, okay."
00:11:24,00:11:26,- Barack Obama is a subject
00:11:26,00:11:28,of an incredibly weird book
00:11:28,00:11:31,called The Phrenology of Barack Obama.
00:11:31,00:11:32,It's a self-published book.
00:11:32,00:11:33,- No.
00:11:33,00:11:35,- By a guy called Bensa Magos.
00:11:35,00:11:39,And apparently he looked at a mysterious headscar
00:11:39,00:11:43,on Obama's head that the mass media refuses to discuss.
00:11:43,00:11:45,(laughing)
00:11:45,00:11:46,"And according to him,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,this is evidence that Obama once had a horn
00:11:49,00:11:54,and leads ultimately to the satanic endgame revealed
00:11:54,00:11:56,by the demon horn of Mollock.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"- Oh, okay."
00:11:58,00:11:58,- So...
00:11:58,00:12:01,- I can't believe the Guardian isn't reporting on this.
00:12:01,00:12:03,- That's outrageous.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- It feels like he's missed the boat
00:12:04,00:12:06,'cause he just served two terms
00:12:06,00:12:08,and then left office in an orderly fashion.
00:12:08,00:12:08,- What a taste.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"- Like, what's Mollock's endgame here?"
00:12:10,00:12:12,(laughing)
00:12:12,00:12:14,"- Maybe it took a while to find a publisher, who knows?"
00:12:14,00:12:17,(laughing)
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Wow.
00:12:18,00:12:19,"- I'm definitely buying it, by the way."
00:12:19,00:12:20,(laughing)
00:12:20,00:12:21,- Sounds awesome.
00:12:21,00:12:24,"- Yeah, this guy, Coom,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,just going back to the casting of True Celebrities.
00:12:27,00:12:29,He did very famous people.
00:12:29,00:12:30,He did Prince Albert's head.
00:12:30,00:12:31,So George Eliot was having her head done
00:12:31,00:12:33,by the guy that did Prince Albert.
00:12:33,00:12:35,He did William Blake as well.
00:12:35,00:12:36,- Ooh.
00:12:36,00:12:37,"- Or rather, he studied,"
00:12:37,00:12:39,it was someone else who Coom didn't do it.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"It was the, there was a different person, wasn't it?"
00:12:41,00:12:42,"Yeah, James DeVille."
00:12:42,00:12:44,But where are these casts?
00:12:44,00:12:47,Where's George Eliot's head?
00:12:47,00:12:51,"- This room, actually, is inside of the cast."
00:12:51,00:12:52,- They used it to the Statue of Liberty.
00:12:52,00:12:55,(laughing)
00:12:55,00:12:56,- Such a good ending for the movie.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"- What a movie, for the phrenology movie."
00:12:58,00:13:00,"It's like, they never knew where it was."
00:13:00,00:13:01,Whip pan out to New York.
00:13:01,00:13:02,- And then just winks.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"- Yes, yes."
00:13:03,00:13:05,Mount Rushmore.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Pour their hands.
00:13:06,00:13:08,- Gives a little thumbs up with his massive hand.
00:13:08,00:13:10,(laughing)
00:13:10,00:13:13,(upbeat music)
00:13:13,00:13:17,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,and that is Anna.
00:13:19,00:13:21,- My fact this week is that the chef
00:13:21,00:13:23,who cooked for Lord's Cricketers on match days
00:13:23,00:13:27,for 35 years was once asked to limit their meals
00:13:27,00:13:30,"to five courses, and she refused."
00:13:30,00:13:32,(laughing)
00:13:32,00:13:34,"So this was a woman called Nancy Doyle,"
00:13:34,00:13:37,"and she, yeah, she was the tea lady at Lord's"
00:13:37,00:13:41,"for 35 years, until 1996, I think she retired."
00:13:41,00:13:44,"And she liked to make them large, large meals."
00:13:44,00:13:47,"So obviously in cricket, you've got meals codified,"
00:13:47,00:13:49,and you have to take your lunch break.
00:13:49,00:13:50,It's in the rules.
00:13:50,00:13:52,- It's so amazing that they're actually
00:13:52,00:13:54,"in the rules of cricket, it says,"
00:13:54,00:13:56,"""Unless the umpires and captains together"
00:13:56,00:14:01,"""agreter alter it, lunch shall be taken at the agreed time."""
00:14:01,00:14:03,It's actually in the rules that you have to have lunch.
00:14:03,00:14:04,- And the captains of each team decide
00:14:04,00:14:06,"on what time lunch is happening,"
00:14:06,00:14:07,"how long or-- - And the umpire, yeah."
00:14:07,00:14:11,"- I mean, what other sport has a conversation like that"
00:14:11,00:14:12,when you're about to flick the coin
00:14:12,00:14:14,"for who bats first or whatever, you know?"
00:14:14,00:14:15,"By the way, what time--"
00:14:15,00:14:16,- When are we having lunch?
00:14:16,00:14:17,(laughing)
00:14:17,00:14:18,- What are we having?
00:14:18,00:14:19,"Well, we're having a roast today."
00:14:19,00:14:20,(laughing)
00:14:20,00:14:22,"- How are we, you guys?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,- So Mrs. Doyle.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"- Mrs. Doyle, she, well, her typical menu,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"it seemed to be, for lunch you'd have soup,"
00:14:28,00:14:31,"then a starter, then a roast."
00:14:31,00:14:32,(laughing)
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Well, you've got to, 'cause you've got to moisten"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"your palate, I suppose. - Absolutely, yeah."
00:14:35,00:14:38,"- Then a starter, then roast meat and potatoes."
00:14:38,00:14:41,And she also served chips and vegetables.
00:14:41,00:14:42,It's quite hard to know.
00:14:42,00:14:43,This was just on an example list
00:14:43,00:14:45,that I think Mike Brealy gave of what she'd serve up.
00:14:45,00:14:49,"Chips and vegetables, then a dessert, then a cheese board."
00:14:49,00:14:50,Then you get back onto plate.
00:14:50,00:14:52,"But of course, in cricket, every two hours,"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"'cause although they decide when you have meals,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,it's pretty much every two hours is the general rules.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Roughly, for when you eat."
00:14:57,00:14:59,"So two hours later, you get back in,"
00:14:59,00:15:00,and she's made you a huge cake.
00:15:00,00:15:01,(laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:02,And there you go.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"So there was this moment where Mike Brealy said,"
00:15:04,00:15:05,in the '70s-- - It's Mike Brealy who was--
00:15:05,00:15:07,- Mike Brealy was the England captain at the time.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"He said to her, ""Do you know what?"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"""I don't know if it's good for the game."
00:15:11,00:15:14,"""The guys can't stand up after lunch."""
00:15:14,00:15:17,"And she replied, so she, you know, he was like,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"""Could we possibly make the meals a bit lighter?"""
00:15:19,00:15:22,"And she said, ""But in an Irish accent,"
00:15:22,00:15:25,"""tell you what, Michael, I won't tell you how to feckin' bat"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"""and you don't tell me how to feckin' cook, okay?"""
00:15:27,00:15:28,"- Amazing, wow."
00:15:28,00:15:30,"- And that was it, and she was apparently terrifying."
00:15:30,00:15:32,"Someone called her a small yet volcanic,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,so I think he didn't ask again.
00:15:34,00:15:36,- She also couldn't cook.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"I mean, it's in the case-- (laughing)"
00:15:38,00:15:39,"No, it's not one of her whatsoever,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,but she said she'd never read a cookbook.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"She didn't use weighing scales,"
00:15:42,00:15:43,and she didn't follow recipes.
00:15:43,00:15:46,- But that shows having a natural affinity to cooking.
00:15:46,00:15:48,- Her organ of cooking was absolutely massive.
00:15:48,00:15:49,(laughing)
00:15:49,00:15:51,"- She's taught by nuns, wasn't she?"
00:15:51,00:15:52,"Like, she did get taught, yeah."
00:15:52,00:15:53,She just didn't--
00:15:53,00:15:54,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:54,00:15:56,- I think being able to cook without a recipe is--
00:15:56,00:15:58,"- No, that is the mark of quality."
00:15:58,00:16:00,I found a bit of a scandal researching this fact.
00:16:00,00:16:01,"- Oh yeah, okay."
00:16:01,00:16:06,- I thought tea in cricket was the most English thing.
00:16:06,00:16:07,- Right.
00:16:07,00:16:09,"- It's not English, it's Australian."
00:16:09,00:16:10,- No.
00:16:10,00:16:11,- It was introduced by Australia.
00:16:11,00:16:12,It was imported.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"Australia started doing this in about the 1880s,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,and then a captain called Joe Darling
00:16:18,00:16:19,brought it over--
00:16:19,00:16:20,- T Darling?
00:16:20,00:16:23,- The T Darling in 1899.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"But even then, it was brought onto the field."
00:16:25,00:16:27,"So, like, they would bring you a cup of tea"
00:16:27,00:16:31,"where you stood, and there were photos of England players"
00:16:31,00:16:33,"just standing around with waitresses,"
00:16:33,00:16:36,"you know, just bringing them a tea trolley, basically."
00:16:36,00:16:38,And it wasn't standard until about 1905
00:16:38,00:16:40,"that players went off and had their tea,"
00:16:40,00:16:41,so it was an Aussie thing.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- Very cool.
00:16:42,00:16:43,- I don't know about that.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"- You were saying about how Nancy can't cook, Andy."
00:16:46,00:16:48,She can't cook curries.
00:16:48,00:16:49,That is one thing.
00:16:49,00:16:51,- She can't cook anything anymore 'cause she is dead.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"- Yes, sorry."
00:16:52,00:16:53,- She can't cook curries.
00:16:53,00:16:54,- Death bed bed?
00:16:54,00:16:55,"It was a, what kind of death bed?"
00:16:55,00:16:56,"- It was a death bed thing, yeah."
00:16:56,00:16:59,"Another cause of death, death bed."
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- No, she couldn't cook curries, I should have said."
00:17:01,00:17:04,"Because during tests, when England's playing"
00:17:04,00:17:06,"people like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,"
00:17:06,00:17:09,"they want to have food which they had at home,"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"and so they want to have curries,"
00:17:11,00:17:12,"and she couldn't cook them,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"and so she brought her daughter, Jeanette,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,"and Jeanette, who was a nurse,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"was apparently a brilliant curry maker,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,so she would come in and make the curries.
00:17:19,00:17:20,- I love that.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"- Just get professional cooks, guys."
00:17:22,00:17:23,It's so weird.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"- No, no, no."
00:17:24,00:17:24,- Professional cook.
00:17:24,00:17:25,She was a nurse.
00:17:25,00:17:30,- Get a nurse who might have left some really ill people
00:17:30,00:17:31,to die.
00:17:31,00:17:34,"- I'm just gonna leave these death beds, I'll be fine."
00:17:34,00:17:38,Curries have been a problem in the past
00:17:38,00:17:42,"for English cricketers, so when they do big tours"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"of India and Pakistan, and in the '70s and '80s,"
00:17:44,00:17:46,"when curry was less common here,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,"and people weren't used to eating it,"
00:17:48,00:17:50,"a lot of the players found it quite difficult,"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"and Alex Stewart, in fact, who was a player in the '80s,"
00:17:54,00:17:56,"said that he, basically, before they were doing"
00:17:56,00:17:59,"a tour of India, him and Jack Russell,"
00:17:59,00:18:00,"who, well, I hadn't heard of Jack Russell,"
00:18:00,00:18:03,"but they couldn't hack the Indian food,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"and so before they'd fly out to Pakistan,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,"they said they'd do a trip to Tesco,"
00:18:07,00:18:08,"and they'd just buy,"
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Alec would buy 43 chicken breasts,"
00:18:10,00:18:11,"43 days worth of mashed potatoes,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,"and 43 days worth of broccoli,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,"and every day he'd just make himself chicken breasts,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"broccoli, mashed potatoes."
00:18:18,00:18:19,- Did he say it'd go into India?
00:18:19,00:18:21,- Yeah. - Quite a hot country.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"Are these chicken breasts refrigerated,"
00:18:22,00:18:24,or are they just loose in his case?
00:18:24,00:18:27,- That is horrible.
00:18:27,00:18:30,It just went into the separating chicken case.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"- Look, I think they probably"
00:18:31,00:18:33,had some kind of refrigeration technology.
00:18:33,00:18:35,"- I don't know if we ever mentioned this on the podcast,"
00:18:35,00:18:38,that when the Beatles went to India
00:18:38,00:18:40,"to see the Maharaja, no, not the Maharaja,"
00:18:40,00:18:41,"the Guru, wasn't it? - The Guru, yeah."
00:18:41,00:18:42,"- They went to see their Guru,"
00:18:42,00:18:45,who was gonna teach them transcendental meditation
00:18:45,00:18:47,and how to free their minds and all of this.
00:18:47,00:18:49,And Ringo Starr took a suitcase of baked beans.
00:18:49,00:18:51,- Yeah. - Did we say that?
00:18:51,00:18:52,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Great, great, great."
00:18:52,00:18:53,"- Well, that's 'cause he had digestion problems"
00:18:53,00:18:55,from childhood when he was hospitalized
00:18:55,00:18:56,and nearly died in hospital.
00:18:56,00:18:58,- Wow. - Whoa.
00:18:58,00:18:59,- Just getting the facts in.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"- Whereas Alex Stewart was just being a bit of a fool,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,"which in fact, Atherton wrote in his autobiography,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,and I feel like this might cause some tension
00:19:06,00:19:07,with your teammate.
00:19:07,00:19:10,"So Atherton was in captain work, played with Stewart,"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"said, ""Alex Stewart has a narrow focus on sport and life."
00:19:14,00:19:17,"I do wonder,"" and he said this of his meal choices in India,"
00:19:17,00:19:19,"""I do wonder whether he'll look back with regret"
00:19:19,00:19:20,at some of the missed opportunities
00:19:20,00:19:23,"that touring life offers."" - Wow."
00:19:23,00:19:25,- But you could say the same about me when we go on tour.
00:19:25,00:19:27,- That's true. - And I'm sure you all three do.
00:19:27,00:19:29,"I don't hear you, though, because it's after 9 p.m."
00:19:29,00:19:30,and I'm in bed.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- You do have a lot of courses on your breakfast,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,"everyone, don't you? - Oh my God, yes you do."
00:19:34,00:19:35,"- That's true, but I have brought them all from home"
00:19:35,00:19:36,and I've stopped them in the suitcase.
00:19:36,00:19:39,I've just brought 350 waffles.
00:19:39,00:19:41,- I went to a cricket match once
00:19:41,00:19:44,and it was sponsored by Sauri Maltloaf.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"- Oh, lovely. - Yeah, delicious."
00:19:45,00:19:46,- And so there was a guy there
00:19:46,00:19:50,and he was handing out free bits of Maltloaf to everyone.
00:19:50,00:19:51,But no one really likes Maltloaf
00:19:51,00:19:55,and everyone likes beer watching like a shirt cricket.
00:19:55,00:19:57,And so everyone just started throwing Maltloaf at him.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- Oh my God.
00:19:58,00:20:00,- And he refused to give any more Maltloaf to anyone
00:20:00,00:20:01,and everyone got really upset
00:20:01,00:20:03,because they wouldn't give him any Maltloaf.
00:20:03,00:20:04,- But how come they only wanted it
00:20:04,00:20:06,to throw at the guy and hang it up?
00:20:06,00:20:09,"If he removes himself, the loop closes."
00:20:09,00:20:10,"- Well, he did exactly the right thing"
00:20:10,00:20:12,as far as I'm concerned.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"But the 20,000 people in Old Trafford"
00:20:13,00:20:15,did not see it the same way.
00:20:15,00:20:16,- I love Maltloaf.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"I'd have been, I'd have been grubbing around"
00:20:19,00:20:23,drinking it up with my big net standing near him.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- What is it?
00:20:24,00:20:25,I don't think I've had it.
00:20:25,00:20:25,- It's absolutely delicious.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"We're not sponsored this week by Maltloaf,"
00:20:27,00:20:31,"but I do really, sorry, if you're listening."
00:20:31,00:20:33,"It's a kind of fruity bread, basically."
00:20:33,00:20:36,"- Yeah, it's very delicious."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"- Although I think any beer drinker worth his salt,"
00:20:38,00:20:39,"if he loves beer that much,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,can turn a Maltloaf into a beer.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"It's got malt in it, surely."
00:20:43,00:20:44,- You blend that.
00:20:44,00:20:46,- And a cricket match over five days.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Eventually it's gonna ferment.
00:20:47,00:20:48,- Exactly.
00:20:48,00:20:52,Just on a sort of eating and drinking in cricket
00:20:52,00:20:54,"and drinking specifically,"
00:20:54,00:20:55,"there's a guy, a cricket called Gary Sobers,"
00:20:55,00:20:56,and I want you to remember that.
00:20:56,00:20:58,"- Oh, I see why we're going here."
00:20:58,00:20:59,- That's where the work out
00:20:59,00:21:00,which road you're gonna go down now.
00:21:00,00:21:02,- Almost a sentence person.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"- You need up to be, he's my son."
00:21:04,00:21:06,"- Yeah, if he married, if he married in double barrel"
00:21:06,00:21:07,with Helen up.
00:21:07,00:21:08,- Yeah.
00:21:08,00:21:10,(laughing)
00:21:10,00:21:11,"Anyway, Gary Sobers,"
00:21:11,00:21:14,he batted his last century while drunk.
00:21:14,00:21:17,- And not even just a bit tipsy.
00:21:17,00:21:19,This sounds like a mad experience.
00:21:19,00:21:20,So he was playing at Lord's.
00:21:20,00:21:21,He played for the West Indies
00:21:21,00:21:24,and he'd been out clubbing until nine in the morning.
00:21:24,00:21:25,(laughing)
00:21:25,00:21:26,And he was batting that day
00:21:26,00:21:27,and he was going straight into bat.
00:21:27,00:21:28,So he got in at nine.
00:21:28,00:21:29,He's completely hammered
00:21:29,00:21:32,"and drank, solidly drinking for, you know, 12 hours straight."
00:21:32,00:21:33,He batted amazingly well.
00:21:33,00:21:37,"He hit 132, extraordinary."
00:21:37,00:21:38,But then begged to be taken off
00:21:38,00:21:41,'cause he said suddenly he sort of started to sober up.
00:21:41,00:21:41,- He started to come down.
00:21:41,00:21:43,- Solidly up to the name of the come down
00:21:43,00:21:44,and the sobering up and the hangover.
00:21:44,00:21:47,So he was taken off with a stomach complaint
00:21:47,00:21:49,after batting 132.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"And then he was brought off,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,but felt quite bad about it.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"And so ended up being apparently,"
00:21:54,00:21:55,"according to him, revived"
00:21:55,00:21:57,for the couple of large port and brandies.
00:21:57,00:21:58,- Oh my God.
00:21:58,00:21:59,- I didn't know.
00:21:59,00:22:00,- Port and brandy.
00:22:00,00:22:01,I've not heard of that as a drink.
00:22:01,00:22:02,- No.
00:22:02,00:22:04,- It's not like a very old fashioned Jagerbomb basically.
00:22:04,00:22:04,(laughing)
00:22:04,00:22:06,- I think that was what it was.
00:22:06,00:22:06,- Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:08,- Can you come back onto cricket?
00:22:08,00:22:09,I thought once you got off the--
00:22:09,00:22:10,- That's sick.
00:22:10,00:22:11,- Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:12,"- Oh, okay."
00:22:12,00:22:13,- I didn't know that.
00:22:13,00:22:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:22:13,00:22:14,- So he returned.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"He returned to hit 150, not out,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,and then the England retired.
00:22:19,00:22:20,- Wow.
00:22:20,00:22:22,- What if the drinking still goes up?
00:22:22,00:22:24,"W.G. Grace, for example."
00:22:24,00:22:27,So he was around in the late 1800s.
00:22:27,00:22:29,His choice of drink during matches
00:22:29,00:22:31,"was if he was coming off,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,he would drink champagne during the match
00:22:33,00:22:34,all the way through.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"And at lunch, he would have whiskey as his choice of drink."
00:22:36,00:22:38,So he was bladded the whole time
00:22:38,00:22:40,that he was playing.
00:22:40,00:22:43,"Or, you know, comfortably marry as opposed to drunk."
00:22:43,00:22:45,I wonder if that still happens.
00:22:45,00:22:45,- Of course it doesn't.
00:22:45,00:22:47,And I think this is one of the great tragedies
00:22:47,00:22:49,"of all sports, 'cause of course it doesn't,"
00:22:49,00:22:50,'cause they've all changed in the last 30 years
00:22:50,00:22:52,so dramatically.
00:22:52,00:22:55,"Like anything you watch, tennis, football, cricket."
00:22:55,00:22:56,- None of them are pissed.
00:22:56,00:22:57,(laughing)
00:22:57,00:22:57,- It's ridiculous.
00:22:57,00:23:01,- It's so cold sober and they're eating these crazy diets.
00:23:01,00:23:03,I think there should be a rule that says
00:23:03,00:23:05,no professional sportspeople are allowed to eat anything
00:23:05,00:23:07,outside of what they would normally eat or drink.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"And then you just have to play like that,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,which is basically how they did it
00:23:10,00:23:11,"until the 70s or 80s, isn't it?"
00:23:11,00:23:13,- Agassi won quite seminal match in his career
00:23:13,00:23:16,with a giant hangover from the night before.
00:23:16,00:23:18,And he played so well with the hangover
00:23:18,00:23:19,"that he did think, am I gonna have to do this"
00:23:19,00:23:21,for every match?
00:23:21,00:23:22,- Wow.
00:23:22,00:23:22,- This is so good.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"- And it's kind of like, what's the chop?"
00:23:25,00:23:26,The same bolt.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"Who, at the Beijing Olympics, I think, 2008,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,he pretty much only had chicken nuggets.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"- Yeah, 'cause I didn't think he trusted"
00:23:33,00:23:35,the local cuisine to the rest of the thing.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- He brought them all.
00:23:36,00:23:40,He brought 43 days work and they were pretty off by the end.
00:23:40,00:23:44,- There are two cricketers for India
00:23:44,00:23:47,called Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kisham.
00:23:47,00:23:51,"And when they get together, they just eat any old crap."
00:23:51,00:23:55,"And apparently their favorite thing is they get a bun,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,"they put some chocolate ice cream on the bread,"
00:23:57,00:24:00,"and then they put Nando sauce on top of that,"
00:24:00,00:24:04,"and then they put a piece of chicken on top of that,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"and they eat it, and they reckon if you eat that,"
00:24:06,00:24:09,it guarantees you're gonna score runs the next day.
00:24:09,00:24:10,- Right. - Wow.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"- Has anyone put it to a scientific testing,"
00:24:12,00:24:13,rigorous testing process?
00:24:13,00:24:15,"- These are great cricketers, you know?"
00:24:15,00:24:16,"- Okay, yeah."
00:24:16,00:24:17,- It's two of the best in the world.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"- Yeah, Ash, they're doing what you want, Anna."
00:24:19,00:24:22,They're just combining all the unhealthy foods into one meal.
00:24:22,00:24:25,"- Like, I'm very hard to please, yeah, yeah."
00:24:25,00:24:26,Get on them.
00:24:26,00:24:28,- But Sri Lankan cricketers have been banned
00:24:28,00:24:31,"from eating biscuits this a few years ago, actually."
00:24:31,00:24:34,"But they were losing games,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"and the government decided to get involved,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,and the Sri Lankan government gave them an ultimatum
00:24:39,00:24:40,"and said, ""Start winning matches,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,"""or we're gonna get rid of your biscuits."""
00:24:42,00:24:46,"And they didn't win matches, and they lost their biscuits."
00:24:46,00:24:47,- No.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"- And Lassith Malinga, who's a really famous bowler,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,he talked about the comments of the sports minister
00:24:52,00:24:54,"and said, ""What does a monkey know"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"""about a parrot's nesting hollow?"""
00:24:56,00:24:59,- What an amazing burn.
00:24:59,00:25:01,- Is that so? - That's a sick bit of sledging.
00:25:01,00:25:04,- I just love the idea of one of them going into a shop
00:25:04,00:25:05,"trying to buy some biscuits,"
00:25:05,00:25:07,and the shopkeeper looking under the counter
00:25:07,00:25:10,where the entire squad's photos are up.
00:25:10,00:25:13,"- To be honest, if Lassith Malinga is very clear"
00:25:13,00:25:14,"what he looks like, he's..."
00:25:14,00:25:16,"- Okay, he's distinctive looking."
00:25:16,00:25:17,- Very distinctive.
00:25:17,00:25:20,There's no way he got a biscuit in the whole country.
00:25:20,00:25:22,(laughing)
00:25:22,00:25:24,"- Loaturing outside a shop asking for a 10-year-old,"
00:25:24,00:25:25,"""What do I mean?"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"""Couldn't get me some garibaldies, could you please?"""
00:25:27,00:25:29,(laughing)
00:25:29,00:25:32,(upbeat music)
00:25:32,00:25:37,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,and that is Andy.
00:25:39,00:25:40,- My fact is that Northern Ireland
00:25:40,00:25:44,contains the world's only upside-down lighthouse.
00:25:44,00:25:45,(laughing)
00:25:45,00:25:47,- How soon was that an architectural cock up?
00:25:47,00:25:50,- Or maybe to scare moles away from the...
00:25:50,00:25:54,"- Exactly, a massive mole problem, aquatic moles,"
00:25:54,00:25:57,"and no, it is so weird, 'cause genuinely,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,"it's not just a low, it's got a tower,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,but the tower is above the light.
00:26:01,00:26:04,- But it's just for anyone who's picturing in their head
00:26:04,00:26:06,a lighthouse that's been flipped upside down.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"It's unfortunately not at all like that,"
00:26:09,00:26:10,it is in no way that...
00:26:10,00:26:11,"- I'm sorry, it is exactly that."
00:26:11,00:26:13,"- Andy, explain exactly what it is."
00:26:13,00:26:15,We'll see if it's exactly what Dan thinks it is.
00:26:15,00:26:17,"- It's on an island called Rathland,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"which is off the coast of Northern Ireland,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,and the lighthouse was built into the cliff face
00:26:22,00:26:24,"at the island's edge, and they wanted a lighthouse"
00:26:24,00:26:27,"'cause they wanted to warn shipping about the island,"
00:26:27,00:26:28,"and its presence, but the problem is,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,the island is often covered in fog.
00:26:30,00:26:34,"It's covered in fog, so if you were to have the lighthouse"
00:26:34,00:26:35,"installed on the cliffs at the bottom of the cliffs,"
00:26:35,00:26:37,"and the light up at the top of the cliffs,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,the light would be lost in the fog.
00:26:39,00:26:43,"So they built the tower, which is where all the supplies"
00:26:43,00:26:45,"are kept, and the stalls, and the spare lenses"
00:26:45,00:26:46,"for the light bulb, and all of this stuff,"
00:26:46,00:26:49,"but the actual light itself is at the bottom of the cliffs,"
00:26:49,00:26:51,and that's the thing that means it can be seen more.
00:26:51,00:26:53,"- So it's like they've sliced the top off a lighthouse,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,and then put it down in front of the rest of the lighthouse.
00:26:56,00:26:57,- Exactly.
00:26:57,00:26:59,- Or have they put it all in reverse order?
00:26:59,00:27:02,"- No, you have to climb down the stairs,"
00:27:02,00:27:05,"upside down, together, yeah."
00:27:05,00:27:06,"- Yeah, so it's sort of a little,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,"it's sitting in front of the tower,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,it's not directly underneath the tower.
00:27:10,00:27:11,"- So it's a lighthouse, and the bulb is at the bottom,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"not at the top, it's an upside down lighthouse."
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- So it's not like in the daytime,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,it makes a dark area.
00:27:17,00:27:19,(laughing)
00:27:19,00:27:21,- That's an inside out lighthouse.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"- Yeah, that's okay, sorry, yeah."
00:27:23,00:27:24,I always go the next step.
00:27:24,00:27:27,And it's just a very cool thing.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"And it was built in about 1912, I think,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,so it's 110 years old now.
00:27:33,00:27:35,"And also, I read this about Rathland Island,"
00:27:35,00:27:36,"I can't, I don't know if it's true,"
00:27:36,00:27:39,that it's the island where Robert the Bruce went
00:27:39,00:27:42,"after a battle, and it's where he saw the useless spider."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"- That is true, well, the fact that,"
00:27:44,00:27:45,"whether that happened or not,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"it's definitely said to have happened on Rathland,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,said to have happened in a cave
00:27:49,00:27:53,"underneath the lighthouse, but not that lighthouse."
00:27:53,00:27:55,(laughing)
00:27:55,00:27:57,"- There's an east lighthouse and a west lighthouse,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,and the Robert the Bruce one is the other one.
00:27:59,00:28:00,"- Okay, okay."
00:28:00,00:28:03,"- So the story is, isn't it that he was in a,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,"yeah, a Scottish guy, he's gone away"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"from where the battles are, he's sat down,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"he's worried, there's a spider there,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"the spider keeps trying to make a web,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,"keeps trying to jump over, keeps failing,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,"and eventually he makes it and he thinks,"
00:28:15,00:28:18,"if at first you don't see, try, try again,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,and he goes back and gets dashed on the rocks
00:28:20,00:28:23,"because of this useless lighthouse,"
00:28:23,00:28:26,the lights at the bottom.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"They also have fog bells sometimes, lighthouses,"
00:28:28,00:28:31,"'cause it is a problem, a lot,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"that you can't see a lighthouse if it's obscured by fog,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,"and it sounds like they haven't really cracked it,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,"so they have bells, which A is a lighthouse keeper,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"I suppose, or you had to in the olden days"
00:28:39,00:28:40,"before everything was automated,"
00:28:40,00:28:43,"you had to just ring them kind of constantly,"
00:28:43,00:28:46,so I think you'd ring them about two rings
00:28:46,00:28:49,every 15 seconds in fog to let ships know
00:28:49,00:28:52,"that you were there, and it only traveled about 100 meters,"
00:28:52,00:28:53,so I think the light from whitehouses
00:28:53,00:28:55,"can travel many, many kilometers, can't it?"
00:28:55,00:28:57,"Seven, eight, nine, more than that, kilometers,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"but it couldn't travel that far,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,"and you could wind them up the bells,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"so you'd wind them up really, really, really far,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"and then it could, as it unwound, like a clock,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"it could do 10,000 strikes."
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- Wow, cool. - That's awesome, man."
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- Yeah, the Rathland Island fog signal"
00:29:11,00:29:13,can be heard 20 miles away.
00:29:13,00:29:14,- So they've got an audio signal as well?
00:29:14,00:29:17,"- Yeah, yeah, they have a fog signal too, yeah, yeah."
00:29:17,00:29:20,"It's pretty cool, they're very cool places, lighthouses."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"You know the beautiful lighthouse lens that you see,"
00:29:22,00:29:23,"which looks almost like a chandelier,"
00:29:23,00:29:27,"it's got loads of cut faces, and sides, and edges,"
00:29:27,00:29:28,"and it's incredibly complicated,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"and it looks, you know, it's not just a big lamp."
00:29:30,00:29:32,That is the creation of a guy called
00:29:32,00:29:35,"Augustin Jean Fresnel, who was, by the way,"
00:29:35,00:29:38,the one who realized that light is a transverse wave.
00:29:38,00:29:41,"Big deal guy. - Or is it, though?"
00:29:41,00:29:42,"- Oh, okay. - So that's just"
00:29:42,00:29:43,a whole separate base. - I don't think
00:29:43,00:29:45,"we've got time to get into that, yeah, you're right."
00:29:45,00:29:48,"- But basically, the lenses would have been incredibly heavy"
00:29:48,00:29:49,if you just made a single lens.
00:29:49,00:29:52,"So he created this clever lens, which can be much thinner,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,"but it has dozens of prisms, and they all focus the light,"
00:29:55,00:29:59,so you do get a beam using much less glass.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"But the really cool thing about those heavy,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"great lenses at the top, is they were created to float."
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- Mercury. - And they float,"
00:30:06,00:30:09,"oh, mercury, they float in this mercury bath,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"and it's so cool, 'cause mercury's so dense,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"it's 14 times denser than water,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,"and if you drop a lump of solid steel into mercury,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,"it will float, and float really high up in it."
00:30:19,00:30:22,And so the whole lighthouse top was just floating
00:30:22,00:30:24,on this gruel. - Seems quite dangerous.
00:30:24,00:30:26,- So dangerous. - Yeah.
00:30:26,00:30:29,"- Don't call it a bath, if you're in that house with kids,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,they'll try and bath in that as well.
00:30:31,00:30:35,- What do you think the US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper
00:30:35,00:30:39,has in common with the English female cricketer
00:30:39,00:30:42,who has the highest ever score in the test match?
00:30:42,00:30:43,- Long arms.
00:30:43,00:30:46,(laughing)
00:30:46,00:30:48,"- Yeah, so she could change the light bulb."
00:30:48,00:30:51,"- Change the bulb, how many lighthouse keepers does it take?"
00:30:51,00:30:53,"Yeah, without going upstairs, yeah."
00:30:53,00:30:56,"- Obviously as a cricketer, it's good to have long arms,"
00:30:56,00:30:56,"don't you? - You need long arms, don't you?"
00:30:56,00:30:57,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's not that though."
00:30:57,00:30:58,- I think-- - What are they having?
00:30:58,00:30:59,"Okay, what are they having?"
00:30:59,00:31:03,"Wait, wait, the US only lighthouse keeper on the--"
00:31:03,00:31:05,- The US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper.
00:31:05,00:31:07,- I would guess you're not gonna guess it.
00:31:07,00:31:08,"If it's the answer, I think,"
00:31:08,00:31:09,"I reckon you're not gonna guess it,"
00:31:09,00:31:11,unless you know we're on both of them.
00:31:11,00:31:12,"- So this could be one of those long games,"
00:31:12,00:31:15,"like the other day, what was it the other day we had?"
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- Oh my god, which artist?"
00:31:16,00:31:18,- Bloody stained glass arches game again.
00:31:18,00:31:20,- This is gonna last us way longer than that.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- Red and white. - Red and white.
00:31:21,00:31:23,- She doesn't live in a lighthouse.
00:31:23,00:31:23,- She does live in a lighthouse.
00:31:23,00:31:25,- Red and white. - But she lives in a lighthouse.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"- But actually, we don't know that too."
00:31:26,00:31:27,Do you know where she lives?
00:31:27,00:31:29,"- Hang on, hang on, I do know this."
00:31:29,00:31:31,"Okay, cricketers wear white, don't they?"
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- Oh, yeah."
00:31:32,00:31:34,- And the ball is red.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"Now, what are the typical colors of a lighthouse?"
00:31:36,00:31:37,They're red and white.
00:31:37,00:31:39,"- Okay, so take that knowledge."
00:31:39,00:31:40,- Yeah.
00:31:40,00:31:41,- And forget about it.
00:31:41,00:31:43,(laughing)
00:31:43,00:31:44,I try to think of something else.
00:31:44,00:31:47,"- Okay, the Coast Guard surname is Lighthouse"
00:31:47,00:31:49,and her surname is Coast Guard.
00:31:49,00:31:51,- You're so close.
00:31:51,00:31:52,They have very similar surnames.
00:31:52,00:31:53,- Okay.
00:31:53,00:31:54,- Think of something that's white.
00:31:54,00:31:56,Something else that's white.
00:31:56,00:31:57,- You know the answer?
00:31:57,00:31:57,- You know the answer?
00:31:57,00:31:58,- Yeah.
00:31:58,00:31:59,"- Cocaine, they're both called cocaine."
00:31:59,00:32:00,Jessica Cocaine.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:32:01,00:32:03,The US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper
00:32:03,00:32:07,is called Sally Snowman and the highest score ever
00:32:07,00:32:09,by an English female cricketer in a test match
00:32:09,00:32:10,was by Betty Snowball.
00:32:10,00:32:11,(laughing)
00:32:11,00:32:12,- Oh my God.
00:32:12,00:32:14,So it's not even something they've got in common.
00:32:14,00:32:16,It's just something quite similar.
00:32:16,00:32:16,- We've got the word snow.
00:32:16,00:32:18,(laughing)
00:32:18,00:32:19,- Oh my God.
00:32:19,00:32:19,- I did.
00:32:19,00:32:20,I'd count that.
00:32:20,00:32:21,(laughing)
00:32:21,00:32:22,- That's a real fair question.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- That's a million dollar question.
00:32:23,00:32:24,(laughing)
00:32:24,00:32:26,"That's like, who would know that?"
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- James, what can my phone a friend be, James?"
00:32:28,00:32:29,(laughing)
00:32:29,00:32:30,"- I'm there going, option B please."
00:32:30,00:32:32,Red and white is the thing that links them.
00:32:32,00:32:35,(laughing)
00:32:35,00:32:37,- She's about to retire Sally Snowman.
00:32:37,00:32:38,- Has she?
00:32:38,00:32:38,"- Yeah, last year I think."
00:32:38,00:32:39,"- Which one, she, the coast guard?"
00:32:39,00:32:40,- The lighthouse keeper.
00:32:40,00:32:41,- Right.
00:32:41,00:32:42,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:42,00:32:43,- No more walking in the air for her.
00:32:43,00:32:45,(laughing)
00:32:45,00:32:46,'Cause when you're at the top of the lighthouse
00:32:46,00:32:48,it must feel like you're floating in the moonlit sky.
00:32:48,00:32:49,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:32:49,00:32:51,I wonder if she blasted that out in times of fog.
00:32:51,00:32:52,You could hear her walking in the air.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"- And abducted boys at night, yes."
00:32:54,00:32:56,- And now all that's left in that lighthouse
00:32:56,00:32:58,is a solitary carrot.
00:32:58,00:33:00,(laughing)
00:33:00,00:33:05,- Did you know that I am a member
00:33:05,00:33:07,of the Association of Lighthouse Keepers?
00:33:07,00:33:08,- Are you?
00:33:08,00:33:09,- Did you join it just for this episode?
00:33:09,00:33:10,- I joined it yesterday.
00:33:10,00:33:11,- Yep.
00:33:11,00:33:12,(laughing)
00:33:12,00:33:13,- Really?
00:33:13,00:33:13,- I gotta say.
00:33:13,00:33:14,- ALK.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- ALK.
00:33:15,00:33:16,- You an alcoholic.
00:33:16,00:33:17,- I am.
00:33:17,00:33:19,And it's fun.
00:33:19,00:33:20,- Have you got a posting yet?
00:33:20,00:33:21,Do we have to do a podcast from Lighthouse?
00:33:21,00:33:23,(laughing)
00:33:23,00:33:25,- But you don't have to be a lighthouse keeper to join.
00:33:25,00:33:26,That's the wonderful thing.
00:33:26,00:33:28,- Evidently if you join.
00:33:28,00:33:30,Unless you've also got a job as a lighthouse keeper
00:33:30,00:33:31,just to join.
00:33:31,00:33:32,- Lots of news guys.
00:33:32,00:33:33,"No, but it's really good."
00:33:33,00:33:34,Just a quick shout out to them.
00:33:34,00:33:37,It's very reasonable price for a year's membership.
00:33:37,00:33:39,And I think you might get a sticker for your car.
00:33:39,00:33:40,- Anything else you get for it?
00:33:40,00:33:42,"- You get their quarterly journal, Lamp."
00:33:42,00:33:43,- Right.
00:33:43,00:33:45,- And I've read a bit of it.
00:33:45,00:33:46,I've read a sample online.
00:33:46,00:33:46,It's really good.
00:33:46,00:33:47,- Is it?
00:33:47,00:33:48,What are they?
00:33:48,00:33:51,Is it largely just the latest in lighthouse news?
00:33:51,00:33:52,- Shining a light on lighthouse news.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:33:53,00:33:54,Yeah.
00:33:54,00:33:55,They don't do expo days or anything like that.
00:33:55,00:33:59,But it's just lots of news from the lighthouse community.
00:33:59,00:34:00,And you know.
00:34:00,00:34:02,- You've been quite cagey about how much it was.
00:34:02,00:34:04,But what is a reasonable price to pay?
00:34:04,00:34:06,"- Also, can I ask what is the sticker?"
00:34:06,00:34:07,Is it like my other car?
00:34:07,00:34:08,- It's a lifeline.
00:34:08,00:34:09,(all laughing)
00:34:09,00:34:11,- My other headlamp is a Fresnel lens.
00:34:11,00:34:12,(all laughing)
00:34:12,00:34:14,- How much was it?
00:34:14,00:34:15,"- Well, I don't want to say in flash,"
00:34:15,00:34:16,but it was 18 pounds for a year.
00:34:16,00:34:19,- 18 pounds for one choke and we might cut out.
00:34:19,00:34:20,(all laughing)
00:34:20,00:34:22,- They almost certainly will get that.
00:34:22,00:34:23,I know.
00:34:23,00:34:26,- I'm worried that this is going to take over your life
00:34:26,00:34:27,gradually.
00:34:27,00:34:28,"And when you quit the podcast in five years,"
00:34:28,00:34:30,this is the moment we should have known.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"- Wow, you think I'm going to last five more years"
00:34:32,00:34:33,on this show?
00:34:33,00:34:34,I've incredibly left it.
00:34:34,00:34:36,(all laughing)
00:34:36,00:34:38,- I'll just have one weird lighthouse.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"One of my favorite lighthouses is,"
00:34:40,00:34:42,I think basically an unnecessary lighthouse.
00:34:42,00:34:44,It's the lighthouse in Machias Seal Island.
00:34:44,00:34:46,So this is--
00:34:46,00:34:47,- Machias Seal.
00:34:47,00:34:50,"- Machias, M-A-C-H-I-A-S."
00:34:50,00:34:51,- Where's that?
00:34:51,00:34:53,- It's a tiny little island just between the U.S.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"and Canada, and it's positioning is crucial because--"
00:34:55,00:34:58,"- It's a land border, most of that, isn't it?"
00:34:58,00:34:59,- Yeah.
00:34:59,00:34:59,- U.S. and Canada?
00:34:59,00:35:00,- Famously.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"- It's on like, if you sort of continue the border,"
00:35:02,00:35:05,"basically, it's in the Atlantic Ocean,"
00:35:05,00:35:06,a sort of--
00:35:06,00:35:07,- Between Maine and--
00:35:07,00:35:09,"- Exactly, between Maine and New Brunswick."
00:35:09,00:35:12,"And so it's disputed,"
00:35:12,00:35:13,'cause both countries want ownership
00:35:13,00:35:16,of this tiny uninhabited island.
00:35:16,00:35:18,I think because you can claim fishing rights
00:35:18,00:35:20,"around a certain circumference of it,"
00:35:20,00:35:21,if you do claim it.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"So it's been argued over since 1832,"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"and Canada, to stake its own claim for the last 25 years,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,has just kept a lighthouse keeper in a lighthouse
00:35:31,00:35:36,"on there, to stamp its identity on the island."
00:35:36,00:35:39,And it's this guy called Ralph Eldridge.
00:35:39,00:35:40,- Same guy?
00:35:40,00:35:42,"- It's been the same guy for 25 years, yeah."
00:35:42,00:35:44,"It's actually two guys, and they alternate"
00:35:44,00:35:45,one month from one month off.
00:35:45,00:35:46,- Okay.
00:35:46,00:35:48,- But they're fun guys.
00:35:48,00:35:51,I read an interview with Ralph a couple of years ago
00:35:51,00:35:54,"where the interviewer said, 'cause it's just him,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"the interviewer said, ""Are you a lonely person, Ralph?"""
00:35:56,00:35:58,"And he said, ""Lone is the wrong word."
00:35:58,00:35:59,"""Independent is better."
00:35:59,00:36:02,"""Let's say I like me best of all."""
00:36:02,00:36:03,"And then the interviewer just goes,"
00:36:03,00:36:04,"""Divorced, Ralph?"
00:36:04,00:36:05,"""Yes."""
00:36:05,00:36:08,(all laughing)
00:36:08,00:36:11,"- There was a bit of lighthouse news this year,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,so you might be seeing it in Lamp later on.
00:36:13,00:36:14,- Great.
00:36:14,00:36:14,- In your quarters.
00:36:14,00:36:15,- At least six months time.
00:36:15,00:36:16,(all laughing)
00:36:16,00:36:18,"- Who, what time was right?"
00:36:18,00:36:19,"- And that was, there was a film festival"
00:36:19,00:36:22,which took place in a lighthouse this year.
00:36:22,00:36:22,- I know.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"- It was a Swedish film festival,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,the Gotterborg Film Festival.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"And 60 movies were played in total at this festival,"
00:36:28,00:36:32,and they were played entirely to one human.
00:36:32,00:36:35,- Did they use the light from the lighthouse?
00:36:35,00:36:35,- As a projector.
00:36:35,00:36:36,- As a projector.
00:36:36,00:36:38,- Did you have to keep walking around?
00:36:38,00:36:41,(all laughing)
00:36:41,00:36:42,- There were 19 shipwrecks in it.
00:36:42,00:36:44,(all laughing)
00:36:44,00:36:46,"- The sailors were so entranced,"
00:36:46,00:36:49,watching Back to the Future 3.
00:36:49,00:36:50,- That's so cool.
00:36:50,00:36:50,- Yeah.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"- Was it a particular kind of film,"
00:36:52,00:36:54,as in was there a genre?
00:36:54,00:36:54,"- No, no, no."
00:36:54,00:36:56,- There was that film recently with Robert Pattinson.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- Yes.
00:36:57,00:36:57,- The lighthouse.
00:36:57,00:36:59,- And they played two lighthouse keepers who were going mad.
00:36:59,00:37:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:37:00,00:37:03,"- No, no, it's a collection of independent film making."
00:37:03,00:37:04,- Okay.
00:37:04,00:37:04,"- Yeah, so every kind of genre."
00:37:04,00:37:06,- It sounds like a horror film festival.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"You know, we're gonna trap you in the lighthouse"
00:37:07,00:37:08,and show you 60 films.
00:37:08,00:37:11,"- Well, no, it was a COVID thing that happened."
00:37:11,00:37:15,And so they couldn't put the festival on as they wanted to.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"And actually, sorry, I slightly got it wrong."
00:37:16,00:37:19,So it might've already been in a issue of lamp.
00:37:19,00:37:20,This was 2021.
00:37:20,00:37:23,So you might've missed out on the story just.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- I'm sure you can get back issues.
00:37:24,00:37:26,(all laughing)
00:37:26,00:37:29,"So yeah, the idea was they were gonna have to go online"
00:37:29,00:37:33,and just stream it online for the entire.
00:37:33,00:37:34,- That's literally the opposite of playing it to one person.
00:37:34,00:37:36,That's playing it to everyone with internet access.
00:37:36,00:37:37,"- Yeah, but for one thing they wanted to do"
00:37:37,00:37:38,was make it special.
00:37:38,00:37:39,And so they did a competition.
00:37:39,00:37:41,"12,000 people applied for it."
00:37:41,00:37:44,"And this one person, Lisa Enthroth, won it."
00:37:44,00:37:47,And so she got sent by boat to this island.
00:37:47,00:37:48,They took away all of her electronics.
00:37:48,00:37:50,She had just a little iPad.
00:37:50,00:37:51,- It's a Salica horror film.
00:37:51,00:37:52,- It's a Salica horror film.
00:37:52,00:37:54,There was one person on the island
00:37:54,00:37:55,who was checking on her once a day
00:37:55,00:37:57,just to make sure that she was okay.
00:37:57,00:37:59,"- The murderer, as he's always known, yes."
00:37:59,00:38:03,"- And she was there for a week, watching these 60 films."
00:38:03,00:38:05,"- So she had to watch about nine films a day,"
00:38:05,00:38:06,which was presumably about 18 hours.
00:38:06,00:38:07,She's under-slapped.
00:38:07,00:38:08,- She hasn't had anything better to do.
00:38:08,00:38:09,"- No, it's true."
00:38:09,00:38:10,- Did she have to watch them?
00:38:10,00:38:12,Did she get tested on them afterwards?
00:38:12,00:38:14,- The creepy caretaker of the island
00:38:14,00:38:16,will do a little film quiz after every single one.
00:38:16,00:38:19,- And who played the butler?
00:38:19,00:38:22,"What does the cricketer, the better snowball,"
00:38:22,00:38:23,have in common?
00:38:24,00:38:27,(upbeat music)
00:38:27,00:38:32,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,and that is James.
00:38:34,00:38:36,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 2007,"
00:38:36,00:38:40,a Japanese arm wrestling arcade machine was recalled
00:38:40,00:38:42,when it broke three players' arms.
00:38:42,00:38:44,(laughing)
00:38:44,00:38:45,Amazing.
00:38:45,00:38:46,"- See, I'm amazed it wasn't recalled"
00:38:46,00:38:48,after breaking one player's arm.
00:38:48,00:38:49,- Yeah?
00:38:49,00:38:52,"- No, they thought, let's let it break a few bodies first."
00:38:52,00:38:54,"- No, I think they happened, all the breaks happened"
00:38:54,00:38:58,in a short enough time that they couldn't recall it
00:38:58,00:38:58,before they-
00:38:58,00:39:01,- It's an afternoon at the arcade that must have been.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"You know, ringing the third ambulance."
00:39:03,00:39:04,"Yeah, amazingly."
00:39:04,00:39:06,"Actually, we are gonna contact the manufacturers now, yes."
00:39:06,00:39:09,- Possibly three kids who are holding it at the same time
00:39:09,00:39:10,trying to beat the big boss.
00:39:10,00:39:11,- That's a good idea.
00:39:11,00:39:12,- Three snaps.
00:39:12,00:39:13,- They're all in the same trench coat
00:39:13,00:39:16,standing on each other's shoulders.
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- I'm afraid you've lost the arm,"
00:39:17,00:39:20,but we have replaced it with one of these claw grapples.
00:39:20,00:39:23,(laughing)
00:39:23,00:39:25,- With which you won't be able to grab anything at all.
00:39:25,00:39:27,- Just try and have your breakfast every morning.
00:39:27,00:39:28,"You just, you grab the spoon"
00:39:28,00:39:32,and then just drop it before it gets to your mouth.
00:39:32,00:39:34,"No, so this is a company called Atlas"
00:39:34,00:39:37,and the game was called Arm Spirit.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"And what they said, this was in an article from the BBC,"
00:39:40,00:39:44,is that probably the players got a bit overexcited
00:39:44,00:39:47,and maybe they twisted their arms in a slightly weird way
00:39:47,00:39:50,"'cause the game was, it was like a fake arm"
00:39:50,00:39:52,and then you would grab hold of the fake arm
00:39:52,00:39:55,and you would play an arm wrestling game against it.
00:39:55,00:39:57,And they were like 10 levels
00:39:57,00:40:00,"and it went from the easiest level, which was a French maid."
00:40:00,00:40:01,- Okay.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"- Famously weak, there's a lot of lugging to do"
00:40:04,00:40:05,when you're a French maid.
00:40:05,00:40:07,Some of those dusters are extremely heavy with all feathers.
00:40:07,00:40:10,"- Look at George Eliot, that's where she got her hand from."
00:40:10,00:40:12,Milk and all them cows.
00:40:12,00:40:15,"- I don't, French maid is not the same as like a cow maid."
00:40:15,00:40:16,- Milk maid.
00:40:16,00:40:17,(laughing)
00:40:17,00:40:20,- French milk maids don't wear the little lacy outfit.
00:40:20,00:40:21,- They're quite different.
00:40:21,00:40:24,"If you go to a summer's elas for a milk-made outfit,"
00:40:24,00:40:25,(laughing)
00:40:25,00:40:26,do you mean French maid?
00:40:26,00:40:27,"No, no."
00:40:27,00:40:28,(laughing)
00:40:28,00:40:29,- That makes sense.
00:40:29,00:40:30,- Or something like a milk and cow.
00:40:30,00:40:31,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:40:31,00:40:32,"- After the French maid,"
00:40:32,00:40:35,"you might fight against a drunken martial arts master,"
00:40:35,00:40:38,a Chihuahua dog and the final is against
00:40:38,00:40:40,a professional arm wrestler.
00:40:40,00:40:42,And it gets harder and harder each time.
00:40:42,00:40:43,So in the end--
00:40:43,00:40:44,- That's not the order I would put that in.
00:40:44,00:40:45,You're saying a Chihuahua dog
00:40:45,00:40:48,is better at arm wrestling than a drunken martial arts master.
00:40:48,00:40:49,"- Doesn't seem that way, does it?"
00:40:49,00:40:50,"- How drunken, yeah, yeah."
00:40:50,00:40:52,"- If he's unconscious, then possibly."
00:40:52,00:40:54,(laughing)
00:40:54,00:40:57,- I can see though how an arm breakage might happen
00:40:57,00:40:59,based on a video that I watched on YouTube.
00:40:59,00:41:01,"There's lots of videos where you can see people playing,"
00:41:01,00:41:02,"not this game, not Arm Spirit,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,but there's another game called Over the Top.
00:41:04,00:41:05,And very similar.
00:41:05,00:41:07,"I think it's exactly the same game, basically."
00:41:07,00:41:08,- I think that's--
00:41:08,00:41:09,"- Also, sorry, just for legal reasons,"
00:41:09,00:41:10,probably not exactly the same.
00:41:10,00:41:12,"- Yes, probably."
00:41:12,00:41:14,"There's no Chihuahua, for example, over the top."
00:41:14,00:41:17,"And so you've got the big bulky hand there,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,and I watched a video of a super strong guy
00:41:19,00:41:21,"take on the final boss, and he was holding it,"
00:41:21,00:41:24,"and my god, he was like really going for it."
00:41:24,00:41:26,"And someone leans over next to him and says,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"""Ah, when I tried to beat the big box,"
00:41:28,00:41:29,"""I totally cheated, I lent in,"
00:41:29,00:41:32,"""I got my arms underneath it, I went."""
00:41:32,00:41:34,"So I can imagine, by manipulation of your body"
00:41:34,00:41:35,"in weird ways to try and beat it,"
00:41:35,00:41:37,a snap might occur when you buckle.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"- No, no, I can see that, yeah, yeah."
00:41:38,00:41:41,"- Isn't Over the Top as a move, isn't it, in arm wrestling?"
00:41:41,00:41:42,- It's where you kind of twist your wrist a little bit.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"- Oh, I thought it was where you put your fingers"
00:41:44,00:41:46,over the top of their hand.
00:41:46,00:41:48,But they're probably meant to be anyway.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"If they're holding your whole hand in their hand,"
00:41:50,00:41:52,you're not going to do very well.
00:41:52,00:41:53,(laughing)
00:41:53,00:41:55,"- Okay, so can I just check with--"
00:41:55,00:41:57,"- There are moves, there are proper moves in arm wrestling."
00:41:57,00:41:58,"There are sort of, I think,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,a couple of dozen different techniques.
00:42:00,00:42:03,"As in, if you're watching with an expert of the game,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,"they'll say, ""Ah, he's trying the French defense now,"""
00:42:05,00:42:06,or whatever.
00:42:06,00:42:08,(laughing)
00:42:08,00:42:09,- He's wearing a French made outfit.
00:42:09,00:42:11,(laughing)
00:42:11,00:42:13,"- What were you going to say, Anna?"
00:42:13,00:42:15,- I was just going to establish it was the kids' fault.
00:42:15,00:42:18,That seems to be where we're landing on this.
00:42:18,00:42:20,The company said they were playing it in a weird way.
00:42:20,00:42:22,- Who do we think is likely to sue?
00:42:22,00:42:23,I think it's the question we need to answer.
00:42:23,00:42:26,"- I think there was no, as far as I could see,"
00:42:26,00:42:28,I couldn't see any later news stories
00:42:28,00:42:31,that explained whether anyone had sued anyone.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"- I feel like some parents got some real,"
00:42:33,00:42:36,large quantities of cash behind the scenes for that.
00:42:36,00:42:37,- I don't know what that happened on that.
00:42:37,00:42:39,- But I wouldn't like to comment.
00:42:39,00:42:41,But arm breakage does happen in arm wrestling.
00:42:41,00:42:43,- relatively regularly.
00:42:43,00:42:47,"Apparently this is according to John Jenk,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,who is the Guinness World Records greatest arm wrestler
00:42:50,00:42:51,of all time.
00:42:51,00:42:53,He says that the people who break their arms
00:42:53,00:42:57,tend to be beginners because you get incredibly strong
00:42:57,00:42:59,"when you're starting out arm wrestling,"
00:42:59,00:43:01,but you haven't actually built up kind of the bone
00:43:01,00:43:03,and tendon resilience.
00:43:03,00:43:04,So you don't know your own strength.
00:43:04,00:43:05,You break your own arm.
00:43:05,00:43:08,"He literally, you push so, so, so hard"
00:43:08,00:43:10,that your bone just snaps.
00:43:10,00:43:12,And it's really horrible.
00:43:12,00:43:15,There was a match in Cumbria in 2018.
00:43:15,00:43:17,It was like a farmers event.
00:43:17,00:43:19,"And there were various kind of fun things,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,"like a little fairground ride or a little, you know,"
00:43:21,00:43:24,shoot the tail of the donkey or whatever.
00:43:24,00:43:27,They do those things and is that what they do?
00:43:27,00:43:28,"- Yeah, it's not really."
00:43:28,00:43:30,- Welcome to Anna's Fair.
00:43:30,00:43:33,"- Okay, look, this was nothing like my fantasy fair."
00:43:33,00:43:34,This was just a normal fair.
00:43:34,00:43:35,There was an arm wrestling contest.
00:43:35,00:43:38,A 20 year old girl broke her arm incredibly badly.
00:43:38,00:43:40,It sounds like she was resting another girl.
00:43:40,00:43:42,It was in a huge amount of pain.
00:43:42,00:43:43,"Her opponent fainted,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"which I can really imagine doing,"
00:43:45,00:43:46,"if you're arm wrestling someone,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,you know when you see one of those snappages
00:43:48,00:43:50,that were at a sudden right angle to the arm.
00:43:50,00:43:53,"So her opponent fainted and then they interviewed,"
00:43:53,00:43:54,"I think this was on the BBC,"
00:43:54,00:43:57,"they interviewed the paramedic, Andrew Dickinson,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,"who said, this is what happened, the opponent fainted,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,"but he also added, the rest of the day"
00:44:01,00:44:02,was absolutely fantastic.
00:44:02,00:44:05,It ended in a dance where 600 people attended
00:44:05,00:44:07,and we were on site until 1.30 in the morning.
00:44:08,00:44:10,- Is that good paramedicking?
00:44:10,00:44:11,"- I guess if you're the onsite paramedic,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,"if you were summoned to take her to hospital,"
00:44:14,00:44:15,it's very bad paramedicking.
00:44:15,00:44:17,- It's not clear.
00:44:17,00:44:19,- They're starting the dance now.
00:44:19,00:44:21,Would you mind if we just kept the engine running
00:44:21,00:44:23,a little bit longer?
00:44:23,00:44:24,"So I was, I always wonder,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,'cause I'm not actually a professional arm wrestler myself.
00:44:27,00:44:28,"- No. - No, no, no."
00:44:28,00:44:29,I'm a member of the association.
00:44:29,00:44:31,(all laughing)
00:44:31,00:44:32,- Look at the magazine.
00:44:32,00:44:33,"- Yeah, slam."
00:44:33,00:44:34,- It's impossible to pick it up.
00:44:34,00:44:36,(all laughing)
00:44:36,00:44:39,But I thought that the rule was
00:44:39,00:44:40,that you couldn't hold the table.
00:44:40,00:44:41,- Right. - Okay.
00:44:41,00:44:42,"- Actually, in the professional game,"
00:44:42,00:44:45,they install pegs in the table for you to hang on to.
00:44:45,00:44:46,- Yeah. - Yes.
00:44:46,00:44:47,- So it's all about the rest of your body as well.
00:44:47,00:44:48,- Do you think? - Yes.
00:44:48,00:44:49,- I can believe it.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"- Yeah, I thought it was just about your arm."
00:44:50,00:44:51,- Am I right?
00:44:51,00:44:53,"I've got an old memory of you, James,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"of you and me hanging out and you saying to me,"
00:44:55,00:44:58,"""I have an unbeatable technique."""
00:44:58,00:44:59,"- I do, yeah. - And then we did it"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"and you almost broke my arm, basically, in my attempt to,"
00:45:02,00:45:04,so you know how to not be facing.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"- I do, but I have to really,"
00:45:06,00:45:11,"you know, I have to trick you into position, basically."
00:45:11,00:45:12,- So why was upside down?
00:45:12,00:45:13,- Okay. (all laughing)
00:45:13,00:45:17,"- There's a way, basically, if I was to arm wrestle you"
00:45:17,00:45:19,and we kept the table on my right-hand side
00:45:19,00:45:21,"and your left-hand side,"
00:45:21,00:45:24,"and we arm wrestled on that table,"
00:45:24,00:45:26,then I would be pulling with my arm
00:45:26,00:45:28,and you'd be pushing with your arm
00:45:28,00:45:29,and the pulling muscle is way stronger
00:45:29,00:45:31,"than the pushing muscle, so you could beat anyone."
00:45:31,00:45:32,Then it's like a pub trick
00:45:32,00:45:34,"where you can win a pint of something, that kind of thing."
00:45:34,00:45:36,- Yes. - But if you got any brains
00:45:36,00:45:39,"on you, you insist, surely you do it over a table, right?"
00:45:39,00:45:40,"- Yeah, but if you're in a bar,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,"there might be a bar, right? - If you're on the bar."
00:45:42,00:45:44,"- You know, that's why it works in a pub."
00:45:44,00:45:47,"- Yeah, that's a good point, yeah, yeah."
00:45:47,00:45:48,"- Anyway, I have injuries now,"
00:45:48,00:45:51,but it means I can't do arm wrestling.
00:45:51,00:45:55,I have something called tenosinivitis
00:45:55,00:45:57,of the first compartment of the wrist.
00:45:57,00:46:00,It's a very common thing that arm wrestlers get.
00:46:01,00:46:04,"And yeah, it's like arm wrestlers thumb, it's called."
00:46:04,00:46:05,- Did you get it from arm wrestling?
00:46:05,00:46:06,"- No, I got the version,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,which is also known as mom's thumb.
00:46:08,00:46:11,I got it from carrying my baby too much.
00:46:11,00:46:15,But you can get the same injury
00:46:15,00:46:17,from carrying a baby in the wrong way
00:46:17,00:46:19,as you can get from arm wrestling in the wrong way.
00:46:19,00:46:20,- It's better than getting the one
00:46:20,00:46:21,"they call wankers collar, isn't it?"
00:46:21,00:46:29,"- So you mentioned John Brzenk, there, Anna."
00:46:29,00:46:32,He's the great arm wrestling champion.
00:46:32,00:46:36,So he is the guy who the main bit of culture
00:46:36,00:46:38,about arm wrestling ever to exist in the world
00:46:38,00:46:40,"is based on. - Oh, what's that?"
00:46:40,00:46:42,"- It's the movie over the top,"
00:46:42,00:46:43,"which is a Sylvester Stallone film,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,which we have briefly mentioned fleetingly
00:46:45,00:46:46,in passing in the past.
00:46:46,00:46:50,"Basically, he plays a character called Lincoln Hawke,"
00:46:50,00:46:52,whose character's name changes about twice
00:46:52,00:46:53,as the film continues.
00:46:53,00:46:56,It's not a level of attention to detail.
00:46:56,00:46:59,And he has to arm wrestle his way to winning a big prize
00:46:59,00:47:02,and to a relationship with his son.
00:47:02,00:47:03,But it's based on John Brzenk.
00:47:03,00:47:05,And this is the really nice thing.
00:47:05,00:47:08,John Brzenk worked for decades as a mechanic
00:47:08,00:47:10,at Delta Airlines so that he could arm wrestle
00:47:10,00:47:13,because he wanted to travel.
00:47:13,00:47:15,His main expenditure was plane tickets
00:47:15,00:47:17,to arm wrestling competitions.
00:47:17,00:47:20,"Whereas if he worked as a mechanic at Delta Airlines,"
00:47:20,00:47:22,free transport.
00:47:22,00:47:24,"- Does that also mean that if you're in,"
00:47:24,00:47:26,let's say the world championships in Reykjavik
00:47:26,00:47:27,"or something and you want to go home,"
00:47:27,00:47:28,but there's a problem with the plane
00:47:28,00:47:30,"and he's in the middle of an arm wrestling championship,"
00:47:30,00:47:31,you have to wait.
00:47:31,00:47:33,"- Everyone has to wait, yeah."
00:47:33,00:47:35,"- If he sees a competitor heading towards the championship,"
00:47:35,00:47:37,he can mess up a piece on the plane.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"- Oh, that's good."
00:47:38,00:47:40,- What?
00:47:40,00:47:41,"- He's just saying through a crash,"
00:47:41,00:47:42,just so it doesn't take off.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"- Yeah, just throw something small into the end."
00:47:44,00:47:46,"Anyway, but God, you wouldn't want to share"
00:47:46,00:47:47,"an arm rest with him, would you?"
00:47:47,00:47:48,- No.
00:47:48,00:47:49,"- Yeah, my man."
00:47:49,00:47:50,- Depends which song though.
00:47:50,00:47:51,Depends on the size.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"- I think his, both arms are probably strong."
00:47:54,00:47:57,"- I was looking at pictures of all arm restes,"
00:47:57,00:47:59,"desperately hoping to find like one puny,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,flaccid little stringy arm and one knee to arm.
00:48:01,00:48:02,- There is a difference though.
00:48:02,00:48:03,There is a difference in size
00:48:03,00:48:05,and it's roughly the difference
00:48:05,00:48:07,between George Eliot's head and James Harkin's head.
00:48:07,00:48:09,"- That's the, yeah, five centimeters."
00:48:09,00:48:11,"- Yeah, it's a bad, that's interesting."
00:48:11,00:48:14,- 'Cause you get some of them are experts
00:48:14,00:48:15,with just the right hand
00:48:15,00:48:17,and some of them are experts with just the left hand.
00:48:17,00:48:18,And I think the women's champion last year
00:48:18,00:48:20,won both right hand and left hand.
00:48:20,00:48:21,- Wow.
00:48:21,00:48:22,- Forgotten her name.
00:48:22,00:48:25,- So are there people who just never play each other?
00:48:25,00:48:26,"- Yeah, of course."
00:48:26,00:48:27,- Yeah.
00:48:27,00:48:28,- 'Cause if you're right handed
00:48:28,00:48:30,"and there's a champion who's a left handed,"
00:48:30,00:48:31,how are you ever gonna meet them?
00:48:31,00:48:32,- Yeah.
00:48:32,00:48:34,- You can't both sit on the same side of the table.
00:48:34,00:48:35,- Wow.
00:48:35,00:48:36,- What if you're good though at backhand
00:48:36,00:48:38,or arm wrestling as such?
00:48:38,00:48:38,- What do you mean?
00:48:38,00:48:41,- So if I went that way.
00:48:41,00:48:43,"- Well, like I told you, it's really hard to pull things"
00:48:43,00:48:45,that in that direction compared to pushing
00:48:45,00:48:46,with your other muscles.
00:48:46,00:48:48,"- Hang on, you also make sense of Andy's."
00:48:48,00:48:49,- We're sitting next to each other
00:48:49,00:48:51,and I'm pushing this way
00:48:51,00:48:52,and you're pushing this way.
00:48:52,00:48:55,- I don't think we've invented a new spark.
00:48:55,00:48:57,"- No, hang on, I think we might have arm pulling."
00:48:57,00:48:58,Isn't that?
00:48:58,00:49:00,You have exactly the same position as arm wrestling
00:49:00,00:49:01,but you have to pull.
00:49:01,00:49:02,- You have to sit next to each other.
00:49:02,00:49:04,- Or you just have to pull.
00:49:04,00:49:04,You have to pull.
00:49:04,00:49:06,So you slam your own arm down.
00:49:06,00:49:07,"- I mean, I think we've invented a sport"
00:49:07,00:49:09,that's even less excited to watch arm wrestling.
00:49:09,00:49:10,But are you saying they have the right handed
00:49:10,00:49:11,"champion trips and they say,"
00:49:11,00:49:13,"""And now we're gonna have the left handed champion."""
00:49:13,00:49:14,"- Yeah, it's different categories."
00:49:14,00:49:15,It's like different weights and boxing
00:49:15,00:49:17,but you've just got different arms.
00:49:17,00:49:18,- Is there any other sport that does that?
00:49:18,00:49:19,"- Yeah, boxing."
00:49:19,00:49:21,You can only punch with your right hand
00:49:21,00:49:22,and then some people are really gonna only
00:49:22,00:49:23,punch him with their left hand.
00:49:23,00:49:24,- I don't believe you.
00:49:24,00:49:27,"- No, that's because I've not done it in a dream."
00:49:27,00:49:29,"- Can I just quickly mention with ""Over the Top"""
00:49:29,00:49:32,"this movie and with John Bridgenk,"
00:49:32,00:49:35,"basically when ""Over the Top"" was going into production,"
00:49:35,00:49:37,they did a thing for part of the promotion
00:49:37,00:49:39,where they actually set up this massive
00:49:39,00:49:43,"arm wrestling championship that was called ""Over the Top"""
00:49:43,00:49:45,once the movie was green lit.
00:49:45,00:49:46,"So they went, ""Let's actually do this."""
00:49:46,00:49:49,"And so they did it as this,"
00:49:49,00:49:51,both it was a sort of national thing in America
00:49:51,00:49:53,but then they had international qualifying rounds
00:49:53,00:49:55,that would happen in places like Japan
00:49:55,00:49:57,and they had a final in Las Vegas.
00:49:57,00:49:59,"And the final, when all of these competitors"
00:49:59,00:50:01,"from all around the country came together,"
00:50:01,00:50:03,that was the footage that makes it into
00:50:03,00:50:04,the final of the film.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"And so, yeah, and so you see real arm wrestlers"
00:50:06,00:50:09,who were part of this big tournament.
00:50:09,00:50:10,"- Well, you would have to have real arm wrestlers,"
00:50:10,00:50:12,otherwise you have normal actors.
00:50:12,00:50:13,(laughing)
00:50:13,00:50:14,You would be like fake arms.
00:50:14,00:50:16,- The problem was is that they wanted to use
00:50:16,00:50:19,real arm wrestlers to fight or to do the arm wrestle
00:50:19,00:50:21,with Stallone in the final of the movie
00:50:21,00:50:22,but they were all too big.
00:50:22,00:50:22,It was unrealistic.
00:50:22,00:50:25,"- No, I thought they weren't big enough"
00:50:25,00:50:26,'cause it's more about technique.
00:50:26,00:50:28,They've got more normal arm lookings
00:50:28,00:50:30,than the huge weightlifting muscles.
00:50:30,00:50:31,- Some of them are massive arms.
00:50:31,00:50:32,- I don't know.
00:50:32,00:50:35,"Dave Dean, who was the main arm wrestler at the time,"
00:50:35,00:50:36,"was Jay Norris and he was,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,and they said this is so impractical
00:50:38,00:50:39,that you would win this.
00:50:39,00:50:42,"- Like for instance, Garth, all arms, Carlson."
00:50:42,00:50:44,"- Well, he does sound like he's got big arms."
00:50:44,00:50:45,(laughing)
00:50:45,00:50:46,"Or tiny, the rest of him."
00:50:46,00:50:47,(laughing)
00:50:47,00:50:48,"- Such a weird name, isn't it?"
00:50:48,00:50:49,All arms.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"- He doesn't play, he's got sort of nine arms."
00:50:50,00:50:51,- Yeah.
00:50:51,00:50:52,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:50:52,00:50:55,Terry Big Man Barton is another one.
00:50:55,00:50:56,They're all big then.
00:50:56,00:50:57,I've seen videos.
00:50:57,00:50:59,"- They're very WD-40 nicknames, aren't they?"
00:50:59,00:51:00,"They're not, they're no one's called"
00:51:00,00:51:02,the smoke screen or the diplomat.
00:51:02,00:51:04,"- The next one I could find was Verne,"
00:51:04,00:51:07,"the one armed bandit, Martel."
00:51:07,00:51:08,And I don't know why you're laughing
00:51:08,00:51:11,'cause he lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.
00:51:11,00:51:11,- Did he?
00:51:11,00:51:13,"- Yeah, one of them."
00:51:13,00:51:14,- 'Cause then he was actually one armed?
00:51:14,00:51:15,Oh my goodness.
00:51:15,00:51:16,- One armed bandit actually did have one arm.
00:51:16,00:51:17,- Oh my God.
00:51:17,00:51:20,"- But yeah, he started going back into tournaments again"
00:51:20,00:51:21,after his accident.
00:51:21,00:51:22,- Right.
00:51:22,00:51:24,"- Which, did he lose his good arm?"
00:51:24,00:51:26,"- No, he lost his less good arm."
00:51:26,00:51:28,"- That's incredible though, 'cause you can't hold on"
00:51:28,00:51:30,"to the peg, doesn't it, so he couldn't use the zoom."
00:51:30,00:51:33,- So he became the best in the world
00:51:33,00:51:35,"in the non-able-bodied class,"
00:51:35,00:51:36,but he also came fourth
00:51:36,00:51:39,in the regular able-bodied class once.
00:51:39,00:51:40,Which is pretty amazing.
00:51:40,00:51:41,- Yeah.
00:51:41,00:51:43,- Some arcade game stuff.
00:51:43,00:51:43,- Yeah.
00:51:43,00:51:45,- You know those penny pushers
00:51:45,00:51:46,where you put like two p.m.
00:51:46,00:51:47,- I love those.
00:51:47,00:51:48,- And there's like some shells.
00:51:48,00:51:49,"- Oh yeah, I've spent more money"
00:51:49,00:51:50,than I'm comfortable with on those.
00:51:50,00:51:51,I love them.
00:51:51,00:51:52,- Me too.
00:51:52,00:51:54,"- Well, they're invented by a company called Comptons"
00:51:54,00:51:57,"in 1964, and they were so sure"
00:51:57,00:51:59,that it was just gonna be a one-year thing
00:51:59,00:52:01,that they didn't even put a patent on it.
00:52:01,00:52:02,They thought this will just be fun for one year.
00:52:02,00:52:04,"Everyone will forget about it,"
00:52:04,00:52:05,so we're not gonna do that.
00:52:05,00:52:07,And then that's why you get them in all the arcades now
00:52:07,00:52:09,'cause they weren't patented.
00:52:09,00:52:13,- But why do they steal my money so effectively?
00:52:13,00:52:14,"- Well, it's really interesting that."
00:52:14,00:52:17,So there's a hole where all the money goes down.
00:52:17,00:52:19,So it seems that when you put two p.m.
00:52:19,00:52:20,it's bound to come out right.
00:52:20,00:52:21,Eventually it'll come out.
00:52:21,00:52:23,So every two p.m. that goes in--
00:52:23,00:52:24,- Should you call one two p.m. out?
00:52:24,00:52:25,- Yeah.
00:52:25,00:52:26,"Now the way to make money is to,"
00:52:26,00:52:29,for some of those two p.ms to fall into the machine.
00:52:29,00:52:32,But surely you'd notice.
00:52:32,00:52:32,- Yeah.
00:52:32,00:52:34,- You used to be able to notice.
00:52:34,00:52:35,There used to be a big hole in the middle
00:52:35,00:52:37,and you see the two p.ms go down.
00:52:37,00:52:40,"And that would be where, obviously, they made the money."
00:52:40,00:52:42,But now they hide the holes.
00:52:42,00:52:42,- Ah!
00:52:42,00:52:44,- So there are holes on the side
00:52:44,00:52:46,that the two p.ms go into.
00:52:46,00:52:48,And so not all of the two p.ms that go in come out.
00:52:48,00:52:49,- What? - And that's how they make
00:52:49,00:52:50,the money.
00:52:50,00:52:51,- That's a swizz.
00:52:51,00:52:51,It's an absolute swizz.
00:52:51,00:52:54,- That genuinely is something that's been blown wide open.
00:52:54,00:52:54,I can't believe that.
00:52:54,00:52:56,So do they have to muffle the noise
00:52:56,00:52:57,of the two p.ms sliding down the holes?
00:52:57,00:52:58,"- No, they must do, I guess."
00:52:58,00:52:59,- Because that's a noisy thing.
00:52:59,00:53:01,When you put your two p.ms at the top.
00:53:01,00:53:04,I sometimes resort to just banging in a fiver.
00:53:04,00:53:06,(laughing)
00:53:06,00:53:08,- You're gonna be the fireman into the slush.
00:53:08,00:53:11,- I have to pipe it down with a long pipe cleaner thing.
00:53:11,00:53:13,"- Yeah, I think that'll get me a few two p.ms."
00:53:13,00:53:15,(laughing)
00:53:15,00:53:17,(upbeat music)
00:53:17,00:53:20,"- Okay, that's it."
