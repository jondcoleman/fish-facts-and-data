00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.940
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.260
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.900
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.860
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.860
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.500
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.540
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.740
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.820
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.100
 My fact this week is that the author, George Elliott,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.660
 had a massive head.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.780
 (laughing)

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.500
 - That's very similar to another fact

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.900
 that we've had a few years ago.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.220
 - This is sort of a sequel fact.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.460
 So for fans of the show,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.420
 you might have remembered in episode 265,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.940
 we delivered the jaw-breaking news that George Elliott

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 had a secret.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.700
 - Jaw-slapping news.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 - Jaw-dropping news.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300
 - Yeah, the jaw-breaking news.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 - My facts are really aggressive.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.580
 - The FEMA snapping news coming to you.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.660
 So what was the news we delivered then?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.140
 - So the jaw-dropping news, no breakage,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.820
 is that 50 years after she died, for 50 years,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.740
 was the fact that she had a massive hand,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.700
 but that was a secret,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.620
 and the family denied her having it.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.420
 Anyway, so this was written in a book,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.100
 which was back in the 1840s.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.860
 So there was a biography that was put together

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 of George Elliott by a writer called Matilda Blind,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.460
 or Mathilda Blind.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.020
 I can't get the exact pronouncement.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.300
 - Could be Blinde as well.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.140
 - Could be what?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.980
 - Could be Blinde.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.540
 - It's probably Matilde Blinde.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.060
 - Matilde Blinde.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.740
 And so Matilde Blinde wrote a biography of her,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.860
 and she went round.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.980
 - She's South African.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.820
 - Matilde Blinde.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.420
 (laughing)

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.260
 - She's a Kiwi.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.580
 (laughing)

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.300
 - Sorry, she wrote an autobiography.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.660
 - She wrote a biography.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.500
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.380
 - A biography, and during the research period,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.700
 she went to the farm where George Elliott used to live,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940
 and there was a couple there called the Braes,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.500
 and it was Mrs. Cara Brae who told everyone

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.180
 that she had this big hand.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.980
 However, when I was reading the book recently,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.580
 I also discovered that her husband became obsessed

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.140
 with George Elliott because he noticed

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.620
 that she also had a ginormous head.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.640
 - Was she just huge?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480
 - Was she a giant?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.320
 - Was she a giant?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.780
 - No, she wasn't that big,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.540
 but I think that's why they were astounded

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.580
 by the size of her head.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.500
 She was taller than average, I think.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860
 - Yeah, but you're not just dragging out

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.300
 for when you don't have a fact next time,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.320
 'cause George Elliott had a massive elbow.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.140
 (laughing)

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.820
 - It's quite possible we will be back

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.860
 at 100 episodes time with another feature.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.060
 So Mrs. Brae wrote of her,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.020
 she said she had her head was massive,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.820
 her feature is powerful and rugged,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
 her mouth large but shapely,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.240
 the jaw singularly square for a woman,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.620
 unbreakable at the sound of a powerful fact, I imagine.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.180
 And so Mr. Brae said,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.660
 "I need to get your head turned into a cast,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.220
 "I need to take you to London,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.740
 "and so we can go and we can do phrenology on it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.060
 "and see how it's going to ring."

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.340
 - So phrenology is where you look at the shape

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.740
 of someone's head and you can tell their personality.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.900
 - Exactly, that's right.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.740
 It was very popular back in those days

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.360
 when people started trying to work out

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.020
 how the brain functioned and maybe certain bits of our brain.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.500
 - Well they couldn't do palm reading on her

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.700
 'cause it'd be like going through Ella

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.180
 and showing to Tom Perdue.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.000
 (laughing)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.260
 - It sounds amazing, the report.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.580
 So her head was, it was measured by a doctor

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.300
 called James DeVille and then it was analyzed

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.300
 by George Coombe who was one of the leaders

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.460
 of the phrenological movement in the whole country.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.300
 So, you know--

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.180
 - She would have needed a very big Coombe.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.180
 - Oh my gosh.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.860
 (laughing)

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.380
 - And when he first saw the cast of her head,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.820
 Coombe, 'cause he was doing the analysis,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.660
 he was in the lab, I don't think I had a lab.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.780
 But anyway, he took the cast for a man's head,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 that's how huge it was, 22 and a quarter inches.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.040
 - How much bigger are men's heads than women's heads?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.600
 - Statistically speaking.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.820
 - My head is five centimeters bigger than George Eliot's.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.700
 - But that's good, so this is just a bit bigger

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.860
 than George Eliot's head.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.300
 - Yeah, yeah, so if anyone sees me in the pub

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.860
 and you're like, oh that's James from the podcast,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.500
 imagine my head but five centimeters smaller

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.940
 and that'll be George Eliot's head.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.260
 - It's like she's there.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.780
 - So this is actually, now your fact has become

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.660
 kind of an insult to James 'cause what you're saying

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.980
 is James Harkin has a really massive head.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.840
 - Compared to, but then men don't have larger heads

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.400
 in general than women, I think.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.040
 - That's true, except for Andy, apparently.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.120
 - I'm just looking at Andy's head.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.200
 - Which Anna was saying at the top of the show.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.960
 - Yeah, I'm not very comfortable

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.160
 with this line of inquiry.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.400
 Have you ever, if just listening at home,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920
 have you ever seen a matchstick?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.800
 - Imagine the head was a bit smaller.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040
 - It actually goes in from the match shaft.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.080
 - Australians, you might know them as dick heads,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.920
 those matches.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760
 - That's right.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.800
 - Yeah, and funnily, at school,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.440
 a lot of the kids were Australian matchmen.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.780
 No, but so she was analysed by this phrenologist.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.780
 So it said that her temperament was nervous lymphatic,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.660
 which means active without endurance.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.560
 And lo and behold, it turned out that she worked

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.020
 from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.160
 So she was active, but didn't have endurance.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.860
 And intellectual and all of this.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.940
 - And she visited this guy over the years.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.820
 Kume, she didn't just have her head sent to him

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.980
 via the casting.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.060
 She actually was in his presence a few times.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.900
 Well, that's what happened.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.460
 You would make the cast of the head

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.860
 and you would send it to phrenologists

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.320
 who were keen to sort of measure the bumps and so on.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.160
 - You just need to be very careful

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.380
 that you do specify cast before someone soars

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.460
 off their own head and turns it into a package.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.420
 - Okay, here's the thing I don't get.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.820
 What about your hair?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.260
 So if you've got a huge hair,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.300
 that will surely obscure the lumps and bumps on your head.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300
 - But you feel the bumps.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.980
 You're not looking for the bumps.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.940
 - But this is one of the things that opponents

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.740
 of phrenology said, you know, this is why it's nonsense.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.520
 So Oliver Wendell Holmes.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.180
 - Wait, who was he again?

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.580
 - I think he was a writer and a doctor, I think.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.660
 - He was a celeb, Victorian celeb.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.020
 - I just double checked 'cause in my head I went,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.980
 oh, Sherlock's brother.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.580
 And then I realized not a real answer.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.060
 - Definitely not, no, no, no.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.420
 But he wrote this.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.060
 He said, could you tell how much money there is in a safe

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.460
 by kneading its knobs with your fingers

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.240
 when a man fumbles about my forehead

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.980
 and talks about the organs of individuality, size, et cetera.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.500
 I trust him as much as I should

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.420
 if he felt the outside of my strongbox

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.420
 and told me there was a $5 or a $10 bill

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.340
 under this or that particular rivet, which is fair.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.180
 - Well, yeah.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.220
 - So even at the time, people did say--

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.180
 - It was a long way of saying, this is bullshit.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.020
 - Yeah. - Isn't it?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.860
 - Yeah.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.820
 - Why is it keeping such small value bills in a safe box?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.780
 - Jesus, the point, maybe he's on holiday.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.620
 - Even back then.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.380
 - It's just the 1700s, that's worth a lot.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.860
 - See, is it 1800s, isn't it?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.740
 - I think so, yeah, yeah, that was his manner.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.620
 - The idea was that, you know, you could have,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.620
 your eyeballs almost pushed out even.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.660
 And this, in fact, was the first, you know,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.900
 the first instance of it.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.620
 So, phrenology was coined,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.460
 the idea of it was coined by Franz Joseph Gaul.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.660
 And he said that he came up with the idea,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.500
 or he realized it was the truth,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.420
 when he noticed that classmates in his class

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.380
 could memorize these massive long bits of text.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.940
 And the ones that could memorize it had quite bulging eyes.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.300
 He said they had big salient eyes.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.120
 And he said, this must mean that the organ of verbal memory

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.180
 is sitting right behind your eyes.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.260
 And if you're really gonna remember yourself,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.540
 it's pushing them out.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.020
 So I don't know if your eyes just drop out of your face

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.820
 entirely if you've got a really good memory.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.060
 But then, yeah, he's the father of it, really, wasn't he?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.900
 - Yeah.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.820
 - The thing I liked about it, though,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.500
 is he wasn't this Gaul character.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.220
 He wasn't onto the wrong idea, really.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.820
 Because all he--

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.660
 - No, that's all right.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.500
 I think-- - I think--

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.340
 - Wait a sec.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.180
 - I think the way that--

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.300
 - Well, I mean, it was definitely all bullshit.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.380
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely, but, you know,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.300
 modern day brain understanding

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.020
 is that certain bits of the brain

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.460
 are compartmentalized to certain things,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.540
 like music and so on, and emotions,

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.060
 and right-thinking, left-thinking, and all that.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.580
 - He didn't come up with that idea.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.140
 So someone else had come up with that idea,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.340
 and he thought, oh, well, what if I took that idea

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.620
 and then made the bump thing a thing?

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.020
 - Right, I could just see that.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.980
 If I was around at that time,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.900
 I definitely would have believed it.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.140
 It just sounds so obviously.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.340
 - Yeah, well, obviously, yeah.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.300
 - I think you would have as well.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.140
 - Yeah, you would.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.460
 - I mean, it's just quite--

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.300
 - I think I wouldn't.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.640
 - It's very hard to put yourself in there.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.020
 - My organ of credulousness is tiny, actually.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.260
 (laughing)

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.100
 - Yeah.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.660
 - Phrenology is basically astrology, isn't it?

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.420
 Or it was sort of a version of astrology

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.620
 in that it seemed to tell people things

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.660
 that were vague enough that they could go,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.100
 yeah, that sounds exactly like me.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.100
 - Barnum statements.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.860
 - It mostly wasn't, the reports you got

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.500
 from a phrenologist were very rarely.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.340
 You're a wanker.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.300
 It was always, oh, you've got a nice organ over there,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.900
 some organ there, and I don't think,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.620
 I don't think they've often said,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.140
 "You've got the organ of the killer."

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.740
 - No, but they told everyone else.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.060
 Actually, they did.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.740
 - But it was used to suggest that other races were lower.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.660
 It was used in a very racist sense.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.320
 - And people believed it.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.160
 Yeah, eugenicists.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.580
 - To be honest, it was mostly used

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.260
 to whatever your belief was.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.100
 - Yeah.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.100
 - It was used to kind of strengthen that.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.580
 So for instance, there was a woman called Mrs. Hamilton.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.500
 She was known as, she was from Ayrshire,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.820
 and she would go around talking about phrenology.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.760
 But she said that because the bumps on a woman's head

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.300
 were generally the same as the bumps on a man's head,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.780
 this proved that women had exactly the same

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.980
 intellectual capacity as men's.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.820
 And she went around saying,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.580
 "Yeah, well, you know, this proves feminism."

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.700
 See, I knew it was bullshit,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.740
 but that is the nail in the coffin of phrenology there,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.580
 isn't it?

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.420
 (laughing)

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.820
 What the hell's the odd about?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.380
 Alderman got phrenologized.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.140
 John James Alderman, the big bird man,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.740
 did all the bird sketches and stuff.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.580
 And actually, he was huge.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.660
 - He wasn't a bird man.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.980
 He was a man who studied birds.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.220
 - He's a man who studied birds.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.260
 - Easily, yeah.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.620
 - The naturalist who was sort of the leading authority

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.940
 on birds that time,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.180
 and his books were beautiful drawings.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.260
 And he wrote in his diary,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.700
 "I was astounded when I had my reading,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.900
 'cause they said that I must be a strong and constant lover.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.260
 An affectionate father,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.180
 I would have made a great general

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.540
 that I was extraordinarily generous.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.380
 I know all these to be facts,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.100
 so I'm amazed that they discovered them."

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.100
 (laughing)

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.140
 - I'm amazed at the person who you're paying

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.220
 to do your phrenology said,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.300
 "Oh, it apparently says you're very generous."

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.140
 (laughing)

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.860
 - Yeah.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.460
 - You guys remember Aaron Burr?

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.300
 - Yeah.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.460
 - Oh, Burr and Hamilton.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.140
 - Of musical fame.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.980
 - Vice President of America.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.660
 - Well, Aaron Burr was cast.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.420
 His head was cast, but after his death.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.260
 - Ah, okay.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
 - And they found that he had lots of secretiveness

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.780
 and destructiveness.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.500
 - Did he die in the duel?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.340
 - No.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.740
 - No, he lived, he survived the duel

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.700
 and then ran away, I think.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.220
 - Yeah, he died on his deathbed many, many years ago.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.060
 (laughing)

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.900
 - Oh, he died on his deathbed.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.740
 - That was such a mistake.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.580
 - He should never have gone there.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.420
 - He didn't die on the duel.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.260
 - When you're in John Lewis,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260
 don't pick the deathbed.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.060
 - Hi, I'm looking for a deathbed.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.060
 - Yeah, are you sure?

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.900
 (laughing)

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.980
 - Some celebrity fans, just quickly?

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.660
 - Oh, modern day ones?

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.500
 - No.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.820
 (laughing)

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.540
 - Not Kim Kardashian or...

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.420
 - No, Arthur Conan Doyle?

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.260
 - Yeah, of course.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.340
 - I mean, Arthur Conan Doyle, absolutely everything.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.540
 - I wish I'd been friends with him.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.800
 The pranking you could have got

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.820
 down Arthur Conan Doyle, that's been epic.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.380
 (laughing)

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.660
 - Queen Victoria as well, and Prince Albert.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.380
 They had studies done by George Cuny.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.220
 - How do you say, Andy?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.020
 When you say some celebrities,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.460
 I thank God you're not bucking Celebrity Love Island.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.300
 (laughing)

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.260
 Well, I've got as Queen Victoria and...

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.380
 - You'd want to see it.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.140
 - You'd want to see it.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.980
 - Dead.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.380
 (laughing)

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.700
 - Was there a deathbed in there?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.540
 (laughing)

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.420
 - Shit, love the deathbed.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.180
 Anyway, they appointed him.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.140
 - Barack Obama?

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.740
 - Oh, find someone living for I don't see.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.580
 - End that sentence, James.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.020
 - Yeah, sorry, he's into...

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.820
 - No, no, you don't let me finish my sentence.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.660
 - Oh, sorry, okay.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.260
 - Barack Obama is a subject

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.380
 of an incredibly weird book

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.060
 called The Phrenology of Barack Obama.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.780
 It's a self-published book.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.620
 - No.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.580
 - By a guy called Bensa Magos.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.260
 And apparently he looked at a mysterious headscar

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.020
 on Obama's head that the mass media refuses to discuss.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.340
 (laughing)

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.660
 And according to him,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.300
 this is evidence that Obama once had a horn

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.180
 and leads ultimately to the satanic endgame revealed

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.740
 by the demon horn of Mollock.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.060
 - Oh, okay.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.900
 - So...

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.420
 - I can't believe the Guardian isn't reporting on this.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.540
 - That's outrageous.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.780
 - It feels like he's missed the boat

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.100
 'cause he just served two terms

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.140
 and then left office in an orderly fashion.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.980
 - What a taste.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.420
 - Like, what's Mollock's endgame here?

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.220
 (laughing)

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.420
 - Maybe it took a while to find a publisher, who knows?

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.060
 (laughing)

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.020
 - Wow.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.820
 - I'm definitely buying it, by the way.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.660
 (laughing)

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.700
 - Sounds awesome.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.060
 - Yeah, this guy, Coom,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.940
 just going back to the casting of True Celebrities.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.500
 He did very famous people.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.420
 He did Prince Albert's head.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.900
 So George Eliot was having her head done

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.580
 by the guy that did Prince Albert.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.540
 He did William Blake as well.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.380
 - Ooh.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.540
 - Or rather, he studied,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.060
 it was someone else who Coom didn't do it.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.140
 It was the, there was a different person, wasn't it?

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.140
 Yeah, James DeVille.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.740
 But where are these casts?

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.140
 Where's George Eliot's head?

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.020
 - This room, actually, is inside of the cast.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.940
 - They used it to the Statue of Liberty.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.260
 (laughing)

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.780
 - Such a good ending for the movie.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.020
 - What a movie, for the phrenology movie.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.380
 It's like, they never knew where it was.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.780
 Whip pan out to New York.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.620
 - And then just winks.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.980
 - Yes, yes.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.340
 Mount Rushmore.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.180
 Pour their hands.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.860
 - Gives a little thumbs up with his massive hand.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.700
 (laughing)

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.280
 (upbeat music)

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.980
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.860
 and that is Anna.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.540
 - My fact this week is that the chef

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.820
 who cooked for Lord's Cricketers on match days

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.700
 for 35 years was once asked to limit their meals

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.740
 to five courses, and she refused.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.660
 (laughing)

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.540
 So this was a woman called Nancy Doyle,

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.860
 and she, yeah, she was the tea lady at Lord's

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.100
 for 35 years, until 1996, I think she retired.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.140
 And she liked to make them large, large meals.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.300
 So obviously in cricket, you've got meals codified,

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.340
 and you have to take your lunch break.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.340
 It's in the rules.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.140
 - It's so amazing that they're actually

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.220
 in the rules of cricket, it says,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.540
 "Unless the umpires and captains together

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.140
 "agreter alter it, lunch shall be taken at the agreed time."

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.060
 It's actually in the rules that you have to have lunch.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.940
 - And the captains of each team decide

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.540
 on what time lunch is happening,

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.820
 how long or-- - And the umpire, yeah.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.580
 - I mean, what other sport has a conversation like that

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.780
 when you're about to flick the coin

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.700
 for who bats first or whatever, you know?

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.540
 By the way, what time--

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.380
 - When are we having lunch?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.220
 (laughing)

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.060
 - What are we having?

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.260
 Well, we're having a roast today.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.580
 (laughing)

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.780
 - How are we, you guys?

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.740
 - So Mrs. Doyle.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.380
 - Mrs. Doyle, she, well, her typical menu,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.740
 it seemed to be, for lunch you'd have soup,

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.300
 then a starter, then a roast.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.420
 (laughing)

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.620
 Well, you've got to, 'cause you've got to moisten

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.820
 your palate, I suppose. - Absolutely, yeah.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.700
 - Then a starter, then roast meat and potatoes.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.100
 And she also served chips and vegetables.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.220
 It's quite hard to know.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.420
 This was just on an example list

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.980
 that I think Mike Brealy gave of what she'd serve up.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.740
 Chips and vegetables, then a dessert, then a cheese board.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.900
 Then you get back onto plate.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.460
 But of course, in cricket, every two hours,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.780
 'cause although they decide when you have meals,

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.220
 it's pretty much every two hours is the general rules.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.620
 Roughly, for when you eat.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.460
 So two hours later, you get back in,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.780
 and she's made you a huge cake.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.620
 (laughing)

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.460
 And there you go.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.340
 So there was this moment where Mike Brealy said,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.500
 in the '70s-- - It's Mike Brealy who was--

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.460
 - Mike Brealy was the England captain at the time.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.220
 He said to her, "Do you know what?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.780
 "I don't know if it's good for the game.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.860
 "The guys can't stand up after lunch."

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.380
 And she replied, so she, you know, he was like,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.260
 "Could we possibly make the meals a bit lighter?"

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.740
 And she said, "But in an Irish accent,

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.300
 "tell you what, Michael, I won't tell you how to feckin' bat

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.860
 "and you don't tell me how to feckin' cook, okay?"

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.700
 - Amazing, wow.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.420
 - And that was it, and she was apparently terrifying.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.860
 Someone called her a small yet volcanic,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.820
 so I think he didn't ask again.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.140
 - She also couldn't cook.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.300
 I mean, it's in the case-- (laughing)

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.860
 No, it's not one of her whatsoever,

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.500
 but she said she'd never read a cookbook.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.740
 She didn't use weighing scales,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.740
 and she didn't follow recipes.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.140
 - But that shows having a natural affinity to cooking.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.300
 - Her organ of cooking was absolutely massive.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.460
 (laughing)

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.140
 - She's taught by nuns, wasn't she?

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.860
 Like, she did get taught, yeah.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.820
 She just didn't--

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.660
 - I think being able to cook without a recipe is--

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.740
 - No, that is the mark of quality.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.740
 I found a bit of a scandal researching this fact.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.940
 - Oh yeah, okay.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.780
 - I thought tea in cricket was the most English thing.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.620
 - Right.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.700
 - It's not English, it's Australian.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.540
 - No.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.660
 - It was introduced by Australia.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660
 It was imported.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.980
 Australia started doing this in about the 1880s,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.580
 and then a captain called Joe Darling

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.900
 brought it over--

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.740
 - T Darling?

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.100
 - The T Darling in 1899.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.880
 But even then, it was brought onto the field.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.980
 So, like, they would bring you a cup of tea

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.820
 where you stood, and there were photos of England players

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.580
 just standing around with waitresses,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.020
 you know, just bringing them a tea trolley, basically.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.260
 And it wasn't standard until about 1905

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.140
 that players went off and had their tea,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.420
 so it was an Aussie thing.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.260
 - Very cool.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.300
 - I don't know about that.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.580
 - You were saying about how Nancy can't cook, Andy.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.740
 She can't cook curries.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.700
 That is one thing.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.500
 - She can't cook anything anymore 'cause she is dead.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.340
 - Yes, sorry.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.260
 - She can't cook curries.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.100
 - Death bed bed?

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.460
 It was a, what kind of death bed?

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.300
 - It was a death bed thing, yeah.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.140
 Another cause of death, death bed.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.700
 - No, she couldn't cook curries, I should have said.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.260
 Because during tests, when England's playing

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.420
 people like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.060
 they want to have food which they had at home,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.140
 and so they want to have curries,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.780
 and she couldn't cook them,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.140
 and so she brought her daughter, Jeanette,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.520
 and Jeanette, who was a nurse,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.260
 was apparently a brilliant curry maker,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.780
 so she would come in and make the curries.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.620
 - I love that.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.340
 - Just get professional cooks, guys.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.180
 It's so weird.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.020
 - No, no, no.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.860
 - Professional cook.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.700
 She was a nurse.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.700
 - Get a nurse who might have left some really ill people

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.940
 to die.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.540
 - I'm just gonna leave these death beds, I'll be fine.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.780
 Curries have been a problem in the past

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.380
 for English cricketers, so when they do big tours

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.740
 of India and Pakistan, and in the '70s and '80s,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.700
 when curry was less common here,

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.740
 and people weren't used to eating it,

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.500
 a lot of the players found it quite difficult,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.020
 and Alex Stewart, in fact, who was a player in the '80s,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.740
 said that he, basically, before they were doing

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.020
 a tour of India, him and Jack Russell,

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.900
 who, well, I hadn't heard of Jack Russell,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.460
 but they couldn't hack the Indian food,

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.340
 and so before they'd fly out to Pakistan,

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.020
 they said they'd do a trip to Tesco,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.500
 and they'd just buy,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.420
 Alec would buy 43 chicken breasts,

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.980
 43 days worth of mashed potatoes,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.580
 and 43 days worth of broccoli,

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.460
 and every day he'd just make himself chicken breasts,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.620
 broccoli, mashed potatoes.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.740
 - Did he say it'd go into India?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.100
 - Yeah. - Quite a hot country.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.660
 Are these chicken breasts refrigerated,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.900
 or are they just loose in his case?

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.740
 - That is horrible.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.060
 It just went into the separating chicken case.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.060
 - Look, I think they probably

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.980
 had some kind of refrigeration technology.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.380
 - I don't know if we ever mentioned this on the podcast,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.180
 that when the Beatles went to India

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.580
 to see the Maharaja, no, not the Maharaja,

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.660
 the Guru, wasn't it? - The Guru, yeah.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.860
 - They went to see their Guru,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.500
 who was gonna teach them transcendental meditation

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.180
 and how to free their minds and all of this.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.580
 And Ringo Starr took a suitcase of baked beans.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.100
 - Yeah. - Did we say that?

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Great, great, great.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.940
 - Well, that's 'cause he had digestion problems

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.660
 from childhood when he was hospitalized

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.500
 and nearly died in hospital.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.420
 - Wow. - Whoa.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.740
 - Just getting the facts in.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.980
 - Whereas Alex Stewart was just being a bit of a fool,

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.860
 which in fact, Atherton wrote in his autobiography,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.580
 and I feel like this might cause some tension

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.420
 with your teammate.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.180
 So Atherton was in captain work, played with Stewart,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.500
 said, "Alex Stewart has a narrow focus on sport and life.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.300
 I do wonder," and he said this of his meal choices in India,

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.580
 "I do wonder whether he'll look back with regret

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.940
 at some of the missed opportunities

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.260
 that touring life offers." - Wow.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.340
 - But you could say the same about me when we go on tour.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.500
 - That's true. - And I'm sure you all three do.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.260
 I don't hear you, though, because it's after 9 p.m.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.100
 and I'm in bed.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.540
 - You do have a lot of courses on your breakfast,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.340
 everyone, don't you? - Oh my God, yes you do.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.740
 - That's true, but I have brought them all from home

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.940
 and I've stopped them in the suitcase.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.540
 I've just brought 350 waffles.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.260
 - I went to a cricket match once

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.020
 and it was sponsored by Sauri Maltloaf.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.660
 - Oh, lovely. - Yeah, delicious.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.980
 - And so there was a guy there

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.220
 and he was handing out free bits of Maltloaf to everyone.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.580
 But no one really likes Maltloaf

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.100
 and everyone likes beer watching like a shirt cricket.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.180
 And so everyone just started throwing Maltloaf at him.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.020
 - Oh my God.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.380
 - And he refused to give any more Maltloaf to anyone

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.540
 and everyone got really upset

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.300
 because they wouldn't give him any Maltloaf.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.380
 - But how come they only wanted it

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.260
 to throw at the guy and hang it up?

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.220
 If he removes himself, the loop closes.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.540
 - Well, he did exactly the right thing

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.060
 as far as I'm concerned.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.860
 But the 20,000 people in Old Trafford

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.020
 did not see it the same way.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.420
 - I love Maltloaf.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.380
 I'd have been, I'd have been grubbing around

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.420
 drinking it up with my big net standing near him.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.260
 - What is it?

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.100
 I don't think I've had it.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.940
 - It's absolutely delicious.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.340
 We're not sponsored this week by Maltloaf,

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.300
 but I do really, sorry, if you're listening.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.860
 It's a kind of fruity bread, basically.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.100
 - Yeah, it's very delicious.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.820
 - Although I think any beer drinker worth his salt,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.660
 if he loves beer that much,

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.540
 can turn a Maltloaf into a beer.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.540
 It's got malt in it, surely.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.380
 - You blend that.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.060
 - And a cricket match over five days.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.220
 Eventually it's gonna ferment.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.860
 - Exactly.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.020
 Just on a sort of eating and drinking in cricket

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.100
 and drinking specifically,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.900
 there's a guy, a cricket called Gary Sobers,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.860
 and I want you to remember that.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.820
 - Oh, I see why we're going here.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.660
 - That's where the work out

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.820
 which road you're gonna go down now.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.860
 - Almost a sentence person.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.700
 - You need up to be, he's my son.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.220
 - Yeah, if he married, if he married in double barrel

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.460
 with Helen up.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.300
 - Yeah.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.500
 (laughing)

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.580
 Anyway, Gary Sobers,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.580
 he batted his last century while drunk.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.060
 - And not even just a bit tipsy.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.180
 This sounds like a mad experience.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.220
 So he was playing at Lord's.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.540
 He played for the West Indies

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.340
 and he'd been out clubbing until nine in the morning.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.180
 (laughing)

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.140
 And he was batting that day

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.660
 and he was going straight into bat.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.620
 So he got in at nine.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.540
 He's completely hammered

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.180
 and drank, solidly drinking for, you know, 12 hours straight.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.460
 He batted amazingly well.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.060
 He hit 132, extraordinary.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.620
 But then begged to be taken off

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.060
 'cause he said suddenly he sort of started to sober up.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:41.900
 - He started to come down.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.020
 - Solidly up to the name of the come down

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.540
 and the sobering up and the hangover.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.460
 So he was taken off with a stomach complaint

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.140
 after batting 132.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.760
 And then he was brought off,

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.340
 but felt quite bad about it.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.460
 And so ended up being apparently,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.380
 according to him, revived

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.780
 for the couple of large port and brandies.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.620
 - Oh my God.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.460
 - I didn't know.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.740
 - Port and brandy.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.700
 I've not heard of that as a drink.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.540
 - No.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.060
 - It's not like a very old fashioned Jagerbomb basically.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:04.900
 (laughing)

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.020
 - I think that was what it was.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:06.860
 - Yeah.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.820
 - Can you come back onto cricket?

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.660
 I thought once you got off the--

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.500
 - That's sick.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.340
 - Yeah.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.160
 - Oh, okay.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.000
 - I didn't know that.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.780
 - So he returned.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.020
 He returned to hit 150, not out,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.500
 and then the England retired.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.340
 - Wow.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.220
 - What if the drinking still goes up?

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.460
 W.G. Grace, for example.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.860
 So he was around in the late 1800s.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.820
 His choice of drink during matches

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.620
 was if he was coming off,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.540
 he would drink champagne during the match

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.380
 all the way through.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.980
 And at lunch, he would have whiskey as his choice of drink.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.900
 So he was bladded the whole time

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.540
 that he was playing.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.820
 Or, you know, comfortably marry as opposed to drunk.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.140
 I wonder if that still happens.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.980
 - Of course it doesn't.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.420
 And I think this is one of the great tragedies

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.100
 of all sports, 'cause of course it doesn't,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.900
 'cause they've all changed in the last 30 years

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.200
 so dramatically.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.060
 Like anything you watch, tennis, football, cricket.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.220
 - None of them are pissed.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.060
 (laughing)

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:57.880
 - It's ridiculous.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.200
 - It's so cold sober and they're eating these crazy diets.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.020
 I think there should be a rule that says

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.300
 no professional sportspeople are allowed to eat anything

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.940
 outside of what they would normally eat or drink.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.060
 And then you just have to play like that,

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.180
 which is basically how they did it

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.500
 until the 70s or 80s, isn't it?

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.980
 - Agassi won quite seminal match in his career

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.180
 with a giant hangover from the night before.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.060
 And he played so well with the hangover

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.940
 that he did think, am I gonna have to do this

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.260
 for every match?

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.100
 - Wow.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.940
 - This is so good.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.420
 - And it's kind of like, what's the chop?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.420
 The same bolt.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.100
 Who, at the Beijing Olympics, I think, 2008,

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.100
 he pretty much only had chicken nuggets.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.180
 - Yeah, 'cause I didn't think he trusted

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.700
 the local cuisine to the rest of the thing.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.540
 - He brought them all.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.860
 He brought 43 days work and they were pretty off by the end.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.500
 - There are two cricketers for India

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.380
 called Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kisham.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.580
 And when they get together, they just eat any old crap.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.100
 And apparently their favorite thing is they get a bun,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.660
 they put some chocolate ice cream on the bread,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.980
 and then they put Nando sauce on top of that,

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.140
 and then they put a piece of chicken on top of that,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.340
 and they eat it, and they reckon if you eat that,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.340
 it guarantees you're gonna score runs the next day.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.540
 - Right. - Wow.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.540
 - Has anyone put it to a scientific testing,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.620
 rigorous testing process?

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.540
 - These are great cricketers, you know?

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.380
 - Okay, yeah.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.820
 - It's two of the best in the world.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.620
 - Yeah, Ash, they're doing what you want, Anna.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.860
 They're just combining all the unhealthy foods into one meal.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.700
 - Like, I'm very hard to please, yeah, yeah.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.540
 Get on them.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.500
 - But Sri Lankan cricketers have been banned

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.980
 from eating biscuits this a few years ago, actually.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.020
 But they were losing games,

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.540
 and the government decided to get involved,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.420
 and the Sri Lankan government gave them an ultimatum

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.660
 and said, "Start winning matches,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.860
 "or we're gonna get rid of your biscuits."

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.820
 And they didn't win matches, and they lost their biscuits.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.660
 - No.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.340
 - And Lassith Malinga, who's a really famous bowler,

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.860
 he talked about the comments of the sports minister

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.620
 and said, "What does a monkey know

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.740
 "about a parrot's nesting hollow?"

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.540
 - What an amazing burn.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.780
 - Is that so? - That's a sick bit of sledging.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.420
 - I just love the idea of one of them going into a shop

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.940
 trying to buy some biscuits,

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.420
 and the shopkeeper looking under the counter

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.140
 where the entire squad's photos are up.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.540
 - To be honest, if Lassith Malinga is very clear

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.740
 what he looks like, he's...

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.620
 - Okay, he's distinctive looking.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.860
 - Very distinctive.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.220
 There's no way he got a biscuit in the whole country.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.380
 (laughing)

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.540
 - Loaturing outside a shop asking for a 10-year-old,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.380
 "What do I mean?

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.620
 "Couldn't get me some garibaldies, could you please?"

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.860
 (laughing)

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.440
 (upbeat music)

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.300
 and that is Andy.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.900
 - My fact is that Northern Ireland

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.300
 contains the world's only upside-down lighthouse.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.740
 (laughing)

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.580
 - How soon was that an architectural cock up?

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.540
 - Or maybe to scare moles away from the...

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.500
 - Exactly, a massive mole problem, aquatic moles,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.420
 and no, it is so weird, 'cause genuinely,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.100
 it's not just a low, it's got a tower,

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.540
 but the tower is above the light.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.660
 - But it's just for anyone who's picturing in their head

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.740
 a lighthouse that's been flipped upside down.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.300
 It's unfortunately not at all like that,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.500
 it is in no way that...

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.820
 - I'm sorry, it is exactly that.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.260
 - Andy, explain exactly what it is.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.900
 We'll see if it's exactly what Dan thinks it is.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.540
 - It's on an island called Rathland,

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.100
 which is off the coast of Northern Ireland,

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.300
 and the lighthouse was built into the cliff face

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.820
 at the island's edge, and they wanted a lighthouse

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.140
 'cause they wanted to warn shipping about the island,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.980
 and its presence, but the problem is,

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.940
 the island is often covered in fog.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.260
 It's covered in fog, so if you were to have the lighthouse

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.980
 installed on the cliffs at the bottom of the cliffs,

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.900
 and the light up at the top of the cliffs,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.580
 the light would be lost in the fog.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.220
 So they built the tower, which is where all the supplies

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.100
 are kept, and the stalls, and the spare lenses

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.620
 for the light bulb, and all of this stuff,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.020
 but the actual light itself is at the bottom of the cliffs,

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.180
 and that's the thing that means it can be seen more.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.740
 - So it's like they've sliced the top off a lighthouse,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.380
 and then put it down in front of the rest of the lighthouse.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.220
 - Exactly.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.260
 - Or have they put it all in reverse order?

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.620
 - No, you have to climb down the stairs,

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.060
 upside down, together, yeah.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.180
 - Yeah, so it's sort of a little,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.180
 it's sitting in front of the tower,

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.020
 it's not directly underneath the tower.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.940
 - So it's a lighthouse, and the bulb is at the bottom,

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.660
 not at the top, it's an upside down lighthouse.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.340
 - So it's not like in the daytime,

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.060
 it makes a dark area.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.300
 (laughing)

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.980
 - That's an inside out lighthouse.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.140
 - Yeah, that's okay, sorry, yeah.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.820
 I always go the next step.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.580
 And it's just a very cool thing.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.860
 And it was built in about 1912, I think,

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.260
 so it's 110 years old now.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.260
 And also, I read this about Rathland Island,

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.580
 I can't, I don't know if it's true,

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.300
 that it's the island where Robert the Bruce went

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.220
 after a battle, and it's where he saw the useless spider.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.420
 - That is true, well, the fact that,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.700
 whether that happened or not,

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.980
 it's definitely said to have happened on Rathland,

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.180
 said to have happened in a cave

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.220
 underneath the lighthouse, but not that lighthouse.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.060
 (laughing)

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.260
 - There's an east lighthouse and a west lighthouse,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.500
 and the Robert the Bruce one is the other one.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.340
 - Okay, okay.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.140
 - So the story is, isn't it that he was in a,

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.220
 yeah, a Scottish guy, he's gone away

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.860
 from where the battles are, he's sat down,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.660
 he's worried, there's a spider there,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.420
 the spider keeps trying to make a web,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.380
 keeps trying to jump over, keeps failing,

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.420
 and eventually he makes it and he thinks,

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.020
 if at first you don't see, try, try again,

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.700
 and he goes back and gets dashed on the rocks

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.780
 because of this useless lighthouse,

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.060
 the lights at the bottom.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.900
 They also have fog bells sometimes, lighthouses,

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.060
 'cause it is a problem, a lot,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.260
 that you can't see a lighthouse if it's obscured by fog,

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.460
 and it sounds like they haven't really cracked it,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.700
 so they have bells, which A is a lighthouse keeper,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.300
 I suppose, or you had to in the olden days

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.180
 before everything was automated,

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.700
 you had to just ring them kind of constantly,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.220
 so I think you'd ring them about two rings

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.020
 every 15 seconds in fog to let ships know

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.220
 that you were there, and it only traveled about 100 meters,

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.540
 so I think the light from whitehouses

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.620
 can travel many, many kilometers, can't it?

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.700
 Seven, eight, nine, more than that, kilometers,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.180
 but it couldn't travel that far,

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.220
 and you could wind them up the bells,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.060
 so you'd wind them up really, really, really far,

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.660
 and then it could, as it unwound, like a clock,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.420
 it could do 10,000 strikes.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.380
 - Wow, cool. - That's awesome, man.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.300
 - Yeah, the Rathland Island fog signal

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.100
 can be heard 20 miles away.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.820
 - So they've got an audio signal as well?

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.180
 - Yeah, yeah, they have a fog signal too, yeah, yeah.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.140
 It's pretty cool, they're very cool places, lighthouses.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.540
 You know the beautiful lighthouse lens that you see,

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.940
 which looks almost like a chandelier,

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.100
 it's got loads of cut faces, and sides, and edges,

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.260
 and it's incredibly complicated,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.620
 and it looks, you know, it's not just a big lamp.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.180
 That is the creation of a guy called

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.020
 Augustin Jean Fresnel, who was, by the way,

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.940
 the one who realized that light is a transverse wave.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.100
 Big deal guy. - Or is it, though?

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.180
 - Oh, okay. - So that's just

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.020
 a whole separate base. - I don't think

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.300
 we've got time to get into that, yeah, you're right.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.020
 - But basically, the lenses would have been incredibly heavy

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.300
 if you just made a single lens.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.860
 So he created this clever lens, which can be much thinner,

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.660
 but it has dozens of prisms, and they all focus the light,

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.100
 so you do get a beam using much less glass.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.220
 But the really cool thing about those heavy,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.420
 great lenses at the top, is they were created to float.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.140
 - Mercury. - And they float,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.940
 oh, mercury, they float in this mercury bath,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.860
 and it's so cool, 'cause mercury's so dense,

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.700
 it's 14 times denser than water,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.860
 and if you drop a lump of solid steel into mercury,

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.860
 it will float, and float really high up in it.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.980
 And so the whole lighthouse top was just floating

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.260
 on this gruel. - Seems quite dangerous.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.420
 - So dangerous. - Yeah.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.020
 - Don't call it a bath, if you're in that house with kids,

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.860
 they'll try and bath in that as well.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.660
 - What do you think the US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.380
 has in common with the English female cricketer

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.780
 who has the highest ever score in the test match?

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.780
 - Long arms.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.340
 (laughing)

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.740
 - Yeah, so she could change the light bulb.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.500
 - Change the bulb, how many lighthouse keepers does it take?

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.980
 Yeah, without going upstairs, yeah.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.140
 - Obviously as a cricketer, it's good to have long arms,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.980
 don't you? - You need long arms, don't you?

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.820
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's not that though.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.660
 - I think-- - What are they having?

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.500
 Okay, what are they having?

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.100
 Wait, wait, the US only lighthouse keeper on the--

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.980
 - The US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.420
 - I would guess you're not gonna guess it.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.260
 If it's the answer, I think,

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.500
 I reckon you're not gonna guess it,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.380
 unless you know we're on both of them.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.940
 - So this could be one of those long games,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.260
 like the other day, what was it the other day we had?

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.940
 - Oh my god, which artist?

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.740
 - Bloody stained glass arches game again.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.980
 - This is gonna last us way longer than that.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.820
 - Red and white. - Red and white.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.060
 - She doesn't live in a lighthouse.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:23.900
 - She does live in a lighthouse.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.300
 - Red and white. - But she lives in a lighthouse.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.780
 - But actually, we don't know that too.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.620
 Do you know where she lives?

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.340
 - Hang on, hang on, I do know this.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.980
 Okay, cricketers wear white, don't they?

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.540
 - And the ball is red.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.980
 Now, what are the typical colors of a lighthouse?

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.820
 They're red and white.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.540
 - Okay, so take that knowledge.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.380
 - Yeah.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.860
 - And forget about it.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.060
 (laughing)

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.260
 I try to think of something else.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.700
 - Okay, the Coast Guard surname is Lighthouse

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.700
 and her surname is Coast Guard.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.100
 - You're so close.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.900
 They have very similar surnames.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.740
 - Okay.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.740
 - Think of something that's white.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.260
 Something else that's white.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.100
 - You know the answer?

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.940
 - You know the answer?

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.780
 - Yeah.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.620
 - Cocaine, they're both called cocaine.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.460
 Jessica Cocaine.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.860
 The US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.340
 is called Sally Snowman and the highest score ever

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.340
 by an English female cricketer in a test match

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.940
 was by Betty Snowball.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.780
 (laughing)

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.620
 - Oh my God.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.700
 So it's not even something they've got in common.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.020
 It's just something quite similar.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:16.860
 - We've got the word snow.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.220
 (laughing)

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.060
 - Oh my God.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.900
 - I did.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.740
 I'd count that.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.580
 (laughing)

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.420
 - That's a real fair question.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.940
 - That's a million dollar question.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.780
 (laughing)

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.140
 That's like, who would know that?

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.580
 - James, what can my phone a friend be, James?

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.420
 (laughing)

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.860
 - I'm there going, option B please.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.860
 Red and white is the thing that links them.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.220
 (laughing)

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.180
 - She's about to retire Sally Snowman.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.020
 - Has she?

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.860
 - Yeah, last year I think.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.700
 - Which one, she, the coast guard?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.540
 - The lighthouse keeper.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.360
 - Right.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.180
 - No more walking in the air for her.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.180
 (laughing)

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.380
 'Cause when you're at the top of the lighthouse

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.180
 it must feel like you're floating in the moonlit sky.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.020
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.420
 I wonder if she blasted that out in times of fog.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.740
 You could hear her walking in the air.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.660
 - And abducted boys at night, yes.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.900
 - And now all that's left in that lighthouse

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.580
 is a solitary carrot.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.820
 (laughing)

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.460
 - Did you know that I am a member

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.700
 of the Association of Lighthouse Keepers?

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.540
 - Are you?

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.700
 - Did you join it just for this episode?

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.540
 - I joined it yesterday.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.380
 - Yep.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.220
 (laughing)

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.040
 - Really?

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.880
 - I gotta say.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.720
 - ALK.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.540
 - ALK.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.380
 - You an alcoholic.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.220
 - I am.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.060
 And it's fun.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.100
 - Have you got a posting yet?

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.780
 Do we have to do a podcast from Lighthouse?

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.980
 (laughing)

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.620
 - But you don't have to be a lighthouse keeper to join.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.460
 That's the wonderful thing.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.140
 - Evidently if you join.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.340
 Unless you've also got a job as a lighthouse keeper

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.180
 just to join.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.220
 - Lots of news guys.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.220
 No, but it's really good.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.780
 Just a quick shout out to them.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.460
 It's very reasonable price for a year's membership.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.180
 And I think you might get a sticker for your car.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.540
 - Anything else you get for it?

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.980
 - You get their quarterly journal, Lamp.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.820
 - Right.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.060
 - And I've read a bit of it.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.140
 I've read a sample online.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.980
 It's really good.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.800
 - Is it?

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.640
 What are they?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.100
 Is it largely just the latest in lighthouse news?

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.780
 - Shining a light on lighthouse news.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.620
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.440
 Yeah.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.980
 They don't do expo days or anything like that.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.220
 But it's just lots of news from the lighthouse community.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.060
 And you know.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.100
 - You've been quite cagey about how much it was.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.100
 But what is a reasonable price to pay?

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.100
 - Also, can I ask what is the sticker?

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.180
 Is it like my other car?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.340
 - It's a lifeline.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.660
 (all laughing)

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.600
 - My other headlamp is a Fresnel lens.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.740
 (all laughing)

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.080
 - How much was it?

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.380
 - Well, I don't want to say in flash,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.860
 but it was 18 pounds for a year.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.820
 - 18 pounds for one choke and we might cut out.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.940
 (all laughing)

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.260
 - They almost certainly will get that.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.100
 I know.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.540
 - I'm worried that this is going to take over your life

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.380
 gradually.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.740
 And when you quit the podcast in five years,

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.900
 this is the moment we should have known.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.580
 - Wow, you think I'm going to last five more years

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.740
 on this show?

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.900
 I've incredibly left it.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.100
 (all laughing)

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.220
 - I'll just have one weird lighthouse.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.700
 One of my favorite lighthouses is,

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.140
 I think basically an unnecessary lighthouse.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.560
 It's the lighthouse in Machias Seal Island.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.220
 So this is--

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.540
 - Machias Seal.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.340
 - Machias, M-A-C-H-I-A-S.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.180
 - Where's that?

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.020
 - It's a tiny little island just between the U.S.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.700
 and Canada, and it's positioning is crucial because--

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.180
 - It's a land border, most of that, isn't it?

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.020
 - Yeah.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:34:59.860
 - U.S. and Canada?

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.680
 - Famously.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.460
 - It's on like, if you sort of continue the border,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.140
 basically, it's in the Atlantic Ocean,

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.140
 a sort of--

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.980
 - Between Maine and--

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.660
 - Exactly, between Maine and New Brunswick.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.260
 And so it's disputed,

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.980
 'cause both countries want ownership

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.660
 of this tiny uninhabited island.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.460
 I think because you can claim fishing rights

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.460
 around a certain circumference of it,

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.660
 if you do claim it.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.160
 So it's been argued over since 1832,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.420
 and Canada, to stake its own claim for the last 25 years,

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.580
 has just kept a lighthouse keeper in a lighthouse

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:36.580
 on there, to stamp its identity on the island.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.340
 And it's this guy called Ralph Eldridge.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.180
 - Same guy?

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.740
 - It's been the same guy for 25 years, yeah.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.260
 It's actually two guys, and they alternate

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.900
 one month from one month off.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.740
 - Okay.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.460
 - But they're fun guys.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.540
 I read an interview with Ralph a couple of years ago

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.260
 where the interviewer said, 'cause it's just him,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.620
 the interviewer said, "Are you a lonely person, Ralph?"

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.180
 And he said, "Lone is the wrong word.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.620
 "Independent is better.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.260
 "Let's say I like me best of all."

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.620
 And then the interviewer just goes,

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.900
 "Divorced, Ralph?

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.740
 "Yes."

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.940
 (all laughing)

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.100
 - There was a bit of lighthouse news this year,

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.180
 so you might be seeing it in Lamp later on.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.020
 - Great.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.860
 - In your quarters.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.700
 - At least six months time.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.540
 (all laughing)

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.220
 - Who, what time was right?

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.860
 - And that was, there was a film festival

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.100
 which took place in a lighthouse this year.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:22.940
 - I know.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.780
 - It was a Swedish film festival,

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.580
 the Gotterborg Film Festival.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.900
 And 60 movies were played in total at this festival,

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.140
 and they were played entirely to one human.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.020
 - Did they use the light from the lighthouse?

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.860
 - As a projector.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.700
 - As a projector.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.020
 - Did you have to keep walking around?

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.180
 (all laughing)

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.660
 - There were 19 shipwrecks in it.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.980
 (all laughing)

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.780
 - The sailors were so entranced,

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.180
 watching Back to the Future 3.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.020
 - That's so cool.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.860
 - Yeah.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.900
 - Was it a particular kind of film,

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.020
 as in was there a genre?

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.860
 - No, no, no.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.220
 - There was that film recently with Robert Pattinson.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.060
 - Yes.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.900
 - The lighthouse.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.660
 - And they played two lighthouse keepers who were going mad.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.180
 - No, no, it's a collection of independent film making.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.020
 - Okay.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.860
 - Yeah, so every kind of genre.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.180
 - It sounds like a horror film festival.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.620
 You know, we're gonna trap you in the lighthouse

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.460
 and show you 60 films.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.380
 - Well, no, it was a COVID thing that happened.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.060
 And so they couldn't put the festival on as they wanted to.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.780
 And actually, sorry, I slightly got it wrong.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.500
 So it might've already been in a issue of lamp.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.860
 This was 2021.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.220
 So you might've missed out on the story just.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.860
 - I'm sure you can get back issues.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.460
 (all laughing)

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.900
 So yeah, the idea was they were gonna have to go online

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.100
 and just stream it online for the entire.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.820
 - That's literally the opposite of playing it to one person.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.260
 That's playing it to everyone with internet access.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.860
 - Yeah, but for one thing they wanted to do

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.780
 was make it special.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.900
 And so they did a competition.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.540
 12,000 people applied for it.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.220
 And this one person, Lisa Enthroth, won it.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.140
 And so she got sent by boat to this island.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.900
 They took away all of her electronics.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.420
 She had just a little iPad.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.740
 - It's a Salica horror film.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.900
 - It's a Salica horror film.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.300
 There was one person on the island

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.660
 who was checking on her once a day

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.220
 just to make sure that she was okay.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.700
 - The murderer, as he's always known, yes.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.380
 - And she was there for a week, watching these 60 films.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.100
 - So she had to watch about nine films a day,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.780
 which was presumably about 18 hours.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.620
 She's under-slapped.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.460
 - She hasn't had anything better to do.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.460
 - No, it's true.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.300
 - Did she have to watch them?

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.460
 Did she get tested on them afterwards?

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.180
 - The creepy caretaker of the island

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.620
 will do a little film quiz after every single one.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.220
 - And who played the butler?

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.420
 What does the cricketer, the better snowball,

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.740
 have in common?

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.320
 (upbeat music)

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.740
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.220
 and that is James.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.740
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 2007,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.260
 a Japanese arm wrestling arcade machine was recalled

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.740
 when it broke three players' arms.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.420
 (laughing)

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.260
 Amazing.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.660
 - See, I'm amazed it wasn't recalled

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.220
 after breaking one player's arm.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.060
 - Yeah?

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.620
 - No, they thought, let's let it break a few bodies first.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.700
 - No, I think they happened, all the breaks happened

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.020
 in a short enough time that they couldn't recall it

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.860
 before they-

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.020
 - It's an afternoon at the arcade that must have been.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.540
 You know, ringing the third ambulance.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.380
 Yeah, amazingly.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.820
 Actually, we are gonna contact the manufacturers now, yes.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.620
 - Possibly three kids who are holding it at the same time

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.860
 trying to beat the big boss.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.700
 - That's a good idea.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.540
 - Three snaps.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.740
 - They're all in the same trench coat

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.180
 standing on each other's shoulders.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.660
 - I'm afraid you've lost the arm,

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.420
 but we have replaced it with one of these claw grapples.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.100
 (laughing)

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.500
 - With which you won't be able to grab anything at all.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.460
 - Just try and have your breakfast every morning.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.820
 You just, you grab the spoon

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.140
 and then just drop it before it gets to your mouth.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.940
 No, so this is a company called Atlas

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.300
 and the game was called Arm Spirit.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.980
 And what they said, this was in an article from the BBC,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.220
 is that probably the players got a bit overexcited

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:47.260
 and maybe they twisted their arms in a slightly weird way

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.500
 'cause the game was, it was like a fake arm

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.700
 and then you would grab hold of the fake arm

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.540
 and you would play an arm wrestling game against it.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.260
 And they were like 10 levels

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.860
 and it went from the easiest level, which was a French maid.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.700
 - Okay.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.540
 - Famously weak, there's a lot of lugging to do

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.620
 when you're a French maid.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.860
 Some of those dusters are extremely heavy with all feathers.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.180
 - Look at George Eliot, that's where she got her hand from.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.060
 Milk and all them cows.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.260
 - I don't, French maid is not the same as like a cow maid.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.100
 - Milk maid.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.380
 (laughing)

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.980
 - French milk maids don't wear the little lacy outfit.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.820
 - They're quite different.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.380
 If you go to a summer's elas for a milk-made outfit,

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.820
 (laughing)

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.700
 do you mean French maid?

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.540
 No, no.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.380
 (laughing)

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.220
 - That makes sense.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.220
 - Or something like a milk and cow.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.540
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.620
 - After the French maid,

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.940
 you might fight against a drunken martial arts master,

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.620
 a Chihuahua dog and the final is against

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.620
 a professional arm wrestler.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.620
 And it gets harder and harder each time.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.460
 So in the end--

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.660
 - That's not the order I would put that in.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.660
 You're saying a Chihuahua dog

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.220
 is better at arm wrestling than a drunken martial arts master.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.340
 - Doesn't seem that way, does it?

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.980
 - How drunken, yeah, yeah.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.740
 - If he's unconscious, then possibly.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.900
 (laughing)

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.340
 - I can see though how an arm breakage might happen

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.620
 based on a video that I watched on YouTube.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.500
 There's lots of videos where you can see people playing,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.820
 not this game, not Arm Spirit,

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.420
 but there's another game called Over the Top.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.340
 And very similar.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.180
 I think it's exactly the same game, basically.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.020
 - I think that's--

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.220
 - Also, sorry, just for legal reasons,

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.820
 probably not exactly the same.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.140
 - Yes, probably.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.940
 There's no Chihuahua, for example, over the top.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.180
 And so you've got the big bulky hand there,

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.580
 and I watched a video of a super strong guy

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.500
 take on the final boss, and he was holding it,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.300
 and my god, he was like really going for it.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.300
 And someone leans over next to him and says,

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.220
 "Ah, when I tried to beat the big box,

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.900
 "I totally cheated, I lent in,

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.020
 "I got my arms underneath it, I went."

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.260
 So I can imagine, by manipulation of your body

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.580
 in weird ways to try and beat it,

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.140
 a snap might occur when you buckle.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.580
 - No, no, I can see that, yeah, yeah.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.180
 - Isn't Over the Top as a move, isn't it, in arm wrestling?

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.740
 - It's where you kind of twist your wrist a little bit.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.340
 - Oh, I thought it was where you put your fingers

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.420
 over the top of their hand.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.060
 But they're probably meant to be anyway.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.420
 If they're holding your whole hand in their hand,

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.100
 you're not going to do very well.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.100
 (laughing)

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.100
 - Okay, so can I just check with--

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.780
 - There are moves, there are proper moves in arm wrestling.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.780
 There are sort of, I think,

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.980
 a couple of dozen different techniques.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.500
 As in, if you're watching with an expert of the game,

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.900
 they'll say, "Ah, he's trying the French defense now,"

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.740
 or whatever.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.060
 (laughing)

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.340
 - He's wearing a French made outfit.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.700
 (laughing)

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.500
 - What were you going to say, Anna?

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.940
 - I was just going to establish it was the kids' fault.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.100
 That seems to be where we're landing on this.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.900
 The company said they were playing it in a weird way.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.100
 - Who do we think is likely to sue?

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.860
 I think it's the question we need to answer.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.380
 - I think there was no, as far as I could see,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.380
 I couldn't see any later news stories

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.780
 that explained whether anyone had sued anyone.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.620
 - I feel like some parents got some real,

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.540
 large quantities of cash behind the scenes for that.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.940
 - I don't know what that happened on that.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.180
 - But I wouldn't like to comment.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.340
 But arm breakage does happen in arm wrestling.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.660
 - relatively regularly.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.060
 Apparently this is according to John Jenk,

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.900
 who is the Guinness World Records greatest arm wrestler

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.740
 of all time.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.860
 He says that the people who break their arms

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.340
 tend to be beginners because you get incredibly strong

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.100
 when you're starting out arm wrestling,

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.900
 but you haven't actually built up kind of the bone

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.340
 and tendon resilience.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.620
 So you don't know your own strength.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.860
 You break your own arm.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.420
 He literally, you push so, so, so hard

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.100
 that your bone just snaps.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.820
 And it's really horrible.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.460
 There was a match in Cumbria in 2018.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.780
 It was like a farmers event.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.860
 And there were various kind of fun things,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.780
 like a little fairground ride or a little, you know,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.380
 shoot the tail of the donkey or whatever.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.780
 They do those things and is that what they do?

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.620
 - Yeah, it's not really.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.260
 - Welcome to Anna's Fair.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.740
 - Okay, look, this was nothing like my fantasy fair.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.780
 This was just a normal fair.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.860
 There was an arm wrestling contest.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.860
 A 20 year old girl broke her arm incredibly badly.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.940
 It sounds like she was resting another girl.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.140
 It was in a huge amount of pain.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.820
 Her opponent fainted,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.860
 which I can really imagine doing,

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.780
 if you're arm wrestling someone,

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.260
 you know when you see one of those snappages

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.580
 that were at a sudden right angle to the arm.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.420
 So her opponent fainted and then they interviewed,

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.260
 I think this was on the BBC,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.340
 they interviewed the paramedic, Andrew Dickinson,

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.660
 who said, this is what happened, the opponent fainted,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.180
 but he also added, the rest of the day

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.820
 was absolutely fantastic.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.140
 It ended in a dance where 600 people attended

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.580
 and we were on site until 1.30 in the morning.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.100
 - Is that good paramedicking?

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.940
 - I guess if you're the onsite paramedic,

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.300
 if you were summoned to take her to hospital,

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.820
 it's very bad paramedicking.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.980
 - It's not clear.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.340
 - They're starting the dance now.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.260
 Would you mind if we just kept the engine running

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.460
 a little bit longer?

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.700
 So I was, I always wonder,

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.260
 'cause I'm not actually a professional arm wrestler myself.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.100
 - No. - No, no, no.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.340
 I'm a member of the association.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.580
 (all laughing)

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.420
 - Look at the magazine.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.260
 - Yeah, slam.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.420
 - It's impossible to pick it up.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.020
 (all laughing)

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.140
 But I thought that the rule was

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.660
 that you couldn't hold the table.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.500
 - Right. - Okay.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.420
 - Actually, in the professional game,

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.380
 they install pegs in the table for you to hang on to.

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.220
 - Yeah. - Yes.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.860
 - So it's all about the rest of your body as well.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.700
 - Do you think? - Yes.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.520
 - I can believe it.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.700
 - Yeah, I thought it was just about your arm.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.940
 - Am I right?

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.540
 I've got an old memory of you, James,

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.500
 of you and me hanging out and you saying to me,

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.180
 "I have an unbeatable technique."

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.020
 - I do, yeah. - And then we did it

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.820
 and you almost broke my arm, basically, in my attempt to,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.260
 so you know how to not be facing.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.860
 - I do, but I have to really,

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.140
 you know, I have to trick you into position, basically.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.140
 - So why was upside down?

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.940
 - Okay. (all laughing)

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.180
 - There's a way, basically, if I was to arm wrestle you

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.940
 and we kept the table on my right-hand side

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.900
 and your left-hand side,

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.420
 and we arm wrestled on that table,

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.380
 then I would be pulling with my arm

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.020
 and you'd be pushing with your arm

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.500
 and the pulling muscle is way stronger

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.260
 than the pushing muscle, so you could beat anyone.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.540
 Then it's like a pub trick

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.420
 where you can win a pint of something, that kind of thing.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.500
 - Yes. - But if you got any brains

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.340
 on you, you insist, surely you do it over a table, right?

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.820
 - Yeah, but if you're in a bar,

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:42.260
 there might be a bar, right? - If you're on the bar.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.100
 - You know, that's why it works in a pub.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.220
 - Yeah, that's a good point, yeah, yeah.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.500
 - Anyway, I have injuries now,

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.780
 but it means I can't do arm wrestling.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.100
 I have something called tenosinivitis

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.420
 of the first compartment of the wrist.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.260
 It's a very common thing that arm wrestlers get.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.100
 And yeah, it's like arm wrestlers thumb, it's called.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.340
 - Did you get it from arm wrestling?

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.660
 - No, I got the version,

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.620
 which is also known as mom's thumb.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.860
 I got it from carrying my baby too much.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.060
 But you can get the same injury

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.140
 from carrying a baby in the wrong way

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.220
 as you can get from arm wrestling in the wrong way.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.060
 - It's better than getting the one

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.540
 they call wankers collar, isn't it?

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:29.140
 - So you mentioned John Brzenk, there, Anna.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.340
 He's the great arm wrestling champion.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.740
 So he is the guy who the main bit of culture

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.980
 about arm wrestling ever to exist in the world

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.140
 is based on. - Oh, what's that?

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.020
 - It's the movie over the top,

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.980
 which is a Sylvester Stallone film,

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.700
 which we have briefly mentioned fleetingly

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.940
 in passing in the past.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.060
 Basically, he plays a character called Lincoln Hawke,

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.140
 whose character's name changes about twice

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.480
 as the film continues.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.300
 It's not a level of attention to detail.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.820
 And he has to arm wrestle his way to winning a big prize

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.420
 and to a relationship with his son.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.940
 But it's based on John Brzenk.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.420
 And this is the really nice thing.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.220
 John Brzenk worked for decades as a mechanic

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.900
 at Delta Airlines so that he could arm wrestle

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.300
 because he wanted to travel.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.660
 His main expenditure was plane tickets

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.860
 to arm wrestling competitions.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.380
 Whereas if he worked as a mechanic at Delta Airlines,

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.020
 free transport.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.300
 - Does that also mean that if you're in,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.260
 let's say the world championships in Reykjavik

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.780
 or something and you want to go home,

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.980
 but there's a problem with the plane

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.940
 and he's in the middle of an arm wrestling championship,

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.780
 you have to wait.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.100
 - Everyone has to wait, yeah.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.780
 - If he sees a competitor heading towards the championship,

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.340
 he can mess up a piece on the plane.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.660
 - Oh, that's good.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.300
 - What?

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.260
 - He's just saying through a crash,

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.300
 just so it doesn't take off.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.500
 - Yeah, just throw something small into the end.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.260
 Anyway, but God, you wouldn't want to share

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.820
 an arm rest with him, would you?

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.660
 - No.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.500
 - Yeah, my man.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.340
 - Depends which song though.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.780
 Depends on the size.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.180
 - I think his, both arms are probably strong.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.020
 - I was looking at pictures of all arm restes,

00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.420
 desperately hoping to find like one puny,

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.740
 flaccid little stringy arm and one knee to arm.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.580
 - There is a difference though.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.700
 There is a difference in size

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.100
 and it's roughly the difference

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.300
 between George Eliot's head and James Harkin's head.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.540
 - That's the, yeah, five centimeters.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.420
 - Yeah, it's a bad, that's interesting.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.180
 - 'Cause you get some of them are experts

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.460
 with just the right hand

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.300
 and some of them are experts with just the left hand.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.780
 And I think the women's champion last year

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.580
 won both right hand and left hand.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.620
 - Wow.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:22.500
 - Forgotten her name.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.700
 - So are there people who just never play each other?

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.540
 - Yeah, of course.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.380
 - Yeah.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.220
 - 'Cause if you're right handed

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.420
 and there's a champion who's a left handed,

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.620
 how are you ever gonna meet them?

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.460
 - Yeah.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.620
 - You can't both sit on the same side of the table.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.460
 - Wow.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.700
 - What if you're good though at backhand

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.140
 or arm wrestling as such?

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.980
 - What do you mean?

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.300
 - So if I went that way.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.980
 - Well, like I told you, it's really hard to pull things

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.740
 that in that direction compared to pushing

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.820
 with your other muscles.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.620
 - Hang on, you also make sense of Andy's.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.620
 - We're sitting next to each other

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.020
 and I'm pushing this way

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.820
 and you're pushing this way.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.020
 - I don't think we've invented a new spark.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.860
 - No, hang on, I think we might have arm pulling.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:58.700
 Isn't that?

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.540
 You have exactly the same position as arm wrestling

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.380
 but you have to pull.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.500
 - You have to sit next to each other.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.140
 - Or you just have to pull.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:04.980
 You have to pull.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.340
 So you slam your own arm down.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.780
 - I mean, I think we've invented a sport

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.740
 that's even less excited to watch arm wrestling.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.900
 But are you saying they have the right handed

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.740
 champion trips and they say,

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.340
 "And now we're gonna have the left handed champion."

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.420
 - Yeah, it's different categories.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.900
 It's like different weights and boxing

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.460
 but you've just got different arms.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.900
 - Is there any other sport that does that?

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:19.740
 - Yeah, boxing.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.260
 You can only punch with your right hand

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.700
 and then some people are really gonna only

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:23.780
 punch him with their left hand.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.620
 - I don't believe you.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.380
 - No, that's because I've not done it in a dream.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.260
 - Can I just quickly mention with "Over the Top"

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.540
 this movie and with John Bridgenk,

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.820
 basically when "Over the Top" was going into production,

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.620
 they did a thing for part of the promotion

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.940
 where they actually set up this massive

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.340
 arm wrestling championship that was called "Over the Top"

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.140
 once the movie was green lit.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.780
 So they went, "Let's actually do this."

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.020
 And so they did it as this,

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.140
 both it was a sort of national thing in America

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.300
 but then they had international qualifying rounds

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.060
 that would happen in places like Japan

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.260
 and they had a final in Las Vegas.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.860
 And the final, when all of these competitors

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.540
 from all around the country came together,

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.100
 that was the footage that makes it into

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.700
 the final of the film.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.900
 And so, yeah, and so you see real arm wrestlers

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.100
 who were part of this big tournament.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.660
 - Well, you would have to have real arm wrestlers,

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.220
 otherwise you have normal actors.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.060
 (laughing)

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.940
 You would be like fake arms.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.660
 - The problem was is that they wanted to use

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.340
 real arm wrestlers to fight or to do the arm wrestle

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.020
 with Stallone in the final of the movie

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.060
 but they were all too big.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:22.900
 It was unrealistic.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.460
 - No, I thought they weren't big enough

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.740
 'cause it's more about technique.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.620
 They've got more normal arm lookings

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.180
 than the huge weightlifting muscles.

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.260
 - Some of them are massive arms.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.100
 - I don't know.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.140
 Dave Dean, who was the main arm wrestler at the time,

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.620
 was Jay Norris and he was,

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.540
 and they said this is so impractical

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.380
 that you would win this.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.300
 - Like for instance, Garth, all arms, Carlson.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.340
 - Well, he does sound like he's got big arms.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.180
 (laughing)

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.140
 Or tiny, the rest of him.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.220
 (laughing)

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.540
 - Such a weird name, isn't it?

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.380
 All arms.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.780
 - He doesn't play, he's got sort of nine arms.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.620
 - Yeah.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.140
 Terry Big Man Barton is another one.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.180
 They're all big then.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.180
 I've seen videos.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.060
 - They're very WD-40 nicknames, aren't they?

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.700
 They're not, they're no one's called

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.740
 the smoke screen or the diplomat.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.580
 - The next one I could find was Verne,

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.180
 the one armed bandit, Martel.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.580
 And I don't know why you're laughing

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.020
 'cause he lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.860
 - Did he?

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.180
 - Yeah, one of them.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.460
 - 'Cause then he was actually one armed?

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.300
 Oh my goodness.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.980
 - One armed bandit actually did have one arm.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:17.820
 - Oh my God.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.620
 - But yeah, he started going back into tournaments again

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.580
 after his accident.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.420
 - Right.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.220
 - Which, did he lose his good arm?

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.260
 - No, he lost his less good arm.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.820
 - That's incredible though, 'cause you can't hold on

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.860
 to the peg, doesn't it, so he couldn't use the zoom.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.420
 - So he became the best in the world

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.300
 in the non-able-bodied class,

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.820
 but he also came fourth

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.780
 in the regular able-bodied class once.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.740
 Which is pretty amazing.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:41.580
 - Yeah.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.060
 - Some arcade game stuff.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:43.900
 - Yeah.

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.660
 - You know those penny pushers

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.980
 where you put like two p.m.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.820
 - I love those.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.660
 - And there's like some shells.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.500
 - Oh yeah, I've spent more money

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.340
 than I'm comfortable with on those.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.180
 I love them.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.020
 - Me too.

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.740
 - Well, they're invented by a company called Comptons

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.020
 in 1964, and they were so sure

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.060
 that it was just gonna be a one-year thing

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.020
 that they didn't even put a patent on it.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.980
 They thought this will just be fun for one year.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.020
 Everyone will forget about it,

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.020
 so we're not gonna do that.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.780
 And then that's why you get them in all the arcades now

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.380
 'cause they weren't patented.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:13.100
 - But why do they steal my money so effectively?

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.860
 - Well, it's really interesting that.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.060
 So there's a hole where all the money goes down.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.300
 So it seems that when you put two p.m.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.380
 it's bound to come out right.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.640
 Eventually it'll come out.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.140
 So every two p.m. that goes in--

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.460
 - Should you call one two p.m. out?

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.300
 - Yeah.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.820
 Now the way to make money is to,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.940
 for some of those two p.ms to fall into the machine.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.140
 But surely you'd notice.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:32.980
 - Yeah.

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.100
 - You used to be able to notice.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.740
 There used to be a big hole in the middle

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.680
 and you see the two p.ms go down.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.300
 And that would be where, obviously, they made the money.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.060
 But now they hide the holes.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:42.980
 - Ah!

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.560
 - So there are holes on the side

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.260
 that the two p.ms go into.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.560
 And so not all of the two p.ms that go in come out.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.400
 - What? - And that's how they make

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.240
 the money.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.080
 - That's a swizz.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.920
 It's an absolute swizz.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.020
 - That genuinely is something that's been blown wide open.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.860
 I can't believe that.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.320
 So do they have to muffle the noise

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.700
 of the two p.ms sliding down the holes?

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.820
 - No, they must do, I guess.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.760
 - Because that's a noisy thing.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.380
 When you put your two p.ms at the top.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.400
 I sometimes resort to just banging in a fiver.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.740
 (laughing)

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.320
 - You're gonna be the fireman into the slush.

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.460
 - I have to pipe it down with a long pipe cleaner thing.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.660
 - Yeah, I think that'll get me a few two p.ms.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.120
 (laughing)

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.700
 (upbeat music)

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.360
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.320
 That's all of our facts.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.760

 In September, it's the final leg of nerd immunity.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.260
 It's an awesome night.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.320
 We're gonna do a live podcast in the second half

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.280
 and a whole show that you've never seen before

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.340
 in the first half.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.260
 It's stand up, it's facts, it's everything you want.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.860
 Come and see it.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.180
