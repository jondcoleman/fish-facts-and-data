1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,940
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,260
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,900
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,100
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,860
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,860
 and James Harkin, and once again,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,500
 we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,540
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,740
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,820
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,100
 My fact this week is that the author, George Elliott,

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,660
 had a massive head.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,780
 (laughing)

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,500
 - That's very similar to another fact

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,900
 that we've had a few years ago.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,220
 - This is sort of a sequel fact.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,460
 So for fans of the show,

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,420
 you might have remembered in episode 265,

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,940
 we delivered the jaw-breaking news that George Elliott

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,780
 had a secret.

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,700
 - Jaw-slapping news.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
 - Jaw-dropping news.

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,300
 - Yeah, the jaw-breaking news.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,140
 - My facts are really aggressive.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,580
 - The FEMA snapping news coming to you.

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,660
 So what was the news we delivered then?

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,140
 - So the jaw-dropping news, no breakage,

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,820
 is that 50 years after she died, for 50 years,

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,740
 was the fact that she had a massive hand,

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,700
 but that was a secret,

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,620
 and the family denied her having it.

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,420
 Anyway, so this was written in a book,

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,100
 which was back in the 1840s.

35
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,860
 So there was a biography that was put together

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
 of George Elliott by a writer called Matilda Blind,

37
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,460
 or Mathilda Blind.

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,020
 I can't get the exact pronouncement.

39
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,300
 - Could be Blinde as well.

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,140
 - Could be what?

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,980
 - Could be Blinde.

42
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,540
 - It's probably Matilde Blinde.

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,060
 - Matilde Blinde.

44
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,740
 And so Matilde Blinde wrote a biography of her,

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,860
 and she went round.

46
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,980
 - She's South African.

47
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,820
 - Matilde Blinde.

48
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,420
 (laughing)

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,260
 - She's a Kiwi.

50
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,580
 (laughing)

51
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,300
 - Sorry, she wrote an autobiography.

52
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,660
 - She wrote a biography.

53
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

54
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,380
 - A biography, and during the research period,

55
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,700
 she went to the farm where George Elliott used to live,

56
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,940
 and there was a couple there called the Braes,

57
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,500
 and it was Mrs. Cara Brae who told everyone

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,180
 that she had this big hand.

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,980
 However, when I was reading the book recently,

60
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,580
 I also discovered that her husband became obsessed

61
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,140
 with George Elliott because he noticed

62
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,620
 that she also had a ginormous head.

63
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,640
 - Was she just huge?

64
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,480
 - Was she a giant?

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,320
 - Was she a giant?

66
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,780
 - No, she wasn't that big,

67
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,540
 but I think that's why they were astounded

68
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,580
 by the size of her head.

69
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,500
 She was taller than average, I think.

70
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,860
 - Yeah, but you're not just dragging out

71
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,300
 for when you don't have a fact next time,

72
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,320
 'cause George Elliott had a massive elbow.

73
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,140
 (laughing)

74
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,820
 - It's quite possible we will be back

75
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,860
 at 100 episodes time with another feature.

76
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,060
 So Mrs. Brae wrote of her,

77
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,020
 she said she had her head was massive,

78
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,820
 her feature is powerful and rugged,

79
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
 her mouth large but shapely,

80
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,240
 the jaw singularly square for a woman,

81
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,620
 unbreakable at the sound of a powerful fact, I imagine.

82
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,180
 And so Mr. Brae said,

83
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,660
 "I need to get your head turned into a cast,

84
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,220
 "I need to take you to London,

85
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,740
 "and so we can go and we can do phrenology on it

86
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,060
 "and see how it's going to ring."

87
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,340
 - So phrenology is where you look at the shape

88
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,740
 of someone's head and you can tell their personality.

89
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,900
 - Exactly, that's right.

90
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,740
 It was very popular back in those days

91
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,360
 when people started trying to work out

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,020
 how the brain functioned and maybe certain bits of our brain.

93
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,500
 - Well they couldn't do palm reading on her

94
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,700
 'cause it'd be like going through Ella

95
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,180
 and showing to Tom Perdue.

96
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,000
 (laughing)

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,260
 - It sounds amazing, the report.

98
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,580
 So her head was, it was measured by a doctor

99
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,300
 called James DeVille and then it was analyzed

100
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
 by George Coombe who was one of the leaders

101
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,460
 of the phrenological movement in the whole country.

102
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,300
 So, you know--

103
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,180
 - She would have needed a very big Coombe.

104
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
 - Oh my gosh.

105
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,860
 (laughing)

106
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,380
 - And when he first saw the cast of her head,

107
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,820
 Coombe, 'cause he was doing the analysis,

108
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,660
 he was in the lab, I don't think I had a lab.

109
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,780
 But anyway, he took the cast for a man's head,

110
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,220
 that's how huge it was, 22 and a quarter inches.

111
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,040
 - How much bigger are men's heads than women's heads?

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,600
 - Statistically speaking.

113
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,820
 - My head is five centimeters bigger than George Eliot's.

114
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,700
 - But that's good, so this is just a bit bigger

115
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,860
 than George Eliot's head.

116
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,300
 - Yeah, yeah, so if anyone sees me in the pub

117
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,860
 and you're like, oh that's James from the podcast,

118
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,500
 imagine my head but five centimeters smaller

119
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,940
 and that'll be George Eliot's head.

120
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
 - It's like she's there.

121
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,780
 - So this is actually, now your fact has become

122
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,660
 kind of an insult to James 'cause what you're saying

123
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,980
 is James Harkin has a really massive head.

124
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,840
 - Compared to, but then men don't have larger heads

125
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,400
 in general than women, I think.

126
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
 - That's true, except for Andy, apparently.

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,120
 - I'm just looking at Andy's head.

128
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,200
 - Which Anna was saying at the top of the show.

129
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,960
 - Yeah, I'm not very comfortable

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
 with this line of inquiry.

131
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
 Have you ever, if just listening at home,

132
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
 have you ever seen a matchstick?

133
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,800
 - Imagine the head was a bit smaller.

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
 - It actually goes in from the match shaft.

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,080
 - Australians, you might know them as dick heads,

136
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
 those matches.

137
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
 - That's right.

138
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,800
 - Yeah, and funnily, at school,

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,440
 a lot of the kids were Australian matchmen.

140
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,780
 No, but so she was analysed by this phrenologist.

141
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,780
 So it said that her temperament was nervous lymphatic,

142
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,660
 which means active without endurance.

143
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,560
 And lo and behold, it turned out that she worked

144
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,020
 from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.

145
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,160
 So she was active, but didn't have endurance.

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,860
 And intellectual and all of this.

147
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,940
 - And she visited this guy over the years.

148
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,820
 Kume, she didn't just have her head sent to him

149
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,980
 via the casting.

150
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,060
 She actually was in his presence a few times.

151
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,900
 Well, that's what happened.

152
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,460
 You would make the cast of the head

153
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,860
 and you would send it to phrenologists

154
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,320
 who were keen to sort of measure the bumps and so on.

155
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
 - You just need to be very careful

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,380
 that you do specify cast before someone soars

157
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,460
 off their own head and turns it into a package.

158
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,420
 - Okay, here's the thing I don't get.

159
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,820
 What about your hair?

160
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,260
 So if you've got a huge hair,

161
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,300
 that will surely obscure the lumps and bumps on your head.

162
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
 - But you feel the bumps.

163
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,980
 You're not looking for the bumps.

164
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,940
 - But this is one of the things that opponents

165
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,740
 of phrenology said, you know, this is why it's nonsense.

166
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,520
 So Oliver Wendell Holmes.

167
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
 - Oh yeah.

168
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,180
 - Wait, who was he again?

169
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,580
 - I think he was a writer and a doctor, I think.

170
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,660
 - He was a celeb, Victorian celeb.

171
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,020
 - I just double checked 'cause in my head I went,

172
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,980
 oh, Sherlock's brother.

173
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,580
 And then I realized not a real answer.

174
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,060
 - Definitely not, no, no, no.

175
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,420
 But he wrote this.

176
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,060
 He said, could you tell how much money there is in a safe

177
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,460
 by kneading its knobs with your fingers

178
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,240
 when a man fumbles about my forehead

179
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,980
 and talks about the organs of individuality, size, et cetera.

180
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,500
 I trust him as much as I should

181
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,420
 if he felt the outside of my strongbox

182
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420
 and told me there was a $5 or a $10 bill

183
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,340
 under this or that particular rivet, which is fair.

184
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,180
 - Well, yeah.

185
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,220
 - So even at the time, people did say--

186
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,180
 - It was a long way of saying, this is bullshit.

187
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,020
 - Yeah. - Isn't it?

188
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,860
 - Yeah.

189
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,820
 - Why is it keeping such small value bills in a safe box?

190
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,780
 - Jesus, the point, maybe he's on holiday.

191
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,620
 - Even back then.

192
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,380
 - It's just the 1700s, that's worth a lot.

193
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,860
 - See, is it 1800s, isn't it?

194
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,740
 - I think so, yeah, yeah, that was his manner.

195
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,620
 - The idea was that, you know, you could have,

196
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,620
 your eyeballs almost pushed out even.

197
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,660
 And this, in fact, was the first, you know,

198
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,900
 the first instance of it.

199
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,620
 So, phrenology was coined,

200
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,460
 the idea of it was coined by Franz Joseph Gaul.

201
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,660
 And he said that he came up with the idea,

202
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,500
 or he realized it was the truth,

203
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,420
 when he noticed that classmates in his class

204
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,380
 could memorize these massive long bits of text.

205
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,940
 And the ones that could memorize it had quite bulging eyes.

206
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,300
 He said they had big salient eyes.

207
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,120
 And he said, this must mean that the organ of verbal memory

208
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,180
 is sitting right behind your eyes.

209
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,260
 And if you're really gonna remember yourself,

210
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,540
 it's pushing them out.

211
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,020
 So I don't know if your eyes just drop out of your face

212
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,820
 entirely if you've got a really good memory.

213
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,060
 But then, yeah, he's the father of it, really, wasn't he?

214
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,900
 - Yeah.

215
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,820
 - The thing I liked about it, though,

216
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,500
 is he wasn't this Gaul character.

217
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,220
 He wasn't onto the wrong idea, really.

218
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,820
 Because all he--

219
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,660
 - No, that's all right.

220
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,500
 I think-- - I think--

221
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,340
 - Wait a sec.

222
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,180
 - I think the way that--

223
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,300
 - Well, I mean, it was definitely all bullshit.

224
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,380
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely, but, you know,

225
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,300
 modern day brain understanding

226
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,020
 is that certain bits of the brain

227
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,460
 are compartmentalized to certain things,

228
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,540
 like music and so on, and emotions,

229
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,060
 and right-thinking, left-thinking, and all that.

230
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,580
 - He didn't come up with that idea.

231
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,140
 So someone else had come up with that idea,

232
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,340
 and he thought, oh, well, what if I took that idea

233
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,620
 and then made the bump thing a thing?

234
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,020
 - Right, I could just see that.

235
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,980
 If I was around at that time,

236
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,900
 I definitely would have believed it.

237
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,140
 It just sounds so obviously.

238
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,340
 - Yeah, well, obviously, yeah.

239
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,300
 - I think you would have as well.

240
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,140
 - Yeah, you would.

241
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,460
 - I mean, it's just quite--

242
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,300
 - I think I wouldn't.

243
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,640
 - It's very hard to put yourself in there.

244
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,020
 - My organ of credulousness is tiny, actually.

245
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,260
 (laughing)

246
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,100
 - Yeah.

247
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,660
 - Phrenology is basically astrology, isn't it?

248
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,420
 Or it was sort of a version of astrology

249
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,620
 in that it seemed to tell people things

250
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,660
 that were vague enough that they could go,

251
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,100
 yeah, that sounds exactly like me.

252
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 - Barnum statements.

253
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,860
 - It mostly wasn't, the reports you got

254
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,500
 from a phrenologist were very rarely.

255
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,340
 You're a wanker.

256
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,300
 It was always, oh, you've got a nice organ over there,

257
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
 some organ there, and I don't think,

258
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,620
 I don't think they've often said,

259
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,140
 "You've got the organ of the killer."

260
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,740
 - No, but they told everyone else.

261
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,060
 Actually, they did.

262
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,740
 - But it was used to suggest that other races were lower.

263
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,660
 It was used in a very racist sense.

264
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,320
 - And people believed it.

266
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
 Yeah, eugenicists.

267
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,580
 - To be honest, it was mostly used

268
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,260
 to whatever your belief was.

269
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,100
 - Yeah.

270
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
 - It was used to kind of strengthen that.

271
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,580
 So for instance, there was a woman called Mrs. Hamilton.

272
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,500
 She was known as, she was from Ayrshire,

273
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,820
 and she would go around talking about phrenology.

274
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,760
 But she said that because the bumps on a woman's head

275
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,300
 were generally the same as the bumps on a man's head,

276
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,780
 this proved that women had exactly the same

277
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,980
 intellectual capacity as men's.

278
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,820
 And she went around saying,

279
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,580
 "Yeah, well, you know, this proves feminism."

280
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,700
 See, I knew it was bullshit,

281
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,740
 but that is the nail in the coffin of phrenology there,

282
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,580
 isn't it?

283
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,420
 (laughing)

284
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,820
 What the hell's the odd about?

285
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,380
 Alderman got phrenologized.

286
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,140
 John James Alderman, the big bird man,

287
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,740
 did all the bird sketches and stuff.

288
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,580
 And actually, he was huge.

289
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,660
 - He wasn't a bird man.

290
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,980
 He was a man who studied birds.

291
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,220
 - He's a man who studied birds.

292
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,260
 - Easily, yeah.

293
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,620
 - The naturalist who was sort of the leading authority

294
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,940
 on birds that time,

295
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,180
 and his books were beautiful drawings.

296
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,260
 And he wrote in his diary,

297
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,700
 "I was astounded when I had my reading,

298
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,900
 'cause they said that I must be a strong and constant lover.

299
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,260
 An affectionate father,

300
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,180
 I would have made a great general

301
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,540
 that I was extraordinarily generous.

302
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,380
 I know all these to be facts,

303
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,100
 so I'm amazed that they discovered them."

304
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
 (laughing)

305
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,140
 - I'm amazed at the person who you're paying

306
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,220
 to do your phrenology said,

307
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,300
 "Oh, it apparently says you're very generous."

308
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,140
 (laughing)

309
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,860
 - Yeah.

310
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,460
 - You guys remember Aaron Burr?

311
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
 - Yeah.

312
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,460
 - Oh, Burr and Hamilton.

313
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,300
 - Yeah, yeah.

314
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,140
 - Of musical fame.

315
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,980
 - Vice President of America.

316
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,660
 - Well, Aaron Burr was cast.

317
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,420
 His head was cast, but after his death.

318
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,260
 - Ah, okay.

319
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
 - And they found that he had lots of secretiveness

320
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,780
 and destructiveness.

321
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,500
 - Did he die in the duel?

322
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,340
 - No.

323
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,740
 - No, he lived, he survived the duel

324
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,700
 and then ran away, I think.

325
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,220
 - Yeah, he died on his deathbed many, many years ago.

326
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,060
 (laughing)

327
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,900
 - Oh, he died on his deathbed.

328
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,740
 - That was such a mistake.

329
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,580
 - He should never have gone there.

330
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,420
 - He didn't die on the duel.

331
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,260
 - When you're in John Lewis,

332
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
 don't pick the deathbed.

333
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,060
 - Hi, I'm looking for a deathbed.

334
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,060
 - Yeah, are you sure?

335
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,900
 (laughing)

336
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,980
 - Some celebrity fans, just quickly?

337
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,820
 - Oh, yeah.

338
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
 - Oh, modern day ones?

339
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
 - No.

340
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,820
 (laughing)

341
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,540
 - Not Kim Kardashian or...

342
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,420
 - No, Arthur Conan Doyle?

343
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,260
 - Yeah, of course.

344
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,340
 - I mean, Arthur Conan Doyle, absolutely everything.

345
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,540
 - I wish I'd been friends with him.

346
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,800
 The pranking you could have got

347
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,820
 down Arthur Conan Doyle, that's been epic.

348
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,380
 (laughing)

349
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,660
 - Queen Victoria as well, and Prince Albert.

350
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,380
 They had studies done by George Cuny.

351
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,220
 - How do you say, Andy?

352
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,020
 When you say some celebrities,

353
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,460
 I thank God you're not bucking Celebrity Love Island.

354
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,300
 (laughing)

355
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,260
 Well, I've got as Queen Victoria and...

356
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,380
 - You'd want to see it.

357
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,140
 - You'd want to see it.

358
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,980
 - Dead.

359
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,380
 (laughing)

360
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,700
 - Was there a deathbed in there?

361
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,540
 (laughing)

362
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,420
 - Shit, love the deathbed.

363
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,180
 Anyway, they appointed him.

364
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,140
 - Barack Obama?

365
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,740
 - Oh, find someone living for I don't see.

366
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,580
 - End that sentence, James.

367
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,020
 - Yeah, sorry, he's into...

368
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,820
 - No, no, you don't let me finish my sentence.

369
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,660
 - Oh, sorry, okay.

370
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,260
 - Barack Obama is a subject

371
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,380
 of an incredibly weird book

372
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,060
 called The Phrenology of Barack Obama.

373
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,780
 It's a self-published book.

374
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,620
 - No.

375
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,580
 - By a guy called Bensa Magos.

376
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,260
 And apparently he looked at a mysterious headscar

377
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,020
 on Obama's head that the mass media refuses to discuss.

378
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,340
 (laughing)

379
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,660
 And according to him,

380
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,300
 this is evidence that Obama once had a horn

381
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,180
 and leads ultimately to the satanic endgame revealed

382
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,740
 by the demon horn of Mollock.

383
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,060
 - Oh, okay.

384
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,900
 - So...

385
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,420
 - I can't believe the Guardian isn't reporting on this.

386
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,540
 - That's outrageous.

387
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,780
 - It feels like he's missed the boat

388
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,100
 'cause he just served two terms

389
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,140
 and then left office in an orderly fashion.

390
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,980
 - What a taste.

391
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,420
 - Like, what's Mollock's endgame here?

392
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,220
 (laughing)

393
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,420
 - Maybe it took a while to find a publisher, who knows?

394
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,060
 (laughing)

395
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,020
 - Wow.

396
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,820
 - I'm definitely buying it, by the way.

397
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,660
 (laughing)

398
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,700
 - Sounds awesome.

399
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,060
 - Yeah, this guy, Coom,

400
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,940
 just going back to the casting of True Celebrities.

401
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,500
 He did very famous people.

402
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,420
 He did Prince Albert's head.

403
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,900
 So George Eliot was having her head done

404
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,580
 by the guy that did Prince Albert.

405
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,540
 He did William Blake as well.

406
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,380
 - Ooh.

407
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,540
 - Or rather, he studied,

408
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,060
 it was someone else who Coom didn't do it.

409
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,140
 It was the, there was a different person, wasn't it?

410
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
 Yeah, James DeVille.

411
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,740
 But where are these casts?

412
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,140
 Where's George Eliot's head?

413
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,020
 - This room, actually, is inside of the cast.

414
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,940
 - They used it to the Statue of Liberty.

415
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,260
 (laughing)

416
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,780
 - Such a good ending for the movie.

417
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,020
 - What a movie, for the phrenology movie.

418
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,380
 It's like, they never knew where it was.

419
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,780
 Whip pan out to New York.

420
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,620
 - And then just winks.

421
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,980
 - Yes, yes.

422
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,340
 Mount Rushmore.

423
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,180
 Pour their hands.

424
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,860
 - Gives a little thumbs up with his massive hand.

425
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,700
 (laughing)

426
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,280
 (upbeat music)

427
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,980
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

428
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,860
 and that is Anna.

429
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,540
 - My fact this week is that the chef

430
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,820
 who cooked for Lord's Cricketers on match days

431
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,700
 for 35 years was once asked to limit their meals

432
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,740
 to five courses, and she refused.

433
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,660
 (laughing)

434
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,540
 So this was a woman called Nancy Doyle,

435
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,860
 and she, yeah, she was the tea lady at Lord's

436
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,100
 for 35 years, until 1996, I think she retired.

437
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,140
 And she liked to make them large, large meals.

438
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,300
 So obviously in cricket, you've got meals codified,

439
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,340
 and you have to take your lunch break.

440
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
 It's in the rules.

441
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,140
 - It's so amazing that they're actually

442
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,220
 in the rules of cricket, it says,

443
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,540
 "Unless the umpires and captains together

444
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,140
 "agreter alter it, lunch shall be taken at the agreed time."

445
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,060
 It's actually in the rules that you have to have lunch.

446
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,940
 - And the captains of each team decide

447
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,540
 on what time lunch is happening,

448
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,820
 how long or-- - And the umpire, yeah.

449
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,580
 - I mean, what other sport has a conversation like that

450
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,780
 when you're about to flick the coin

451
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,700
 for who bats first or whatever, you know?

452
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,540
 By the way, what time--

453
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,380
 - When are we having lunch?

454
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,220
 (laughing)

455
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,060
 - What are we having?

456
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,260
 Well, we're having a roast today.

457
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,580
 (laughing)

458
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,780
 - How are we, you guys?

459
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,740
 - So Mrs. Doyle.

460
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,380
 - Mrs. Doyle, she, well, her typical menu,

461
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,740
 it seemed to be, for lunch you'd have soup,

462
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,300
 then a starter, then a roast.

463
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,420
 (laughing)

464
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,620
 Well, you've got to, 'cause you've got to moisten

465
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,820
 your palate, I suppose. - Absolutely, yeah.

466
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,700
 - Then a starter, then roast meat and potatoes.

467
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,100
 And she also served chips and vegetables.

468
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,220
 It's quite hard to know.

469
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,420
 This was just on an example list

470
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,980
 that I think Mike Brealy gave of what she'd serve up.

471
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,740
 Chips and vegetables, then a dessert, then a cheese board.

472
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,900
 Then you get back onto plate.

473
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,460
 But of course, in cricket, every two hours,

474
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,780
 'cause although they decide when you have meals,

475
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,220
 it's pretty much every two hours is the general rules.

476
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,620
 Roughly, for when you eat.

477
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,460
 So two hours later, you get back in,

478
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,780
 and she's made you a huge cake.

479
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,620
 (laughing)

480
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,460
 And there you go.

481
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,340
 So there was this moment where Mike Brealy said,

482
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,500
 in the '70s-- - It's Mike Brealy who was--

483
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,460
 - Mike Brealy was the England captain at the time.

484
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,220
 He said to her, "Do you know what?

485
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,780
 "I don't know if it's good for the game.

486
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,860
 "The guys can't stand up after lunch."

487
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,380
 And she replied, so she, you know, he was like,

488
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,260
 "Could we possibly make the meals a bit lighter?"

489
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,740
 And she said, "But in an Irish accent,

490
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,300
 "tell you what, Michael, I won't tell you how to feckin' bat

491
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,860
 "and you don't tell me how to feckin' cook, okay?"

492
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,700
 - Amazing, wow.

493
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,420
 - And that was it, and she was apparently terrifying.

494
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,860
 Someone called her a small yet volcanic,

495
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,820
 so I think he didn't ask again.

496
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,140
 - She also couldn't cook.

497
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,300
 I mean, it's in the case-- (laughing)

498
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,860
 No, it's not one of her whatsoever,

499
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,500
 but she said she'd never read a cookbook.

500
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,740
 She didn't use weighing scales,

501
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
 and she didn't follow recipes.

502
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,140
 - But that shows having a natural affinity to cooking.

503
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,300
 - Her organ of cooking was absolutely massive.

504
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,460
 (laughing)

505
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,140
 - She's taught by nuns, wasn't she?

506
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,860
 Like, she did get taught, yeah.

507
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,820
 She just didn't--

508
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
 - I think being able to cook without a recipe is--

510
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,740
 - No, that is the mark of quality.

511
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
 I found a bit of a scandal researching this fact.

512
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,940
 - Oh yeah, okay.

513
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,780
 - I thought tea in cricket was the most English thing.

514
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,620
 - Right.

515
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,700
 - It's not English, it's Australian.

516
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,540
 - No.

517
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,660
 - It was introduced by Australia.

518
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
 It was imported.

519
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,980
 Australia started doing this in about the 1880s,

520
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,580
 and then a captain called Joe Darling

521
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,900
 brought it over--

522
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,740
 - T Darling?

523
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,100
 - The T Darling in 1899.

524
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,880
 But even then, it was brought onto the field.

525
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,980
 So, like, they would bring you a cup of tea

526
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,820
 where you stood, and there were photos of England players

527
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,580
 just standing around with waitresses,

528
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,020
 you know, just bringing them a tea trolley, basically.

529
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,260
 And it wasn't standard until about 1905

530
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,140
 that players went off and had their tea,

531
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,420
 so it was an Aussie thing.

532
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,260
 - Very cool.

533
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,300
 - I don't know about that.

534
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,580
 - You were saying about how Nancy can't cook, Andy.

535
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,740
 She can't cook curries.

536
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,700
 That is one thing.

537
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,500
 - She can't cook anything anymore 'cause she is dead.

538
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
 - Yes, sorry.

539
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,260
 - She can't cook curries.

540
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,100
 - Death bed bed?

541
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,460
 It was a, what kind of death bed?

542
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,300
 - It was a death bed thing, yeah.

543
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,140
 Another cause of death, death bed.

544
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,700
 - No, she couldn't cook curries, I should have said.

545
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,260
 Because during tests, when England's playing

546
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,420
 people like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,

547
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,060
 they want to have food which they had at home,

548
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,140
 and so they want to have curries,

549
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,780
 and she couldn't cook them,

550
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,140
 and so she brought her daughter, Jeanette,

551
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,520
 and Jeanette, who was a nurse,

552
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,260
 was apparently a brilliant curry maker,

553
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,780
 so she would come in and make the curries.

554
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,620
 - I love that.

555
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,340
 - Just get professional cooks, guys.

556
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,180
 It's so weird.

557
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
 - No, no, no.

558
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,860
 - Professional cook.

559
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,700
 She was a nurse.

560
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,700
 - Get a nurse who might have left some really ill people

561
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,940
 to die.

562
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,540
 - I'm just gonna leave these death beds, I'll be fine.

563
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,780
 Curries have been a problem in the past

564
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,380
 for English cricketers, so when they do big tours

565
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,740
 of India and Pakistan, and in the '70s and '80s,

566
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,700
 when curry was less common here,

567
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,740
 and people weren't used to eating it,

568
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,500
 a lot of the players found it quite difficult,

569
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,020
 and Alex Stewart, in fact, who was a player in the '80s,

570
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,740
 said that he, basically, before they were doing

571
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,020
 a tour of India, him and Jack Russell,

572
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,900
 who, well, I hadn't heard of Jack Russell,

573
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,460
 but they couldn't hack the Indian food,

574
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,340
 and so before they'd fly out to Pakistan,

575
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,020
 they said they'd do a trip to Tesco,

576
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,500
 and they'd just buy,

577
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,420
 Alec would buy 43 chicken breasts,

578
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,980
 43 days worth of mashed potatoes,

579
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,580
 and 43 days worth of broccoli,

580
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,460
 and every day he'd just make himself chicken breasts,

581
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,620
 broccoli, mashed potatoes.

582
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,740
 - Did he say it'd go into India?

583
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,100
 - Yeah. - Quite a hot country.

584
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,660
 Are these chicken breasts refrigerated,

585
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,900
 or are they just loose in his case?

586
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,740
 - That is horrible.

587
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,060
 It just went into the separating chicken case.

588
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
 - Look, I think they probably

589
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,980
 had some kind of refrigeration technology.

590
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,380
 - I don't know if we ever mentioned this on the podcast,

591
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,180
 that when the Beatles went to India

592
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,580
 to see the Maharaja, no, not the Maharaja,

593
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,660
 the Guru, wasn't it? - The Guru, yeah.

594
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
 - They went to see their Guru,

595
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,500
 who was gonna teach them transcendental meditation

596
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,180
 and how to free their minds and all of this.

597
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,580
 And Ringo Starr took a suitcase of baked beans.

598
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,100
 - Yeah. - Did we say that?

599
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Great, great, great.

600
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,940
 - Well, that's 'cause he had digestion problems

601
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,660
 from childhood when he was hospitalized

602
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,500
 and nearly died in hospital.

603
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,420
 - Wow. - Whoa.

604
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,740
 - Just getting the facts in.

605
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,980
 - Whereas Alex Stewart was just being a bit of a fool,

606
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,860
 which in fact, Atherton wrote in his autobiography,

607
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,580
 and I feel like this might cause some tension

608
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,420
 with your teammate.

609
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,180
 So Atherton was in captain work, played with Stewart,

610
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,500
 said, "Alex Stewart has a narrow focus on sport and life.

611
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,300
 I do wonder," and he said this of his meal choices in India,

612
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,580
 "I do wonder whether he'll look back with regret

613
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,940
 at some of the missed opportunities

614
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,260
 that touring life offers." - Wow.

615
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,340
 - But you could say the same about me when we go on tour.

616
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,500
 - That's true. - And I'm sure you all three do.

617
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,260
 I don't hear you, though, because it's after 9 p.m.

618
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,100
 and I'm in bed.

619
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,540
 - You do have a lot of courses on your breakfast,

620
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,340
 everyone, don't you? - Oh my God, yes you do.

621
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,740
 - That's true, but I have brought them all from home

622
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,940
 and I've stopped them in the suitcase.

623
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,540
 I've just brought 350 waffles.

624
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,260
 - I went to a cricket match once

625
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,020
 and it was sponsored by Sauri Maltloaf.

626
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,660
 - Oh, lovely. - Yeah, delicious.

627
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,980
 - And so there was a guy there

628
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,220
 and he was handing out free bits of Maltloaf to everyone.

629
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,580
 But no one really likes Maltloaf

630
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,100
 and everyone likes beer watching like a shirt cricket.

631
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,180
 And so everyone just started throwing Maltloaf at him.

632
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
 - Oh my God.

633
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,380
 - And he refused to give any more Maltloaf to anyone

634
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,540
 and everyone got really upset

635
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,300
 because they wouldn't give him any Maltloaf.

636
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,380
 - But how come they only wanted it

637
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,260
 to throw at the guy and hang it up?

638
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,220
 If he removes himself, the loop closes.

639
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,540
 - Well, he did exactly the right thing

640
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,060
 as far as I'm concerned.

641
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,860
 But the 20,000 people in Old Trafford

642
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,020
 did not see it the same way.

643
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,420
 - I love Maltloaf.

644
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,380
 I'd have been, I'd have been grubbing around

645
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,420
 drinking it up with my big net standing near him.

646
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
 - What is it?

647
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,100
 I don't think I've had it.

648
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,940
 - It's absolutely delicious.

649
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,340
 We're not sponsored this week by Maltloaf,

650
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,300
 but I do really, sorry, if you're listening.

651
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,860
 It's a kind of fruity bread, basically.

652
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,100
 - Yeah, it's very delicious.

653
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,820
 - Although I think any beer drinker worth his salt,

654
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,660
 if he loves beer that much,

655
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,540
 can turn a Maltloaf into a beer.

656
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
 It's got malt in it, surely.

657
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,380
 - You blend that.

658
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,060
 - And a cricket match over five days.

659
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,220
 Eventually it's gonna ferment.

660
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,860
 - Exactly.

661
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,020
 Just on a sort of eating and drinking in cricket

662
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,100
 and drinking specifically,

663
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,900
 there's a guy, a cricket called Gary Sobers,

664
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,860
 and I want you to remember that.

665
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,820
 - Oh, I see why we're going here.

666
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,660
 - That's where the work out

667
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,820
 which road you're gonna go down now.

668
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,860
 - Almost a sentence person.

669
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,700
 - You need up to be, he's my son.

670
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,220
 - Yeah, if he married, if he married in double barrel

671
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,460
 with Helen up.

672
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,300
 - Yeah.

673
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,500
 (laughing)

674
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,580
 Anyway, Gary Sobers,

675
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,580
 he batted his last century while drunk.

676
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,060
 - And not even just a bit tipsy.

677
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,180
 This sounds like a mad experience.

678
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,220
 So he was playing at Lord's.

679
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,540
 He played for the West Indies

680
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,340
 and he'd been out clubbing until nine in the morning.

681
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,180
 (laughing)

682
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,140
 And he was batting that day

683
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,660
 and he was going straight into bat.

684
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,620
 So he got in at nine.

685
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,540
 He's completely hammered

686
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,180
 and drank, solidly drinking for, you know, 12 hours straight.

687
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,460
 He batted amazingly well.

688
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,060
 He hit 132, extraordinary.

689
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,620
 But then begged to be taken off

690
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,060
 'cause he said suddenly he sort of started to sober up.

691
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,900
 - He started to come down.

692
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,020
 - Solidly up to the name of the come down

693
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,540
 and the sobering up and the hangover.

694
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,460
 So he was taken off with a stomach complaint

695
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,140
 after batting 132.

696
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,760
 And then he was brought off,

697
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,340
 but felt quite bad about it.

698
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,460
 And so ended up being apparently,

699
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,380
 according to him, revived

700
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,780
 for the couple of large port and brandies.

701
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,620
 - Oh my God.

702
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,460
 - I didn't know.

703
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,740
 - Port and brandy.

704
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,700
 I've not heard of that as a drink.

705
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,540
 - No.

706
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,060
 - It's not like a very old fashioned Jagerbomb basically.

707
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,900
 (laughing)

708
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,020
 - I think that was what it was.

709
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,860
 - Yeah.

710
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,820
 - Can you come back onto cricket?

711
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,660
 I thought once you got off the--

712
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,500
 - That's sick.

713
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,340
 - Yeah.

714
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,160
 - Oh, okay.

715
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
 - I didn't know that.

716
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

717
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,780
 - So he returned.

718
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,020
 He returned to hit 150, not out,

719
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,500
 and then the England retired.

720
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
 - Wow.

721
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,220
 - What if the drinking still goes up?

722
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,460
 W.G. Grace, for example.

723
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,860
 So he was around in the late 1800s.

724
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,820
 His choice of drink during matches

725
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,620
 was if he was coming off,

726
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,540
 he would drink champagne during the match

727
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,380
 all the way through.

728
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,980
 And at lunch, he would have whiskey as his choice of drink.

729
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,900
 So he was bladded the whole time

730
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,540
 that he was playing.

731
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,820
 Or, you know, comfortably marry as opposed to drunk.

732
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,140
 I wonder if that still happens.

733
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,980
 - Of course it doesn't.

734
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,420
 And I think this is one of the great tragedies

735
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,100
 of all sports, 'cause of course it doesn't,

736
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,900
 'cause they've all changed in the last 30 years

737
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,200
 so dramatically.

738
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,060
 Like anything you watch, tennis, football, cricket.

739
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,220
 - None of them are pissed.

740
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,060
 (laughing)

741
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,880
 - It's ridiculous.

742
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,200
 - It's so cold sober and they're eating these crazy diets.

743
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,020
 I think there should be a rule that says

744
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,300
 no professional sportspeople are allowed to eat anything

745
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,940
 outside of what they would normally eat or drink.

746
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,060
 And then you just have to play like that,

747
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,180
 which is basically how they did it

748
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,500
 until the 70s or 80s, isn't it?

749
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,980
 - Agassi won quite seminal match in his career

750
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,180
 with a giant hangover from the night before.

751
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,060
 And he played so well with the hangover

752
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,940
 that he did think, am I gonna have to do this

753
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,260
 for every match?

754
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,100
 - Wow.

755
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,940
 - This is so good.

756
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,420
 - And it's kind of like, what's the chop?

757
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,420
 The same bolt.

758
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,100
 Who, at the Beijing Olympics, I think, 2008,

759
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
 he pretty much only had chicken nuggets.

760
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,180
 - Yeah, 'cause I didn't think he trusted

761
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,700
 the local cuisine to the rest of the thing.

762
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,540
 - He brought them all.

763
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,860
 He brought 43 days work and they were pretty off by the end.

764
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,500
 - There are two cricketers for India

765
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,380
 called Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kisham.

766
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,580
 And when they get together, they just eat any old crap.

767
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,100
 And apparently their favorite thing is they get a bun,

768
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,660
 they put some chocolate ice cream on the bread,

769
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,980
 and then they put Nando sauce on top of that,

770
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,140
 and then they put a piece of chicken on top of that,

771
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,340
 and they eat it, and they reckon if you eat that,

772
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,340
 it guarantees you're gonna score runs the next day.

773
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,540
 - Right. - Wow.

774
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
 - Has anyone put it to a scientific testing,

775
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,620
 rigorous testing process?

776
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,540
 - These are great cricketers, you know?

777
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,380
 - Okay, yeah.

778
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,820
 - It's two of the best in the world.

779
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,620
 - Yeah, Ash, they're doing what you want, Anna.

780
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,860
 They're just combining all the unhealthy foods into one meal.

781
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,700
 - Like, I'm very hard to please, yeah, yeah.

782
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,540
 Get on them.

783
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,500
 - But Sri Lankan cricketers have been banned

784
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,980
 from eating biscuits this a few years ago, actually.

785
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,020
 But they were losing games,

786
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,540
 and the government decided to get involved,

787
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,420
 and the Sri Lankan government gave them an ultimatum

788
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,660
 and said, "Start winning matches,

789
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,860
 "or we're gonna get rid of your biscuits."

790
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,820
 And they didn't win matches, and they lost their biscuits.

791
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,660
 - No.

792
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,340
 - And Lassith Malinga, who's a really famous bowler,

793
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,860
 he talked about the comments of the sports minister

794
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,620
 and said, "What does a monkey know

795
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,740
 "about a parrot's nesting hollow?"

796
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,540
 - What an amazing burn.

797
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,780
 - Is that so? - That's a sick bit of sledging.

798
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,420
 - I just love the idea of one of them going into a shop

799
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,940
 trying to buy some biscuits,

800
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,420
 and the shopkeeper looking under the counter

801
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,140
 where the entire squad's photos are up.

802
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,540
 - To be honest, if Lassith Malinga is very clear

803
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,740
 what he looks like, he's...

804
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,620
 - Okay, he's distinctive looking.

805
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,860
 - Very distinctive.

806
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,220
 There's no way he got a biscuit in the whole country.

807
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,380
 (laughing)

808
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,540
 - Loaturing outside a shop asking for a 10-year-old,

809
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,380
 "What do I mean?

810
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,620
 "Couldn't get me some garibaldies, could you please?"

811
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,860
 (laughing)

812
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,440
 (upbeat music)

813
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

814
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,300
 and that is Andy.

815
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,900
 - My fact is that Northern Ireland

816
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,300
 contains the world's only upside-down lighthouse.

817
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,740
 (laughing)

818
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,580
 - How soon was that an architectural cock up?

819
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,540
 - Or maybe to scare moles away from the...

820
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,500
 - Exactly, a massive mole problem, aquatic moles,

821
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,420
 and no, it is so weird, 'cause genuinely,

822
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,100
 it's not just a low, it's got a tower,

823
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,540
 but the tower is above the light.

824
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,660
 - But it's just for anyone who's picturing in their head

825
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,740
 a lighthouse that's been flipped upside down.

826
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,300
 It's unfortunately not at all like that,

827
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,500
 it is in no way that...

828
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,820
 - I'm sorry, it is exactly that.

829
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,260
 - Andy, explain exactly what it is.

830
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,900
 We'll see if it's exactly what Dan thinks it is.

831
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,540
 - It's on an island called Rathland,

832
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,100
 which is off the coast of Northern Ireland,

833
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,300
 and the lighthouse was built into the cliff face

834
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,820
 at the island's edge, and they wanted a lighthouse

835
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,140
 'cause they wanted to warn shipping about the island,

836
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,980
 and its presence, but the problem is,

837
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,940
 the island is often covered in fog.

838
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,260
 It's covered in fog, so if you were to have the lighthouse

839
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,980
 installed on the cliffs at the bottom of the cliffs,

840
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,900
 and the light up at the top of the cliffs,

841
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,580
 the light would be lost in the fog.

842
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,220
 So they built the tower, which is where all the supplies

843
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,100
 are kept, and the stalls, and the spare lenses

844
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,620
 for the light bulb, and all of this stuff,

845
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,020
 but the actual light itself is at the bottom of the cliffs,

846
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,180
 and that's the thing that means it can be seen more.

847
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,740
 - So it's like they've sliced the top off a lighthouse,

848
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,380
 and then put it down in front of the rest of the lighthouse.

849
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,220
 - Exactly.

850
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,260
 - Or have they put it all in reverse order?

851
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,620
 - No, you have to climb down the stairs,

852
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,060
 upside down, together, yeah.

853
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,180
 - Yeah, so it's sort of a little,

854
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
 it's sitting in front of the tower,

855
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,020
 it's not directly underneath the tower.

856
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,940
 - So it's a lighthouse, and the bulb is at the bottom,

857
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,660
 not at the top, it's an upside down lighthouse.

858
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,340
 - So it's not like in the daytime,

859
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,060
 it makes a dark area.

860
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,300
 (laughing)

861
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,980
 - That's an inside out lighthouse.

862
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,140
 - Yeah, that's okay, sorry, yeah.

863
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,820
 I always go the next step.

864
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,580
 And it's just a very cool thing.

865
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,860
 And it was built in about 1912, I think,

866
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,260
 so it's 110 years old now.

867
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,260
 And also, I read this about Rathland Island,

868
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,580
 I can't, I don't know if it's true,

869
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,300
 that it's the island where Robert the Bruce went

870
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,220
 after a battle, and it's where he saw the useless spider.

871
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,420
 - That is true, well, the fact that,

872
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,700
 whether that happened or not,

873
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,980
 it's definitely said to have happened on Rathland,

874
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,180
 said to have happened in a cave

875
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,220
 underneath the lighthouse, but not that lighthouse.

876
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,060
 (laughing)

877
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,260
 - There's an east lighthouse and a west lighthouse,

878
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,500
 and the Robert the Bruce one is the other one.

879
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,340
 - Okay, okay.

880
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,140
 - So the story is, isn't it that he was in a,

881
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,220
 yeah, a Scottish guy, he's gone away

882
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,860
 from where the battles are, he's sat down,

883
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,660
 he's worried, there's a spider there,

884
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,420
 the spider keeps trying to make a web,

885
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,380
 keeps trying to jump over, keeps failing,

886
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,420
 and eventually he makes it and he thinks,

887
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,020
 if at first you don't see, try, try again,

888
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,700
 and he goes back and gets dashed on the rocks

889
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,780
 because of this useless lighthouse,

890
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,060
 the lights at the bottom.

891
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,900
 They also have fog bells sometimes, lighthouses,

892
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,060
 'cause it is a problem, a lot,

893
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,260
 that you can't see a lighthouse if it's obscured by fog,

894
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,460
 and it sounds like they haven't really cracked it,

895
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,700
 so they have bells, which A is a lighthouse keeper,

896
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,300
 I suppose, or you had to in the olden days

897
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,180
 before everything was automated,

898
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,700
 you had to just ring them kind of constantly,

899
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,220
 so I think you'd ring them about two rings

900
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,020
 every 15 seconds in fog to let ships know

901
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,220
 that you were there, and it only traveled about 100 meters,

902
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,540
 so I think the light from whitehouses

903
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,620
 can travel many, many kilometers, can't it?

904
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,700
 Seven, eight, nine, more than that, kilometers,

905
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,180
 but it couldn't travel that far,

906
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,220
 and you could wind them up the bells,

907
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,060
 so you'd wind them up really, really, really far,

908
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,660
 and then it could, as it unwound, like a clock,

909
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,420
 it could do 10,000 strikes.

910
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,380
 - Wow, cool. - That's awesome, man.

911
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,300
 - Yeah, the Rathland Island fog signal

912
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,100
 can be heard 20 miles away.

913
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,820
 - So they've got an audio signal as well?

914
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,180
 - Yeah, yeah, they have a fog signal too, yeah, yeah.

915
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,140
 It's pretty cool, they're very cool places, lighthouses.

916
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,540
 You know the beautiful lighthouse lens that you see,

917
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,940
 which looks almost like a chandelier,

918
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,100
 it's got loads of cut faces, and sides, and edges,

919
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,260
 and it's incredibly complicated,

920
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,620
 and it looks, you know, it's not just a big lamp.

921
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,180
 That is the creation of a guy called

922
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,020
 Augustin Jean Fresnel, who was, by the way,

923
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,940
 the one who realized that light is a transverse wave.

924
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,100
 Big deal guy. - Or is it, though?

925
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,180
 - Oh, okay. - So that's just

926
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,020
 a whole separate base. - I don't think

927
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,300
 we've got time to get into that, yeah, you're right.

928
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,020
 - But basically, the lenses would have been incredibly heavy

929
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,300
 if you just made a single lens.

930
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,860
 So he created this clever lens, which can be much thinner,

931
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,660
 but it has dozens of prisms, and they all focus the light,

932
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,100
 so you do get a beam using much less glass.

933
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,220
 But the really cool thing about those heavy,

934
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,420
 great lenses at the top, is they were created to float.

935
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,140
 - Mercury. - And they float,

936
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,940
 oh, mercury, they float in this mercury bath,

937
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,860
 and it's so cool, 'cause mercury's so dense,

938
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,700
 it's 14 times denser than water,

939
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,860
 and if you drop a lump of solid steel into mercury,

940
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,860
 it will float, and float really high up in it.

941
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,980
 And so the whole lighthouse top was just floating

942
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,260
 on this gruel. - Seems quite dangerous.

943
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,420
 - So dangerous. - Yeah.

944
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,020
 - Don't call it a bath, if you're in that house with kids,

945
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,860
 they'll try and bath in that as well.

946
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,660
 - What do you think the US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper

947
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,380
 has in common with the English female cricketer

948
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,780
 who has the highest ever score in the test match?

949
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
 - Long arms.

950
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,340
 (laughing)

951
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,740
 - Yeah, so she could change the light bulb.

952
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,500
 - Change the bulb, how many lighthouse keepers does it take?

953
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,980
 Yeah, without going upstairs, yeah.

954
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,140
 - Obviously as a cricketer, it's good to have long arms,

955
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,980
 don't you? - You need long arms, don't you?

956
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,820
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's not that though.

957
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,660
 - I think-- - What are they having?

958
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,500
 Okay, what are they having?

959
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,100
 Wait, wait, the US only lighthouse keeper on the--

960
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,980
 - The US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper.

961
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,420
 - I would guess you're not gonna guess it.

962
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,260
 If it's the answer, I think,

963
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,500
 I reckon you're not gonna guess it,

964
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,380
 unless you know we're on both of them.

965
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,940
 - So this could be one of those long games,

966
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,260
 like the other day, what was it the other day we had?

967
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,940
 - Oh my god, which artist?

968
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,740
 - Bloody stained glass arches game again.

969
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,980
 - This is gonna last us way longer than that.

970
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,820
 - Red and white. - Red and white.

971
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,060
 - She doesn't live in a lighthouse.

972
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,900
 - She does live in a lighthouse.

973
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,300
 - Red and white. - But she lives in a lighthouse.

974
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,780
 - But actually, we don't know that too.

975
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,620
 Do you know where she lives?

976
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,340
 - Hang on, hang on, I do know this.

977
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,980
 Okay, cricketers wear white, don't they?

978
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,820
 - Oh, yeah.

979
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,540
 - And the ball is red.

980
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,980
 Now, what are the typical colors of a lighthouse?

981
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,820
 They're red and white.

982
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,540
 - Okay, so take that knowledge.

983
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,380
 - Yeah.

984
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,860
 - And forget about it.

985
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,060
 (laughing)

986
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,260
 I try to think of something else.

987
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,700
 - Okay, the Coast Guard surname is Lighthouse

988
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
 and her surname is Coast Guard.

989
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,100
 - You're so close.

990
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,900
 They have very similar surnames.

991
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,740
 - Okay.

992
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
 - Think of something that's white.

993
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,260
 Something else that's white.

994
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,100
 - You know the answer?

995
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,940
 - You know the answer?

996
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,780
 - Yeah.

997
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,620
 - Cocaine, they're both called cocaine.

998
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,460
 Jessica Cocaine.

999
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,300
 - Oh, yeah.

1000
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,860
 The US Coast Guard's only lighthouse keeper

1001
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,340
 is called Sally Snowman and the highest score ever

1002
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
 by an English female cricketer in a test match

1003
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,940
 was by Betty Snowball.

1004
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,780
 (laughing)

1005
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,620
 - Oh my God.

1006
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,700
 So it's not even something they've got in common.

1007
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,020
 It's just something quite similar.

1008
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,860
 - We've got the word snow.

1009
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,220
 (laughing)

1010
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,060
 - Oh my God.

1011
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,900
 - I did.

1012
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,740
 I'd count that.

1013
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,580
 (laughing)

1014
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,420
 - That's a real fair question.

1015
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,940
 - That's a million dollar question.

1016
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,780
 (laughing)

1017
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,140
 That's like, who would know that?

1018
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,580
 - James, what can my phone a friend be, James?

1019
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,420
 (laughing)

1020
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,860
 - I'm there going, option B please.

1021
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
 Red and white is the thing that links them.

1022
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,220
 (laughing)

1023
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,180
 - She's about to retire Sally Snowman.

1024
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,020
 - Has she?

1025
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,860
 - Yeah, last year I think.

1026
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,700
 - Which one, she, the coast guard?

1027
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,540
 - The lighthouse keeper.

1028
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,360
 - Right.

1029
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,180
 - No more walking in the air for her.

1031
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
 (laughing)

1032
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,380
 'Cause when you're at the top of the lighthouse

1033
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,180
 it must feel like you're floating in the moonlit sky.

1034
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,020
 - Yeah, that's good.

1035
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,420
 I wonder if she blasted that out in times of fog.

1036
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,740
 You could hear her walking in the air.

1037
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,660
 - And abducted boys at night, yes.

1038
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,900
 - And now all that's left in that lighthouse

1039
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,580
 is a solitary carrot.

1040
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,820
 (laughing)

1041
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,460
 - Did you know that I am a member

1042
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,700
 of the Association of Lighthouse Keepers?

1043
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
 - Are you?

1044
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,700
 - Did you join it just for this episode?

1045
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,540
 - I joined it yesterday.

1046
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,380
 - Yep.

1047
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,220
 (laughing)

1048
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,040
 - Really?

1049
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,880
 - I gotta say.

1050
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,720
 - ALK.

1051
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,540
 - ALK.

1052
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,380
 - You an alcoholic.

1053
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,220
 - I am.

1054
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,060
 And it's fun.

1055
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,100
 - Have you got a posting yet?

1056
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,780
 Do we have to do a podcast from Lighthouse?

1057
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,980
 (laughing)

1058
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,620
 - But you don't have to be a lighthouse keeper to join.

1059
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,460
 That's the wonderful thing.

1060
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,140
 - Evidently if you join.

1061
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,340
 Unless you've also got a job as a lighthouse keeper

1062
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,180
 just to join.

1063
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,220
 - Lots of news guys.

1064
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,220
 No, but it's really good.

1065
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,780
 Just a quick shout out to them.

1066
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,460
 It's very reasonable price for a year's membership.

1067
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,180
 And I think you might get a sticker for your car.

1068
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,540
 - Anything else you get for it?

1069
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,980
 - You get their quarterly journal, Lamp.

1070
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,820
 - Right.

1071
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,060
 - And I've read a bit of it.

1072
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,140
 I've read a sample online.

1073
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,980
 It's really good.

1074
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,800
 - Is it?

1075
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,640
 What are they?

1076
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,100
 Is it largely just the latest in lighthouse news?

1077
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,780
 - Shining a light on lighthouse news.

1078
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,620
 - Yeah, exactly.

1079
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,440
 Yeah.

1080
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,980
 They don't do expo days or anything like that.

1081
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,220
 But it's just lots of news from the lighthouse community.

1082
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,060
 And you know.

1083
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,100
 - You've been quite cagey about how much it was.

1084
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
 But what is a reasonable price to pay?

1085
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
 - Also, can I ask what is the sticker?

1086
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,180
 Is it like my other car?

1087
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,340
 - It's a lifeline.

1088
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,660
 (all laughing)

1089
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,600
 - My other headlamp is a Fresnel lens.

1090
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,740
 (all laughing)

1091
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,080
 - How much was it?

1092
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,380
 - Well, I don't want to say in flash,

1093
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,860
 but it was 18 pounds for a year.

1094
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,820
 - 18 pounds for one choke and we might cut out.

1095
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,940
 (all laughing)

1096
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,260
 - They almost certainly will get that.

1097
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,100
 I know.

1098
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,540
 - I'm worried that this is going to take over your life

1099
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,380
 gradually.

1100
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,740
 And when you quit the podcast in five years,

1101
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,900
 this is the moment we should have known.

1102
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,580
 - Wow, you think I'm going to last five more years

1103
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,740
 on this show?

1104
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,900
 I've incredibly left it.

1105
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,100
 (all laughing)

1106
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,220
 - I'll just have one weird lighthouse.

1107
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,700
 One of my favorite lighthouses is,

1108
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,140
 I think basically an unnecessary lighthouse.

1109
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,560
 It's the lighthouse in Machias Seal Island.

1110
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,220
 So this is--

1111
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,540
 - Machias Seal.

1112
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,340
 - Machias, M-A-C-H-I-A-S.

1113
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,180
 - Where's that?

1114
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,020
 - It's a tiny little island just between the U.S.

1115
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,700
 and Canada, and it's positioning is crucial because--

1116
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,180
 - It's a land border, most of that, isn't it?

1117
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,020
 - Yeah.

1118
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,860
 - U.S. and Canada?

1119
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,680
 - Famously.

1120
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,460
 - It's on like, if you sort of continue the border,

1121
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,140
 basically, it's in the Atlantic Ocean,

1122
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
 a sort of--

1123
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,980
 - Between Maine and--

1124
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,660
 - Exactly, between Maine and New Brunswick.

1125
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,260
 And so it's disputed,

1126
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,980
 'cause both countries want ownership

1127
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,660
 of this tiny uninhabited island.

1128
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,460
 I think because you can claim fishing rights

1129
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
 around a certain circumference of it,

1130
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,660
 if you do claim it.

1131
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,160
 So it's been argued over since 1832,

1132
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,420
 and Canada, to stake its own claim for the last 25 years,

1133
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,580
 has just kept a lighthouse keeper in a lighthouse

1134
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,580
 on there, to stamp its identity on the island.

1135
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,340
 And it's this guy called Ralph Eldridge.

1136
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,180
 - Same guy?

1137
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,740
 - It's been the same guy for 25 years, yeah.

1138
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,260
 It's actually two guys, and they alternate

1139
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,900
 one month from one month off.

1140
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,740
 - Okay.

1141
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,460
 - But they're fun guys.

1142
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,540
 I read an interview with Ralph a couple of years ago

1143
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,260
 where the interviewer said, 'cause it's just him,

1144
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,620
 the interviewer said, "Are you a lonely person, Ralph?"

1145
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,180
 And he said, "Lone is the wrong word.

1146
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,620
 "Independent is better.

1147
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,260
 "Let's say I like me best of all."

1148
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,620
 And then the interviewer just goes,

1149
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,900
 "Divorced, Ralph?

1150
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,740
 "Yes."

1151
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,940
 (all laughing)

1152
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,100
 - There was a bit of lighthouse news this year,

1153
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,180
 so you might be seeing it in Lamp later on.

1154
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,020
 - Great.

1155
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,860
 - In your quarters.

1156
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,700
 - At least six months time.

1157
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,540
 (all laughing)

1158
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,220
 - Who, what time was right?

1159
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,860
 - And that was, there was a film festival

1160
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,100
 which took place in a lighthouse this year.

1161
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,940
 - I know.

1162
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,780
 - It was a Swedish film festival,

1163
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,580
 the Gotterborg Film Festival.

1164
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,900
 And 60 movies were played in total at this festival,

1165
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,140
 and they were played entirely to one human.

1166
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,020
 - Did they use the light from the lighthouse?

1167
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,860
 - As a projector.

1168
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,700
 - As a projector.

1169
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,020
 - Did you have to keep walking around?

1170
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,180
 (all laughing)

1171
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,660
 - There were 19 shipwrecks in it.

1172
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,980
 (all laughing)

1173
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,780
 - The sailors were so entranced,

1174
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,180
 watching Back to the Future 3.

1175
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,020
 - That's so cool.

1176
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,860
 - Yeah.

1177
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,900
 - Was it a particular kind of film,

1178
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,020
 as in was there a genre?

1179
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,860
 - No, no, no.

1180
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,220
 - There was that film recently with Robert Pattinson.

1181
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,060
 - Yes.

1182
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,900
 - The lighthouse.

1183
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,660
 - And they played two lighthouse keepers who were going mad.

1184
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,500
 Yeah, yeah.

1185
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,180
 - No, no, it's a collection of independent film making.

1186
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,020
 - Okay.

1187
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,860
 - Yeah, so every kind of genre.

1188
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,180
 - It sounds like a horror film festival.

1189
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,620
 You know, we're gonna trap you in the lighthouse

1190
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,460
 and show you 60 films.

1191
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,380
 - Well, no, it was a COVID thing that happened.

1192
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,060
 And so they couldn't put the festival on as they wanted to.

1193
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,780
 And actually, sorry, I slightly got it wrong.

1194
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,500
 So it might've already been in a issue of lamp.

1195
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,860
 This was 2021.

1196
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,220
 So you might've missed out on the story just.

1197
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,860
 - I'm sure you can get back issues.

1198
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,460
 (all laughing)

1199
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,900
 So yeah, the idea was they were gonna have to go online

1200
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,100
 and just stream it online for the entire.

1201
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,820
 - That's literally the opposite of playing it to one person.

1202
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,260
 That's playing it to everyone with internet access.

1203
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,860
 - Yeah, but for one thing they wanted to do

1204
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,780
 was make it special.

1205
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,900
 And so they did a competition.

1206
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,540
 12,000 people applied for it.

1207
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,220
 And this one person, Lisa Enthroth, won it.

1208
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,140
 And so she got sent by boat to this island.

1209
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,900
 They took away all of her electronics.

1210
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,420
 She had just a little iPad.

1211
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,740
 - It's a Salica horror film.

1212
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,900
 - It's a Salica horror film.

1213
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,300
 There was one person on the island

1214
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,660
 who was checking on her once a day

1215
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,220
 just to make sure that she was okay.

1216
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,700
 - The murderer, as he's always known, yes.

1217
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,380
 - And she was there for a week, watching these 60 films.

1218
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,100
 - So she had to watch about nine films a day,

1219
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,780
 which was presumably about 18 hours.

1220
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,620
 She's under-slapped.

1221
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,460
 - She hasn't had anything better to do.

1222
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
 - No, it's true.

1223
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,300
 - Did she have to watch them?

1224
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,460
 Did she get tested on them afterwards?

1225
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,180
 - The creepy caretaker of the island

1226
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,620
 will do a little film quiz after every single one.

1227
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,220
 - And who played the butler?

1228
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,420
 What does the cricketer, the better snowball,

1229
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,740
 have in common?

1230
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,320
 (upbeat music)

1231
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,740
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1232
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,220
 and that is James.

1233
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,740
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 2007,

1234
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,260
 a Japanese arm wrestling arcade machine was recalled

1235
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,740
 when it broke three players' arms.

1236
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,420
 (laughing)

1237
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,260
 Amazing.

1238
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,660
 - See, I'm amazed it wasn't recalled

1239
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,220
 after breaking one player's arm.

1240
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,060
 - Yeah?

1241
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,620
 - No, they thought, let's let it break a few bodies first.

1242
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,700
 - No, I think they happened, all the breaks happened

1243
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,020
 in a short enough time that they couldn't recall it

1244
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,860
 before they-

1245
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,020
 - It's an afternoon at the arcade that must have been.

1246
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,540
 You know, ringing the third ambulance.

1247
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,380
 Yeah, amazingly.

1248
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,820
 Actually, we are gonna contact the manufacturers now, yes.

1249
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,620
 - Possibly three kids who are holding it at the same time

1250
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,860
 trying to beat the big boss.

1251
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,700
 - That's a good idea.

1252
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,540
 - Three snaps.

1253
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,740
 - They're all in the same trench coat

1254
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,180
 standing on each other's shoulders.

1255
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,660
 - I'm afraid you've lost the arm,

1256
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,420
 but we have replaced it with one of these claw grapples.

1257
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,100
 (laughing)

1258
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,500
 - With which you won't be able to grab anything at all.

1259
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,460
 - Just try and have your breakfast every morning.

1260
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,820
 You just, you grab the spoon

1261
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,140
 and then just drop it before it gets to your mouth.

1262
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,940
 No, so this is a company called Atlas

1263
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,300
 and the game was called Arm Spirit.

1264
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,980
 And what they said, this was in an article from the BBC,

1265
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,220
 is that probably the players got a bit overexcited

1266
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,260
 and maybe they twisted their arms in a slightly weird way

1267
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,500
 'cause the game was, it was like a fake arm

1268
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,700
 and then you would grab hold of the fake arm

1269
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,540
 and you would play an arm wrestling game against it.

1270
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,260
 And they were like 10 levels

1271
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,860
 and it went from the easiest level, which was a French maid.

1272
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,700
 - Okay.

1273
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,540
 - Famously weak, there's a lot of lugging to do

1274
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,620
 when you're a French maid.

1275
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,860
 Some of those dusters are extremely heavy with all feathers.

1276
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,180
 - Look at George Eliot, that's where she got her hand from.

1277
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,060
 Milk and all them cows.

1278
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,260
 - I don't, French maid is not the same as like a cow maid.

1279
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,100
 - Milk maid.

1280
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,380
 (laughing)

1281
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,980
 - French milk maids don't wear the little lacy outfit.

1282
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,820
 - They're quite different.

1283
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,380
 If you go to a summer's elas for a milk-made outfit,

1284
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,820
 (laughing)

1285
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,700
 do you mean French maid?

1286
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,540
 No, no.

1287
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,380
 (laughing)

1288
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,220
 - That makes sense.

1289
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
 - Or something like a milk and cow.

1290
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,540
 - Yeah, yeah.

1291
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,620
 - After the French maid,

1292
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,940
 you might fight against a drunken martial arts master,

1293
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,620
 a Chihuahua dog and the final is against

1294
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
 a professional arm wrestler.

1295
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
 And it gets harder and harder each time.

1296
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,460
 So in the end--

1297
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,660
 - That's not the order I would put that in.

1298
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
 You're saying a Chihuahua dog

1299
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,220
 is better at arm wrestling than a drunken martial arts master.

1300
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,340
 - Doesn't seem that way, does it?

1301
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,980
 - How drunken, yeah, yeah.

1302
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,740
 - If he's unconscious, then possibly.

1303
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,900
 (laughing)

1304
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,340
 - I can see though how an arm breakage might happen

1305
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,620
 based on a video that I watched on YouTube.

1306
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,500
 There's lots of videos where you can see people playing,

1307
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,820
 not this game, not Arm Spirit,

1308
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,420
 but there's another game called Over the Top.

1309
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,340
 And very similar.

1310
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,180
 I think it's exactly the same game, basically.

1311
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,020
 - I think that's--

1312
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,220
 - Also, sorry, just for legal reasons,

1313
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,820
 probably not exactly the same.

1314
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,140
 - Yes, probably.

1315
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,940
 There's no Chihuahua, for example, over the top.

1316
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,180
 And so you've got the big bulky hand there,

1317
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,580
 and I watched a video of a super strong guy

1318
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,500
 take on the final boss, and he was holding it,

1319
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,300
 and my god, he was like really going for it.

1320
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
 And someone leans over next to him and says,

1321
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,220
 "Ah, when I tried to beat the big box,

1322
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,900
 "I totally cheated, I lent in,

1323
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,020
 "I got my arms underneath it, I went."

1324
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,260
 So I can imagine, by manipulation of your body

1325
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,580
 in weird ways to try and beat it,

1326
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,140
 a snap might occur when you buckle.

1327
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,580
 - No, no, I can see that, yeah, yeah.

1328
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,180
 - Isn't Over the Top as a move, isn't it, in arm wrestling?

1329
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,740
 - It's where you kind of twist your wrist a little bit.

1330
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,340
 - Oh, I thought it was where you put your fingers

1331
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,420
 over the top of their hand.

1332
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,060
 But they're probably meant to be anyway.

1333
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,420
 If they're holding your whole hand in their hand,

1334
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,100
 you're not going to do very well.

1335
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
 (laughing)

1336
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
 - Okay, so can I just check with--

1337
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,780
 - There are moves, there are proper moves in arm wrestling.

1338
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,780
 There are sort of, I think,

1339
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,980
 a couple of dozen different techniques.

1340
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,500
 As in, if you're watching with an expert of the game,

1341
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,900
 they'll say, "Ah, he's trying the French defense now,"

1342
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,740
 or whatever.

1343
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,060
 (laughing)

1344
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,340
 - He's wearing a French made outfit.

1345
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,700
 (laughing)

1346
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,500
 - What were you going to say, Anna?

1347
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,940
 - I was just going to establish it was the kids' fault.

1348
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,100
 That seems to be where we're landing on this.

1349
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,900
 The company said they were playing it in a weird way.

1350
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,100
 - Who do we think is likely to sue?

1351
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,860
 I think it's the question we need to answer.

1352
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,380
 - I think there was no, as far as I could see,

1353
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,380
 I couldn't see any later news stories

1354
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,780
 that explained whether anyone had sued anyone.

1355
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,620
 - I feel like some parents got some real,

1356
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,540
 large quantities of cash behind the scenes for that.

1357
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,940
 - I don't know what that happened on that.

1358
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,180
 - But I wouldn't like to comment.

1359
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,340
 But arm breakage does happen in arm wrestling.

1360
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,660
 - relatively regularly.

1361
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,060
 Apparently this is according to John Jenk,

1362
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,900
 who is the Guinness World Records greatest arm wrestler

1363
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,740
 of all time.

1364
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,860
 He says that the people who break their arms

1365
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,340
 tend to be beginners because you get incredibly strong

1366
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,100
 when you're starting out arm wrestling,

1367
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,900
 but you haven't actually built up kind of the bone

1368
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,340
 and tendon resilience.

1369
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,620
 So you don't know your own strength.

1370
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,860
 You break your own arm.

1371
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,420
 He literally, you push so, so, so hard

1372
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,100
 that your bone just snaps.

1373
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,820
 And it's really horrible.

1374
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,460
 There was a match in Cumbria in 2018.

1375
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,780
 It was like a farmers event.

1376
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,860
 And there were various kind of fun things,

1377
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,780
 like a little fairground ride or a little, you know,

1378
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,380
 shoot the tail of the donkey or whatever.

1379
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,780
 They do those things and is that what they do?

1380
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,620
 - Yeah, it's not really.

1381
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,260
 - Welcome to Anna's Fair.

1382
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,740
 - Okay, look, this was nothing like my fantasy fair.

1383
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,780
 This was just a normal fair.

1384
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,860
 There was an arm wrestling contest.

1385
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,860
 A 20 year old girl broke her arm incredibly badly.

1386
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,940
 It sounds like she was resting another girl.

1387
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,140
 It was in a huge amount of pain.

1388
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,820
 Her opponent fainted,

1389
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,860
 which I can really imagine doing,

1390
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,780
 if you're arm wrestling someone,

1391
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,260
 you know when you see one of those snappages

1392
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,580
 that were at a sudden right angle to the arm.

1393
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,420
 So her opponent fainted and then they interviewed,

1394
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,260
 I think this was on the BBC,

1395
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,340
 they interviewed the paramedic, Andrew Dickinson,

1396
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,660
 who said, this is what happened, the opponent fainted,

1397
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,180
 but he also added, the rest of the day

1398
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,820
 was absolutely fantastic.

1399
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,140
 It ended in a dance where 600 people attended

1400
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,580
 and we were on site until 1.30 in the morning.

1401
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,100
 - Is that good paramedicking?

1402
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,940
 - I guess if you're the onsite paramedic,

1403
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,300
 if you were summoned to take her to hospital,

1404
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,820
 it's very bad paramedicking.

1405
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,980
 - It's not clear.

1406
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,340
 - They're starting the dance now.

1407
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,260
 Would you mind if we just kept the engine running

1408
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,460
 a little bit longer?

1409
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,700
 So I was, I always wonder,

1410
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,260
 'cause I'm not actually a professional arm wrestler myself.

1411
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,100
 - No. - No, no, no.

1412
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,340
 I'm a member of the association.

1413
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,580
 (all laughing)

1414
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,420
 - Look at the magazine.

1415
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,260
 - Yeah, slam.

1416
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,420
 - It's impossible to pick it up.

1417
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,020
 (all laughing)

1418
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,140
 But I thought that the rule was

1419
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,660
 that you couldn't hold the table.

1420
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,500
 - Right. - Okay.

1421
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,420
 - Actually, in the professional game,

1422
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,380
 they install pegs in the table for you to hang on to.

1423
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,220
 - Yeah. - Yes.

1424
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,860
 - So it's all about the rest of your body as well.

1425
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,700
 - Do you think? - Yes.

1426
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,520
 - I can believe it.

1427
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,700
 - Yeah, I thought it was just about your arm.

1428
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,940
 - Am I right?

1429
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,540
 I've got an old memory of you, James,

1430
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,500
 of you and me hanging out and you saying to me,

1431
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,180
 "I have an unbeatable technique."

1432
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,020
 - I do, yeah. - And then we did it

1433
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,820
 and you almost broke my arm, basically, in my attempt to,

1434
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,260
 so you know how to not be facing.

1435
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,860
 - I do, but I have to really,

1436
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,140
 you know, I have to trick you into position, basically.

1437
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
 - So why was upside down?

1438
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,940
 - Okay. (all laughing)

1439
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,180
 - There's a way, basically, if I was to arm wrestle you

1440
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,940
 and we kept the table on my right-hand side

1441
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,900
 and your left-hand side,

1442
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,420
 and we arm wrestled on that table,

1443
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,380
 then I would be pulling with my arm

1444
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,020
 and you'd be pushing with your arm

1445
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,500
 and the pulling muscle is way stronger

1446
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,260
 than the pushing muscle, so you could beat anyone.

1447
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,540
 Then it's like a pub trick

1448
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,420
 where you can win a pint of something, that kind of thing.

1449
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,500
 - Yes. - But if you got any brains

1450
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,340
 on you, you insist, surely you do it over a table, right?

1451
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,820
 - Yeah, but if you're in a bar,

1452
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,260
 there might be a bar, right? - If you're on the bar.

1453
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,100
 - You know, that's why it works in a pub.

1454
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,220
 - Yeah, that's a good point, yeah, yeah.

1455
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,500
 - Anyway, I have injuries now,

1456
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,780
 but it means I can't do arm wrestling.

1457
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,100
 I have something called tenosinivitis

1458
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,420
 of the first compartment of the wrist.

1459
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,260
 It's a very common thing that arm wrestlers get.

1460
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,100
 And yeah, it's like arm wrestlers thumb, it's called.

1461
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,340
 - Did you get it from arm wrestling?

1462
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,660
 - No, I got the version,

1463
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,620
 which is also known as mom's thumb.

1464
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,860
 I got it from carrying my baby too much.

1465
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,060
 But you can get the same injury

1466
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,140
 from carrying a baby in the wrong way

1467
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,220
 as you can get from arm wrestling in the wrong way.

1468
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,060
 - It's better than getting the one

1469
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,540
 they call wankers collar, isn't it?

1470
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:29,140
 - So you mentioned John Brzenk, there, Anna.

1471
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,340
 He's the great arm wrestling champion.

1472
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,740
 So he is the guy who the main bit of culture

1473
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,980
 about arm wrestling ever to exist in the world

1474
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,140
 is based on. - Oh, what's that?

1475
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,020
 - It's the movie over the top,

1476
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,980
 which is a Sylvester Stallone film,

1477
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,700
 which we have briefly mentioned fleetingly

1478
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,940
 in passing in the past.

1479
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,060
 Basically, he plays a character called Lincoln Hawke,

1480
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,140
 whose character's name changes about twice

1481
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,480
 as the film continues.

1482
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,300
 It's not a level of attention to detail.

1483
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,820
 And he has to arm wrestle his way to winning a big prize

1484
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,420
 and to a relationship with his son.

1485
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,940
 But it's based on John Brzenk.

1486
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,420
 And this is the really nice thing.

1487
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,220
 John Brzenk worked for decades as a mechanic

1488
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,900
 at Delta Airlines so that he could arm wrestle

1489
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,300
 because he wanted to travel.

1490
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,660
 His main expenditure was plane tickets

1491
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,860
 to arm wrestling competitions.

1492
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,380
 Whereas if he worked as a mechanic at Delta Airlines,

1493
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,020
 free transport.

1494
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,300
 - Does that also mean that if you're in,

1495
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,260
 let's say the world championships in Reykjavik

1496
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,780
 or something and you want to go home,

1497
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,980
 but there's a problem with the plane

1498
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,940
 and he's in the middle of an arm wrestling championship,

1499
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,780
 you have to wait.

1500
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,100
 - Everyone has to wait, yeah.

1501
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,780
 - If he sees a competitor heading towards the championship,

1502
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,340
 he can mess up a piece on the plane.

1503
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,660
 - Oh, that's good.

1504
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,300
 - What?

1505
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,260
 - He's just saying through a crash,

1506
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,300
 just so it doesn't take off.

1507
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,500
 - Yeah, just throw something small into the end.

1508
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,260
 Anyway, but God, you wouldn't want to share

1509
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,820
 an arm rest with him, would you?

1510
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,660
 - No.

1511
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,500
 - Yeah, my man.

1512
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,340
 - Depends which song though.

1513
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,780
 Depends on the size.

1514
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,180
 - I think his, both arms are probably strong.

1515
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,020
 - I was looking at pictures of all arm restes,

1516
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,420
 desperately hoping to find like one puny,

1517
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,740
 flaccid little stringy arm and one knee to arm.

1518
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,580
 - There is a difference though.

1519
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,700
 There is a difference in size

1520
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,100
 and it's roughly the difference

1521
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,300
 between George Eliot's head and James Harkin's head.

1522
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,540
 - That's the, yeah, five centimeters.

1523
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,420
 - Yeah, it's a bad, that's interesting.

1524
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,180
 - 'Cause you get some of them are experts

1525
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,460
 with just the right hand

1526
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,300
 and some of them are experts with just the left hand.

1527
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,780
 And I think the women's champion last year

1528
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,580
 won both right hand and left hand.

1529
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,620
 - Wow.

1530
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,500
 - Forgotten her name.

1531
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,700
 - So are there people who just never play each other?

1532
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,540
 - Yeah, of course.

1533
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,380
 - Yeah.

1534
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,220
 - 'Cause if you're right handed

1535
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,420
 and there's a champion who's a left handed,

1536
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,620
 how are you ever gonna meet them?

1537
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,460
 - Yeah.

1538
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,620
 - You can't both sit on the same side of the table.

1539
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,460
 - Wow.

1540
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,700
 - What if you're good though at backhand

1541
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,140
 or arm wrestling as such?

1542
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,980
 - What do you mean?

1543
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,300
 - So if I went that way.

1544
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,980
 - Well, like I told you, it's really hard to pull things

1545
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,740
 that in that direction compared to pushing

1546
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,820
 with your other muscles.

1547
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,620
 - Hang on, you also make sense of Andy's.

1548
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
 - We're sitting next to each other

1549
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,020
 and I'm pushing this way

1550
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,820
 and you're pushing this way.

1551
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,020
 - I don't think we've invented a new spark.

1552
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,860
 - No, hang on, I think we might have arm pulling.

1553
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,700
 Isn't that?

1554
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,540
 You have exactly the same position as arm wrestling

1555
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,380
 but you have to pull.

1556
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,500
 - You have to sit next to each other.

1557
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,140
 - Or you just have to pull.

1558
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:04,980
 You have to pull.

1559
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,340
 So you slam your own arm down.

1560
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,780
 - I mean, I think we've invented a sport

1561
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,740
 that's even less excited to watch arm wrestling.

1562
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,900
 But are you saying they have the right handed

1563
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,740
 champion trips and they say,

1564
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,340
 "And now we're gonna have the left handed champion."

1565
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,420
 - Yeah, it's different categories.

1566
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,900
 It's like different weights and boxing

1567
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,460
 but you've just got different arms.

1568
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,900
 - Is there any other sport that does that?

1569
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,740
 - Yeah, boxing.

1570
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,260
 You can only punch with your right hand

1571
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,700
 and then some people are really gonna only

1572
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,780
 punch him with their left hand.

1573
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,620
 - I don't believe you.

1574
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,380
 - No, that's because I've not done it in a dream.

1575
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,260
 - Can I just quickly mention with "Over the Top"

1576
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,540
 this movie and with John Bridgenk,

1577
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,820
 basically when "Over the Top" was going into production,

1578
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,620
 they did a thing for part of the promotion

1579
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,940
 where they actually set up this massive

1580
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,340
 arm wrestling championship that was called "Over the Top"

1581
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,140
 once the movie was green lit.

1582
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,780
 So they went, "Let's actually do this."

1583
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,020
 And so they did it as this,

1584
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,140
 both it was a sort of national thing in America

1585
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,300
 but then they had international qualifying rounds

1586
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,060
 that would happen in places like Japan

1587
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,260
 and they had a final in Las Vegas.

1588
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,860
 And the final, when all of these competitors

1589
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,540
 from all around the country came together,

1590
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,100
 that was the footage that makes it into

1591
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,700
 the final of the film.

1592
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,900
 And so, yeah, and so you see real arm wrestlers

1593
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,100
 who were part of this big tournament.

1594
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,660
 - Well, you would have to have real arm wrestlers,

1595
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,220
 otherwise you have normal actors.

1596
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,060
 (laughing)

1597
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,940
 You would be like fake arms.

1598
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,660
 - The problem was is that they wanted to use

1599
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,340
 real arm wrestlers to fight or to do the arm wrestle

1600
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,020
 with Stallone in the final of the movie

1601
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,060
 but they were all too big.

1602
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,900
 It was unrealistic.

1603
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,460
 - No, I thought they weren't big enough

1604
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,740
 'cause it's more about technique.

1605
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,620
 They've got more normal arm lookings

1606
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,180
 than the huge weightlifting muscles.

1607
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,260
 - Some of them are massive arms.

1608
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,100
 - I don't know.

1609
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,140
 Dave Dean, who was the main arm wrestler at the time,

1610
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,620
 was Jay Norris and he was,

1611
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,540
 and they said this is so impractical

1612
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,380
 that you would win this.

1613
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,300
 - Like for instance, Garth, all arms, Carlson.

1614
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,340
 - Well, he does sound like he's got big arms.

1615
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,180
 (laughing)

1616
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,140
 Or tiny, the rest of him.

1617
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,220
 (laughing)

1618
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,540
 - Such a weird name, isn't it?

1619
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,380
 All arms.

1620
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,780
 - He doesn't play, he's got sort of nine arms.

1621
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,620
 - Yeah.

1622
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1623
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,140
 Terry Big Man Barton is another one.

1624
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,180
 They're all big then.

1625
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,180
 I've seen videos.

1626
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,060
 - They're very WD-40 nicknames, aren't they?

1627
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,700
 They're not, they're no one's called

1628
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,740
 the smoke screen or the diplomat.

1629
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,580
 - The next one I could find was Verne,

1630
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,180
 the one armed bandit, Martel.

1631
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,580
 And I don't know why you're laughing

1632
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,020
 'cause he lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.

1633
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,860
 - Did he?

1634
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,180
 - Yeah, one of them.

1635
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,460
 - 'Cause then he was actually one armed?

1636
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,300
 Oh my goodness.

1637
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,980
 - One armed bandit actually did have one arm.

1638
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,820
 - Oh my God.

1639
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,620
 - But yeah, he started going back into tournaments again

1640
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,580
 after his accident.

1641
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,420
 - Right.

1642
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,220
 - Which, did he lose his good arm?

1643
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,260
 - No, he lost his less good arm.

1644
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,820
 - That's incredible though, 'cause you can't hold on

1645
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,860
 to the peg, doesn't it, so he couldn't use the zoom.

1646
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,420
 - So he became the best in the world

1647
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,300
 in the non-able-bodied class,

1648
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,820
 but he also came fourth

1649
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,780
 in the regular able-bodied class once.

1650
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,740
 Which is pretty amazing.

1651
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,580
 - Yeah.

1652
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,060
 - Some arcade game stuff.

1653
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,900
 - Yeah.

1654
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,660
 - You know those penny pushers

1655
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,980
 where you put like two p.m.

1656
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,820
 - I love those.

1657
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,660
 - And there's like some shells.

1658
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,500
 - Oh yeah, I've spent more money

1659
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,340
 than I'm comfortable with on those.

1660
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,180
 I love them.

1661
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,020
 - Me too.

1662
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,740
 - Well, they're invented by a company called Comptons

1663
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,020
 in 1964, and they were so sure

1664
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,060
 that it was just gonna be a one-year thing

1665
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,020
 that they didn't even put a patent on it.

1666
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,980
 They thought this will just be fun for one year.

1667
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,020
 Everyone will forget about it,

1668
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,020
 so we're not gonna do that.

1669
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,780
 And then that's why you get them in all the arcades now

1670
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,380
 'cause they weren't patented.

1671
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,100
 - But why do they steal my money so effectively?

1672
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,860
 - Well, it's really interesting that.

1673
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,060
 So there's a hole where all the money goes down.

1674
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,300
 So it seems that when you put two p.m.

1675
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,380
 it's bound to come out right.

1676
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,640
 Eventually it'll come out.

1677
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,140
 So every two p.m. that goes in--

1678
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,460
 - Should you call one two p.m. out?

1679
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,300
 - Yeah.

1680
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,820
 Now the way to make money is to,

1681
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,940
 for some of those two p.ms to fall into the machine.

1682
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,140
 But surely you'd notice.

1683
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,980
 - Yeah.

1684
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,100
 - You used to be able to notice.

1685
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,740
 There used to be a big hole in the middle

1686
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,680
 and you see the two p.ms go down.

1687
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,300
 And that would be where, obviously, they made the money.

1688
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,060
 But now they hide the holes.

1689
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:42,980
 - Ah!

1690
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,560
 - So there are holes on the side

1691
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,260
 that the two p.ms go into.

1692
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,560
 And so not all of the two p.ms that go in come out.

1693
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,400
 - What? - And that's how they make

1694
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,240
 the money.

1695
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,080
 - That's a swizz.

1696
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,920
 It's an absolute swizz.

1697
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,020
 - That genuinely is something that's been blown wide open.

1698
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:54,860
 I can't believe that.

1699
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,320
 So do they have to muffle the noise

1700
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,700
 of the two p.ms sliding down the holes?

1701
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,820
 - No, they must do, I guess.

1702
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,760
 - Because that's a noisy thing.

1703
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,380
 When you put your two p.ms at the top.

1704
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,400
 I sometimes resort to just banging in a fiver.

1705
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,740
 (laughing)

1706
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,320
 - You're gonna be the fireman into the slush.

1707
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,460
 - I have to pipe it down with a long pipe cleaner thing.

1708
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,660
 - Yeah, I think that'll get me a few two p.ms.

1709
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,120
 (laughing)

1710
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,700
 (upbeat music)

1711
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,360
 - Okay, that's it.

1712
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,320
 That's all of our facts.

1713
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,760
 Thank you so much for listening.

 In September, it's the final leg of nerd immunity.

1733
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,260
 It's an awesome night.

1734
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,320
 We're gonna do a live podcast in the second half

1735
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,280
 and a whole show that you've never seen before

1736
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,340
 in the first half.

1737
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,260
 It's stand up, it's facts, it's everything you want.

1738
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,860
 Come and see it.

1739
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,180
 If I sell it, I hope so.

1740
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,600
 All right, we'll be back again next week

1741
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,440
 with another episode.

1742
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,280
 We'll see you then.

1743
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,620
 Goodbye.

1744
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,200
 (upbeat music)

1745
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,780
 (upbeat music)

1746
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,360
 (upbeat music)

1747
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,940
 (upbeat music)
