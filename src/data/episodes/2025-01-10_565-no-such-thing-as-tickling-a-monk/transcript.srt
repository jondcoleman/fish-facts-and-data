00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,000
 Hi everyone, happy new year. Welcome to 2025.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,200
 It's a square number, so it's going to be a great year, I am sure.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,800
 Why am I here speaking to you today?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,100
 Well, it is because we have a slightly different show today.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,800
 It's a normal show. It was one that we filmed live in Wellington.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,900
 But unfortunately, on the day of this show, Andrew Hunter Murray was unexpectedly called back to the UK.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,600
 He had to leave, and so to save the day in his place came Leon Buttons-Kirkbeck.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,200
 Now, some of you will have heard that name and got very excited.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 A lot of you might not know it, but he is one of the three members of another podcast

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,400
 called The Cryptid Factor, with himself, Rhys Darby, and some little-known guy called Daniel Schreiber.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,800
 Those of you who have heard that will know that he's absolutely brilliant as he was on our show.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
 And those of you who haven't heard it, well, why not?

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
 Once you've listened to this show, why not go to your podcast provider of choice

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,000
 and search for The Cryptid Factor and listen to their show?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,400
 Anyway, not much more to say, apart from hope.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,700
 All is going well for you in January.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,100
 I'm recording this in December, so goodness does what's happened since then.

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,900
 On with the podcast!

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,400
 Hello, and welcome to another episode!

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,800
 My Such Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 This week, coming to you all for a living time!

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,600
 [Applause]

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,400
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin, and Leon Buttenskirk back.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,900
 And in no particular order, here we go.

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,700
 Starting with fact number one, and that is buttons.

32
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,400
 My fact this week is the fact that the world's longest conductor's baton

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 is actually more than three times longer than Friedrich Chopin.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
 Mmm!

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
 Stacked up. Stacked.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,500
 The height of him times three.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,100
 That is amazing. Did he ever use this baton?

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,200
 Because that would be awesome.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 No, it wasn't actually Chopin didn't actually own this.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
 That would have been quite amazing.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,800
 And was he tiny? Was Chopin, was he a borrower?

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,500
 No, he was 170 centimeters.

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,400
 And so that makes the world's longest baton 20 foot long.

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,600
 Wow. Is there a useful reason for having such a big baton?

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 Careful.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,300
 Or is it just someone trying to break a record?

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,600
 Or what is the reason?

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 Well, it is ego is the reason largely.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,500
 It is a record. It was a record set by Brown University band in Provinc, Rhode Island.

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,200
 And it happened just this year.

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,400
 And it actually happened as a form of competition to another band that was in Penn State.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,800
 And they had one that was 15 foot long and they thought,

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,900
 "What are we going to do that's going to really break the regos?"

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,000
 And it was like, "Make a bigger baton!"

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,300
 So there went five more foot.

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,700
 Yeah. And they won.

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,400
 But well, they had a first attempt which was they managed to get a 16 foot baton.

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,800
 But it was disqualified because the handle was too skinny.

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,600
 So that didn't count as a baton.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,300
 There were so many interesting rules that needed to be adhered by in order for this record to happen.

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,800
 So if you were shifting the baton to conduct the audience,

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,000
 you weren't allowed it to sort of like bend up and down.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
 It needed to stay.

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,200
 So the guy conducting had to like slowly bring it across while the Guinness World Records officiators stared at it.

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,800
 So it wasn't allowed to be like, "You couldn't pull the bolt with it?"

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,300
 You couldn't.

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,500
 No.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
 It's like the opposite of a pull the bolt.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Yeah. It had to be straight.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,700
 And they conducted three songs with the baton.

71
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,000
 And so that's what set the record.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,400
 But it is interesting because we tried to break a Guinness World Record recently on stage.

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,200
 Oh, yeah. Those rules are tough.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,100
 They're really tough.

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,400
 What was it? We had to eat...

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,800
 We had to eat as many cheese slices.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,100
 You know, like that plastic cheese you put on burgers.

78
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,600
 Yeah.

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
 But the rule was that you had to take the plastic off as well.

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
 And it just meant that it was impossible.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,900
 Because...

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,400
 Yeah. And we had one minute to do it.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,700
 We had to eat 15 in one minute.

84
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,000
 What?

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
 And you're not allowed to drink water in between.

86
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,300
 And I trained with water.

87
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,400
 It's the only way I could do it.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,900
 You didn't...

89
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,200
 If you trained for that, then I'm worried about a sheep.

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,700
 You ate about a quarter of a slice.

91
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,300
 I know.

92
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
 Yeah, I know.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
 Because they didn't let me drink water.

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,500
 I got stuck on stage and it was horrible.

95
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,200
 So we didn't get a Guinness World Record.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,000
 Interesting fact though, you got New Zealand a Guinness World Record the other day, didn't you?

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
 Stop it.

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,000
 Okay, I helped get a world record with the Hacker, the world's largest Hacker.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,200
 We took it from the slimy French.

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,900
 The French.

101
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,600
 Did you know that?

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,800
 The French.

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,100
 Why are the French huckering?

104
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,800
 Exactly.

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,400
 That feels culturally inappropriate to start off with.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
 I know.

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,200
 And funnily enough, the people who, the Guinness World Record Officiators actually acknowledged that.

108
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,700
 But they didn't rescind the record.

109
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
 But they said, "You're welcome to break it."

110
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 But of course, then the rules were a lot harder.

111
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,700
 They came down real hard.

112
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,300
 But we did it and we took it back.

113
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,900
 And so it is now officially ours.

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,100
 And I'd like to see another country go, "No, we're going to take it back off."

115
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,900
 The balls in that country.

116
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
 That would be...

117
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,700
 Not going to happen.

118
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,100
 I'm not saying that people who are just doing these things to break records have something else missing in their lives.

119
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,300
 Or I...

120
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,300
 But I am saying that you don't see the Berlin Philharmonic or the London Symphony Orchestra competing over who's got the longest.

121
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,100
 Buton.

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
 And it doesn't sound like it's that useful.

123
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,100
 Maybe they should because not as many people are going to classical concerts.

124
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,300
 Do you think this is what would turn it around?

125
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,300
 It would make me want to go.

126
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,900
 You couldn't have anyone sitting in the front ten rows.

127
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,300
 I hadn't realised quite how late the conductor came about as a position in an orchestra.

128
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,100
 Or the conductor, as we know it, as in someone who faces the orchestra.

129
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:26,500
 And with their right hand keeps the beat and with their left hand does things like bring new instruments in, inject emotion into it, things like that.

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,700
 But that's relatively modern and actually composers used to do so much more than they do today.

131
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:42,700
 So in the 16th or 18th centuries, composers would also usually be playing the harpsichord piano in their pieces while performing and they would be conducting.

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,300
 And it's weird this lasted at least 200 years and I don't know how it was effective because obviously often to play the piano you need two hands.

133
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,300
 Or in the article I read it said to play the harpsichord well you do need two hands.

134
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
 It's a very low bar.

135
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,300
 So they'd have to nod their heads vigorously conducting the orchestra.

136
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
 It's amazing. Sometimes it would be the violinist as well like the first violinist would do it with their bow.

137
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,300
 But again, it seems difficult because how do you play while you're waving the bow around?

138
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
 I don't get it. Yeah, that was so weird.

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
 But do we need it? Do we need the baton?

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
 Oh, don't start, Dan. Oh my God.

141
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:22,300
 So on the show a little while ago, Dan did say that people who are in orchestras shouldn't need sheet music.

142
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
 Because Bruce Springsteen's band don't need sheet music.

143
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,300
 All I was saying was there was an orchestra incident where the composer got angry with what was going on and took all the sheet music away.

144
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,300
 And then the concert had to be cancelled because no one knew the songs.

145
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,300
 And I just thought, well, I mean, learn them? And I know it's controversial.

146
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,300
 I've had a lot of bassoonists write to me and threaten my life and children's lives.

147
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
 As you should.

148
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,300
 But there has been an example where we have seen conducting happening without a baton or even the movement of hands.

149
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
 And that was Leonard Bernstein.

150
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
 There was that movie Maestro that was made not too long ago about him.

151
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,300
 There's a very great video that you can watch online of him conducting an orchestra simply with the movement of his eyebrows.

152
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
 And it's amazing.

153
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
 So he's just saying, it's a do-do-do-do-do.

154
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
 And it's just like, you know, a little, and then his eyes poke that way.

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
 And it's not that song. That's the one that came to mind.

156
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
 Dirty had his arms unbutated.

157
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,300
 He wanted to show the power of when the synergy of an orchestra is so great that you can simply rely on looks and impressions.

158
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
 Interesting.

159
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,300
 There was a time in Soviet Russia where they did away with the conductors.

160
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
 In what sense did away with?

161
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,300
 They went a bit too close to those windows.

162
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,300
 Now, the idea was in a non-hierarchical communist society where everyone's equal.

163
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,300
 You don't need one person at the front who's, like, lording it over everyone else.

164
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
 And for quite a while they did do that.

165
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,300
 And actually, in the '70s, Andre Previn in the UK, he did the same thing.

166
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,300
 He did a TV show where he said, OK, I'm conducting and now I'm going to stop.

167
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,300
 And they thought, everyone thought, oh, everything's just going to go to shit as soon as he leaves.

168
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
 But actually, it was kind of fine.

169
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
 It's like when countries don't have governments.

170
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
 You know, Ireland and Northern Ireland didn't have a government for about three years.

171
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
 And everyone always goes, huh, didn't realize.

172
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 Yeah.

173
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,300
 We were talking earlier about, is there an importance to the length of a baton?

174
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,300
 And some conductors have a preference for the size.

175
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
 They have a preference for the shape.

176
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
 Some of them have lucky batons because they had an amazing experience.

177
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
 So they become superstitious about it.

178
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,300
 So it almost becomes like a wizard's wand in a way to them.

179
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 They sort of feel that there's power embodied in it, right?

180
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,300
 Fritz Reiner, who was a 20th century Hungarian conductor, he used one that was so small.

181
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:52,300
 It was such a tiny baton that one musician at the back brought a pair of binoculars along to mock him

182
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
 to show that he needed to do that to see him.

183
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
 Fritz Reiner saw that and then replied when he was using the binoculars

184
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,300
 by lifting up a piece of paper that read, "You're fired."

185
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
 [LAUGHTER]

186
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
 Britain really small.

187
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
 That's so funny.

188
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 You know, conductors officially live longer than any other proficient.

189
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
 Do we know why they live longer?

190
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,300
 Is it because they're basically richer and, you know, they come from...

191
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 They live off nothing but caviar.

192
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 No, they can only speculate.

193
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,300
 But they think on the back of the study, they think it's because you get so much upper body work out.

194
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
 Some of these pieces that they're conducting go for like three hours.

195
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,300
 It could be because you only really get a job as a conductor when you're quite old.

196
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,300
 So it's kind of self-selecting.

197
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
 All the people who died in their 20s and 30s, they never become...

198
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
 That is also another...

199
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 It does work out, but it's not like you're an Olympic athlete, is it?

200
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,300
 I've seen some of the famous conductors out there.

201
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,300
 In the 19th century, when conducting became a thing, it was really controversial.

202
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
 Lots of composers didn't like it.

203
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
 I think there were Schumann conductors.

204
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,300
 Emania and Evil Verdi was outraged that they got to take a bow

205
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
 because these composers thought these guys were pointless.

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
 But there was, at the time the conductors were suddenly appearing,

207
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,300
 this one called Louis Julia, and he was so in awe of Beethoven

208
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
 that whenever he played a piece of Beethoven,

209
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
 he wore white gloves anyway to conduct,

210
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,300
 but he had a specific jeweled baton that was presented to him on a cushion

211
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
 every time he conducted.

212
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
 And I should tell you his full name. Do you know his full name?

213
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
 No? No.

214
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
 Do you want me to tell you his full name?

215
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
 No, please do.

216
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,300
 It was Louis George Maurice Adolf Roche Albert, Abel Antonio Alexandre Noé,

217
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
 Lucien Daniel Lugin, Joseph LeBron, Joseph Parem, Thomas Thomas Thomas,

218
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,300
 Thomas Thomas Pierre, Abel Pierre Morel, Bartel Ami,

219
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,300
 Artus Alphonse Bertrand, Diodemne, Emmanuel, Josué, Vincent,

220
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,300
 Luc Michel, Jules Laplaine, Jules Bertrand, Julia César, Julien.

221
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
 What's his full name?

222
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,300
 I think I follow him on Instagram.

223
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 He could never get a driver's license, couldn't he?

224
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
 Did you have a stroke halfway through that?

225
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,300
 Always were there like five Thomas's in a row?

226
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,300
 I actually think I said one too many Thomas's. There were four Thomas's.

227
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,300
 And two of them seem to be hyphenated, but the reason was...

228
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,300
 He's got a double-barrelled Thomas in the mid-name?

229
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,300
 There's Thomas Thomas, Thomas Thomas.

230
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,300
 But the reason for this name is that his dad...

231
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,300
 So this is one of the leading conductors of the 19th century.

232
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,300
 His dad was a musician who played in an orchestra.

233
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,300
 He was a violinist and he was playing a concert just before his son was going to be baptized.

234
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
 And he said to the orchestra he was playing with, "Does anyone want to be Godfather?"

235
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
 And they all said, "Yes."

236
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,300
 And so he named it after them all.

237
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
 That's amazing.

238
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
 I did not know we knew so many Thomas's.

239
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:53,300
 It's time for fact number two, and that is James.

240
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,300
 OK, my fact this week is that in Japan,

241
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,300
 you can buy rice bowls that are shaped by women's armpits.

242
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
 [laughter]

243
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
 Why?

244
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,300
 Well, I don't want to get into the mental state of the people who buy these things.

245
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
 All I can say is that they exist.

246
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,300
 I would say there's nothing I can shape with my armpit that I can't shape with my hands.

247
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
 OK.

248
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
 They're not achieving a magical shape, are they?

249
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,300
 No, well let me explain how they're made and it might give you a bit more of an insight.

250
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,300
 So these are onigiri, these little rice triangle things.

251
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,300
 And they're kind of rice on the outside and they usually have a filling on the inside.

252
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,300
 And what happens is that the women who are going to make them,

253
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,300
 they have their body parts disinfected,

254
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
 but then they exercise to produce sweat.

255
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
 Oh.

256
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,300
 And then they use their armpits to put the rice bowls into that exact shape

257
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,300
 and apparently they sell for as much as ten times the price as regular rice bowls.

258
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,300
 But a diner in an article that I read said they actually tasted no different to any other rice bowls.

259
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
 [laughter]

260
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 And this is just a thing that happens and I'm not judging anyone.

261
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
 That's fine.

262
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
 It's wild.

263
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,300
 The inviting people back to watch them be made is pretty amazing.

264
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
 So that's the thing that happens when you go to the restaurant and they say,

265
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 "Would you like to see them being molded in the armpits live?"

266
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
 And you can do that.

267
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
 You've got to pay extra for that.

268
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,300
 Yeah, possibly, or maybe it's part of the deal.

269
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
 Well, otherwise they might do it with their hands.

270
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,300
 There you go.

271
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 If you're not seeing it happen, maybe you don't trust them.

272
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,300
 It sort of sounds like this restaurant has an OnlyFans page.

273
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
 [laughter]

274
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
 It sounds like something else is going on.

275
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
 The only thing that makes it slightly less gross,

276
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,300
 I guess, is that most people in Japan about 90% of people don't have odourful sweat,

277
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,300
 because they're lacking the gene that makes sweat smell really bad.

278
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 So it's not going to be the very...

279
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,300
 If we, you know, white Westerners did it, even worse.

280
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
 I'm not saying it's not disgusting, but this would be even more disgusting.

281
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,300
 One interesting thing about this is that onigiri in Japan,

282
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,300
 there was a study done where they found that 62% of Japanese people

283
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,300
 would only eat an onigiri that was made by someone they know.

284
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,300
 What?

285
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,300
 And only 30% said that they would eat one that was made

286
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
 by someone who was completely unfamiliar to them.

287
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
 Right.

288
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,300
 And that comes from, like, a historical thing,

289
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
 where there's been quite a few times in history

290
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,300
 where people have been poisoned by rice balls,

291
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,300
 or at least according to the stories they have been.

292
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
 And so there's kind of this superstition

293
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 that you should always see the person who's made your rice ball.

294
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
 You're most likely to be killed by someone that you do know.

295
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
 So what a stupid rule.

296
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
 You should only eat rice balls made by someone you don't know.

297
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
 Don't let your wife make them for you, for God's sake.

298
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,300
 It's very popular globally, onigiri.

299
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 There's even a society.

300
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
 There's the onigiri society,

301
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,300
 and it attracts members who love it so much.

302
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
 There's one guy who was the owner of the thing called onigiri bongo,

303
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300
 and she has said that she would like to come back in her next life as a rice ball.

304
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
 And the follow-up question in the interview,

305
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
 "What flavor would you like to come back?"

306
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
 She said, "It doesn't matter. Onigiri isn't about the shape.

307
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 It is about the soul.

308
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,300
 I want to come back as one that has been made with the whole heart."

309
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
 So it's a bill.

310
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
 God, they make them with the heart as well.

311
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,300
 I want to know if the flavors for these rice balls

312
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 are sort of like ricksona type things,

313
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,300
 like sea breeze and mountain mist in New Africa.

314
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,300
 But hang on, isn't rice got that whole thing with bacteria

315
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
 that it's really bad at eating?

316
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
 Yeah, you're not supposed to double-cuck it, right?

317
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 Yeah, and that it's really good at holding bad bacteria.

318
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
 And you're putting it somewhere where a whole bunch of bacteria...

319
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 To be honest, honestly, the bacteria that's in your armpit, generally speaking,

320
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
 is not going to be super bad stuff.

321
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,300
 Also, and this is less a fact and more just like a useful lie fact

322
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
 that I always remind myself, it's not a problem.

323
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 The rice bacteria thing has been hugely overblown.

324
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,300
 Reheating rice is absolutely fine for many days afterwards.

325
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,300
 The only thing to do, if you really do want to avoid the still quite slim risk

326
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
 of the sort of poisoning that we're talking about,

327
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
 is you need to make it cool very quickly.

328
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
 So as soon as you've cooked rice, put all the shit you're not going to eat in the fridge.

329
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
 Like have it every mouthful, take it out of the fridge and eat another mouthful,

330
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
 then put it back in the fridge. And then it's fine for days.

331
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,300
 Here's another thing. So sushi kind of predates...

332
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 We all associate it with Japan, but there's evidence of it in China.

333
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,300
 And so sushi, you would have bits of fish, salted fish, and you would have the rice.

334
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,300
 In the very earliest days of sushi, when you pulled out the fish with the rice,

335
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,300
 you threw away the rice. It just didn't eat the rice to begin with.

336
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
 It was part basically of a refrigeration process

337
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,300
 and making sure exactly about bacteria and so on, not getting into it.

338
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,300
 So it took ages before someone went, "Should we eat that bit as well?"

339
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
 And they did. And then they went, "Well, that's actually good."

340
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,300
 And so if a time traveller came forward and saw us doing that, they'd be like, "Whoa!"

341
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
 It's like eating a Haribo packet.

342
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,300
 Well, actually on rice waste, I didn't realise,

343
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,300
 obviously rice is such an important food stuff in Japan

344
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,300
 because it's used as an ingredient for so many other things, obvious including sake.

345
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
 And with sake, when they make it, they lose.

346
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,300
 If you're making really high level sake, you have to lose about 70% of the rice.

347
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,300
 So they polish it. Every little grain of rice has to be polished

348
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,300
 until you've sanded down almost all of the outside of it.

349
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,300
 So where's that going?

350
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
 Down the train.

351
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,300
 Down the train?

352
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
 Yeah.

353
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,300
 So really, really good white rice, really gleaming white rice that's been polished

354
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
 and looks amazing.

355
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
 That was a status symbol for a long time in Japan.

356
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,300
 And there was a problem because if you remove those outer layers,

357
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
 so what you do when you're polishing rice

358
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
 is you're basically washing it again and again and again.

359
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,300
 But if you remove those layers, then it removes quite a lot of the good stuff,

360
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,300
 especially the vitamin B1 or thiamine.

361
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,300
 Okay, so without thiamine, you get this terrible disease called berry berry.

362
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 And it can kill.

363
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,300
 She starts a bit harsh, James.

364
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
 I mean, it might not be up your street, but...

365
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
 It's berry berry.

366
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
 And it's really, but I mean, you can die from it for sure.

367
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
 And it really is strange because it's very similar to, you know,

368
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,300
 the thing in the West, people would get on ships and they wouldn't eat oranges

369
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
 and lemons and stuff and they would get scurvy.

370
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,300
 Well, in Japan, they had a similar thing because they're eating this white rice.

371
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
 They would get this berry berry.

372
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,300
 And so there's a guy called Takaki who was a doctor and he did an experiment

373
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,300
 where he sent two ships on the same route, on the same route, sorry.

374
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
 And one of them would eat rice all the time.

375
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,300
 And then the other one would be allowed to have like meat and bread and stuff like that.

376
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 And he thought this is going to prove that the problem is the rice.

377
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,300
 And sure enough, when they came back, the people who were on the rice ship

378
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
 were suffering, but the people who weren't were much better.

379
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 And that's when they realized that you can't just eat rice all the time.

380
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,300
 And he said that if the experiment had failed, he was going to kill himself.

381
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
 Oh, wow.

382
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,300
 But yeah, within a few years of that, they got rid of this bitumen b1 deficiency

383
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,300
 in the same way that in the Western world, we got rid of scurvy by just giving people lemons.

384
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
 And he didn't have to do it himself.

385
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
 It's not funny, but it's interesting.

386
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
 It is.

387
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,300
 I wish more scientists said that they would kill themselves if their experiment had failed.

388
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,300
 I think that would really raise the caliber, wouldn't it?

389
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
 If there was that risk.

390
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
 Japan eats more dairy than rice.

391
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
 Interesting, really.

392
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
 I thought they didn't really eat much dairy.

393
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
 Well, that's bloody bewildering, isn't it?

394
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
 Because most of them are lactose intolerant.

395
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
 What are you doing?

396
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
 So where are they eating?

397
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
 And in Japanese people in the audience, why are they eating so much dairy?

398
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
 Well, they're eating it as milk.

399
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
 So I think about 85%.

400
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,300
 And estimates always vary.

401
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 Some of them are between 80% and 95% of East Asians are lactose intolerant.

402
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
 And it's actually related to the gene that means your sweat doesn't smell.

403
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,300
 But still, dairy's become very popular.

404
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
 And if you eat little bits of it, so what, you have diarrhea.

405
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
 You know, it's worth it for a pizza.

406
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,300
 Yeah, the rice consumption has halved in the last 40 years,

407
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
 and dairy's consumption has gone up a lot.

408
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
 So I grew up in Hong Kong, right, until I was 12 years old.

409
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
 And the thing that always was said about me is that I smell of milk.

410
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
 Because it's not a big thing in Hong Kong as well.

411
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
 Milk is not a massive thing.

412
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
 And that was like a nickname that I always used to like.

413
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
 There was this one particular mum who was always like, oh, milk boys here, is he?

414
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
 Oh, yeah.

415
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,300
 So you weren't being bullied by the other kids in the school.

416
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
 You were being bullied by the parents.

417
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
 Yeah, by this one mum.

418
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 Yeah, I used to go to her son's house.

419
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
 He was called Daniel as well.

420
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
 And she was, yeah, she was like, oh, milk boys here again.

421
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,300
 And so that really stuck with me, that I was like, reeked of milk all the time.

422
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
 That's so funny.

423
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:02,300
 Yeah, the Great Wall of China, they found it has been held together largely by rice, sticky rice.

424
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
 Sticky rice.

425
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
 Yeah, it's part of the mortar that they made.

426
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,300
 They're a university in China, the Xi Jiang University.

427
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,300
 They were researching the mortar of the Great Wall of China,

428
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
 and the mortar along with the lime is sticky rice.

429
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
 Interesting.

430
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,300
 And back to your point around the polishing of the rice,

431
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
 they think that a lot of it was actually used with polish rice,

432
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,300
 which means there's a lot of extra work needed to make that.

433
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
 Why have they polished that rice?

434
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
 To get stickier, I guess.

435
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
 Maybe it makes stickier sticky rice.

436
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
 Maybe it gets it stickier.

437
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
 Why do we not use it anymore then?

438
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
 Because that wall is going pretty strong, isn't it?

439
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
 It's doing great.

440
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,300
 Yeah, but they did actually think it is actually the world's first example of composite mortar,

441
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,300
 where you're including organic and inorganic material together.

442
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,300
 And they say that it is actually very, very good.

443
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,300
 That's what the architects say, is it, in the report.

444
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
 Very, very good.

445
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
 Very, very good.

446
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
 Sorry.

447
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,300
 In answer to your question, Dan, we might have gone with even more efficient building materials now.

448
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
 No offense to the ancient Chinese.

449
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 Okay.

450
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
 If anyone is in from ancient China.

451
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
 Okay.

452
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
 That is.

453
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,300
 Rice is a huge source of pride in Japan, in Japan and China, in fact.

454
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,300
 But it's a real patriotic thing, maybe slightly less so now,

455
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,300
 but I haven't realised that it was illegal to import any rice into Japan until the mid-1990s.

456
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
 '90s?

457
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
 It was early to mid-90s.

458
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,300
 Yeah, when America sort of bullied Japan into saying you've got to accept some of our exports.

459
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,300
 Because Japan always wanted to be rice self-sufficient and be able to grow all of its own rice.

460
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
 And even now, there's a lot of skepticism.

461
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,300
 I was talking to my friend, who has Japanese family in America,

462
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,300
 and was saying that they will often buy at a much higher price,

463
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
 rice that's been imported to America from Japan,

464
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,300
 because they think it's much higher quality.

465
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
 Even though in blind taste tests,

466
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 they almost always can't tell any difference whatsoever between American rice and Japanese rice.

467
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
 But the idea is that it's much higher quality.

468
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 That is.

469
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
 I've got one last thing quickly that I can mention.

470
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
 This is just going back to armpits.

471
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,300
 There's an amazing festival that used to happen.

472
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,300
 I think it's just stopped, but hopefully the mention on this podcast will bring it back.

473
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,300
 In Nevada, in a place called Battle Mountain.

474
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,300
 And basically, there was a journalist who called this particular town the armpit of America.

475
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,300
 And they were very upset by this.

476
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,300
 And so they set up a competition which was sponsored by a deodorant company.

477
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 I believe it was Old Spice.

478
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 And they turned it into a plus.

479
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,300
 And so they had the armpit beauty queen contest,

480
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
 whereby it was brilliant.

481
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,300
 So you would go and it would be a big festival and you would have a sweaty t-shirt contest.

482
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,300
 Can I just say, so is it who has the most beautiful armpit?

483
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
 Yeah.

484
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
 And then in like beauty contest, you have to do like a skill as well.

485
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
 Yes.

486
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
 So they're doing that thing where they make fart noises.

487
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
 Yes.

488
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
 Yeah, they do the fart noises.

489
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
 There's deodorant throwing competitions.

490
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,300
 So I think who can throw the deodorant the furthest.

491
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
 There's quick draw deodorant competitions.

492
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,300
 Who can get it and spray it as quickly as possible.

493
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
 And then eventually they crown the armpit queen.

494
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
 But yeah, they've really leaned into it.

495
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,300
 They're motto, which they now have on the sign as you enter Battle Mountain.

496
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,300
 Says, make Battle Mountain your next pit stop.

497
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
 Oh, brilliant.

498
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 [Music]

499
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
 It is time for fact number three.

500
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 And that is my fact.

501
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,300
 My fact this week is that 2,500 years ago,

502
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,300
 Buddha taught the world that the road to enlightenment

503
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,300
 could be achieved through compassion, mindfulness,

504
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
 and the eradication of the game hopscotch.

505
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
 [Laughter]

506
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
 He hated hopscotch.

507
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 What?

508
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,300
 Buddha hated any game whereby you drew on the ground

509
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,300
 and you were using your feet to sort of be confined

510
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
 by the drawing on the ground.

511
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
 And hopscotch is exactly what that is.

512
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
 It might not have existed during the day,

513
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
 but if Buddha came back now,

514
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
 he'd be like, what the hell's this?

515
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
 Did you learn nothing?

516
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 I guess these kind of hopscotch type games are very, very old, aren't they?

517
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
 And they're all over the world.

518
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
 So there would have been something that we would have seen

519
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
 that would have looked a bit like hopscotch.

520
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
 Did he suppose that he banned drawing on the ground

521
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
 and stepping in the squares that you've created, didn't he?

522
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
 Yes.

523
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
 I'd say that's hopscotch.

524
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,300
 He also banned all dice games,

525
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
 all stick games, all marble games,

526
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,300
 all games where you blow through toy pipes,

527
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 all games where you turn some assaults,

528
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
 games where you play with toy windmills,

529
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,300
 games where you play with toy chariots, toy bows,

530
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
 games where you guess the letters drawn in the air

531
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
 or they're on the back of the body,

532
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
 and games where you mimic deformities.

533
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
 Yeah.

534
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 I think the last one, fair enough.

535
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
 Yeah, that's good.

536
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
 He sort of got into a good rhythm right at the end there, didn't he?

537
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,300
 But he also guessing a friend's thoughts,

538
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
 not allowed by Buddha,

539
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
 playing with someone's ears.

540
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 Why?

541
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 No wet willies in the world.

542
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
 Why is this guy such a killjoy?

543
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
 I know.

544
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 Why is he always smiling?

545
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 It's weird.

546
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
 And all eyes or nose, to be fair.

547
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,300
 Yeah.

548
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
 No facial parts.

549
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,300
 And no Jenga and no pickup sticks, either.

550
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
 Was Jenga around back then?

551
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
 Well, again, he specified,

552
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
 and it is interesting to see how these concepts go back.

553
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 He specified no games that involve adding pieces

554
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
 or removing pieces from piles.

555
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
 Wow.

556
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
 We're some unimaginative humans.

557
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
 We just generate the same old shit.

558
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
 Oh, wow.

559
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 And why was it?

560
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
 It was to stop people getting distracted from scripture

561
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
 and holiness, wasn't it?

562
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
 Yeah, exactly.

563
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 You know, it's a philosophy,

564
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
 and Buddha did say that this should all be altered

565
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
 as we go along, hence why we now have hopscotch.

566
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 But...

567
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
 I don't think that's...

568
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
 He said that therefor we have hopscotch.

569
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
 I don't think we were waiting for the 1,000-year cut-off,

570
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 and then we went, right, Buddha said it's okay now.

571
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
 Get the chalk out.

572
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
 Well, you say that.

573
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
 There was no hopscotch then, and there is now.

574
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
 So I don't know...

575
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 One thing we should say, you say,

576
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
 "Why is he smiling all the time?"

577
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
 That's not Buddha, is it?

578
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
 Yeah, you're right.

579
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,300
 That's someone who we've accidentally labeled as Buddha.

580
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,300
 Yeah, so Buddha's birth name was said already.

581
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 Buddha's birth name was Siddhartha Gautama,

582
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,300
 and he was someone who was born into royalty.

583
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
 He was a very well-to-do person.

584
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,300
 But then he found a path of enlightenment, basically,

585
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
 and then he brought all his followers on.

586
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
 And by the smiling one,

587
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,300
 you mean the big sort of fat Buddha that you get on, like, you know?

588
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
 Yes, the smiling Jolly Buddha.

589
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
 Yeah, that was a Chinese monk who was called Uday.

590
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
 So you can understand the confusion.

591
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 That's pretty close, close enough.

592
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
 Tomato tomato.

593
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
 Yeah.

594
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,300
 And one thing that he banned as well was playing with toy carts.

595
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
 Like a little toy cart.

596
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 But, I mean, it would be easy, wouldn't it?

597
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,300
 Because you'd be like, "Oi, you, with the toy cart."

598
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,300
 I'd be like, "No, it's not a toy cart."

599
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 I'm actually... This is legit.

600
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,300
 I'm just a little kid carrying these stones over there.

601
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,300
 It could be work.

602
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
 You could be child labour.

603
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
 I'm just jump-sporting fluff.

604
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
 There's lots of ways out of it.

605
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,300
 Is this stuff all from those book of rules called the Vinaya?

606
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
 I think it might be from that.

607
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
 Yeah.

608
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
 There's some other rules in there that says,

609
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
 "A monk shall not tickle a mother monk."

610
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,300
 Yeah.

611
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,300
 Or, "Lie down in a bed scattered with flowers."

612
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
 Wow.

613
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,300
 Okay.

614
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,300
 Well, that's always a prelude to something more sexy, isn't it?

615
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,300
 Especially when tickling comes straight afterwards.

616
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
 Yeah.

617
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,300
 It's very nice.

618
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,300
 Well, but so is playing with someone's ears, eyes or nose,

619
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
 which he was against as well.

620
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
 And that sometimes is a prelude, too.

621
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
 Well, I mean, where I come...

622
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
 Anyway.

623
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
 Yeah.

624
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
 I guess one of the stuff in really specific circumstances

625
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
 could be the prelude to some sexy stuff.

626
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
 Particularly the one with the guessing,

627
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,300
 "Lessons traced with a finger and the ear on somebody's back."

628
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
 Yeah.

629
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
 That's definitely cock-and-balls.

630
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,300
 Cock-and-balls again.

631
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
 Stop.

632
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,300
 Can you stop doing cock-and-balls on my back?

633
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
 That's all you can do.

634
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
 They were Sanskrit letters, weren't they?

635
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
 Cock-and-balls.

636
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
 Yeah.

637
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,300
 I have found out a really interesting thing about the etymology of Buddha.

638
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,300
 Yeah.

639
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,300
 And that is that it...

640
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,300
 So that's from a Sanskrit term, which is "bud" to awaken,

641
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
 to, you know, enlightenment awakening.

642
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
 You can see how it comes from that.

643
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
 But what I find amazing is, of course,

644
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,300
 that word originated in India where Buddhism originated.

645
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,300
 And that nonetheless has the same origin as the word "bodh."

646
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
 Our word, "bodh," it bodes well,

647
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 which is just from old English sacks and languages,

648
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
 because they both date back even further to Pai,

649
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
 which I'm sure you all know as Proto-Indo-European.

650
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:51,300
 And so 8,000 years ago, these two languages sort of split,

651
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 and we got "bodh" from the same origin as they got Buddha,

652
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
 and now they've met again.

653
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
 I find that amazing.

654
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
 Oh, that is incredible.

655
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
 Language can travel that far and then meet again.

656
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
 It's very gross.

657
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
 Look, it's not funny, but it's really massive.

658
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
 No, that's amazing.

659
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
 It's quite romantic.

660
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,300
 Well, I also have an unfunny etymology thing of hopscotch.

661
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
 Go on.

662
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,300
 So the word "scotch" can mean an incensed line

663
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
 or scratch in the ground.

664
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,300
 So you pop in a scratch, scratching on the ground.

665
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,300
 And in fact, that got a young girl, a 10-year-old girl,

666
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
 in trouble with the police, believe it or not,

667
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
 in Ramsgate a few years ago.

668
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,300
 A young 10-year-old girl was putting a hopscotch, scratching,

669
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
 and sensing a line in the ground.

670
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
 And she was done for criminal damage.

671
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
 She's so mad.

672
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
 A 10-year-old.

673
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,300
 The police officer came along and frightened.

674
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,300
 This is Bob Allen, the father of Lily Mae Allen.

675
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
 She could be Lily Allen.

676
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
 Maybe.

677
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,300
 Maybe I should check these facts.

678
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,300
 Anyway, he came along and said,

679
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,300
 "Oy, that's your defacing public property?"

680
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
 Yeah.

681
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
 It's mad, isn't it?

682
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
 Why isn't it in?

683
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
 Because this happens a lot in these news stories

684
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
 about people being arrested for, or not arrested for,

685
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
 given warnings by the police for drawing hopscotch things.

686
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
 It should be page one, police handbook.

687
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,300
 Don't accuse a 10-year-old of graffiti and criminal damage

688
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
 because he's drawn a fucking hopscotch.

689
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,300
 We're all trying to get kids out of the house playing games.

690
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,300
 It's so weird.

691
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
 She did, to be fair, in the place where you have to write

692
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,300
 the letters and stuff, so you did write, "Fuck the police."

693
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,300
 I mean, to be fair, that also probably should be cheap.

694
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
 Yeah.

695
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,300
 Hopscotch, you're talking about the etymology of it.

696
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,300
 Do you know what it was called before it was called hopscotch?

697
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,300
 Oh, I don't know.

698
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
 Scotch hop.

699
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
 Oh.

700
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
 Yeah.

701
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
 That's nice.

702
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
 Just at some point, we just went, "Oh, let's turn that round."

703
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,300
 It's like the rice and the sushi.

704
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
 Oh, yeah.

705
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
 We just flipped it around and started using it different.

706
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 The first mention is in a book by Francis Willoughby,

707
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
 and it's in the 17th century book of games.

708
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
 And it's a big old book full of loads and loads of different games

709
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
 you can play.

710
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
 And there's one chapter that's kind of disappeared,

711
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
 and we don't really know much about it now.

712
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,300
 And that chapter is called "Tricks to Abuse and Hurt One Another."

713
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
 [LAUGHTER]

714
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,300
 So he had all-- it was like games you can play in the garden,

715
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
 games you can play by running around.

716
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,300
 And then this one, which is abusing and hurting one another.

717
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,300
 And the thing is, we do have the chapter heading,

718
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
 so we know what's in it, but we don't know what the games are.

719
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
 So there was a game--

720
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
 Is that also a sexy book?

721
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,300
 Is that the sexy-- because where I'm from, that's also a six.

722
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
 Anyway.

723
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
 It's a kick-goin, sorry.

724
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,300
 There's one called "Bying of Mustard."

725
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
 We don't know what it is.

726
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
 "Selling of Millstones."

727
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
 "Bum to Bus a Fool."

728
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
 "Bum to Butter."

729
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
 "Bum to Bus a Fool."

730
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,300
 Oh, see, sexy as hell.

731
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
 But lots of names.

732
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,300
 It was called "Hickety-Hackety," and "Hickety-Hackety-Hackety,"

733
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
 and "Paliali," and "Hitchabed."

734
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,300
 I like the fact that games used to have so many different names.

735
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 Why have we codified them?

736
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
 Did she just have another stroke?

737
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,300
 Yeah, Lele and Kit Kit and Thomas Thomas Thomas.

739
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,300
 When I was a kid, it used to be like we would play British Bulldog,

740
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
 where you have to run across the field,

741
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
 and then it's up to someone to rubby tackle you

742
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
 and beat you to the ground.

743
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
 And then the school would ban it,

744
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,300
 and then we would just play it again under a different name.

745
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
 And we thought that this was a loophole,

746
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,300
 that it's like, "Oh, they banned British Bulldog,

747
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
 but they didn't ban Blue Boy,"

748
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,300
 which is exactly the same game.

749
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
 And then they'd go, "Yeah, that's banned as well."

750
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,300
 And then the next day, we'd call it something else.

751
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
 So maybe that was it.

752
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
 Another bit of enlightenment.

753
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,300
 So in Buddhism, you have enlightenment.

754
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
 In the Jain religion, you also have enlightenment.

755
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,300
 They're really, really very similar religions.

756
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
 They grew up from the same place.

757
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,300
 And in the Jain religion, there are 24 Ford Makers.

758
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
 And these are people who have gone through

759
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
 all of the different cycles

760
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
 and been reborn, reborn, reborn,

761
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300
 and now they're out of the cycle.

762
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
 These are perfect people.

763
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,300
 So one of them is said to have floated perfectly still

764
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
 in his mother's womb,

765
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
 sending not so much as a ripple

766
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
 so that he didn't harm his mother.

767
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
 Which is nice.

768
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
 They tended to be really tall and really old.

769
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
 So there's a guy called Nemanatha,

770
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
 who lived for 1,054 years.

771
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
 300 years is a bachelor.

772
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
 54 days is a monk.

773
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,300
 And then 700 years is an omniscient being.

774
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
 And then another 200 years is a conductor.

775
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,300
 And this guy was 30 meters tall.

776
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
 So if he was a building in London,

777
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
 he would need a second staircase due to fire regulations.

778
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,300
 That's amazing.

779
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,300
 I can't believe he tolerated 300 years being single

780
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
 before going, "You know what? I'm just going to say I'm a monk."

781
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
 Five years to me.

782
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
 So the idea of Buddhism largely

783
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
 is to achieve enlightenment.

784
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
 And this goes through many different disciplines

785
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
 that are involved in philosophy.

786
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,300
 So George Harrison, who joined that whole movement,

787
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
 he was Buddhist and he went through various other things,

788
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,300
 became Hare Krishna at the end of his life.

789
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
 From the Beatles?

790
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
 From the Beatles, yes.

791
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,300
 For anyone who's not heard of George Harrison.

792
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,300
 We have lots of young cool listeners, Dan.

793
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
 Not cool if they don't know George Harrison.

794
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,300
 So I don't know if you all remember,

795
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
 but it was a horrible moment that happened

796
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
 just after the turn of the millennium,

797
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
 where someone broke into his house and stabbed him,

798
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
 and he got stabbed multiple times.

799
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
 He miraculously survived.

800
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
 It was really amazing.

801
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
 But the account of when he was dying

802
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,300
 was George Harrison basically was waiting for the moment

803
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,300
 to achieve enlightenment, to take him to the next level.

804
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
 So at one point, when he was being attacked by this guy,

805
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
 he sort of gave into it and just said,

806
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
 "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna."

807
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
 And he repeated it over and over,

808
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,300
 and it was, "I need to get to enlightenment before I die."

809
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,300
 He survived because his wife leapt on the back of this guy

810
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,300
 and beat him down with a side lamp that was on a bedside table.

811
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
 And so blood was everywhere.

812
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
 It was an astonishingly bad thing.

813
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,300
 He should have died.

814
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
 Everyone said he should have died, the doctors and so on.

815
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
 And there's a great story that Eric Idle tells,

816
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
 which is as he's leaving the house and he's on a gurney

817
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
 and they're bringing into the ambulance,

818
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,300
 he passes two new members of staff who started that day,

819
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
 and that was their first morning.

820
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,300
 And as they passed, a week and almost dead, George Harrison went,

821
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,300
 "So how are you finding the job so far?"

822
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,300
 (Laughter)

823
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,300
 And that could have been his last words ever, but yeah.

824
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
 I love that.

825
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
 And according to Olivia Harrison,

826
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,300
 his wife, he did achieve enlightenment right at the end.

827
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
 She saw him ascend.

828
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
 According to his wife?

829
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
 I'm just saying it's a happy ending.

830
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
 I think, yeah, sure.

831
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,300
 The second person ever to achieve enlightenment,

832
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
 according to George Harrison's wife.

833
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,300
 There is a type of Buddhist meditation that I quite fancy

834
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,300
 and I didn't know about, which requires you to find a corpse.

835
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
 This is such a dark note to end on.

836
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,300
 Oh my God.

837
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,300
 And dig it up.

838
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
 No, not dig it up.

839
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,300
 To find a corpse and sit there and watch it decay.

840
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,300
 And I didn't know about this, and it's the nine stages of decay,

841
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,300
 and you have to sit in front of a corpse.

842
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,300
 I don't know what the family are doing at the time.

843
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,300
 They just let you do it.

844
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
 And it's amazing.

845
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,300
 So you start with bloat, and then rupture,

846
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,300
 and then, you know, like, I won't take you through all nine stages.

847
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,300
 You know what?

848
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
 I think I might stick with my meditation app.

849
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
 (Laughter)

850
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
 It's coming up in the next lesson,

851
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,300
 but it's done in a very sexy American woman's voice,

852
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
 so you'll find it really nice.

853
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
 And you would like to do that?

854
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,300
 Sounds pretty fun, of a week, you know?

855
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,300
 So where I'm from, that's actually quite sexy.

856
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
 Sorry, no.

857
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
 That's sorry. No.

858
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
 I'm from Tim's, by the way.

859
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
 (Laughter)

860
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
 We do things proper there.

861
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
 (Music)

862
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,300
 All right, Lo, we need to get to our final fact of the show.

863
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,300
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna.

864
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
 My fact this week is that...

865
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
 (Laughter)

866
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,300
 Is that a patio for cats is called a catio?

867
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
 (Laughter)

868
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,300
 It's very silly.

869
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
 I just really want to say now,

870
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,300
 this is the most stupid fact I've ever said on the show.

871
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,300
 (Laughter)

872
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
 And I couldn't believe these guys...

873
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
 Listen, she's always like this.

874
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
 I don't know, I'm ashamed,

875
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
 but I'm going to tell you now, because you're here.

876
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
 So, catios are a thing.

877
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,300
 And maybe it'll come in handy with your cat-loving friends.

878
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
 You know, you can be like, "Have you got a catio yet?"

879
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,300
 Because every site and every company that sells stuff for pets,

880
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
 it's just like, "Hey, have you got the best catio available?"

881
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,300
 And apparently that's just an accepted way to refer to cat patios.

882
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,300
 And, you know, so that you can let them outside without them...

883
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,300
 It's like a patio, as we know it,

884
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,300
 but with a cage around it, as they know it,

885
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,300
 so that they can't escape onto the roads and get run over,

886
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
 and so that they also can't kill all the birds.

887
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
 Are you being paid for this?

888
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
 Is this a secret ad?

889
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
 It's bizarre, isn't it?

890
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,300
 Is there an offer-code fish at the end of this?

891
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,300
 It's not even a brand. It's a generic term.

892
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
 It's probably in the OED by now.

893
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,300
 It's just a generic term that pet owners are accepting, a catio.

894
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,300
 So, get one.

895
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,300
 Ramps, tunnels, swing bridges, they can be yours.

896
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
 (Laughter)

897
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,300
 So, we just had a heckle from the audience,

898
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
 and I am going to address it.

899
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,300
 I wouldn't usually, but it said, "Did you know about our native birds?"

900
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,300
 And we're in New Zealand, and the whole point of a cat patio

901
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,300
 is to protect the native birds, so they're very in demand in New Zealand.

902
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
 (Applause)

903
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,300
 You don't get other comedians dealing with hecklers like that, do you?

904
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
 (Laughter)

905
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
 Well, you go, "Fuck off, mate!"

906
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
 But that was beautiful.

907
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
 No, it's a good question, actually.

908
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,300
 Yes, the Lyles, I mean, how famous is the Lyles Wren in New Zealand?

909
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
 Do you all know the Lyles Wren?

910
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,300
 Well, okay, I feel like no.

911
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
 No, I don't, for my benefit.

912
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,300
 So, the Lyles Wren was a New Zealand bird.

913
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,300
 It was having an absolute whale of a time for thousands of years,

914
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,300
 and the Marys arrived almost a thousand years ago,

915
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,300
 and they gradually sort of wiped it out, not intentionally,

916
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,300
 by bringing rats with them, which killed it.

917
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
 But there were a few left by the 19th century,

918
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,300
 and then European settlers arrived, and they really fucked it,

919
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,300
 and the only ones left were of this lovely Lyles Wren

920
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,300
 were on a place called Stevens Island, which I'm sure a lot of of you know,

921
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,300
 and there was a lighthouse set up in 1894,

922
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
 but the lighthouse keeper brought cats,

923
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:55,300
 and the very, very last Lyles Wren was eaten by tibbles the cat.

924
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
 (Laughter)

925
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,300
 But the owner kept the body, so we do have the last body of the Lyles Wren.

926
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
 Oh, right.

927
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,300
 Domestic cats, they're responsible for the extinction of at least,

928
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,300
 like, almost a dozen species, I would say, right?

929
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,300
 Right.

930
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,300
 And they're even eating penguins in New Zealand,

931
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,300
 they're running up mountains eating lizards.

932
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
 Because when you say it doesn't, you mean in New Zealand, right?

933
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
 Yeah.

934
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,300
 Yeah, it's just in New Zealand that many.

935
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
 So, are we saying death to cats?

936
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
 Wow.

937
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
 No, we're not.

938
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,300
 Jesus.

939
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,300
 Wow, wow.

940
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
 Controversial, controversial.

941
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,300
 What's his name, the trade me guy that's trying to get them all killed?

942
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
 That guy, yeah.

943
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300
 Wow.

944
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,300
 It's a big thing in New Zealand.

945
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,300
 There's people advocating.

946
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
 I think there's even a political party, isn't there,

947
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,300
 to kill the cats?

948
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,300
 What?

949
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,300
 Or something.

950
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,300
 I don't know.

951
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
 You might want to check that.

952
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,300
 But I've got to say, I've watched a lot of New Zealand comedy.

953
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,300
 I didn't know that this death of cats was a threat.

954
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
 I agree.

955
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
 So, we're slightly also talking about luxury for pets, right?

956
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
 This has a practical purpose.

957
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,300
 But if you say to anyone, "My cat has a catio," you're going to be, I think,

958
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,300
 slightly mocked.

959
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,300
 And there's amazing examples throughout history of people who have built

960
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,300
 extraordinary structures for their animals.

961
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,300
 So, there was a British surgeon who had two great Danes,

962
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:18,300
 and she built what was a 250,000 pound, so it's like 550,000 New Zealand dollars,

963
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,300
 a giant house for these two dogs.

964
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,300
 It was known as Barkingham Palace.

965
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,300
 And it was designed by an architect called Andy Rammus,

966
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
 a thousand foot square.

967
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,300
 And it had everything from 18-inch deep doggy spas.

968
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
 It had temperature-controlled beds.

969
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,300
 It had a 52-inch plasma television.

970
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
 And did they just live there on their own, these dogs?

971
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,300
 Yeah.

972
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,300
 The designer lived in another house.

973
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,300
 So, was it just covered in feces?

974
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
 Yeah.

975
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,300
 I'm sure there were servants who came to...

976
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,300
 [laughter]

977
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,300
 It was different cats.

978
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
 Dogs know how to poo outside.

979
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,300
 It's fine.

980
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,300
 All you need to do is give them a dog flap, and they poo outside.

981
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,300
 Give them a dog flap.

982
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
 Yeah.

983
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
 Presumably.

984
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,300
 Oh, imagine if they missed the dog flap off that 250 grand budget.

985
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,300
 Imagine if they were like, "We can't stretch."

986
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
 [laughter]

987
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,300
 On the other side is a guy called Bruce Robinson in the UK,

988
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,300
 who he started taking in cats that had been abandoned during COVID-19.

989
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
 He just took in one or two at the start, and then a couple more,

990
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,300
 and then they all started multiplying.

991
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
 [laughter]

992
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,300
 And in the end, he had 300 cats.

993
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,300
 And he told a newspaper, he said, "I made a bad decision.

994
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
 [laughter]

995
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,300
 I thought I could handle the cats."

996
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,300
 [laughter]

997
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,300
 And he ended up spending thousands of pounds every month.

998
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
 He had to go without food himself,

999
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,300
 because he had to buy so much food for the cats,

1000
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,300
 and buying cat litter for the 10 little boxes for these 300 cats.

1001
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,300
 And in the end, they were taken away by the SPCA,

1002
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,300
 but in actual fact, they were all in very good condition.

1003
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,300
 I'm going to come out and say it.

1004
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
 10 litter boxes is not enough for 300 cats.

1005
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
 [laughter]

1006
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
 You can't have 30 cats to a box.

1007
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,300
 I think that's when they saw, "This is not working."

1008
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,300
 Yeah.

1009
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,300
 There's a Japanese architect, quite a famous one,

1010
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,300
 called Tan Yamanuchi, and he recently designed...

1011
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,300
 It was very interesting to watch the video of how the design worked.

1012
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,300
 He designed a house for his cats, but that he also lives in,

1013
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,300
 but it was based around the designs of his cats.

1014
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
 And the really difficult thing about being an architect

1015
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,300
 with your bosses being cats is that they obviously don't speak your language,

1016
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
 and so you need to work out what they want.

1017
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,300
 So he followed them around everywhere to work out what temperatures they like best,

1018
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,300
 and then he'd take a reading.

1019
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,300
 And so he's created this amazing house where, for instance,

1020
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,300
 the staircase of the house goes all around the outside of the inner wall.

1021
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,300
 And that's so that the cats on their way up can always see everything in the house

1022
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,300
 so that there's never any threat, there's never any tension.

1023
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,300
 And each step is exactly measured to be the height of the cat,

1024
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
 so it works for them, lots of hiding spots for them.

1025
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,300
 At the top of this spiral staircase in this beautiful house,

1026
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,300
 millions of dollars, is just a window at cat height.

1027
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,300
 They get to the top of the steps and they can look out the window.

1028
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,300
 It's amazing.

1029
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,300
 And there are also shed loads of books in it, which I don't understand.

1030
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,300
 The whole thing is I designed a house specifically for my cats,

1031
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,300
 and you're looking at this video and you're going, "There's bookcases everywhere."

1032
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,300
 What are they reading?

1033
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,300
 It's just pictures of mice.

1034
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,300
 Some other inventions for cats.

1035
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,300
 There's a new thing which you can get, which is like a mat for your house,

1036
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,300
 and it's got a wire that goes down into the ground,

1037
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,300
 and it's four, according to the people who invented it,

1038
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,300
 when there's a lightning storm that goes past,

1039
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,300
 there's enough static electricity in the air that your fluffy cat

1040
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,300
 gets loads of static inside them.

1041
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,300
 And you know when you walk on a carpet and you accidentally touch something metal

1042
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,300
 and you get a shock, they reckon that this is happening to cats all the time.

1043
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,300
 And so the only way to solve it is to get one of these mats

1044
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,300
 which your cat can go and sit on and it grounds them.

1045
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,300
 What the hell?

1046
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,300
 That's amazing.

1047
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,300
 That's amazing.

1048
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,300
 That's amazing.

1049
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,300
 What the hell?

1050
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,300
 We would know if cats were having electric shocks all the time.

1051
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
 I wouldn't think so.

1052
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
 You say, "I wasted my money."

1053
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,300
 Okay, I got one more invention.

1054
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,300
 This is quite a good one.

1055
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,300
 I think this is a good one actually.

1056
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,300
 So we don't like cats in New Zealand.

1057
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,300
 Okay, we've decided.

1058
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,300
 We've decided we don't want any animal pets,

1059
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,300
 but you still kind of want a pet.

1060
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,300
 So in 2010 they invented a thing called a pot pet,

1061
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,300
 and this is a flower pot that lives in your house with a flower in it.

1062
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,300
 And whenever it needs water, it kind of follows you around.

1063
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,300
 And so it makes a little squeaking noise

1064
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
 and then you have to pour water in it.

1065
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,300
 Okay.

1066
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,300
 And then when it needs some sunshine,

1067
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,300
 it goes into a nice sunny place and stuff like that.

1068
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,300
 So it's like a plant, but it has all the mobility of a pet.

1069
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,300
 Wow, it's like a sentient plant.

1070
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
 It's, "I need light, I need water."

1071
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,300
 Yeah.

1072
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,300
 Yeah, it's like a Tamagotchi basically, right?

1073
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,300
 But more 3D.

1074
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,300
 You fancy one of those?

1075
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,300
 Sorry?

1076
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,300
 You fancy one?

1077
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,300
 Tamagotchi or the pot pet?

1078
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,300
 No, the thing that I just planned that it's explaining.

1079
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,300
 I'm seeing not encouraging this industry.

1080
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,300
 I think the energies of scientists are going in the wrong directions here.

1081
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,300
 But partially the scientists who invented this

1082
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,300
 then killed himself because he didn't sell any.

1083
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,300
 We're going to have to wrap up fairly soon.

1084
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,300
 Andy told me a great anecdote.

1085
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,300
 He read this book recently,

1086
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,300
 which was by Craig Brown, amazing journalist in the UK.

1087
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,300
 And it's all about the Queen.

1088
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
 So it's a new book.

1089
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,300
 It might be out in New Zealand as well.

1090
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,300
 But it's written around the Queen, it's called.

1091
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,300
 And basically, we've spoken many times on this podcast about

1092
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,300
 dictators who have dogs, who have more rights and more power

1093
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
 than most of the people in their life, right?

1094
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,300
 That was kind of the same with the Queen and the Queen Mother,

1095
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,300
 with the Corgis.

1096
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,300
 The Corgis didn't have more legal rights than British citizens.

1097
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,300
 No, no.

1098
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,300
 What I mean is they were big deals in the Buckingham Palace.

1099
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,300
 And so there's a story that Craig Brown tells in the book,

1100
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,300
 which is that the Queen Mother was walking through the halls

1101
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,300
 when suddenly she saw a giant pile of dog poo sitting on the carpet.

1102
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,300
 And she went, who did that?

1103
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,300
 That wasn't one of my dogs.

1104
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,300
 And everyone was just tense because they were like,

1105
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,300
 well, it definitely was one of the dogs.

1106
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,300
 Well, what do we do?

1107
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,300
 So her private secretary, Mark and Gilead,

1108
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,300
 stepped in and said, well, Mom, if it wasn't your dogs,

1109
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300
 it certainly wasn't you.

1110
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,300
 So it must have been me.

1111
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,300
 That's the power of the Corgis.

1112
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:36,300
 That is all of our facts.

1113
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,300
 Thank you so much for being here.

1114
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
 We're going to be back again next week with another episode.

1115
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,300
 Wellington, you were incredible.

1116
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,300
 Thank you for having us.

1117
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,300
 We will be back.

1118
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,300
 We'll see you then.

1119
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,300
 Goodbye!
