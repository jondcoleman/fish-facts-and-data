00:00:02,00:00:07,"Hi everyone, happy new year. Welcome to 2025."
00:00:07,00:00:11,"It's a square number, so it's going to be a great year, I am sure."
00:00:11,00:00:13,Why am I here speaking to you today?
00:00:13,00:00:17,"Well, it is because we have a slightly different show today."
00:00:17,00:00:21,It's a normal show. It was one that we filmed live in Wellington.
00:00:21,00:00:27,"But unfortunately, on the day of this show, Andrew Hunter Murray was unexpectedly called back to the UK."
00:00:27,00:00:34,"He had to leave, and so to save the day in his place came Leon Buttons-Kirkbeck."
00:00:34,00:00:38,"Now, some of you will have heard that name and got very excited."
00:00:38,00:00:43,"A lot of you might not know it, but he is one of the three members of another podcast"
00:00:43,00:00:51,"called The Cryptid Factor, with himself, Rhys Darby, and some little-known guy called Daniel Schreiber."
00:00:51,00:00:55,Those of you who have heard that will know that he's absolutely brilliant as he was on our show.
00:00:55,00:00:58,"And those of you who haven't heard it, well, why not?"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"Once you've listened to this show, why not go to your podcast provider of choice"
00:01:01,00:01:05,and search for The Cryptid Factor and listen to their show?
00:01:05,00:01:07,"Anyway, not much more to say, apart from hope."
00:01:07,00:01:09,All is going well for you in January.
00:01:09,00:01:13,"I'm recording this in December, so goodness does what's happened since then."
00:01:13,00:01:14,On with the podcast!
00:01:14,00:01:17,[Music]
00:01:17,00:01:20,[Music]
00:01:20,00:01:27,[Music]
00:01:27,00:01:32,"Hello, and welcome to another episode!"
00:01:32,00:01:36,"My Such Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:01:36,00:01:40,"This week, coming to you all for a living time!"
00:01:40,00:01:44,[Applause]
00:01:44,00:01:46,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:46,00:01:52,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin, and Leon Buttenskirk back."
00:01:52,00:01:57,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:01:57,00:02:00,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:00,00:02:04,"Starting with fact number one, and that is buttons."
00:02:04,00:02:10,My fact this week is the fact that the world's longest conductor's baton
00:02:10,00:02:15,is actually more than three times longer than Friedrich Chopin.
00:02:15,00:02:17,Mmm!
00:02:17,00:02:20,Stacked up. Stacked.
00:02:20,00:02:22,The height of him times three.
00:02:22,00:02:25,That is amazing. Did he ever use this baton?
00:02:25,00:02:26,Because that would be awesome.
00:02:26,00:02:29,"No, it wasn't actually Chopin didn't actually own this."
00:02:29,00:02:30,That would have been quite amazing.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"And was he tiny? Was Chopin, was he a borrower?"
00:02:33,00:02:36,"No, he was 170 centimeters."
00:02:36,00:02:42,And so that makes the world's longest baton 20 foot long.
00:02:42,00:02:46,Wow. Is there a useful reason for having such a big baton?
00:02:46,00:02:48,Careful.
00:02:48,00:02:51,Or is it just someone trying to break a record?
00:02:51,00:02:52,Or what is the reason?
00:02:52,00:02:56,"Well, it is ego is the reason largely."
00:02:56,00:03:03,"It is a record. It was a record set by Brown University band in Provinc, Rhode Island."
00:03:03,00:03:05,And it happened just this year.
00:03:05,00:03:12,And it actually happened as a form of competition to another band that was in Penn State.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"And they had one that was 15 foot long and they thought,"
00:03:15,00:03:18,"""What are we going to do that's going to really break the regos?"""
00:03:18,00:03:21,"And it was like, ""Make a bigger baton!"""
00:03:21,00:03:22,So there went five more foot.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Yeah. And they won.
00:03:23,00:03:28,"But well, they had a first attempt which was they managed to get a 16 foot baton."
00:03:28,00:03:32,But it was disqualified because the handle was too skinny.
00:03:32,00:03:34,So that didn't count as a baton.
00:03:34,00:03:40,There were so many interesting rules that needed to be adhered by in order for this record to happen.
00:03:40,00:03:43,"So if you were shifting the baton to conduct the audience,"
00:03:43,00:03:47,you weren't allowed it to sort of like bend up and down.
00:03:47,00:03:47,It needed to stay.
00:03:47,00:03:54,So the guy conducting had to like slowly bring it across while the Guinness World Records officiators stared at it.
00:03:54,00:03:56,"So it wasn't allowed to be like, ""You couldn't pull the bolt with it?"""
00:03:56,00:03:57,You couldn't.
00:03:57,00:03:57,No.
00:03:57,00:03:59,It's like the opposite of a pull the bolt.
00:03:59,00:04:01,Yeah. It had to be straight.
00:04:01,00:04:04,And they conducted three songs with the baton.
00:04:04,00:04:07,And so that's what set the record.
00:04:07,00:04:11,But it is interesting because we tried to break a Guinness World Record recently on stage.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"Oh, yeah. Those rules are tough."
00:04:13,00:04:14,They're really tough.
00:04:14,00:04:15,What was it? We had to eat...
00:04:15,00:04:18,We had to eat as many cheese slices.
00:04:18,00:04:21,"You know, like that plastic cheese you put on burgers."
00:04:21,00:04:21,Yeah.
00:04:21,00:04:26,But the rule was that you had to take the plastic off as well.
00:04:26,00:04:28,And it just meant that it was impossible.
00:04:28,00:04:28,Because...
00:04:28,00:04:30,Yeah. And we had one minute to do it.
00:04:30,00:04:32,We had to eat 15 in one minute.
00:04:32,00:04:33,What?
00:04:33,00:04:35,And you're not allowed to drink water in between.
00:04:35,00:04:36,And I trained with water.
00:04:36,00:04:37,It's the only way I could do it.
00:04:37,00:04:37,You didn't...
00:04:37,00:04:41,"If you trained for that, then I'm worried about a sheep."
00:04:41,00:04:42,You ate about a quarter of a slice.
00:04:42,00:04:43,I know.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"Yeah, I know."
00:04:44,00:04:46,Because they didn't let me drink water.
00:04:46,00:04:48,I got stuck on stage and it was horrible.
00:04:48,00:04:50,So we didn't get a Guinness World Record.
00:04:50,00:04:54,"Interesting fact though, you got New Zealand a Guinness World Record the other day, didn't you?"
00:04:54,00:04:55,Stop it.
00:04:55,00:05:01,"Okay, I helped get a world record with the Hacker, the world's largest Hacker."
00:05:01,00:05:05,We took it from the slimy French.
00:05:05,00:05:05,The French.
00:05:05,00:05:06,Did you know that?
00:05:06,00:05:06,The French.
00:05:06,00:05:08,Why are the French huckering?
00:05:08,00:05:08,Exactly.
00:05:08,00:05:11,That feels culturally inappropriate to start off with.
00:05:11,00:05:12,I know.
00:05:12,00:05:19,"And funnily enough, the people who, the Guinness World Record Officiators actually acknowledged that."
00:05:19,00:05:21,But they didn't rescind the record.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"But they said, ""You're welcome to break it."""
00:05:23,00:05:26,"But of course, then the rules were a lot harder."
00:05:26,00:05:27,They came down real hard.
00:05:27,00:05:29,But we did it and we took it back.
00:05:29,00:05:30,And so it is now officially ours.
00:05:30,00:05:36,"And I'd like to see another country go, ""No, we're going to take it back off."""
00:05:36,00:05:37,The balls in that country.
00:05:37,00:05:39,That would be...
00:05:39,00:05:39,Not going to happen.
00:05:39,00:05:46,I'm not saying that people who are just doing these things to break records have something else missing in their lives.
00:05:46,00:05:48,Or I...
00:05:48,00:05:53,But I am saying that you don't see the Berlin Philharmonic or the London Symphony Orchestra competing over who's got the longest.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Buton.
00:05:54,00:05:57,And it doesn't sound like it's that useful.
00:05:57,00:06:01,Maybe they should because not as many people are going to classical concerts.
00:06:01,00:06:03,Do you think this is what would turn it around?
00:06:03,00:06:06,It would make me want to go.
00:06:06,00:06:08,You couldn't have anyone sitting in the front ten rows.
00:06:08,00:06:14,I hadn't realised quite how late the conductor came about as a position in an orchestra.
00:06:14,00:06:18,"Or the conductor, as we know it, as in someone who faces the orchestra."
00:06:18,00:06:26,"And with their right hand keeps the beat and with their left hand does things like bring new instruments in, inject emotion into it, things like that."
00:06:26,00:06:32,But that's relatively modern and actually composers used to do so much more than they do today.
00:06:32,00:06:42,"So in the 16th or 18th centuries, composers would also usually be playing the harpsichord piano in their pieces while performing and they would be conducting."
00:06:42,00:06:48,And it's weird this lasted at least 200 years and I don't know how it was effective because obviously often to play the piano you need two hands.
00:06:48,00:06:54,Or in the article I read it said to play the harpsichord well you do need two hands.
00:06:54,00:06:56,It's a very low bar.
00:06:56,00:06:59,So they'd have to nod their heads vigorously conducting the orchestra.
00:06:59,00:07:04,It's amazing. Sometimes it would be the violinist as well like the first violinist would do it with their bow.
00:07:04,00:07:08,"But again, it seems difficult because how do you play while you're waving the bow around?"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"I don't get it. Yeah, that was so weird."
00:07:10,00:07:12,But do we need it? Do we need the baton?
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Oh, don't start, Dan. Oh my God."
00:07:14,00:07:22,"So on the show a little while ago, Dan did say that people who are in orchestras shouldn't need sheet music."
00:07:22,00:07:26,Because Bruce Springsteen's band don't need sheet music.
00:07:26,00:07:33,All I was saying was there was an orchestra incident where the composer got angry with what was going on and took all the sheet music away.
00:07:33,00:07:37,And then the concert had to be cancelled because no one knew the songs.
00:07:37,00:07:43,"And I just thought, well, I mean, learn them? And I know it's controversial."
00:07:43,00:07:47,I've had a lot of bassoonists write to me and threaten my life and children's lives.
00:07:47,00:07:49,As you should.
00:07:49,00:07:55,But there has been an example where we have seen conducting happening without a baton or even the movement of hands.
00:07:55,00:07:57,And that was Leonard Bernstein.
00:07:57,00:08:00,There was that movie Maestro that was made not too long ago about him.
00:08:00,00:08:07,There's a very great video that you can watch online of him conducting an orchestra simply with the movement of his eyebrows.
00:08:07,00:08:09,And it's amazing.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"So he's just saying, it's a do-do-do-do-do."
00:08:11,00:08:15,"And it's just like, you know, a little, and then his eyes poke that way."
00:08:15,00:08:20,And it's not that song. That's the one that came to mind.
00:08:20,00:08:23,Dirty had his arms unbutated.
00:08:23,00:08:29,He wanted to show the power of when the synergy of an orchestra is so great that you can simply rely on looks and impressions.
00:08:29,00:08:31,Interesting.
00:08:31,00:08:35,There was a time in Soviet Russia where they did away with the conductors.
00:08:35,00:08:37,In what sense did away with?
00:08:37,00:08:42,They went a bit too close to those windows.
00:08:42,00:08:49,"Now, the idea was in a non-hierarchical communist society where everyone's equal."
00:08:49,00:08:53,"You don't need one person at the front who's, like, lording it over everyone else."
00:08:53,00:08:55,And for quite a while they did do that.
00:08:55,00:09:01,"And actually, in the '70s, Andre Previn in the UK, he did the same thing."
00:09:01,00:09:05,"He did a TV show where he said, OK, I'm conducting and now I'm going to stop."
00:09:05,00:09:09,"And they thought, everyone thought, oh, everything's just going to go to shit as soon as he leaves."
00:09:09,00:09:11,"But actually, it was kind of fine."
00:09:11,00:09:13,It's like when countries don't have governments.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"You know, Ireland and Northern Ireland didn't have a government for about three years."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"And everyone always goes, huh, didn't realize."
00:09:18,00:09:19,Yeah.
00:09:19,00:09:23,"We were talking earlier about, is there an importance to the length of a baton?"
00:09:23,00:09:27,And some conductors have a preference for the size.
00:09:27,00:09:29,They have a preference for the shape.
00:09:29,00:09:32,Some of them have lucky batons because they had an amazing experience.
00:09:32,00:09:34,So they become superstitious about it.
00:09:34,00:09:37,So it almost becomes like a wizard's wand in a way to them.
00:09:37,00:09:40,"They sort of feel that there's power embodied in it, right?"
00:09:40,00:09:45,"Fritz Reiner, who was a 20th century Hungarian conductor, he used one that was so small."
00:09:45,00:09:52,It was such a tiny baton that one musician at the back brought a pair of binoculars along to mock him
00:09:52,00:09:54,to show that he needed to do that to see him.
00:09:54,00:09:58,Fritz Reiner saw that and then replied when he was using the binoculars
00:09:58,00:10:01,"by lifting up a piece of paper that read, ""You're fired."""
00:10:01,00:10:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:02,00:10:04,Britain really small.
00:10:04,00:10:06,That's so funny.
00:10:06,00:10:12,"You know, conductors officially live longer than any other proficient."
00:10:12,00:10:14,Do we know why they live longer?
00:10:14,00:10:17,"Is it because they're basically richer and, you know, they come from..."
00:10:17,00:10:19,They live off nothing but caviar.
00:10:19,00:10:23,"No, they can only speculate."
00:10:23,00:10:29,"But they think on the back of the study, they think it's because you get so much upper body work out."
00:10:29,00:10:32,Some of these pieces that they're conducting go for like three hours.
00:10:32,00:10:37,It could be because you only really get a job as a conductor when you're quite old.
00:10:37,00:10:40,So it's kind of self-selecting.
00:10:40,00:10:42,"All the people who died in their 20s and 30s, they never become..."
00:10:42,00:10:44,That is also another...
00:10:44,00:10:49,"It does work out, but it's not like you're an Olympic athlete, is it?"
00:10:49,00:10:52,I've seen some of the famous conductors out there.
00:10:52,00:10:56,"In the 19th century, when conducting became a thing, it was really controversial."
00:10:56,00:10:58,Lots of composers didn't like it.
00:10:58,00:11:01,I think there were Schumann conductors.
00:11:01,00:11:05,Emania and Evil Verdi was outraged that they got to take a bow
00:11:05,00:11:07,because these composers thought these guys were pointless.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"But there was, at the time the conductors were suddenly appearing,"
00:11:10,00:11:15,"this one called Louis Julia, and he was so in awe of Beethoven"
00:11:15,00:11:17,"that whenever he played a piece of Beethoven,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,"he wore white gloves anyway to conduct,"
00:11:19,00:11:23,but he had a specific jeweled baton that was presented to him on a cushion
00:11:23,00:11:25,every time he conducted.
00:11:25,00:11:28,And I should tell you his full name. Do you know his full name?
00:11:28,00:11:29,No? No.
00:11:29,00:11:30,Do you want me to tell you his full name?
00:11:30,00:11:32,"No, please do."
00:11:32,00:11:37,"It was Louis George Maurice Adolf Roche Albert, Abel Antonio Alexandre Noé,"
00:11:37,00:11:40,"Lucien Daniel Lugin, Joseph LeBron, Joseph Parem, Thomas Thomas Thomas,"
00:11:40,00:11:43,"Thomas Thomas Pierre, Abel Pierre Morel, Bartel Ami,"
00:11:43,00:11:47,"Artus Alphonse Bertrand, Diodemne, Emmanuel, Josué, Vincent,"
00:11:47,00:11:52,"Luc Michel, Jules Laplaine, Jules Bertrand, Julia César, Julien."
00:11:52,00:11:54,What's his full name?
00:11:54,00:11:58,I think I follow him on Instagram.
00:11:58,00:12:01,"He could never get a driver's license, couldn't he?"
00:12:01,00:12:03,Did you have a stroke halfway through that?
00:12:03,00:12:07,Always were there like five Thomas's in a row?
00:12:07,00:12:10,I actually think I said one too many Thomas's. There were four Thomas's.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"And two of them seem to be hyphenated, but the reason was..."
00:12:13,00:12:16,He's got a double-barrelled Thomas in the mid-name?
00:12:16,00:12:19,"There's Thomas Thomas, Thomas Thomas."
00:12:19,00:12:22,But the reason for this name is that his dad...
00:12:22,00:12:25,So this is one of the leading conductors of the 19th century.
00:12:25,00:12:28,His dad was a musician who played in an orchestra.
00:12:28,00:12:32,He was a violinist and he was playing a concert just before his son was going to be baptized.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"And he said to the orchestra he was playing with, ""Does anyone want to be Godfather?"""
00:12:35,00:12:37,"And they all said, ""Yes."""
00:12:37,00:12:40,And so he named it after them all.
00:12:40,00:12:42,That's amazing.
00:12:42,00:12:45,I did not know we knew so many Thomas's.
00:12:45,00:12:53,"It's time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:12:53,00:12:56,"OK, my fact this week is that in Japan,"
00:12:56,00:13:01,you can buy rice bowls that are shaped by women's armpits.
00:13:01,00:13:04,[laughter]
00:13:04,00:13:06,Why?
00:13:06,00:13:11,"Well, I don't want to get into the mental state of the people who buy these things."
00:13:11,00:13:14,All I can say is that they exist.
00:13:14,00:13:19,I would say there's nothing I can shape with my armpit that I can't shape with my hands.
00:13:19,00:13:21,OK.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"They're not achieving a magical shape, are they?"
00:13:24,00:13:28,"No, well let me explain how they're made and it might give you a bit more of an insight."
00:13:28,00:13:34,"So these are onigiri, these little rice triangle things."
00:13:34,00:13:38,And they're kind of rice on the outside and they usually have a filling on the inside.
00:13:38,00:13:42,"And what happens is that the women who are going to make them,"
00:13:42,00:13:46,"they have their body parts disinfected,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,but then they exercise to produce sweat.
00:13:49,00:13:51,Oh.
00:13:51,00:13:57,And then they use their armpits to put the rice bowls into that exact shape
00:13:57,00:14:03,and apparently they sell for as much as ten times the price as regular rice bowls.
00:14:03,00:14:08,But a diner in an article that I read said they actually tasted no different to any other rice bowls.
00:14:08,00:14:10,[laughter]
00:14:10,00:14:14,And this is just a thing that happens and I'm not judging anyone.
00:14:14,00:14:15,That's fine.
00:14:15,00:14:17,It's wild.
00:14:17,00:14:21,The inviting people back to watch them be made is pretty amazing.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"So that's the thing that happens when you go to the restaurant and they say,"
00:14:24,00:14:27,"""Would you like to see them being molded in the armpits live?"""
00:14:27,00:14:29,And you can do that.
00:14:29,00:14:31,You've got to pay extra for that.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"Yeah, possibly, or maybe it's part of the deal."
00:14:34,00:14:36,"Well, otherwise they might do it with their hands."
00:14:36,00:14:37,There you go.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"If you're not seeing it happen, maybe you don't trust them."
00:14:40,00:14:43,It sort of sounds like this restaurant has an OnlyFans page.
00:14:43,00:14:45,[laughter]
00:14:45,00:14:47,It sounds like something else is going on.
00:14:47,00:14:49,"The only thing that makes it slightly less gross,"
00:14:49,00:14:54,"I guess, is that most people in Japan about 90% of people don't have odourful sweat,"
00:14:54,00:14:58,because they're lacking the gene that makes sweat smell really bad.
00:14:58,00:15:00,So it's not going to be the very...
00:15:00,00:15:04,"If we, you know, white Westerners did it, even worse."
00:15:04,00:15:08,"I'm not saying it's not disgusting, but this would be even more disgusting."
00:15:08,00:15:12,"One interesting thing about this is that onigiri in Japan,"
00:15:12,00:15:16,there was a study done where they found that 62% of Japanese people
00:15:16,00:15:20,would only eat an onigiri that was made by someone they know.
00:15:20,00:15:21,What?
00:15:21,00:15:24,And only 30% said that they would eat one that was made
00:15:24,00:15:26,by someone who was completely unfamiliar to them.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Right.
00:15:27,00:15:30,"And that comes from, like, a historical thing,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,where there's been quite a few times in history
00:15:32,00:15:35,"where people have been poisoned by rice balls,"
00:15:35,00:15:38,or at least according to the stories they have been.
00:15:38,00:15:40,And so there's kind of this superstition
00:15:40,00:15:43,that you should always see the person who's made your rice ball.
00:15:43,00:15:45,You're most likely to be killed by someone that you do know.
00:15:45,00:15:46,So what a stupid rule.
00:15:46,00:15:49,You should only eat rice balls made by someone you don't know.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"Don't let your wife make them for you, for God's sake."
00:15:52,00:15:56,"It's very popular globally, onigiri."
00:15:56,00:15:57,There's even a society.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"There's the onigiri society,"
00:15:59,00:16:02,and it attracts members who love it so much.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"There's one guy who was the owner of the thing called onigiri bongo,"
00:16:05,00:16:10,and she has said that she would like to come back in her next life as a rice ball.
00:16:10,00:16:13,"And the follow-up question in the interview,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"""What flavor would you like to come back?"""
00:16:15,00:16:18,"She said, ""It doesn't matter. Onigiri isn't about the shape."
00:16:18,00:16:20,It is about the soul.
00:16:20,00:16:23,"I want to come back as one that has been made with the whole heart."""
00:16:23,00:16:25,So it's a bill.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"God, they make them with the heart as well."
00:16:27,00:16:31,I want to know if the flavors for these rice balls
00:16:31,00:16:33,"are sort of like ricksona type things,"
00:16:33,00:16:37,like sea breeze and mountain mist in New Africa.
00:16:37,00:16:42,"But hang on, isn't rice got that whole thing with bacteria"
00:16:42,00:16:44,that it's really bad at eating?
00:16:44,00:16:47,"Yeah, you're not supposed to double-cuck it, right?"
00:16:47,00:16:51,"Yeah, and that it's really good at holding bad bacteria."
00:16:51,00:16:53,And you're putting it somewhere where a whole bunch of bacteria...
00:16:53,00:16:57,"To be honest, honestly, the bacteria that's in your armpit, generally speaking,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,is not going to be super bad stuff.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"Also, and this is less a fact and more just like a useful lie fact"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"that I always remind myself, it's not a problem."
00:17:04,00:17:06,The rice bacteria thing has been hugely overblown.
00:17:06,00:17:09,Reheating rice is absolutely fine for many days afterwards.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"The only thing to do, if you really do want to avoid the still quite slim risk"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"of the sort of poisoning that we're talking about,"
00:17:15,00:17:17,is you need to make it cool very quickly.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"So as soon as you've cooked rice, put all the shit you're not going to eat in the fridge."
00:17:20,00:17:23,"Like have it every mouthful, take it out of the fridge and eat another mouthful,"
00:17:23,00:17:26,then put it back in the fridge. And then it's fine for days.
00:17:26,00:17:29,Here's another thing. So sushi kind of predates...
00:17:29,00:17:33,"We all associate it with Japan, but there's evidence of it in China."
00:17:33,00:17:38,"And so sushi, you would have bits of fish, salted fish, and you would have the rice."
00:17:38,00:17:41,"In the very earliest days of sushi, when you pulled out the fish with the rice,"
00:17:41,00:17:44,you threw away the rice. It just didn't eat the rice to begin with.
00:17:44,00:17:47,It was part basically of a refrigeration process
00:17:47,00:17:50,"and making sure exactly about bacteria and so on, not getting into it."
00:17:50,00:17:53,"So it took ages before someone went, ""Should we eat that bit as well?"""
00:17:53,00:17:56,"And they did. And then they went, ""Well, that's actually good."""
00:17:56,00:18:00,"And so if a time traveller came forward and saw us doing that, they'd be like, ""Whoa!"""
00:18:00,00:18:02,It's like eating a Haribo packet.
00:18:02,00:18:07,"Well, actually on rice waste, I didn't realise,"
00:18:07,00:18:10,obviously rice is such an important food stuff in Japan
00:18:10,00:18:13,"because it's used as an ingredient for so many other things, obvious including sake."
00:18:13,00:18:16,"And with sake, when they make it, they lose."
00:18:16,00:18:20,"If you're making really high level sake, you have to lose about 70% of the rice."
00:18:20,00:18:24,So they polish it. Every little grain of rice has to be polished
00:18:24,00:18:28,until you've sanded down almost all of the outside of it.
00:18:28,00:18:29,So where's that going?
00:18:29,00:18:30,Down the train.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Down the train?
00:18:31,00:18:32,Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:36,"So really, really good white rice, really gleaming white rice that's been polished"
00:18:36,00:18:37,and looks amazing.
00:18:37,00:18:40,That was a status symbol for a long time in Japan.
00:18:40,00:18:45,"And there was a problem because if you remove those outer layers,"
00:18:45,00:18:47,so what you do when you're polishing rice
00:18:47,00:18:49,is you're basically washing it again and again and again.
00:18:49,00:18:53,"But if you remove those layers, then it removes quite a lot of the good stuff,"
00:18:53,00:18:57,especially the vitamin B1 or thiamine.
00:18:57,00:19:01,"Okay, so without thiamine, you get this terrible disease called berry berry."
00:19:01,00:19:06,And it can kill.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"She starts a bit harsh, James."
00:19:09,00:19:11,"I mean, it might not be up your street, but..."
00:19:11,00:19:13,It's berry berry.
00:19:13,00:19:16,"And it's really, but I mean, you can die from it for sure."
00:19:16,00:19:19,"And it really is strange because it's very similar to, you know,"
00:19:19,00:19:23,"the thing in the West, people would get on ships and they wouldn't eat oranges"
00:19:23,00:19:25,and lemons and stuff and they would get scurvy.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"Well, in Japan, they had a similar thing because they're eating this white rice."
00:19:29,00:19:31,They would get this berry berry.
00:19:31,00:19:35,And so there's a guy called Takaki who was a doctor and he did an experiment
00:19:35,00:19:39,"where he sent two ships on the same route, on the same route, sorry."
00:19:39,00:19:41,And one of them would eat rice all the time.
00:19:41,00:19:46,And then the other one would be allowed to have like meat and bread and stuff like that.
00:19:46,00:19:49,And he thought this is going to prove that the problem is the rice.
00:19:49,00:19:53,"And sure enough, when they came back, the people who were on the rice ship"
00:19:53,00:19:56,"were suffering, but the people who weren't were much better."
00:19:56,00:19:59,And that's when they realized that you can't just eat rice all the time.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"And he said that if the experiment had failed, he was going to kill himself."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"Oh, wow."
00:20:06,00:20:11,"But yeah, within a few years of that, they got rid of this bitumen b1 deficiency"
00:20:11,00:20:15,"in the same way that in the Western world, we got rid of scurvy by just giving people lemons."
00:20:15,00:20:16,And he didn't have to do it himself.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"It's not funny, but it's interesting."
00:20:18,00:20:19,It is.
00:20:19,00:20:24,I wish more scientists said that they would kill themselves if their experiment had failed.
00:20:24,00:20:28,"I think that would really raise the caliber, wouldn't it?"
00:20:28,00:20:30,If there was that risk.
00:20:30,00:20:33,Japan eats more dairy than rice.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"Interesting, really."
00:20:35,00:20:37,I thought they didn't really eat much dairy.
00:20:37,00:20:39,"Well, that's bloody bewildering, isn't it?"
00:20:39,00:20:41,Because most of them are lactose intolerant.
00:20:41,00:20:43,What are you doing?
00:20:43,00:20:44,So where are they eating?
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And in Japanese people in the audience, why are they eating so much dairy?"
00:20:47,00:20:49,"Well, they're eating it as milk."
00:20:49,00:20:52,So I think about 85%.
00:20:52,00:20:53,And estimates always vary.
00:20:53,00:20:59,Some of them are between 80% and 95% of East Asians are lactose intolerant.
00:20:59,00:21:02,And it's actually related to the gene that means your sweat doesn't smell.
00:21:02,00:21:05,"But still, dairy's become very popular."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"And if you eat little bits of it, so what, you have diarrhea."
00:21:07,00:21:09,"You know, it's worth it for a pizza."
00:21:09,00:21:16,"Yeah, the rice consumption has halved in the last 40 years,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,and dairy's consumption has gone up a lot.
00:21:18,00:21:21,"So I grew up in Hong Kong, right, until I was 12 years old."
00:21:21,00:21:24,And the thing that always was said about me is that I smell of milk.
00:21:24,00:21:27,Because it's not a big thing in Hong Kong as well.
00:21:27,00:21:29,Milk is not a massive thing.
00:21:29,00:21:31,And that was like a nickname that I always used to like.
00:21:31,00:21:35,"There was this one particular mum who was always like, oh, milk boys here, is he?"
00:21:35,00:21:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:36,00:21:40,So you weren't being bullied by the other kids in the school.
00:21:40,00:21:42,You were being bullied by the parents.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Yeah, by this one mum."
00:21:43,00:21:44,"Yeah, I used to go to her son's house."
00:21:44,00:21:45,He was called Daniel as well.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"And she was, yeah, she was like, oh, milk boys here again."
00:21:48,00:21:53,"And so that really stuck with me, that I was like, reeked of milk all the time."
00:21:53,00:21:55,That's so funny.
00:21:55,00:22:02,"Yeah, the Great Wall of China, they found it has been held together largely by rice, sticky rice."
00:22:02,00:22:03,Sticky rice.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"Yeah, it's part of the mortar that they made."
00:22:06,00:22:11,"They're a university in China, the Xi Jiang University."
00:22:11,00:22:14,"They were researching the mortar of the Great Wall of China,"
00:22:14,00:22:17,and the mortar along with the lime is sticky rice.
00:22:17,00:22:18,Interesting.
00:22:18,00:22:22,"And back to your point around the polishing of the rice,"
00:22:22,00:22:25,"they think that a lot of it was actually used with polish rice,"
00:22:25,00:22:29,which means there's a lot of extra work needed to make that.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Why have they polished that rice?
00:22:30,00:22:32,"To get stickier, I guess."
00:22:32,00:22:34,Maybe it makes stickier sticky rice.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Maybe it gets it stickier.
00:22:35,00:22:37,Why do we not use it anymore then?
00:22:37,00:22:39,"Because that wall is going pretty strong, isn't it?"
00:22:39,00:22:40,It's doing great.
00:22:40,00:22:45,"Yeah, but they did actually think it is actually the world's first example of composite mortar,"
00:22:45,00:22:49,where you're including organic and inorganic material together.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"And they say that it is actually very, very good."
00:22:53,00:22:57,"That's what the architects say, is it, in the report."
00:22:57,00:22:59,"Very, very good."
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Very, very good."
00:23:01,00:23:02,Sorry.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"In answer to your question, Dan, we might have gone with even more efficient building materials now."
00:23:06,00:23:08,No offense to the ancient Chinese.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Okay.
00:23:09,00:23:11,If anyone is in from ancient China.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Okay.
00:23:12,00:23:13,That is.
00:23:13,00:23:17,"Rice is a huge source of pride in Japan, in Japan and China, in fact."
00:23:17,00:23:22,"But it's a real patriotic thing, maybe slightly less so now,"
00:23:22,00:23:28,but I haven't realised that it was illegal to import any rice into Japan until the mid-1990s.
00:23:28,00:23:29,'90s?
00:23:29,00:23:31,It was early to mid-90s.
00:23:31,00:23:35,"Yeah, when America sort of bullied Japan into saying you've got to accept some of our exports."
00:23:35,00:23:40,Because Japan always wanted to be rice self-sufficient and be able to grow all of its own rice.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"And even now, there's a lot of skepticism."
00:23:44,00:23:49,"I was talking to my friend, who has Japanese family in America,"
00:23:49,00:23:53,"and was saying that they will often buy at a much higher price,"
00:23:53,00:23:56,"rice that's been imported to America from Japan,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,because they think it's much higher quality.
00:23:59,00:24:01,"Even though in blind taste tests,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,they almost always can't tell any difference whatsoever between American rice and Japanese rice.
00:24:04,00:24:07,But the idea is that it's much higher quality.
00:24:07,00:24:08,That is.
00:24:08,00:24:10,I've got one last thing quickly that I can mention.
00:24:10,00:24:12,This is just going back to armpits.
00:24:12,00:24:17,There's an amazing festival that used to happen.
00:24:17,00:24:21,"I think it's just stopped, but hopefully the mention on this podcast will bring it back."
00:24:21,00:24:24,"In Nevada, in a place called Battle Mountain."
00:24:24,00:24:30,"And basically, there was a journalist who called this particular town the armpit of America."
00:24:30,00:24:33,And they were very upset by this.
00:24:33,00:24:38,And so they set up a competition which was sponsored by a deodorant company.
00:24:38,00:24:39,I believe it was Old Spice.
00:24:39,00:24:41,And they turned it into a plus.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"And so they had the armpit beauty queen contest,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,whereby it was brilliant.
00:24:47,00:24:51,So you would go and it would be a big festival and you would have a sweaty t-shirt contest.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"Can I just say, so is it who has the most beautiful armpit?"
00:24:54,00:24:55,Yeah.
00:24:55,00:24:58,"And then in like beauty contest, you have to do like a skill as well."
00:24:58,00:24:59,Yes.
00:24:59,00:25:01,So they're doing that thing where they make fart noises.
00:25:01,00:25:02,Yes.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Yeah, they do the fart noises."
00:25:04,00:25:06,There's deodorant throwing competitions.
00:25:06,00:25:09,So I think who can throw the deodorant the furthest.
00:25:09,00:25:11,There's quick draw deodorant competitions.
00:25:11,00:25:14,Who can get it and spray it as quickly as possible.
00:25:14,00:25:17,And then eventually they crown the armpit queen.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"But yeah, they've really leaned into it."
00:25:19,00:25:23,"They're motto, which they now have on the sign as you enter Battle Mountain."
00:25:23,00:25:26,"Says, make Battle Mountain your next pit stop."
00:25:26,00:25:28,"Oh, brilliant."
00:25:28,00:25:34,[Music]
00:25:34,00:25:36,It is time for fact number three.
00:25:36,00:25:38,And that is my fact.
00:25:38,00:25:42,"My fact this week is that 2,500 years ago,"
00:25:42,00:25:46,Buddha taught the world that the road to enlightenment
00:25:46,00:25:49,"could be achieved through compassion, mindfulness,"
00:25:49,00:25:52,and the eradication of the game hopscotch.
00:25:52,00:25:54,[Laughter]
00:25:54,00:25:56,He hated hopscotch.
00:25:56,00:25:57,What?
00:25:57,00:26:02,Buddha hated any game whereby you drew on the ground
00:26:02,00:26:05,and you were using your feet to sort of be confined
00:26:05,00:26:07,by the drawing on the ground.
00:26:07,00:26:09,And hopscotch is exactly what that is.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"It might not have existed during the day,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"but if Buddha came back now,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"he'd be like, what the hell's this?"
00:26:15,00:26:16,Did you learn nothing?
00:26:16,00:26:20,"I guess these kind of hopscotch type games are very, very old, aren't they?"
00:26:20,00:26:21,And they're all over the world.
00:26:21,00:26:23,So there would have been something that we would have seen
00:26:23,00:26:25,that would have looked a bit like hopscotch.
00:26:25,00:26:27,Did he suppose that he banned drawing on the ground
00:26:27,00:26:29,"and stepping in the squares that you've created, didn't he?"
00:26:29,00:26:30,Yes.
00:26:30,00:26:32,I'd say that's hopscotch.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"He also banned all dice games,"
00:26:35,00:26:38,"all stick games, all marble games,"
00:26:38,00:26:41,"all games where you blow through toy pipes,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,"all games where you turn some assaults,"
00:26:43,00:26:45,"games where you play with toy windmills,"
00:26:45,00:26:48,"games where you play with toy chariots, toy bows,"
00:26:48,00:26:50,games where you guess the letters drawn in the air
00:26:50,00:26:52,"or they're on the back of the body,"
00:26:52,00:26:56,and games where you mimic deformities.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"I think the last one, fair enough."
00:26:59,00:27:00,"Yeah, that's good."
00:27:00,00:27:03,"He sort of got into a good rhythm right at the end there, didn't he?"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"But he also guessing a friend's thoughts,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,"not allowed by Buddha,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,playing with someone's ears.
00:27:10,00:27:11,Why?
00:27:11,00:27:14,No wet willies in the world.
00:27:14,00:27:16,Why is this guy such a killjoy?
00:27:16,00:27:17,I know.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Why is he always smiling?
00:27:18,00:27:19,It's weird.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"And all eyes or nose, to be fair."
00:27:21,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:23,No facial parts.
00:27:23,00:27:26,"And no Jenga and no pickup sticks, either."
00:27:26,00:27:28,Was Jenga around back then?
00:27:28,00:27:29,"Well, again, he specified,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,and it is interesting to see how these concepts go back.
00:27:31,00:27:33,He specified no games that involve adding pieces
00:27:33,00:27:35,or removing pieces from piles.
00:27:35,00:27:36,Wow.
00:27:36,00:27:38,We're some unimaginative humans.
00:27:38,00:27:40,We just generate the same old shit.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"Oh, wow."
00:27:41,00:27:42,And why was it?
00:27:42,00:27:44,It was to stop people getting distracted from scripture
00:27:44,00:27:45,"and holiness, wasn't it?"
00:27:45,00:27:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:27:46,00:27:48,"You know, it's a philosophy,"
00:27:48,00:27:50,and Buddha did say that this should all be altered
00:27:50,00:27:52,"as we go along, hence why we now have hopscotch."
00:27:52,00:27:53,But...
00:27:53,00:27:54,I don't think that's...
00:27:54,00:27:56,He said that therefor we have hopscotch.
00:27:56,00:27:58,"I don't think we were waiting for the 1,000-year cut-off,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"and then we went, right, Buddha said it's okay now."
00:28:00,00:28:02,Get the chalk out.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Well, you say that."
00:28:03,00:28:05,"There was no hopscotch then, and there is now."
00:28:05,00:28:07,So I don't know...
00:28:07,00:28:08,"One thing we should say, you say,"
00:28:08,00:28:09,"""Why is he smiling all the time?"""
00:28:09,00:28:11,"That's not Buddha, is it?"
00:28:11,00:28:12,"Yeah, you're right."
00:28:12,00:28:15,That's someone who we've accidentally labeled as Buddha.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"Yeah, so Buddha's birth name was said already."
00:28:17,00:28:20,"Buddha's birth name was Siddhartha Gautama,"
00:28:20,00:28:24,and he was someone who was born into royalty.
00:28:24,00:28:26,He was a very well-to-do person.
00:28:26,00:28:29,"But then he found a path of enlightenment, basically,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,and then he brought all his followers on.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"And by the smiling one,"
00:28:32,00:28:35,"you mean the big sort of fat Buddha that you get on, like, you know?"
00:28:35,00:28:37,"Yes, the smiling Jolly Buddha."
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Yeah, that was a Chinese monk who was called Uday."
00:28:40,00:28:42,So you can understand the confusion.
00:28:42,00:28:43,"That's pretty close, close enough."
00:28:43,00:28:44,Tomato tomato.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Yeah.
00:28:45,00:28:48,And one thing that he banned as well was playing with toy carts.
00:28:48,00:28:50,Like a little toy cart.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"But, I mean, it would be easy, wouldn't it?"
00:28:52,00:28:55,"Because you'd be like, ""Oi, you, with the toy cart."""
00:28:55,00:28:56,"I'd be like, ""No, it's not a toy cart."""
00:28:56,00:28:58,I'm actually... This is legit.
00:28:58,00:29:01,I'm just a little kid carrying these stones over there.
00:29:01,00:29:02,It could be work.
00:29:02,00:29:03,You could be child labour.
00:29:03,00:29:06,I'm just jump-sporting fluff.
00:29:06,00:29:09,There's lots of ways out of it.
00:29:09,00:29:13,Is this stuff all from those book of rules called the Vinaya?
00:29:13,00:29:14,I think it might be from that.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Yeah.
00:29:15,00:29:17,"There's some other rules in there that says,"
00:29:17,00:29:20,"""A monk shall not tickle a mother monk."""
00:29:20,00:29:21,Yeah.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"Or, ""Lie down in a bed scattered with flowers."""
00:29:24,00:29:25,Wow.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Okay.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"Well, that's always a prelude to something more sexy, isn't it?"
00:29:29,00:29:32,Especially when tickling comes straight afterwards.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:34,It's very nice.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"Well, but so is playing with someone's ears, eyes or nose,"
00:29:37,00:29:38,which he was against as well.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"And that sometimes is a prelude, too."
00:29:40,00:29:41,"Well, I mean, where I come..."
00:29:41,00:29:42,Anyway.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Yeah.
00:29:43,00:29:46,I guess one of the stuff in really specific circumstances
00:29:46,00:29:48,could be the prelude to some sexy stuff.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"Particularly the one with the guessing,"
00:29:50,00:29:54,"""Lessons traced with a finger and the ear on somebody's back."""
00:29:54,00:29:55,Yeah.
00:29:55,00:29:56,That's definitely cock-and-balls.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Cock-and-balls again.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Stop.
00:29:58,00:30:01,Can you stop doing cock-and-balls on my back?
00:30:01,00:30:03,That's all you can do.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"They were Sanskrit letters, weren't they?"
00:30:05,00:30:06,Cock-and-balls.
00:30:06,00:30:07,Yeah.
00:30:07,00:30:11,I have found out a really interesting thing about the etymology of Buddha.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yeah.
00:30:12,00:30:15,And that is that it...
00:30:15,00:30:19,"So that's from a Sanskrit term, which is ""bud"" to awaken,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"to, you know, enlightenment awakening."
00:30:21,00:30:23,You can see how it comes from that.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"But what I find amazing is, of course,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,that word originated in India where Buddhism originated.
00:30:28,00:30:34,"And that nonetheless has the same origin as the word ""bodh."""
00:30:34,00:30:36,"Our word, ""bodh,"" it bodes well,"
00:30:36,00:30:39,"which is just from old English sacks and languages,"
00:30:39,00:30:43,"because they both date back even further to Pai,"
00:30:43,00:30:45,which I'm sure you all know as Proto-Indo-European.
00:30:45,00:30:51,"And so 8,000 years ago, these two languages sort of split,"
00:30:51,00:30:55,"and we got ""bodh"" from the same origin as they got Buddha,"
00:30:55,00:30:56,and now they've met again.
00:30:56,00:30:57,I find that amazing.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"Oh, that is incredible."
00:30:58,00:31:00,Language can travel that far and then meet again.
00:31:00,00:31:01,It's very gross.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"Look, it's not funny, but it's really massive."
00:31:03,00:31:04,"No, that's amazing."
00:31:04,00:31:05,It's quite romantic.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"Well, I also have an unfunny etymology thing of hopscotch."
00:31:09,00:31:10,Go on.
00:31:10,00:31:16,"So the word ""scotch"" can mean an incensed line"
00:31:16,00:31:18,or scratch in the ground.
00:31:18,00:31:22,"So you pop in a scratch, scratching on the ground."
00:31:22,00:31:26,"And in fact, that got a young girl, a 10-year-old girl,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,"in trouble with the police, believe it or not,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,in Ramsgate a few years ago.
00:31:31,00:31:35,"A young 10-year-old girl was putting a hopscotch, scratching,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,and sensing a line in the ground.
00:31:38,00:31:40,And she was done for criminal damage.
00:31:40,00:31:41,She's so mad.
00:31:41,00:31:43,A 10-year-old.
00:31:43,00:31:46,The police officer came along and frightened.
00:31:46,00:31:50,"This is Bob Allen, the father of Lily Mae Allen."
00:31:50,00:31:51,She could be Lily Allen.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Maybe.
00:31:52,00:31:55,Maybe I should check these facts.
00:31:55,00:32:00,"Anyway, he came along and said,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"""Oy, that's your defacing public property?"""
00:32:03,00:32:04,Yeah.
00:32:04,00:32:05,"It's mad, isn't it?"
00:32:05,00:32:06,Why isn't it in?
00:32:06,00:32:07,Because this happens a lot in these news stories
00:32:07,00:32:09,"about people being arrested for, or not arrested for,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,given warnings by the police for drawing hopscotch things.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"It should be page one, police handbook."
00:32:14,00:32:17,Don't accuse a 10-year-old of graffiti and criminal damage
00:32:17,00:32:19,because he's drawn a fucking hopscotch.
00:32:19,00:32:22,We're all trying to get kids out of the house playing games.
00:32:22,00:32:23,It's so weird.
00:32:23,00:32:25,"She did, to be fair, in the place where you have to write"
00:32:25,00:32:28,"the letters and stuff, so you did write, ""Fuck the police."""
00:32:28,00:32:33,"I mean, to be fair, that also probably should be cheap."
00:32:33,00:32:34,Yeah.
00:32:34,00:32:37,"Hopscotch, you're talking about the etymology of it."
00:32:37,00:32:40,Do you know what it was called before it was called hopscotch?
00:32:40,00:32:41,"Oh, I don't know."
00:32:41,00:32:42,Scotch hop.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Oh.
00:32:43,00:32:44,Yeah.
00:32:44,00:32:45,That's nice.
00:32:45,00:32:46,"Just at some point, we just went, ""Oh, let's turn that round."""
00:32:46,00:32:48,It's like the rice and the sushi.
00:32:48,00:32:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:49,00:32:51,We just flipped it around and started using it different.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"The first mention is in a book by Francis Willoughby,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,and it's in the 17th century book of games.
00:32:57,00:33:00,And it's a big old book full of loads and loads of different games
00:33:00,00:33:01,you can play.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"And there's one chapter that's kind of disappeared,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,and we don't really know much about it now.
00:33:05,00:33:09,"And that chapter is called ""Tricks to Abuse and Hurt One Another."""
00:33:09,00:33:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:11,00:33:15,"So he had all-- it was like games you can play in the garden,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,games you can play by running around.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"And then this one, which is abusing and hurting one another."
00:33:20,00:33:22,"And the thing is, we do have the chapter heading,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"so we know what's in it, but we don't know what the games are."
00:33:25,00:33:26,So there was a game--
00:33:26,00:33:28,Is that also a sexy book?
00:33:28,00:33:31,"Is that the sexy-- because where I'm from, that's also a six."
00:33:31,00:33:32,Anyway.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"It's a kick-goin, sorry."
00:33:34,00:33:37,"There's one called ""Bying of Mustard."""
00:33:37,00:33:38,We don't know what it is.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"""Selling of Millstones."""
00:33:40,00:33:42,"""Bum to Bus a Fool."""
00:33:42,00:33:44,"""Bum to Butter."""
00:33:44,00:33:46,"""Bum to Bus a Fool."""
00:33:46,00:33:49,"Oh, see, sexy as hell."
00:33:49,00:33:50,But lots of names.
00:33:50,00:33:53,"It was called ""Hickety-Hackety,"" and ""Hickety-Hackety-Hackety,"""
00:33:53,00:33:55,"and ""Paliali,"" and ""Hitchabed."""
00:33:55,00:33:58,I like the fact that games used to have so many different names.
00:33:58,00:34:00,Why have we codified them?
00:34:00,00:34:02,Did she just have another stroke?
00:34:02,00:34:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:04,00:34:07,"Yeah, Lele and Kit Kit and Thomas Thomas Thomas."
00:34:07,00:34:10,"When I was a kid, it used to be like we would play British Bulldog,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"where you have to run across the field,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,and then it's up to someone to rubby tackle you
00:34:14,00:34:16,and beat you to the ground.
00:34:16,00:34:17,"And then the school would ban it,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,and then we would just play it again under a different name.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"And we thought that this was a loophole,"
00:34:23,00:34:26,"that it's like, ""Oh, they banned British Bulldog,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,"but they didn't ban Blue Boy,"""
00:34:28,00:34:31,which is exactly the same game.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"And then they'd go, ""Yeah, that's banned as well."""
00:34:33,00:34:35,"And then the next day, we'd call it something else."
00:34:35,00:34:37,So maybe that was it.
00:34:37,00:34:39,Another bit of enlightenment.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"So in Buddhism, you have enlightenment."
00:34:42,00:34:44,"In the Jain religion, you also have enlightenment."
00:34:44,00:34:47,"They're really, really very similar religions."
00:34:47,00:34:49,They grew up from the same place.
00:34:49,00:34:52,"And in the Jain religion, there are 24 Ford Makers."
00:34:52,00:34:54,And these are people who have gone through
00:34:54,00:34:56,all of the different cycles
00:34:56,00:34:58,"and been reborn, reborn, reborn,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,and now they're out of the cycle.
00:35:00,00:35:01,These are perfect people.
00:35:01,00:35:04,So one of them is said to have floated perfectly still
00:35:04,00:35:06,"in his mother's womb,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,sending not so much as a ripple
00:35:08,00:35:10,so that he didn't harm his mother.
00:35:10,00:35:12,Which is nice.
00:35:12,00:35:14,They tended to be really tall and really old.
00:35:14,00:35:16,"So there's a guy called Nemanatha,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"who lived for 1,054 years."
00:35:18,00:35:20,300 years is a bachelor.
00:35:20,00:35:22,54 days is a monk.
00:35:22,00:35:25,And then 700 years is an omniscient being.
00:35:25,00:35:28,And then another 200 years is a conductor.
00:35:28,00:35:33,And this guy was 30 meters tall.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"So if he was a building in London,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,he would need a second staircase due to fire regulations.
00:35:38,00:35:44,That's amazing.
00:35:44,00:35:47,I can't believe he tolerated 300 years being single
00:35:47,00:35:50,"before going, ""You know what? I'm just going to say I'm a monk."""
00:35:50,00:35:52,Five years to me.
00:35:52,00:35:54,So the idea of Buddhism largely
00:35:54,00:35:56,is to achieve enlightenment.
00:35:56,00:35:58,And this goes through many different disciplines
00:35:58,00:36:00,that are involved in philosophy.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"So George Harrison, who joined that whole movement,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"he was Buddhist and he went through various other things,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,became Hare Krishna at the end of his life.
00:36:08,00:36:09,From the Beatles?
00:36:09,00:36:10,"From the Beatles, yes."
00:36:10,00:36:13,For anyone who's not heard of George Harrison.
00:36:13,00:36:16,"We have lots of young cool listeners, Dan."
00:36:17,00:36:20,Not cool if they don't know George Harrison.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"So I don't know if you all remember,"
00:36:24,00:36:26,but it was a horrible moment that happened
00:36:26,00:36:28,"just after the turn of the millennium,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,"where someone broke into his house and stabbed him,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,and he got stabbed multiple times.
00:36:32,00:36:34,He miraculously survived.
00:36:34,00:36:35,It was really amazing.
00:36:35,00:36:37,But the account of when he was dying
00:36:37,00:36:40,was George Harrison basically was waiting for the moment
00:36:40,00:36:43,"to achieve enlightenment, to take him to the next level."
00:36:43,00:36:45,"So at one point, when he was being attacked by this guy,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,"he sort of gave into it and just said,"
00:36:47,00:36:49,"""Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna."""
00:36:49,00:36:51,"And he repeated it over and over,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,"and it was, ""I need to get to enlightenment before I die."""
00:36:53,00:36:56,He survived because his wife leapt on the back of this guy
00:36:56,00:37:00,and beat him down with a side lamp that was on a bedside table.
00:37:00,00:37:02,And so blood was everywhere.
00:37:02,00:37:04,It was an astonishingly bad thing.
00:37:04,00:37:05,He should have died.
00:37:05,00:37:07,"Everyone said he should have died, the doctors and so on."
00:37:07,00:37:09,"And there's a great story that Eric Idle tells,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,which is as he's leaving the house and he's on a gurney
00:37:12,00:37:15,"and they're bringing into the ambulance,"
00:37:15,00:37:20,"he passes two new members of staff who started that day,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,and that was their first morning.
00:37:22,00:37:26,"And as they passed, a week and almost dead, George Harrison went,"
00:37:26,00:37:29,"""So how are you finding the job so far?"""
00:37:29,00:37:32,(Laughter)
00:37:32,00:37:35,"And that could have been his last words ever, but yeah."
00:37:35,00:37:37,I love that.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"And according to Olivia Harrison,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,"his wife, he did achieve enlightenment right at the end."
00:37:41,00:37:43,She saw him ascend.
00:37:43,00:37:45,According to his wife?
00:37:45,00:37:48,I'm just saying it's a happy ending.
00:37:48,00:37:49,"I think, yeah, sure."
00:37:49,00:37:51,"The second person ever to achieve enlightenment,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,according to George Harrison's wife.
00:37:53,00:37:56,There is a type of Buddhist meditation that I quite fancy
00:37:56,00:38:00,"and I didn't know about, which requires you to find a corpse."
00:38:00,00:38:02,This is such a dark note to end on.
00:38:02,00:38:04,Oh my God.
00:38:04,00:38:06,And dig it up.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"No, not dig it up."
00:38:07,00:38:10,To find a corpse and sit there and watch it decay.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"And I didn't know about this, and it's the nine stages of decay,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,and you have to sit in front of a corpse.
00:38:15,00:38:17,I don't know what the family are doing at the time.
00:38:17,00:38:18,They just let you do it.
00:38:18,00:38:20,And it's amazing.
00:38:20,00:38:22,"So you start with bloat, and then rupture,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,"and then, you know, like, I won't take you through all nine stages."
00:38:25,00:38:26,You know what?
00:38:26,00:38:28,I think I might stick with my meditation app.
00:38:28,00:38:30,(Laughter)
00:38:30,00:38:32,"It's coming up in the next lesson,"
00:38:32,00:38:35,"but it's done in a very sexy American woman's voice,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,so you'll find it really nice.
00:38:37,00:38:39,And you would like to do that?
00:38:39,00:38:42,"Sounds pretty fun, of a week, you know?"
00:38:42,00:38:45,"So where I'm from, that's actually quite sexy."
00:38:45,00:38:47,"Sorry, no."
00:38:47,00:38:49,That's sorry. No.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"I'm from Tim's, by the way."
00:38:51,00:38:53,(Laughter)
00:38:53,00:38:55,We do things proper there.
00:38:55,00:38:57,(Music)
00:38:57,00:39:02,"All right, Lo, we need to get to our final fact of the show."
00:39:02,00:39:05,"It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna."
00:39:05,00:39:07,My fact this week is that...
00:39:07,00:39:09,(Laughter)
00:39:09,00:39:15,Is that a patio for cats is called a catio?
00:39:15,00:39:17,(Laughter)
00:39:17,00:39:21,It's very silly.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"I just really want to say now,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,this is the most stupid fact I've ever said on the show.
00:39:26,00:39:28,(Laughter)
00:39:28,00:39:30,And I couldn't believe these guys...
00:39:30,00:39:32,"Listen, she's always like this."
00:39:32,00:39:34,"I don't know, I'm ashamed,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"but I'm going to tell you now, because you're here."
00:39:36,00:39:38,"So, catios are a thing."
00:39:38,00:39:42,And maybe it'll come in handy with your cat-loving friends.
00:39:42,00:39:44,"You know, you can be like, ""Have you got a catio yet?"""
00:39:44,00:39:48,"Because every site and every company that sells stuff for pets,"
00:39:48,00:39:51,"it's just like, ""Hey, have you got the best catio available?"""
00:39:51,00:39:55,And apparently that's just an accepted way to refer to cat patios.
00:39:55,00:39:59,"And, you know, so that you can let them outside without them..."
00:39:59,00:40:02,"It's like a patio, as we know it,"
00:40:02,00:40:05,"but with a cage around it, as they know it,"
00:40:05,00:40:08,"so that they can't escape onto the roads and get run over,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,and so that they also can't kill all the birds.
00:40:10,00:40:12,Are you being paid for this?
00:40:12,00:40:14,Is this a secret ad?
00:40:14,00:40:16,"It's bizarre, isn't it?"
00:40:16,00:40:18,Is there an offer-code fish at the end of this?
00:40:18,00:40:21,It's not even a brand. It's a generic term.
00:40:21,00:40:23,It's probably in the OED by now.
00:40:23,00:40:26,"It's just a generic term that pet owners are accepting, a catio."
00:40:26,00:40:28,"So, get one."
00:40:28,00:40:31,"Ramps, tunnels, swing bridges, they can be yours."
00:40:31,00:40:33,(Laughter)
00:40:33,00:40:36,"So, we just had a heckle from the audience,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,and I am going to address it.
00:40:38,00:40:41,"I wouldn't usually, but it said, ""Did you know about our native birds?"""
00:40:41,00:40:44,"And we're in New Zealand, and the whole point of a cat patio"
00:40:44,00:40:47,"is to protect the native birds, so they're very in demand in New Zealand."
00:40:47,00:40:49,(Applause)
00:40:49,00:40:54,"You don't get other comedians dealing with hecklers like that, do you?"
00:40:54,00:40:56,(Laughter)
00:40:56,00:40:58,"Well, you go, ""Fuck off, mate!"""
00:40:58,00:41:00,But that was beautiful.
00:41:00,00:41:02,"No, it's a good question, actually."
00:41:02,00:41:05,"Yes, the Lyles, I mean, how famous is the Lyles Wren in New Zealand?"
00:41:05,00:41:07,Do you all know the Lyles Wren?
00:41:07,00:41:09,"Well, okay, I feel like no."
00:41:09,00:41:11,"No, I don't, for my benefit."
00:41:11,00:41:15,"So, the Lyles Wren was a New Zealand bird."
00:41:15,00:41:18,"It was having an absolute whale of a time for thousands of years,"
00:41:18,00:41:22,"and the Marys arrived almost a thousand years ago,"
00:41:22,00:41:26,"and they gradually sort of wiped it out, not intentionally,"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"by bringing rats with them, which killed it."
00:41:30,00:41:32,"But there were a few left by the 19th century,"
00:41:32,00:41:35,"and then European settlers arrived, and they really fucked it,"
00:41:35,00:41:39,and the only ones left were of this lovely Lyles Wren
00:41:39,00:41:42,"were on a place called Stevens Island, which I'm sure a lot of of you know,"
00:41:42,00:41:46,"and there was a lighthouse set up in 1894,"
00:41:46,00:41:49,"but the lighthouse keeper brought cats,"
00:41:49,00:41:55,"and the very, very last Lyles Wren was eaten by tibbles the cat."
00:41:55,00:41:57,(Laughter)
00:41:57,00:42:02,"But the owner kept the body, so we do have the last body of the Lyles Wren."
00:42:02,00:42:03,"Oh, right."
00:42:03,00:42:07,"Domestic cats, they're responsible for the extinction of at least,"
00:42:07,00:42:10,"like, almost a dozen species, I would say, right?"
00:42:10,00:42:11,Right.
00:42:11,00:42:14,"And they're even eating penguins in New Zealand,"
00:42:14,00:42:17,they're running up mountains eating lizards.
00:42:17,00:42:19,"Because when you say it doesn't, you mean in New Zealand, right?"
00:42:19,00:42:20,Yeah.
00:42:20,00:42:21,"Yeah, it's just in New Zealand that many."
00:42:21,00:42:23,"So, are we saying death to cats?"
00:42:23,00:42:24,Wow.
00:42:24,00:42:25,"No, we're not."
00:42:25,00:42:26,Jesus.
00:42:26,00:42:28,"Wow, wow."
00:42:28,00:42:29,"Controversial, controversial."
00:42:29,00:42:34,"What's his name, the trade me guy that's trying to get them all killed?"
00:42:34,00:42:35,"That guy, yeah."
00:42:35,00:42:36,Wow.
00:42:36,00:42:37,It's a big thing in New Zealand.
00:42:37,00:42:38,There's people advocating.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"I think there's even a political party, isn't there,"
00:42:40,00:42:41,to kill the cats?
00:42:41,00:42:42,What?
00:42:42,00:42:43,Or something.
00:42:43,00:42:44,I don't know.
00:42:44,00:42:46,You might want to check that.
00:42:46,00:42:49,"But I've got to say, I've watched a lot of New Zealand comedy."
00:42:49,00:42:52,I didn't know that this death of cats was a threat.
00:42:52,00:42:53,I agree.
00:42:53,00:42:57,"So, we're slightly also talking about luxury for pets, right?"
00:42:57,00:42:58,This has a practical purpose.
00:42:58,00:43:02,"But if you say to anyone, ""My cat has a catio,"" you're going to be, I think,"
00:43:02,00:43:03,slightly mocked.
00:43:03,00:43:06,And there's amazing examples throughout history of people who have built
00:43:06,00:43:08,extraordinary structures for their animals.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"So, there was a British surgeon who had two great Danes,"
00:43:11,00:43:18,"and she built what was a 250,000 pound, so it's like 550,000 New Zealand dollars,"
00:43:18,00:43:21,a giant house for these two dogs.
00:43:21,00:43:24,It was known as Barkingham Palace.
00:43:24,00:43:27,"And it was designed by an architect called Andy Rammus,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,a thousand foot square.
00:43:29,00:43:33,And it had everything from 18-inch deep doggy spas.
00:43:33,00:43:35,It had temperature-controlled beds.
00:43:35,00:43:38,It had a 52-inch plasma television.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"And did they just live there on their own, these dogs?"
00:43:40,00:43:41,Yeah.
00:43:41,00:43:42,The designer lived in another house.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"So, was it just covered in feces?"
00:43:44,00:43:45,Yeah.
00:43:45,00:43:47,I'm sure there were servants who came to...
00:43:47,00:43:49,[laughter]
00:43:49,00:43:50,It was different cats.
00:43:50,00:43:51,Dogs know how to poo outside.
00:43:51,00:43:52,It's fine.
00:43:52,00:43:54,"All you need to do is give them a dog flap, and they poo outside."
00:43:54,00:43:55,Give them a dog flap.
00:43:55,00:43:56,Yeah.
00:43:56,00:43:57,Presumably.
00:43:57,00:44:00,"Oh, imagine if they missed the dog flap off that 250 grand budget."
00:44:00,00:44:03,"Imagine if they were like, ""We can't stretch."""
00:44:03,00:44:04,[laughter]
00:44:04,00:44:07,"On the other side is a guy called Bruce Robinson in the UK,"
00:44:07,00:44:12,who he started taking in cats that had been abandoned during COVID-19.
00:44:12,00:44:15,"He just took in one or two at the start, and then a couple more,"
00:44:15,00:44:18,and then they all started multiplying.
00:44:18,00:44:19,[laughter]
00:44:19,00:44:22,"And in the end, he had 300 cats."
00:44:22,00:44:27,"And he told a newspaper, he said, ""I made a bad decision."
00:44:27,00:44:29,[laughter]
00:44:29,00:44:31,"I thought I could handle the cats."""
00:44:31,00:44:32,[laughter]
00:44:32,00:44:36,And he ended up spending thousands of pounds every month.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"He had to go without food himself,"
00:44:38,00:44:41,"because he had to buy so much food for the cats,"
00:44:41,00:44:45,and buying cat litter for the 10 little boxes for these 300 cats.
00:44:45,00:44:48,"And in the end, they were taken away by the SPCA,"
00:44:48,00:44:51,"but in actual fact, they were all in very good condition."
00:44:51,00:44:53,I'm going to come out and say it.
00:44:53,00:44:55,10 litter boxes is not enough for 300 cats.
00:44:55,00:44:56,[laughter]
00:44:56,00:44:58,You can't have 30 cats to a box.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"I think that's when they saw, ""This is not working."""
00:45:01,00:45:02,Yeah.
00:45:02,00:45:05,"There's a Japanese architect, quite a famous one,"
00:45:05,00:45:09,"called Tan Yamanuchi, and he recently designed..."
00:45:09,00:45:12,It was very interesting to watch the video of how the design worked.
00:45:12,00:45:16,"He designed a house for his cats, but that he also lives in,"
00:45:16,00:45:19,but it was based around the designs of his cats.
00:45:19,00:45:21,And the really difficult thing about being an architect
00:45:21,00:45:24,"with your bosses being cats is that they obviously don't speak your language,"
00:45:24,00:45:26,and so you need to work out what they want.
00:45:26,00:45:30,"So he followed them around everywhere to work out what temperatures they like best,"
00:45:30,00:45:32,and then he'd take a reading.
00:45:32,00:45:35,"And so he's created this amazing house where, for instance,"
00:45:35,00:45:40,the staircase of the house goes all around the outside of the inner wall.
00:45:40,00:45:44,And that's so that the cats on their way up can always see everything in the house
00:45:44,00:45:47,"so that there's never any threat, there's never any tension."
00:45:47,00:45:52,"And each step is exactly measured to be the height of the cat,"
00:45:52,00:45:55,"so it works for them, lots of hiding spots for them."
00:45:55,00:45:58,"At the top of this spiral staircase in this beautiful house,"
00:45:58,00:46:02,"millions of dollars, is just a window at cat height."
00:46:02,00:46:05,They get to the top of the steps and they can look out the window.
00:46:05,00:46:06,It's amazing.
00:46:06,00:46:09,"And there are also shed loads of books in it, which I don't understand."
00:46:09,00:46:14,"The whole thing is I designed a house specifically for my cats,"
00:46:14,00:46:18,"and you're looking at this video and you're going, ""There's bookcases everywhere."""
00:46:18,00:46:19,What are they reading?
00:46:19,00:46:21,It's just pictures of mice.
00:46:21,00:46:23,Some other inventions for cats.
00:46:23,00:46:28,"There's a new thing which you can get, which is like a mat for your house,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,"and it's got a wire that goes down into the ground,"
00:46:31,00:46:34,"and it's four, according to the people who invented it,"
00:46:34,00:46:37,"when there's a lightning storm that goes past,"
00:46:37,00:46:40,there's enough static electricity in the air that your fluffy cat
00:46:40,00:46:42,gets loads of static inside them.
00:46:42,00:46:46,And you know when you walk on a carpet and you accidentally touch something metal
00:46:46,00:46:50,"and you get a shock, they reckon that this is happening to cats all the time."
00:46:50,00:46:53,And so the only way to solve it is to get one of these mats
00:46:53,00:46:56,which your cat can go and sit on and it grounds them.
00:46:56,00:46:57,What the hell?
00:46:57,00:46:58,That's amazing.
00:46:58,00:46:59,That's amazing.
00:46:59,00:47:00,That's amazing.
00:47:00,00:47:02,What the hell?
00:47:02,00:47:07,We would know if cats were having electric shocks all the time.
00:47:07,00:47:08,I wouldn't think so.
00:47:08,00:47:10,"You say, ""I wasted my money."""
00:47:10,00:47:13,"Okay, I got one more invention."
00:47:13,00:47:14,This is quite a good one.
00:47:14,00:47:15,I think this is a good one actually.
00:47:15,00:47:18,So we don't like cats in New Zealand.
00:47:18,00:47:19,"Okay, we've decided."
00:47:19,00:47:21,"We've decided we don't want any animal pets,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,but you still kind of want a pet.
00:47:23,00:47:27,"So in 2010 they invented a thing called a pot pet,"
00:47:27,00:47:31,and this is a flower pot that lives in your house with a flower in it.
00:47:31,00:47:35,"And whenever it needs water, it kind of follows you around."
00:47:35,00:47:37,And so it makes a little squeaking noise
00:47:37,00:47:39,and then you have to pour water in it.
00:47:39,00:47:40,Okay.
00:47:40,00:47:42,"And then when it needs some sunshine,"
00:47:42,00:47:44,it goes into a nice sunny place and stuff like that.
00:47:44,00:47:49,"So it's like a plant, but it has all the mobility of a pet."
00:47:49,00:47:51,"Wow, it's like a sentient plant."
00:47:51,00:47:53,"It's, ""I need light, I need water."""
00:47:53,00:47:54,Yeah.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"Yeah, it's like a Tamagotchi basically, right?"
00:47:56,00:47:57,But more 3D.
00:47:57,00:47:58,You fancy one of those?
00:47:58,00:47:59,Sorry?
00:47:59,00:48:00,You fancy one?
00:48:00,00:48:02,Tamagotchi or the pot pet?
00:48:02,00:48:05,"No, the thing that I just planned that it's explaining."
00:48:05,00:48:07,I'm seeing not encouraging this industry.
00:48:07,00:48:10,I think the energies of scientists are going in the wrong directions here.
00:48:10,00:48:12,But partially the scientists who invented this
00:48:12,00:48:15,then killed himself because he didn't sell any.
00:48:15,00:48:18,We're going to have to wrap up fairly soon.
00:48:18,00:48:20,Andy told me a great anecdote.
00:48:20,00:48:21,"He read this book recently,"
00:48:21,00:48:24,"which was by Craig Brown, amazing journalist in the UK."
00:48:24,00:48:25,And it's all about the Queen.
00:48:25,00:48:26,So it's a new book.
00:48:26,00:48:28,It might be out in New Zealand as well.
00:48:28,00:48:31,"But it's written around the Queen, it's called."
00:48:31,00:48:34,"And basically, we've spoken many times on this podcast about"
00:48:34,00:48:37,"dictators who have dogs, who have more rights and more power"
00:48:37,00:48:39,"than most of the people in their life, right?"
00:48:39,00:48:41,"That was kind of the same with the Queen and the Queen Mother,"
00:48:41,00:48:42,with the Corgis.
00:48:42,00:48:45,The Corgis didn't have more legal rights than British citizens.
00:48:45,00:48:46,"No, no."
00:48:46,00:48:51,What I mean is they were big deals in the Buckingham Palace.
00:48:51,00:48:54,"And so there's a story that Craig Brown tells in the book,"
00:48:54,00:48:57,which is that the Queen Mother was walking through the halls
00:48:57,00:49:01,when suddenly she saw a giant pile of dog poo sitting on the carpet.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"And she went, who did that?"
00:49:03,00:49:05,That wasn't one of my dogs.
00:49:05,00:49:08,"And everyone was just tense because they were like,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"well, it definitely was one of the dogs."
00:49:10,00:49:11,"Well, what do we do?"
00:49:11,00:49:14,"So her private secretary, Mark and Gilead,"
00:49:14,00:49:17,"stepped in and said, well, Mom, if it wasn't your dogs,"
00:49:17,00:49:19,it certainly wasn't you.
00:49:19,00:49:22,So it must have been me.
00:49:26,00:49:29,That's the power of the Corgis.
00:49:29,00:49:36,That is all of our facts.
00:49:36,00:49:38,Thank you so much for being here.
00:49:38,00:49:40,We're going to be back again next week with another episode.
00:49:40,00:49:42,"Wellington, you were incredible."
00:49:42,00:49:43,Thank you for having us.
00:49:43,00:49:44,We will be back.
00:49:44,00:49:45,We'll see you then.
00:49:45,00:49:47,Goodbye!
