00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.000
 Hi everyone, happy new year. Welcome to 2025.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 It's a square number, so it's going to be a great year, I am sure.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.800
 Why am I here speaking to you today?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.100
 Well, it is because we have a slightly different show today.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.800
 It's a normal show. It was one that we filmed live in Wellington.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.900
 But unfortunately, on the day of this show, Andrew Hunter Murray was unexpectedly called back to the UK.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.600
 He had to leave, and so to save the day in his place came Leon Buttons-Kirkbeck.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.200
 Now, some of you will have heard that name and got very excited.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 A lot of you might not know it, but he is one of the three members of another podcast

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.400
 called The Cryptid Factor, with himself, Rhys Darby, and some little-known guy called Daniel Schreiber.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.800
 Those of you who have heard that will know that he's absolutely brilliant as he was on our show.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.200
 And those of you who haven't heard it, well, why not?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.600
 Once you've listened to this show, why not go to your podcast provider of choice

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.000
 and search for The Cryptid Factor and listen to their show?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.400
 Anyway, not much more to say, apart from hope.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.700
 All is going well for you in January.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.100
 I'm recording this in December, so goodness does what's happened since then.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.900
 On with the podcast!

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.800
 [Music]

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.400
 Hello, and welcome to another episode!

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.800
 My Such Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 This week, coming to you all for a living time!

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.600
 [Applause]

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.400
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin, and Leon Buttenskirk back.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.900
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.700
 Starting with fact number one, and that is buttons.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.400
 My fact this week is the fact that the world's longest conductor's baton

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 is actually more than three times longer than Friedrich Chopin.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 Mmm!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 Stacked up. Stacked.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
 The height of him times three.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.100
 That is amazing. Did he ever use this baton?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.200
 Because that would be awesome.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 No, it wasn't actually Chopin didn't actually own this.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 That would have been quite amazing.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.800
 And was he tiny? Was Chopin, was he a borrower?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.500
 No, he was 170 centimeters.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 And so that makes the world's longest baton 20 foot long.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.600
 Wow. Is there a useful reason for having such a big baton?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 Careful.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.300
 Or is it just someone trying to break a record?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.600
 Or what is the reason?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 Well, it is ego is the reason largely.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.500
 It is a record. It was a record set by Brown University band in Provinc, Rhode Island.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.200
 And it happened just this year.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.400
 And it actually happened as a form of competition to another band that was in Penn State.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.800
 And they had one that was 15 foot long and they thought,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.900
 "What are we going to do that's going to really break the regos?"

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.000
 And it was like, "Make a bigger baton!"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.300
 So there went five more foot.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.700
 Yeah. And they won.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.400
 But well, they had a first attempt which was they managed to get a 16 foot baton.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.800
 But it was disqualified because the handle was too skinny.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.600
 So that didn't count as a baton.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.300
 There were so many interesting rules that needed to be adhered by in order for this record to happen.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.800
 So if you were shifting the baton to conduct the audience,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.000
 you weren't allowed it to sort of like bend up and down.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.800
 It needed to stay.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.200
 So the guy conducting had to like slowly bring it across while the Guinness World Records officiators stared at it.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.800
 So it wasn't allowed to be like, "You couldn't pull the bolt with it?"

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.300
 You couldn't.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.500
 No.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.000
 It's like the opposite of a pull the bolt.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Yeah. It had to be straight.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.700
 And they conducted three songs with the baton.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000
 And so that's what set the record.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.400
 But it is interesting because we tried to break a Guinness World Record recently on stage.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.200
 Oh, yeah. Those rules are tough.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.100
 They're really tough.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.400
 What was it? We had to eat...

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.800
 We had to eat as many cheese slices.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.100
 You know, like that plastic cheese you put on burgers.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.600
 Yeah.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.400
 But the rule was that you had to take the plastic off as well.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 And it just meant that it was impossible.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.900
 Because...

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.400
 Yeah. And we had one minute to do it.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.700
 We had to eat 15 in one minute.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.000
 What?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.100
 And you're not allowed to drink water in between.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.300
 And I trained with water.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.400
 It's the only way I could do it.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.900
 You didn't...

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.200
 If you trained for that, then I'm worried about a sheep.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.700
 You ate about a quarter of a slice.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.300
 I know.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.800
 Yeah, I know.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.200
 Because they didn't let me drink water.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.500
 I got stuck on stage and it was horrible.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.200
 So we didn't get a Guinness World Record.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.000
 Interesting fact though, you got New Zealand a Guinness World Record the other day, didn't you?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.600
 Stop it.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.000
 Okay, I helped get a world record with the Hacker, the world's largest Hacker.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.200
 We took it from the slimy French.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.900
 The French.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.600
 Did you know that?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.800
 The French.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.100
 Why are the French huckering?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.800
 Exactly.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.400
 That feels culturally inappropriate to start off with.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.800
 I know.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.200
 And funnily enough, the people who, the Guinness World Record Officiators actually acknowledged that.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.700
 But they didn't rescind the record.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.500
 But they said, "You're welcome to break it."

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.500
 But of course, then the rules were a lot harder.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.700
 They came down real hard.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.300
 But we did it and we took it back.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.900
 And so it is now officially ours.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.100
 And I'd like to see another country go, "No, we're going to take it back off."

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.900
 The balls in that country.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.100
 That would be...

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.700
 Not going to happen.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.100
 I'm not saying that people who are just doing these things to break records have something else missing in their lives.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.300
 Or I...

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.300
 But I am saying that you don't see the Berlin Philharmonic or the London Symphony Orchestra competing over who's got the longest.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.100
 Buton.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.100
 And it doesn't sound like it's that useful.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.100
 Maybe they should because not as many people are going to classical concerts.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.300
 Do you think this is what would turn it around?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
 It would make me want to go.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.900
 You couldn't have anyone sitting in the front ten rows.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.300
 I hadn't realised quite how late the conductor came about as a position in an orchestra.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.100
 Or the conductor, as we know it, as in someone who faces the orchestra.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:26.500
 And with their right hand keeps the beat and with their left hand does things like bring new instruments in, inject emotion into it, things like that.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.700
 But that's relatively modern and actually composers used to do so much more than they do today.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:42.700
 So in the 16th or 18th centuries, composers would also usually be playing the harpsichord piano in their pieces while performing and they would be conducting.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.300
 And it's weird this lasted at least 200 years and I don't know how it was effective because obviously often to play the piano you need two hands.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.300
 Or in the article I read it said to play the harpsichord well you do need two hands.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.300
 It's a very low bar.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.300
 So they'd have to nod their heads vigorously conducting the orchestra.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.300
 It's amazing. Sometimes it would be the violinist as well like the first violinist would do it with their bow.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.300
 But again, it seems difficult because how do you play while you're waving the bow around?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.300
 I don't get it. Yeah, that was so weird.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.300
 But do we need it? Do we need the baton?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.300
 Oh, don't start, Dan. Oh my God.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:22.300
 So on the show a little while ago, Dan did say that people who are in orchestras shouldn't need sheet music.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.300
 Because Bruce Springsteen's band don't need sheet music.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.300
 All I was saying was there was an orchestra incident where the composer got angry with what was going on and took all the sheet music away.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.300
 And then the concert had to be cancelled because no one knew the songs.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.300
 And I just thought, well, I mean, learn them? And I know it's controversial.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.300
 I've had a lot of bassoonists write to me and threaten my life and children's lives.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.300
 As you should.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.300
 But there has been an example where we have seen conducting happening without a baton or even the movement of hands.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.300
 And that was Leonard Bernstein.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.300
 There was that movie Maestro that was made not too long ago about him.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.300
 There's a very great video that you can watch online of him conducting an orchestra simply with the movement of his eyebrows.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300
 And it's amazing.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.300
 So he's just saying, it's a do-do-do-do-do.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.300
 And it's just like, you know, a little, and then his eyes poke that way.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.300
 And it's not that song. That's the one that came to mind.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.300
 Dirty had his arms unbutated.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:29.300
 He wanted to show the power of when the synergy of an orchestra is so great that you can simply rely on looks and impressions.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.300
 Interesting.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.300
 There was a time in Soviet Russia where they did away with the conductors.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.300
 In what sense did away with?

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.300
 They went a bit too close to those windows.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:49.300
 Now, the idea was in a non-hierarchical communist society where everyone's equal.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.300
 You don't need one person at the front who's, like, lording it over everyone else.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.300
 And for quite a while they did do that.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.300
 And actually, in the '70s, Andre Previn in the UK, he did the same thing.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.300
 He did a TV show where he said, OK, I'm conducting and now I'm going to stop.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.300
 And they thought, everyone thought, oh, everything's just going to go to shit as soon as he leaves.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.300
 But actually, it was kind of fine.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.300
 It's like when countries don't have governments.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.300
 You know, Ireland and Northern Ireland didn't have a government for about three years.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.300
 And everyone always goes, huh, didn't realize.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.300
 Yeah.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.300
 We were talking earlier about, is there an importance to the length of a baton?

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.300
 And some conductors have a preference for the size.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.300
 They have a preference for the shape.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.300
 Some of them have lucky batons because they had an amazing experience.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.300
 So they become superstitious about it.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.300
 So it almost becomes like a wizard's wand in a way to them.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.300
 They sort of feel that there's power embodied in it, right?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.300
 Fritz Reiner, who was a 20th century Hungarian conductor, he used one that was so small.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:52.300
 It was such a tiny baton that one musician at the back brought a pair of binoculars along to mock him

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.300
 to show that he needed to do that to see him.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.300
 Fritz Reiner saw that and then replied when he was using the binoculars

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.300
 by lifting up a piece of paper that read, "You're fired."

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.300
 Britain really small.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.300
 That's so funny.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:12.300
 You know, conductors officially live longer than any other proficient.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.300
 Do we know why they live longer?

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.300
 Is it because they're basically richer and, you know, they come from...

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300
 They live off nothing but caviar.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.300
 No, they can only speculate.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:29.300
 But they think on the back of the study, they think it's because you get so much upper body work out.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.300
 Some of these pieces that they're conducting go for like three hours.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.300
 It could be because you only really get a job as a conductor when you're quite old.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.300
 So it's kind of self-selecting.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.300
 All the people who died in their 20s and 30s, they never become...

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.300
 That is also another...

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.300
 It does work out, but it's not like you're an Olympic athlete, is it?

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.300
 I've seen some of the famous conductors out there.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.300
 In the 19th century, when conducting became a thing, it was really controversial.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.300
 Lots of composers didn't like it.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.300
 I think there were Schumann conductors.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.300
 Emania and Evil Verdi was outraged that they got to take a bow

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.300
 because these composers thought these guys were pointless.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.300
 But there was, at the time the conductors were suddenly appearing,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.300
 this one called Louis Julia, and he was so in awe of Beethoven

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.300
 that whenever he played a piece of Beethoven,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.300
 he wore white gloves anyway to conduct,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.300
 but he had a specific jeweled baton that was presented to him on a cushion

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.300
 every time he conducted.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.300
 And I should tell you his full name. Do you know his full name?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.300
 No? No.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.300
 Do you want me to tell you his full name?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.300
 No, please do.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.300
 It was Louis George Maurice Adolf Roche Albert, Abel Antonio Alexandre Noé,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.300
 Lucien Daniel Lugin, Joseph LeBron, Joseph Parem, Thomas Thomas Thomas,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.300
 Thomas Thomas Pierre, Abel Pierre Morel, Bartel Ami,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.300
 Artus Alphonse Bertrand, Diodemne, Emmanuel, Josué, Vincent,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.300
 Luc Michel, Jules Laplaine, Jules Bertrand, Julia César, Julien.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.300
 What's his full name?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.300
 I think I follow him on Instagram.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.300
 He could never get a driver's license, couldn't he?

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.300
 Did you have a stroke halfway through that?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.300
 Always were there like five Thomas's in a row?

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.300
 I actually think I said one too many Thomas's. There were four Thomas's.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.300
 And two of them seem to be hyphenated, but the reason was...

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.300
 He's got a double-barrelled Thomas in the mid-name?

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.300
 There's Thomas Thomas, Thomas Thomas.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.300
 But the reason for this name is that his dad...

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.300
 So this is one of the leading conductors of the 19th century.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.300
 His dad was a musician who played in an orchestra.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.300
 He was a violinist and he was playing a concert just before his son was going to be baptized.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.300
 And he said to the orchestra he was playing with, "Does anyone want to be Godfather?"

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.300
 And they all said, "Yes."

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.300
 And so he named it after them all.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.300
 That's amazing.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.300
 I did not know we knew so many Thomas's.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:53.300
 It's time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.300
 OK, my fact this week is that in Japan,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.300
 you can buy rice bowls that are shaped by women's armpits.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.300
 [laughter]

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.300
 Why?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.300
 Well, I don't want to get into the mental state of the people who buy these things.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.300
 All I can say is that they exist.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.300
 I would say there's nothing I can shape with my armpit that I can't shape with my hands.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.300
 OK.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.300
 They're not achieving a magical shape, are they?

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.300
 No, well let me explain how they're made and it might give you a bit more of an insight.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.300
 So these are onigiri, these little rice triangle things.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.300
 And they're kind of rice on the outside and they usually have a filling on the inside.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.300
 And what happens is that the women who are going to make them,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.300
 they have their body parts disinfected,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.300
 but then they exercise to produce sweat.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.300
 Oh.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.300
 And then they use their armpits to put the rice bowls into that exact shape

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.300
 and apparently they sell for as much as ten times the price as regular rice bowls.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:08.300
 But a diner in an article that I read said they actually tasted no different to any other rice bowls.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.300
 [laughter]

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.300
 And this is just a thing that happens and I'm not judging anyone.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.300
 That's fine.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.300
 It's wild.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.300
 The inviting people back to watch them be made is pretty amazing.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.300
 So that's the thing that happens when you go to the restaurant and they say,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.300
 "Would you like to see them being molded in the armpits live?"

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.300
 And you can do that.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.300
 You've got to pay extra for that.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.300
 Yeah, possibly, or maybe it's part of the deal.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.300
 Well, otherwise they might do it with their hands.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.300
 There you go.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.300
 If you're not seeing it happen, maybe you don't trust them.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.300
 It sort of sounds like this restaurant has an OnlyFans page.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.300
 [laughter]

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.300
 It sounds like something else is going on.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.300
 The only thing that makes it slightly less gross,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.300
 I guess, is that most people in Japan about 90% of people don't have odourful sweat,

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.300
 because they're lacking the gene that makes sweat smell really bad.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 So it's not going to be the very...

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.300
 If we, you know, white Westerners did it, even worse.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.300
 I'm not saying it's not disgusting, but this would be even more disgusting.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.300
 One interesting thing about this is that onigiri in Japan,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.300
 there was a study done where they found that 62% of Japanese people

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.300
 would only eat an onigiri that was made by someone they know.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.300
 What?

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.300
 And only 30% said that they would eat one that was made

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.300
 by someone who was completely unfamiliar to them.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.300
 Right.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.300
 And that comes from, like, a historical thing,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.300
 where there's been quite a few times in history

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.300
 where people have been poisoned by rice balls,

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.300
 or at least according to the stories they have been.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.300
 And so there's kind of this superstition

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.300
 that you should always see the person who's made your rice ball.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.300
 You're most likely to be killed by someone that you do know.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.300
 So what a stupid rule.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.300
 You should only eat rice balls made by someone you don't know.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.300
 Don't let your wife make them for you, for God's sake.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.300
 It's very popular globally, onigiri.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.300
 There's even a society.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.300
 There's the onigiri society,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.300
 and it attracts members who love it so much.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.300
 There's one guy who was the owner of the thing called onigiri bongo,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:10.300
 and she has said that she would like to come back in her next life as a rice ball.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.300
 And the follow-up question in the interview,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.300
 "What flavor would you like to come back?"

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.300
 She said, "It doesn't matter. Onigiri isn't about the shape.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.300
 It is about the soul.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.300
 I want to come back as one that has been made with the whole heart."

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.300
 So it's a bill.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.300
 God, they make them with the heart as well.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.300
 I want to know if the flavors for these rice balls

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.300
 are sort of like ricksona type things,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.300
 like sea breeze and mountain mist in New Africa.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.300
 But hang on, isn't rice got that whole thing with bacteria

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.300
 that it's really bad at eating?

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.300
 Yeah, you're not supposed to double-cuck it, right?

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.300
 Yeah, and that it's really good at holding bad bacteria.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.300
 And you're putting it somewhere where a whole bunch of bacteria...

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.300
 To be honest, honestly, the bacteria that's in your armpit, generally speaking,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.300
 is not going to be super bad stuff.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.300
 Also, and this is less a fact and more just like a useful lie fact

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.300
 that I always remind myself, it's not a problem.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.300
 The rice bacteria thing has been hugely overblown.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.300
 Reheating rice is absolutely fine for many days afterwards.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.300
 The only thing to do, if you really do want to avoid the still quite slim risk

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.300
 of the sort of poisoning that we're talking about,

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.300
 is you need to make it cool very quickly.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.300
 So as soon as you've cooked rice, put all the shit you're not going to eat in the fridge.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.300
 Like have it every mouthful, take it out of the fridge and eat another mouthful,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.300
 then put it back in the fridge. And then it's fine for days.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.300
 Here's another thing. So sushi kind of predates...

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.300
 We all associate it with Japan, but there's evidence of it in China.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.300
 And so sushi, you would have bits of fish, salted fish, and you would have the rice.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.300
 In the very earliest days of sushi, when you pulled out the fish with the rice,

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.300
 you threw away the rice. It just didn't eat the rice to begin with.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.300
 It was part basically of a refrigeration process

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.300
 and making sure exactly about bacteria and so on, not getting into it.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.300
 So it took ages before someone went, "Should we eat that bit as well?"

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.300
 And they did. And then they went, "Well, that's actually good."

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.300
 And so if a time traveller came forward and saw us doing that, they'd be like, "Whoa!"

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.300
 It's like eating a Haribo packet.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.300
 Well, actually on rice waste, I didn't realise,

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.300
 obviously rice is such an important food stuff in Japan

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.300
 because it's used as an ingredient for so many other things, obvious including sake.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.300
 And with sake, when they make it, they lose.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.300
 If you're making really high level sake, you have to lose about 70% of the rice.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.300
 So they polish it. Every little grain of rice has to be polished

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.300
 until you've sanded down almost all of the outside of it.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.300
 So where's that going?

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.300
 Down the train.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.300
 Down the train?

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300
 Yeah.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.300
 So really, really good white rice, really gleaming white rice that's been polished

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.300
 and looks amazing.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.300
 That was a status symbol for a long time in Japan.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.300
 And there was a problem because if you remove those outer layers,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300
 so what you do when you're polishing rice

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.300
 is you're basically washing it again and again and again.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.300
 But if you remove those layers, then it removes quite a lot of the good stuff,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.300
 especially the vitamin B1 or thiamine.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.300
 Okay, so without thiamine, you get this terrible disease called berry berry.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.300
 And it can kill.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.300
 She starts a bit harsh, James.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.300
 I mean, it might not be up your street, but...

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.300
 It's berry berry.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.300
 And it's really, but I mean, you can die from it for sure.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.300
 And it really is strange because it's very similar to, you know,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.300
 the thing in the West, people would get on ships and they wouldn't eat oranges

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.300
 and lemons and stuff and they would get scurvy.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.300
 Well, in Japan, they had a similar thing because they're eating this white rice.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.300
 They would get this berry berry.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.300
 And so there's a guy called Takaki who was a doctor and he did an experiment

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.300
 where he sent two ships on the same route, on the same route, sorry.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.300
 And one of them would eat rice all the time.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.300
 And then the other one would be allowed to have like meat and bread and stuff like that.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.300
 And he thought this is going to prove that the problem is the rice.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.300
 And sure enough, when they came back, the people who were on the rice ship

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.300
 were suffering, but the people who weren't were much better.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.300
 And that's when they realized that you can't just eat rice all the time.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.300
 And he said that if the experiment had failed, he was going to kill himself.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.300
 Oh, wow.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.300
 But yeah, within a few years of that, they got rid of this bitumen b1 deficiency

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.300
 in the same way that in the Western world, we got rid of scurvy by just giving people lemons.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.300
 And he didn't have to do it himself.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.300
 It's not funny, but it's interesting.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.300
 It is.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.300
 I wish more scientists said that they would kill themselves if their experiment had failed.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.300
 I think that would really raise the caliber, wouldn't it?

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.300
 If there was that risk.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.300
 Japan eats more dairy than rice.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.300
 Interesting, really.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.300
 I thought they didn't really eat much dairy.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.300
 Well, that's bloody bewildering, isn't it?

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.300
 Because most of them are lactose intolerant.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.300
 What are you doing?

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.300
 So where are they eating?

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.300
 And in Japanese people in the audience, why are they eating so much dairy?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.300
 Well, they're eating it as milk.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.300
 So I think about 85%.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.300
 And estimates always vary.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:59.300
 Some of them are between 80% and 95% of East Asians are lactose intolerant.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.300
 And it's actually related to the gene that means your sweat doesn't smell.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.300
 But still, dairy's become very popular.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.300
 And if you eat little bits of it, so what, you have diarrhea.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.300
 You know, it's worth it for a pizza.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:16.300
 Yeah, the rice consumption has halved in the last 40 years,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.300
 and dairy's consumption has gone up a lot.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.300
 So I grew up in Hong Kong, right, until I was 12 years old.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.300
 And the thing that always was said about me is that I smell of milk.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.300
 Because it's not a big thing in Hong Kong as well.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.300
 Milk is not a massive thing.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.300
 And that was like a nickname that I always used to like.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.300
 There was this one particular mum who was always like, oh, milk boys here, is he?

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.300
 So you weren't being bullied by the other kids in the school.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.300
 You were being bullied by the parents.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.300
 Yeah, by this one mum.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.300
 Yeah, I used to go to her son's house.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.300
 He was called Daniel as well.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.300
 And she was, yeah, she was like, oh, milk boys here again.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.300
 And so that really stuck with me, that I was like, reeked of milk all the time.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.300
 That's so funny.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:02.300
 Yeah, the Great Wall of China, they found it has been held together largely by rice, sticky rice.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.300
 Sticky rice.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.300
 Yeah, it's part of the mortar that they made.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300
 They're a university in China, the Xi Jiang University.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.300
 They were researching the mortar of the Great Wall of China,

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.300
 and the mortar along with the lime is sticky rice.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.300
 Interesting.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.300
 And back to your point around the polishing of the rice,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.300
 they think that a lot of it was actually used with polish rice,

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.300
 which means there's a lot of extra work needed to make that.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.300
 Why have they polished that rice?

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.300
 To get stickier, I guess.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.300
 Maybe it makes stickier sticky rice.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.300
 Maybe it gets it stickier.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.300
 Why do we not use it anymore then?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.300
 Because that wall is going pretty strong, isn't it?

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.300
 It's doing great.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.300
 Yeah, but they did actually think it is actually the world's first example of composite mortar,

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.300
 where you're including organic and inorganic material together.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.300
 And they say that it is actually very, very good.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.300
 That's what the architects say, is it, in the report.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.300
 Very, very good.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.300
 Very, very good.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.300
 Sorry.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.300
 In answer to your question, Dan, we might have gone with even more efficient building materials now.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.300
 No offense to the ancient Chinese.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.300
 Okay.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.300
 If anyone is in from ancient China.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.300
 Okay.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.300
 That is.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.300
 Rice is a huge source of pride in Japan, in Japan and China, in fact.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.300
 But it's a real patriotic thing, maybe slightly less so now,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.300
 but I haven't realised that it was illegal to import any rice into Japan until the mid-1990s.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.300
 '90s?

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.300
 It was early to mid-90s.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.300
 Yeah, when America sort of bullied Japan into saying you've got to accept some of our exports.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.300
 Because Japan always wanted to be rice self-sufficient and be able to grow all of its own rice.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.300
 And even now, there's a lot of skepticism.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.300
 I was talking to my friend, who has Japanese family in America,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.300
 and was saying that they will often buy at a much higher price,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.300
 rice that's been imported to America from Japan,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.300
 because they think it's much higher quality.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.300
 Even though in blind taste tests,

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.300
 they almost always can't tell any difference whatsoever between American rice and Japanese rice.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.300
 But the idea is that it's much higher quality.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300
 That is.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.300
 I've got one last thing quickly that I can mention.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.300
 This is just going back to armpits.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:17.300
 There's an amazing festival that used to happen.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.300
 I think it's just stopped, but hopefully the mention on this podcast will bring it back.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.300
 In Nevada, in a place called Battle Mountain.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:30.300
 And basically, there was a journalist who called this particular town the armpit of America.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.300
 And they were very upset by this.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.300
 And so they set up a competition which was sponsored by a deodorant company.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300
 I believe it was Old Spice.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.300
 And they turned it into a plus.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.300
 And so they had the armpit beauty queen contest,

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.300
 whereby it was brilliant.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.300
 So you would go and it would be a big festival and you would have a sweaty t-shirt contest.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.300
 Can I just say, so is it who has the most beautiful armpit?

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300
 Yeah.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.300
 And then in like beauty contest, you have to do like a skill as well.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300
 Yes.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.300
 So they're doing that thing where they make fart noises.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.300
 Yes.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300
 Yeah, they do the fart noises.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.300
 There's deodorant throwing competitions.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.300
 So I think who can throw the deodorant the furthest.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.300
 There's quick draw deodorant competitions.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.300
 Who can get it and spray it as quickly as possible.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.300
 And then eventually they crown the armpit queen.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.300
 But yeah, they've really leaned into it.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.300
 They're motto, which they now have on the sign as you enter Battle Mountain.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.300
 Says, make Battle Mountain your next pit stop.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.300
 Oh, brilliant.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:34.300
 [Music]

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.300
 It is time for fact number three.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.300
 And that is my fact.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.300
 My fact this week is that 2,500 years ago,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.300
 Buddha taught the world that the road to enlightenment

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.300
 could be achieved through compassion, mindfulness,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.300
 and the eradication of the game hopscotch.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.300
 [Laughter]

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.300
 He hated hopscotch.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.300
 What?

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:02.300
 Buddha hated any game whereby you drew on the ground

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.300
 and you were using your feet to sort of be confined

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.300
 by the drawing on the ground.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.300
 And hopscotch is exactly what that is.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.300
 It might not have existed during the day,

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.300
 but if Buddha came back now,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.300
 he'd be like, what the hell's this?

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300
 Did you learn nothing?

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.300
 I guess these kind of hopscotch type games are very, very old, aren't they?

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.300
 And they're all over the world.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.300
 So there would have been something that we would have seen

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.300
 that would have looked a bit like hopscotch.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.300
 Did he suppose that he banned drawing on the ground

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.300
 and stepping in the squares that you've created, didn't he?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.300
 Yes.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.300
 I'd say that's hopscotch.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.300
 He also banned all dice games,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.300
 all stick games, all marble games,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300
 all games where you blow through toy pipes,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.300
 all games where you turn some assaults,

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.300
 games where you play with toy windmills,

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.300
 games where you play with toy chariots, toy bows,

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.300
 games where you guess the letters drawn in the air

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.300
 or they're on the back of the body,

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.300
 and games where you mimic deformities.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.300
 Yeah.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.300
 I think the last one, fair enough.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.300
 Yeah, that's good.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.300
 He sort of got into a good rhythm right at the end there, didn't he?

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.300
 But he also guessing a friend's thoughts,

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.300
 not allowed by Buddha,

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.300
 playing with someone's ears.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.300
 Why?

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.300
 No wet willies in the world.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.300
 Why is this guy such a killjoy?

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.300
 I know.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.300
 Why is he always smiling?

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.300
 It's weird.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.300
 And all eyes or nose, to be fair.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.300
 Yeah.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.300
 No facial parts.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.300
 And no Jenga and no pickup sticks, either.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.300
 Was Jenga around back then?

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.300
 Well, again, he specified,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.300
 and it is interesting to see how these concepts go back.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300
 He specified no games that involve adding pieces

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.300
 or removing pieces from piles.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.300
 Wow.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.300
 We're some unimaginative humans.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.300
 We just generate the same old shit.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.300
 Oh, wow.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.300
 And why was it?

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.300
 It was to stop people getting distracted from scripture

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.300
 and holiness, wasn't it?

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.300
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.300
 You know, it's a philosophy,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.300
 and Buddha did say that this should all be altered

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.300
 as we go along, hence why we now have hopscotch.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.300
 But...

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.300
 I don't think that's...

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300
 He said that therefor we have hopscotch.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.300
 I don't think we were waiting for the 1,000-year cut-off,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.300
 and then we went, right, Buddha said it's okay now.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.300
 Get the chalk out.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.300
 Well, you say that.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.300
 There was no hopscotch then, and there is now.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.300
 So I don't know...

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.300
 One thing we should say, you say,

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.300
 "Why is he smiling all the time?"

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.300
 That's not Buddha, is it?

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300
 Yeah, you're right.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.300
 That's someone who we've accidentally labeled as Buddha.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.300
 Yeah, so Buddha's birth name was said already.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.300
 Buddha's birth name was Siddhartha Gautama,

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.300
 and he was someone who was born into royalty.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.300
 He was a very well-to-do person.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.300
 But then he found a path of enlightenment, basically,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.300
 and then he brought all his followers on.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.300
 And by the smiling one,

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.300
 you mean the big sort of fat Buddha that you get on, like, you know?

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.300
 Yes, the smiling Jolly Buddha.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.300
 Yeah, that was a Chinese monk who was called Uday.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.300
 So you can understand the confusion.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.300
 That's pretty close, close enough.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.300
 Tomato tomato.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.300
 Yeah.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.300
 And one thing that he banned as well was playing with toy carts.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.300
 Like a little toy cart.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.300
 But, I mean, it would be easy, wouldn't it?

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.300
 Because you'd be like, "Oi, you, with the toy cart."

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300
 I'd be like, "No, it's not a toy cart."

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.300
 I'm actually... This is legit.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.300
 I'm just a little kid carrying these stones over there.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.300
 It could be work.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.300
 You could be child labour.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.300
 I'm just jump-sporting fluff.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.300
 There's lots of ways out of it.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.300
 Is this stuff all from those book of rules called the Vinaya?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.300
 I think it might be from that.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.300
 Yeah.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.300
 There's some other rules in there that says,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.300
 "A monk shall not tickle a mother monk."

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.300
 Yeah.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.300
 Or, "Lie down in a bed scattered with flowers."

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.300
 Wow.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.300
 Okay.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.300
 Well, that's always a prelude to something more sexy, isn't it?

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.300
 Especially when tickling comes straight afterwards.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.300
 Yeah.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.300
 It's very nice.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.300
 Well, but so is playing with someone's ears, eyes or nose,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.300
 which he was against as well.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.300
 And that sometimes is a prelude, too.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.300
 Well, I mean, where I come...

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.300
 Anyway.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.300
 Yeah.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.300
 I guess one of the stuff in really specific circumstances

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.300
 could be the prelude to some sexy stuff.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.300
 Particularly the one with the guessing,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.300
 "Lessons traced with a finger and the ear on somebody's back."

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.300
 Yeah.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300
 That's definitely cock-and-balls.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300
 Cock-and-balls again.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.300
 Stop.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.300
 Can you stop doing cock-and-balls on my back?

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.300
 That's all you can do.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.300
 They were Sanskrit letters, weren't they?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.300
 Cock-and-balls.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.300
 Yeah.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.300
 I have found out a really interesting thing about the etymology of Buddha.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.300
 Yeah.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.300
 And that is that it...

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.300
 So that's from a Sanskrit term, which is "bud" to awaken,

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.300
 to, you know, enlightenment awakening.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.300
 You can see how it comes from that.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.300
 But what I find amazing is, of course,

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.300
 that word originated in India where Buddhism originated.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:34.300
 And that nonetheless has the same origin as the word "bodh."

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.300
 Our word, "bodh," it bodes well,

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.300
 which is just from old English sacks and languages,

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.300
 because they both date back even further to Pai,

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.300
 which I'm sure you all know as Proto-Indo-European.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:51.300
 And so 8,000 years ago, these two languages sort of split,

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.300
 and we got "bodh" from the same origin as they got Buddha,

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300
 and now they've met again.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.300
 I find that amazing.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.300
 Oh, that is incredible.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.300
 Language can travel that far and then meet again.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300
 It's very gross.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.300
 Look, it's not funny, but it's really massive.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.300
 No, that's amazing.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.300
 It's quite romantic.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.300
 Well, I also have an unfunny etymology thing of hopscotch.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.300
 Go on.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:16.300
 So the word "scotch" can mean an incensed line

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.300
 or scratch in the ground.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.300
 So you pop in a scratch, scratching on the ground.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.300
 And in fact, that got a young girl, a 10-year-old girl,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.300
 in trouble with the police, believe it or not,

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.300
 in Ramsgate a few years ago.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.300
 A young 10-year-old girl was putting a hopscotch, scratching,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.300
 and sensing a line in the ground.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.300
 And she was done for criminal damage.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.300
 She's so mad.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.300
 A 10-year-old.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.300
 The police officer came along and frightened.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.300
 This is Bob Allen, the father of Lily Mae Allen.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.300
 She could be Lily Allen.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.300
 Maybe.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.300
 Maybe I should check these facts.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.300
 Anyway, he came along and said,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.300
 "Oy, that's your defacing public property?"

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.300
 Yeah.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.300
 It's mad, isn't it?

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.300
 Why isn't it in?

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.300
 Because this happens a lot in these news stories

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.300
 about people being arrested for, or not arrested for,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.300
 given warnings by the police for drawing hopscotch things.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.300
 It should be page one, police handbook.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.300
 Don't accuse a 10-year-old of graffiti and criminal damage

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.300
 because he's drawn a fucking hopscotch.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.300
 We're all trying to get kids out of the house playing games.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.300
 It's so weird.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.300
 She did, to be fair, in the place where you have to write

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.300
 the letters and stuff, so you did write, "Fuck the police."

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.300
 I mean, to be fair, that also probably should be cheap.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.300
 Yeah.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.300
 Hopscotch, you're talking about the etymology of it.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.300
 Do you know what it was called before it was called hopscotch?

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.300
 Oh, I don't know.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.300
 Scotch hop.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.300
 Oh.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.300
 Yeah.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.300
 That's nice.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300
 Just at some point, we just went, "Oh, let's turn that round."

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.300
 It's like the rice and the sushi.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.300
 We just flipped it around and started using it different.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.300
 The first mention is in a book by Francis Willoughby,

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.300
 and it's in the 17th century book of games.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.300
 And it's a big old book full of loads and loads of different games

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.300
 you can play.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300
 And there's one chapter that's kind of disappeared,

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.300
 and we don't really know much about it now.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.300
 And that chapter is called "Tricks to Abuse and Hurt One Another."

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.300
 So he had all-- it was like games you can play in the garden,

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.300
 games you can play by running around.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.300
 And then this one, which is abusing and hurting one another.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.300
 And the thing is, we do have the chapter heading,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.300
 so we know what's in it, but we don't know what the games are.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.300
 So there was a game--

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.300
 Is that also a sexy book?

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.300
 Is that the sexy-- because where I'm from, that's also a six.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300
 Anyway.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.300
 It's a kick-goin, sorry.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.300
 There's one called "Bying of Mustard."

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.300
 We don't know what it is.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.300
 "Selling of Millstones."

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.300
 "Bum to Bus a Fool."

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.300
 "Bum to Butter."

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.300
 "Bum to Bus a Fool."

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.300
 Oh, see, sexy as hell.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.300
 But lots of names.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.300
 It was called "Hickety-Hackety," and "Hickety-Hackety-Hackety,"

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.300
 and "Paliali," and "Hitchabed."

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.300
 I like the fact that games used to have so many different names.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.300
 Why have we codified them?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.300
 Did she just have another stroke?

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.300
 Yeah, Lele and Kit Kit and Thomas Thomas Thomas.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.300
 When I was a kid, it used to be like we would play British Bulldog,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.300
 where you have to run across the field,

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.300
 and then it's up to someone to rubby tackle you

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.300
 and beat you to the ground.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.300
 And then the school would ban it,

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.300
 and then we would just play it again under a different name.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.300
 And we thought that this was a loophole,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.300
 that it's like, "Oh, they banned British Bulldog,

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.300
 but they didn't ban Blue Boy,"

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.300
 which is exactly the same game.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.300
 And then they'd go, "Yeah, that's banned as well."

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.300
 And then the next day, we'd call it something else.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.300
 So maybe that was it.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.300
 Another bit of enlightenment.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.300
 So in Buddhism, you have enlightenment.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.300
 In the Jain religion, you also have enlightenment.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.300
 They're really, really very similar religions.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.300
 They grew up from the same place.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.300
 And in the Jain religion, there are 24 Ford Makers.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.300
 And these are people who have gone through

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.300
 all of the different cycles

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.300
 and been reborn, reborn, reborn,

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.300
 and now they're out of the cycle.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.300
 These are perfect people.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.300
 So one of them is said to have floated perfectly still

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.300
 in his mother's womb,

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.300
 sending not so much as a ripple

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.300
 so that he didn't harm his mother.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.300
 Which is nice.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.300
 They tended to be really tall and really old.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.300
 So there's a guy called Nemanatha,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.300
 who lived for 1,054 years.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.300
 300 years is a bachelor.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.300
 54 days is a monk.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.300
 And then 700 years is an omniscient being.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.300
 And then another 200 years is a conductor.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.300
 And this guy was 30 meters tall.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.300
 So if he was a building in London,

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.300
 he would need a second staircase due to fire regulations.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:44.300
 That's amazing.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.300
 I can't believe he tolerated 300 years being single

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.300
 before going, "You know what? I'm just going to say I'm a monk."

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.300
 Five years to me.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.300
 So the idea of Buddhism largely

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.300
 is to achieve enlightenment.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.300
 And this goes through many different disciplines

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.300
 that are involved in philosophy.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.300
 So George Harrison, who joined that whole movement,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.300
 he was Buddhist and he went through various other things,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.300
 became Hare Krishna at the end of his life.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300
 From the Beatles?

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.300
 From the Beatles, yes.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.300
 For anyone who's not heard of George Harrison.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.300
 We have lots of young cool listeners, Dan.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.300
 Not cool if they don't know George Harrison.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.300
 So I don't know if you all remember,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.300
 but it was a horrible moment that happened

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.300
 just after the turn of the millennium,

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.300
 where someone broke into his house and stabbed him,

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.300
 and he got stabbed multiple times.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.300
 He miraculously survived.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.300
 It was really amazing.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.300
 But the account of when he was dying

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.300
 was George Harrison basically was waiting for the moment

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.300
 to achieve enlightenment, to take him to the next level.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.300
 So at one point, when he was being attacked by this guy,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300
 he sort of gave into it and just said,

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.300
 "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna."

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.300
 And he repeated it over and over,

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.300
 and it was, "I need to get to enlightenment before I die."

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.300
 He survived because his wife leapt on the back of this guy

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.300
 and beat him down with a side lamp that was on a bedside table.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.300
 And so blood was everywhere.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.300
 It was an astonishingly bad thing.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.300
 He should have died.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.300
 Everyone said he should have died, the doctors and so on.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.300
 And there's a great story that Eric Idle tells,

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.300
 which is as he's leaving the house and he's on a gurney

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.300
 and they're bringing into the ambulance,

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:20.300
 he passes two new members of staff who started that day,

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.300
 and that was their first morning.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.300
 And as they passed, a week and almost dead, George Harrison went,

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.300
 "So how are you finding the job so far?"

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.300
 (Laughter)

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.300
 And that could have been his last words ever, but yeah.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.300
 I love that.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.300
 And according to Olivia Harrison,

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.300
 his wife, he did achieve enlightenment right at the end.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.300
 She saw him ascend.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.300
 According to his wife?

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.300
 I'm just saying it's a happy ending.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.300
 I think, yeah, sure.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.300
 The second person ever to achieve enlightenment,

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.300
 according to George Harrison's wife.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.300
 There is a type of Buddhist meditation that I quite fancy

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.300
 and I didn't know about, which requires you to find a corpse.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.300
 This is such a dark note to end on.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.300
 Oh my God.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.300
 And dig it up.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.300
 No, not dig it up.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.300
 To find a corpse and sit there and watch it decay.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.300
 And I didn't know about this, and it's the nine stages of decay,

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.300
 and you have to sit in front of a corpse.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.300
 I don't know what the family are doing at the time.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.300
 They just let you do it.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.300
 And it's amazing.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.300
 So you start with bloat, and then rupture,

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.300
 and then, you know, like, I won't take you through all nine stages.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.300
 You know what?

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.300
 I think I might stick with my meditation app.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.300
 (Laughter)

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.300
 It's coming up in the next lesson,

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.300
 but it's done in a very sexy American woman's voice,

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.300
 so you'll find it really nice.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.300
 And you would like to do that?

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.300
 Sounds pretty fun, of a week, you know?

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.300
 So where I'm from, that's actually quite sexy.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.300
 Sorry, no.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.300
 That's sorry. No.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.300
 I'm from Tim's, by the way.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.300
 (Laughter)

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.300
 We do things proper there.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.300
 (Music)

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:02.300
 All right, Lo, we need to get to our final fact of the show.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.300
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.300
 My fact this week is that...

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.300
 (Laughter)

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:15.300
 Is that a patio for cats is called a catio?

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.300
 (Laughter)

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.300
 It's very silly.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.300
 I just really want to say now,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.300
 this is the most stupid fact I've ever said on the show.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.300
 (Laughter)

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.300
 And I couldn't believe these guys...

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.300
 Listen, she's always like this.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.300
 I don't know, I'm ashamed,

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.300
 but I'm going to tell you now, because you're here.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.300
 So, catios are a thing.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.300
 And maybe it'll come in handy with your cat-loving friends.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.300
 You know, you can be like, "Have you got a catio yet?"

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.300
 Because every site and every company that sells stuff for pets,

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.300
 it's just like, "Hey, have you got the best catio available?"

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.300
 And apparently that's just an accepted way to refer to cat patios.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.300
 And, you know, so that you can let them outside without them...

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.300
 It's like a patio, as we know it,

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.300
 but with a cage around it, as they know it,

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.300
 so that they can't escape onto the roads and get run over,

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.300
 and so that they also can't kill all the birds.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.300
 Are you being paid for this?

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.300
 Is this a secret ad?

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.300
 It's bizarre, isn't it?

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.300
 Is there an offer-code fish at the end of this?

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.300
 It's not even a brand. It's a generic term.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.300
 It's probably in the OED by now.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.300
 It's just a generic term that pet owners are accepting, a catio.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.300
 So, get one.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.300
 Ramps, tunnels, swing bridges, they can be yours.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.300
 (Laughter)

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.300
 So, we just had a heckle from the audience,

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.300
 and I am going to address it.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.300
 I wouldn't usually, but it said, "Did you know about our native birds?"

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.300
 And we're in New Zealand, and the whole point of a cat patio

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300
 is to protect the native birds, so they're very in demand in New Zealand.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.300
 (Applause)

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:54.300
 You don't get other comedians dealing with hecklers like that, do you?

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.300
 (Laughter)

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.300
 Well, you go, "Fuck off, mate!"

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.300
 But that was beautiful.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.300
 No, it's a good question, actually.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.300
 Yes, the Lyles, I mean, how famous is the Lyles Wren in New Zealand?

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.300
 Do you all know the Lyles Wren?

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.300
 Well, okay, I feel like no.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300
 No, I don't, for my benefit.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.300
 So, the Lyles Wren was a New Zealand bird.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.300
 It was having an absolute whale of a time for thousands of years,

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.300
 and the Marys arrived almost a thousand years ago,

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.300
 and they gradually sort of wiped it out, not intentionally,

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.300
 by bringing rats with them, which killed it.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.300
 But there were a few left by the 19th century,

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.300
 and then European settlers arrived, and they really fucked it,

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.300
 and the only ones left were of this lovely Lyles Wren

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.300
 were on a place called Stevens Island, which I'm sure a lot of of you know,

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.300
 and there was a lighthouse set up in 1894,

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.300
 but the lighthouse keeper brought cats,

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:55.300
 and the very, very last Lyles Wren was eaten by tibbles the cat.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.300
 (Laughter)

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.300
 But the owner kept the body, so we do have the last body of the Lyles Wren.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300
 Oh, right.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.300
 Domestic cats, they're responsible for the extinction of at least,

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.300
 like, almost a dozen species, I would say, right?

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.300
 Right.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.300
 And they're even eating penguins in New Zealand,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.300
 they're running up mountains eating lizards.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.300
 Because when you say it doesn't, you mean in New Zealand, right?

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.300
 Yeah.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300
 Yeah, it's just in New Zealand that many.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.300
 So, are we saying death to cats?

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.300
 Wow.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.300
 No, we're not.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.300
 Jesus.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.300
 Wow, wow.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.300
 Controversial, controversial.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.300
 What's his name, the trade me guy that's trying to get them all killed?

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.300
 That guy, yeah.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.300
 Wow.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.300
 It's a big thing in New Zealand.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300
 There's people advocating.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.300
 I think there's even a political party, isn't there,

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300
 to kill the cats?

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.300
 What?

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.300
 Or something.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.300
 I don't know.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.300
 You might want to check that.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.300
 But I've got to say, I've watched a lot of New Zealand comedy.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.300
 I didn't know that this death of cats was a threat.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.300
 I agree.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.300
 So, we're slightly also talking about luxury for pets, right?

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.300
 This has a practical purpose.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.300
 But if you say to anyone, "My cat has a catio," you're going to be, I think,

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.300
 slightly mocked.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.300
 And there's amazing examples throughout history of people who have built

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.300
 extraordinary structures for their animals.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.300
 So, there was a British surgeon who had two great Danes,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:18.300
 and she built what was a 250,000 pound, so it's like 550,000 New Zealand dollars,

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.300
 a giant house for these two dogs.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.300
 It was known as Barkingham Palace.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.300
 And it was designed by an architect called Andy Rammus,

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.300
 a thousand foot square.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.300
 And it had everything from 18-inch deep doggy spas.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.300
 It had temperature-controlled beds.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.300
 It had a 52-inch plasma television.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.300
 And did they just live there on their own, these dogs?

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.300
 Yeah.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.300
 The designer lived in another house.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.300
 So, was it just covered in feces?

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.300
 Yeah.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.300
 I'm sure there were servants who came to...

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.300
 [laughter]

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.300
 It was different cats.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.300
 Dogs know how to poo outside.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.300
 It's fine.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.300
 All you need to do is give them a dog flap, and they poo outside.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.300
 Give them a dog flap.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.300
 Yeah.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.300
 Presumably.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.300
 Oh, imagine if they missed the dog flap off that 250 grand budget.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.300
 Imagine if they were like, "We can't stretch."

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.300
 [laughter]

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.300
 On the other side is a guy called Bruce Robinson in the UK,

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.300
 who he started taking in cats that had been abandoned during COVID-19.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.300
 He just took in one or two at the start, and then a couple more,

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.300
 and then they all started multiplying.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.300
 [laughter]

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.300
 And in the end, he had 300 cats.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:27.300
 And he told a newspaper, he said, "I made a bad decision.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.300
 [laughter]

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.300
 I thought I could handle the cats."

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.300
 [laughter]

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.300
 And he ended up spending thousands of pounds every month.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.300
 He had to go without food himself,

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.300
 because he had to buy so much food for the cats,

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.300
 and buying cat litter for the 10 little boxes for these 300 cats.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.300
 And in the end, they were taken away by the SPCA,

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.300
 but in actual fact, they were all in very good condition.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.300
 I'm going to come out and say it.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.300
 10 litter boxes is not enough for 300 cats.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.300
 [laughter]

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.300
 You can't have 30 cats to a box.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.300
 I think that's when they saw, "This is not working."

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.300
 Yeah.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.300
 There's a Japanese architect, quite a famous one,

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.300
 called Tan Yamanuchi, and he recently designed...

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.300
 It was very interesting to watch the video of how the design worked.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.300
 He designed a house for his cats, but that he also lives in,

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.300
 but it was based around the designs of his cats.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.300
 And the really difficult thing about being an architect

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.300
 with your bosses being cats is that they obviously don't speak your language,

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.300
 and so you need to work out what they want.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.300
 So he followed them around everywhere to work out what temperatures they like best,

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.300
 and then he'd take a reading.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.300
 And so he's created this amazing house where, for instance,

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:40.300
 the staircase of the house goes all around the outside of the inner wall.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.300
 And that's so that the cats on their way up can always see everything in the house

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.300
 so that there's never any threat, there's never any tension.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:52.300
 And each step is exactly measured to be the height of the cat,

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.300
 so it works for them, lots of hiding spots for them.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.300
 At the top of this spiral staircase in this beautiful house,

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:02.300
 millions of dollars, is just a window at cat height.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.300
 They get to the top of the steps and they can look out the window.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.300
 It's amazing.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.300
 And there are also shed loads of books in it, which I don't understand.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.300
 The whole thing is I designed a house specifically for my cats,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.300
 and you're looking at this video and you're going, "There's bookcases everywhere."

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.300
 What are they reading?

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.300
 It's just pictures of mice.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.300
 Some other inventions for cats.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.300
 There's a new thing which you can get, which is like a mat for your house,

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.300
 and it's got a wire that goes down into the ground,

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.300
 and it's four, according to the people who invented it,

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.300
 when there's a lightning storm that goes past,

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.300
 there's enough static electricity in the air that your fluffy cat

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.300
 gets loads of static inside them.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.300
 And you know when you walk on a carpet and you accidentally touch something metal

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.300
 and you get a shock, they reckon that this is happening to cats all the time.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.300
 And so the only way to solve it is to get one of these mats

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.300
 which your cat can go and sit on and it grounds them.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.300
 What the hell?

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.300
 That's amazing.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.300
 That's amazing.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.300
 That's amazing.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.300
 What the hell?

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:07.300
 We would know if cats were having electric shocks all the time.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.300
 I wouldn't think so.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.300
 You say, "I wasted my money."

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.300
 Okay, I got one more invention.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.300
 This is quite a good one.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.300
 I think this is a good one actually.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.300
 So we don't like cats in New Zealand.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.300
 Okay, we've decided.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.300
 We've decided we don't want any animal pets,

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.300
 but you still kind of want a pet.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.300
 So in 2010 they invented a thing called a pot pet,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:31.300
 and this is a flower pot that lives in your house with a flower in it.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.300
 And whenever it needs water, it kind of follows you around.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.300
 And so it makes a little squeaking noise

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.300
 and then you have to pour water in it.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.300
 Okay.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.300
 And then when it needs some sunshine,

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.300
 it goes into a nice sunny place and stuff like that.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.300
 So it's like a plant, but it has all the mobility of a pet.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.300
 Wow, it's like a sentient plant.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.300
 It's, "I need light, I need water."

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.300
 Yeah.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.300
 Yeah, it's like a Tamagotchi basically, right?

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.300
 But more 3D.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.300
 You fancy one of those?

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.300
 Sorry?

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.300
 You fancy one?

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.300
 Tamagotchi or the pot pet?

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.300
 No, the thing that I just planned that it's explaining.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.300
 I'm seeing not encouraging this industry.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.300
 I think the energies of scientists are going in the wrong directions here.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.300
 But partially the scientists who invented this

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.300
 then killed himself because he didn't sell any.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.300
 We're going to have to wrap up fairly soon.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.300
 Andy told me a great anecdote.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.300
 He read this book recently,

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.300
 which was by Craig Brown, amazing journalist in the UK.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.300
 And it's all about the Queen.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.300
 So it's a new book.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.300
 It might be out in New Zealand as well.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.300
 But it's written around the Queen, it's called.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.300
 And basically, we've spoken many times on this podcast about

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.300
 dictators who have dogs, who have more rights and more power

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.300
 than most of the people in their life, right?

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.300
 That was kind of the same with the Queen and the Queen Mother,

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.300
 with the Corgis.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.300
 The Corgis didn't have more legal rights than British citizens.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.300
 No, no.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.300
 What I mean is they were big deals in the Buckingham Palace.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.300
 And so there's a story that Craig Brown tells in the book,

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.300
 which is that the Queen Mother was walking through the halls

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:01.300
 when suddenly she saw a giant pile of dog poo sitting on the carpet.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.300
 And she went, who did that?

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.300
 That wasn't one of my dogs.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.300
 And everyone was just tense because they were like,

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.300
 well, it definitely was one of the dogs.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.300
 Well, what do we do?

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.300
 So her private secretary, Mark and Gilead,

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.300
 stepped in and said, well, Mom, if it wasn't your dogs,

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.300
 it certainly wasn't you.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.300
 So it must have been me.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.300
 That's the power of the Corgis.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:36.300
 That is all of our facts.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.300
 Thank you so much for being here.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.300
 We're going to be back again next week with another episode.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.300
 Wellington, you were incredible.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.300
 Thank you for having us.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.300
 We will be back.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.300
 We'll see you then.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.300
 Goodbye!
