 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anacizanski and Alex Bell and once again...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 (Bell)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 (Bell)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 (Bell)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 (Bell)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I don't recognize that name.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 And Andy Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 My fact this week is that Neanderthals wore capes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Did they only wear capes?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 I think they kind of did and it seems like...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Is that a good look? Is that a sexy look?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I'm just trying to picture an extra obscene if you're only wearing a cape I think.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Do you think worse than nudity?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I think it's worse than nudity.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 It's worse than being naked with just socks on.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 That's what it is. That looks terrible.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Having one item is always just a bit embarrassing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Absolutely. No, a cape's quite a good look because you can wrap it around yourself and then do the big reveal.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 So Neanderthals, they were capes?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 They did.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Compared to early humans who wore like more like parkers or hoodies.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 So the thing is they found by looking at animal remains in early human settlements and the under fell settlements.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 And they found that the Neanderthals didn't really have the ability to make more complex clothing like the humans could.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 All they could really do is get an animal skin and just wrap it around the neck like a cape,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 whereas the humans could kind of make more proper clothing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And they reckon that this may be one of the reasons why the Neanderthals died out when the humans proliferated.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Kind of ironic that they don't superhero gear in order to wipe themselves out.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 What a bunch of ideas.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 I read a thing about superhero capes and it was a physicist who had done an analysis on Batman's cape.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 He worked out that if, as in the film, he used the cape to help slow himself down, he would still have hit the building he was landing on at 50 miles an hour, which would have immediately killed him.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 I don't think, I mean, I think we're assuming we watched that, that there's some magical force holding him up as well as just the sheer force of his cape.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 But he is just a bloke, let's not forget Batman is a bloke.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 He's not like Superman with superpowers, he's just a guy with tons of money.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Oh, I kind of thought he had a little bit of extra magic power as well.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 His soul superpower is material wealth.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Just, I thought the really interesting thing about this new research that's been done was the idea that early humans, the real superheroes of this story, had fur trim hoodies,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 it's thought fur trim coats because what the researchers found is that certain animals were found at human sites that weren't found at Neanderthal sites.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So I think there were animals like weasels and wolverines that were found on the human sites and they have like short hairs and they're the kind of hair that you'd use to make fur trim.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 So they've got this whole mixture of fur and if it's added to sleeves and the hoods of clothes, then it insulates you better.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 How are they, how are they sewing or putting stuff together?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Well, do you know that the oldest sewing needle was found around this time around 40,000 years ago?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Really? Actually, it was found more recently. Sorry, it was found 40,000 years ago but immediately dropped again.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 But weirdly, it wasn't early humans or Neanderthals, it was Denisovians who were a third group of hominids who kind of lived around the same time.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Were we, were we the most clever of the bunch at that period?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 They definitely have bigger brains than we did. Well they have bigger brains Neanderthals but there is a theory that because they have bigger bodies as well and they had larger eyes too so they had extremely good vision.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 But there's a theory that more of their brain would have had to be given over to their visual cortex and to controlling their body as well.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So they were great at kind of gymnastics or seeing things from a long distance but the Neanderthal Olympics were brilliant.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And all the audience were five miles away as well. But on the other hand they couldn't do Rubik's cubes.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And obviously that really got humans through the eyesight when it was very boring and it had to have entertainment.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Yeah, I think scientists have come forward in the last year slightly, not debunking but saying there's no actual evidence to show the increased focus on your brain on eyesight or body size would mean that you had a less good higher cortex but it's certainly a theory.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 That's the thing, it just changes all the time. Probably everything we're saying right now is just going to be this particularly with Neanderthals every day there's a new story that says, oh they were killed by bunnies or they loved.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Have you not heard that theory? No, no.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Oh they were killed by rabbits. All of them. No.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Yes, to do with the fact that they couldn't, I think I'm gaining this in the sort of area of right, their main source of food also became the main source of food that rabbits were eating and rabbits were eating all the food.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And so they just ran out of food effectively. So rabbits kind of took, I don't know.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Well, here's a thing, if you try to live off rabbits your whole life you wouldn't be able to because they don't contain nearly enough nutrients.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Unless they've eaten all of your other food and so they contain all the food groups now inside of their bodies. Is this an all you can eat rabbit situation?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Yeah, if the only thing you could ever eat was rabbits you would die. No.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 And you die quite quickly as well. I'm not sure exactly what it is that you're missing. I think it's a famous kind of thought experiment about rabbits in particular.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Really? I'm lots of other things presumably or the only ones trying to screw us in.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Yeah, you could probably live just off Guinness. Yeah, okay. They always say that. They always say that. They say like two points of Guinness and three Mars bars will get you through the rest of your life.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 But it doesn't sound as Irish people.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Did you know, because people always used to say, oh, drinking a Guinness is the same as having seven roast dinners or something.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 That there's the same number of calories in a pint of tenants or a pint of fosters. Is there isn't a pint of Guinness?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 I always thought there was way more in Guinness. Yeah, it feels like the small when you drink it, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. Does it?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Yes, I don't know. You had a full pint of beer for your birthday the other day, didn't you? Yeah, fruit beer, you know.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 I really like this clothing thing because it's sort of interesting in the knock-on effects that things have.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 So if Neanderthals only had capes, as we're saying. Then they might have only been able to hunt during the very warmest bits of the day.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So that limits your hunting range time wise. It means you can't hunt in the morning or the evening. Or it might have stopped them foraging further north.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Whereas if you've got humans in sort of parker like fur things they can hunt further north, that extends the range.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Or in that part of Europe, ambush is quite a good means of killing prey.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Because you use the landscape and you wait for animals to come along and then you jump out and kill them, rather than chasing them as early humans did in Africa for example.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 So if you're just lying down in a cape all day, you can't do it, you'll freeze.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Do you remember the book that came out called The Singing Neanderthals? Yes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Yeah, so this is a professor from Reading University called Stephen Mithin and he believes that they sung a lot and they like to dance, dance and clap.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And they used to do in their caves together, they used to sing in groups. I have read that book quite a few years ago.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And I think is it not also that he thinks that language came originally from singing? Yes.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 So people would just kind of sing and get rhythm and then that rhythm and noise would turn into meanings and then that meaning would turn into language.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 I think that's what you do. Yeah, yeah.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 So for that reason as well, the language part, he says that he thinks that they would particularly have liked rap music.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And he says I can see them rapping in my mind. He thinks a lot of stuff this guy.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And the other little males had one massive arm and one puny one. Like Nadal. Like Nadal. Exactly like Nadal.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Athletes, cricket and tennis players in particular have upper arm bones which are much stronger in their dominant arm.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 So all of us here, dominant arm will be between 5 and 14% bigger. This is the arm bone, the upper arm bone, bigger than on the other side.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 In the underfalls, the upper arm bone is 50% bigger than on the other side.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And this is only the case in cricket and tennis players in modern humans today.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So when you say Nadal, it's absolutely right. And they thought that this was because they were doing spear thrusting to hunt animals.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 But actually they got modern humans to sort of practice thrusting spear and measured how much energy it used.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And actually that uses the non dominant arm loads too. So they reckon that what it is is processing animal hides, i.e. scraping laboriously away at the inside of animal skins to make them suitable for wearing your capes.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 And we don't know if female Neanderthals have the same thing because we haven't found female Neanderthals skeletons where both arms are present.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Do we know that female Neanderthals had two arms? No we don't, no. It might be a reason why they died out.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Just one thing on capes, that capes were quite big in the Aztec world. And Montezuma particularly was into them in that every year he collected a tribute from his people of 2500 and 160 of them.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 The word escape comes from the word cape. Does it? It's like when someone grabs your cape but you could run away because you kind of leave them with the cape.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And you're just naked if you're in the Aztec world.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 That's actually according to the etymological dictionary of the English language to escape is to ex-cape oneself, to slip out of your cape and run away.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Isn't that great? Was there any famous villains that were known for that? Like I mean like Jack the Reverend, we've got his cape, you know, was there any?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Like just with the cape done by poppers at the front or something that they just whip off and lose.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Well just if that's Jack the stripper you're thinking.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 But another kind of cape in the Aztec world that only Aztec rulers were allowed to wear was the hummingbird cape and so hummingbirds were sort of revered by Aztecs.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Because I think of their tenacity and the fact that they'd attack things that were bigger than them and they wouldn't rest until they'd got what they wanted.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And so Aztec kings could wear capes made entirely of hummingbird feathers.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 I think I've seen one of those.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Yeah, they're pretty spectacular.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 I think there might be one in a museum in Hawaii or something.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Oh really?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Like really yellow amazing kind of feathery.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Wow.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 I think the only bird that can fly backwards.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 But yeah, one cape would take 8,000 hummingbirds.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 How impressive to catch though that many though it is.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 You probably sneak up on them from the front.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Elvis Presley famously used to wear a cape in the later years and the very first time that they had the idea for the cape because the idea was that it was going to be used to reveal himself not in that way.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 On stage to the audience.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 It was a great way of hiding himself before you could see him.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Because you could still see the cape obviously.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Yeah, I guess but you're like, who's buying the cape?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 I mean, who's buying the cape?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 I don't know, they're at a Presley game.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 All right.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Figures is that with the cape.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 So he commissioned it from this guy who was in another bit of America.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 And so they made the cape and they sent it over on a plane and Elvis put it on.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And it was so heavy that as he walked forward he immediately got dragged back by the weight of it and crashed backwards onto the ground.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Wow.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Who did that in the VMAs last year or something?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Was it Madonna?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 I think she just fell down forward.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Did she not get dragged off by a cape?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 She did.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Someone stepped on the back of her cape.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Maybe it was just a tribute to Elvis.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 No one got it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Someone else who had a massive cape on stage was Liberacci.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Famously.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 One time had such a massive cape.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 He was brought on stage in a custom made Rolls-Rice.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 And then he took off his cape, which was then taken off stage by a small Rolls-Rice.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Wow.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 That was fantastic.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 That's ridiculous.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 I was looking at Sherlock Holmes because he wore a cape.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Yes, he didn't.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Described as a cape.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And he was illustrated wearing a very sort of famous cape.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 I think it became famous because he'd worn it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I don't think it was a famous cape that Sherlock had been adopted.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Who was this weird bloke inside my paper cape?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Sorry, you're absolutely right.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 He popularized that cape.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 There was something really bizarre about the story.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 The man who was commissioned to draw the stories ended up not drawing them.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 His brother sort of got the gig somehow instead.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 But then he drew the man who'd originally been commissioned to draw the cape

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 was then the model for the cape, which his brother then ended up drawing for the stories.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Was that a consolation prize thing?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Kind of.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 His brother was like, oh, sorry, I didn't get the gig.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 He's really weird.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 He's Victorian because there was a coat with a cape built into it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Yes.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 I don't really understand it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Is it just to protect you against rain?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Just fashion.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Yeah.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Must have been fashion.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Yeah, because I, I, exactly, I was trying to work out was there a purpose to Darth Vader's cape.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And a lot of people, because he's in space.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 What's he doing with the cape?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 There's a lot of anti-gravity going on.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 That's not a useful garment to have.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 A lot of people say that it was because of his authority and that a cape would suggest a military kind of authority for some reason.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 But then I, I don't really know much about Star Wars.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Wars.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 But it doesn't seem like they have a lot of problem with anti-gravity at any stage.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Which is interesting, isn't it?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 The one scene where I think you should see that is when he's flying when Vader's in his own ship.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Because I imagine that's where anti-gravity kicks in, but he must be sitting on the cape.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 That's what I thought, because you don't see it in short.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 You're right, because they must have thought this through.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Well, they have, because look, there's a description on Wikipedia about entire outfits.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 So the outer cape was made so that it could block fire and acid jets, helping to protect the suit's electronics.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Because remember Darth Vader was part robot.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Yeah, but the cape was so heavy, you get this.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 The cape was so heavy that it restricted movement.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So he had difficulty lifting his arms over his head, which is why you rarely see that in the movies.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Really?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 I can't really see a scene where that would have fitted in.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 It's what he does the while.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 It's what he does at that football match of the Mexican wave comes around this way.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 My fact this week is that when the first ballpoint pen was launched in the US,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Riot police had to be deployed to restrain the crowds.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 It was the new iPhone of its day.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 This was in 1945, and I actually read about this in a book I've just bought called Adventures in Stationary by James Ward.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And this ballpoint pen was brought to America by a guy called Milton Reynolds.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 It was 29th of October 1945, and he launched it in a department store called Gimbals in New York.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And thousands of people came.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So I think 5,000 people swarmed Gimbals department store.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 And 50 extra policemen had to be deployed as an emergency at the last minute, because it was being swarmed so much.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 So they cost the equivalent of $160 now, which is a lot, but still they sold, you know, they'd sold millions.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Absolutely, they weren't the really crummy cheap buyers that you were paying $160 for.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Well, even, I mean, that was a time of some hardship across the world, right?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Well, what he was thinking, actually, you say it's of some hardship.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 A, they didn't work because he rushed them through, but B, I think he was thinking it's the end of the war.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 I need to launch it now. People want a treat.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Well, that wall was terrible, but at least we've got a barrier.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 It's almost worth having another wall.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 It was called the Reynolds rocket, though.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 So there was a little bit of militarization going on over there.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 He actually took out an ad in the New York Times to promote a full page ad.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 That's how big they were promoting the thing.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 And in it, he said that it was fantastic, miraculous pen, guaranteed to write for two years without refilling.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Yeah, and you got your money back if it didn't.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And a lot of people did, didn't they?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Yeah, loads of people, yeah.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 There's 104,643 had to be replaced in the first eight months.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 So I think, yeah, had massive problems.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 It was really leaky or it was stopped writing altogether.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 It just wasn't a very good design.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And the reason was because he was a very competitive businessman.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 So there was this, this chap called Lazlo Byro, who a few years beforehand had invented the Byro in Europe.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And he brought it to Argentina and word had reached America and this guy Milton Reynolds of the Byro.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And he really wanted to patent the design, which was just this round tip in this capillary action,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 which meant that you could write in all directions and the ink wouldn't bleed out the page.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Anyway, he tried to buy the patent for the design and it had already been sold.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 And so he was so pissed off, he decided to rush through his own design before Byro could get his out.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 So he knew that Byro in 1945, which was now run by a company called Evershard, I think.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 He knew that they were about to rush a design out and so he put his out prematurely.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 But the thing was that his didn't use capillary action.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 No.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 His relied on gravity.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 So Darth Vader wouldn't have been able to use it for instance.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Indeed.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 That's why you never saw him signing papers.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Actually, there is a theory which Andy was just pointing.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 So I vet he was about to say this.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Yeah.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 But there is no writing in the whole Star Wars universe.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Fear it's a post literary universe.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 You just see people pointing at, you know, pressing buttons with little symbols on them.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Right.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 So there are some scrolls at the Jedi's.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 You can see it in the background occasionally that there's a scroll there.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 But whether they have writing on we don't know.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 But also you can see in this is getting too geeky now.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 But you can see in Raiders of the Lost Ark, there are symbols of R2D2 and C3PO.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 So they've now put that in a suggested LucasArts timeline of the universe.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 So long time ago in the galaxy far, far away was remembered close enough on Earth that they knew about 3PO and R2D2.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 So it's not that long ago.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 So when you said this is too geeky, I was about to say, no, it can't be too geeky for this show.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 You've managed to do it.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 So the first, one of the first big orders for Byres was by the RAF.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Actually during the Second World War.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 So this was by the Lazlo Biro, inventor himself.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Which is called Biro.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 I think it's originally pronounced Biro.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 We've been saying it wrong all these years.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 It's probably Lazlo as well as Lazlo Biro.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 I think it's Biro.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Probably. He was Hungarian.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Well, he was born in Budapest.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Right. He was Hungarian.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And then he moved to Argentina.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 So this is a really weird thing, but also about the way he invented it.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 I mean, he had to flee the Nazis and he went to Argentina.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Partly because he'd had a chance encounter on a beach with a fellow holiday maker and told him about this great invention.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 He had a fellow holiday maker said, oh, well, I'm the president of Argentina.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 So do you want to come and set up in my country?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 And he said, thank you very much, I will.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 It's not amazing. It's extraordinary.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Yeah, they're on the beach and they're happy to be chatting to the Argentinian president.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Yeah.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 He was the former president.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Oh, well, yeah.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 But then really tragically, Biro never made much money from it.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Because he had sold the patent to it very early on in the process.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Because partly, I think to get more of his family out of Europe.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 I think his last shares were sold to get his family to Argentina.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Yeah.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 I really love the sound of this guy, Biro.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Because apparently before he invented the Biro, he was a hypnotist, a race car driver and a surrealist painter.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Wow.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 That's awesome.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Sounds amazing.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 And you'll like how he invented the ballpoint pen and these.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 He was just sat there looking out of a window and he saw a marble go through a puddle and then it left a line of water on the ground.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And he thought, wait a minute, I could make a pen like that.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Did you know?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Yeah.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Because Andy, you really hate these ideas of serendipity and invention.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 I just think that often inventions are, it's so much nicer, the story of Biro seeing a child playing with marbles and the marble going through the puddle.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And you know, that may well be the case.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 But often you get the whole, oh yes, he had invented a whole load of fountain pens and then one of them was dropped and it created a weird ball on the end of it.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 He thought, oh, I know.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Yeah, because Biro didn't actually invent the ballpoint pen or he wasn't the first person to come up with a patent for it.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 No.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And he was allowed who did had the first patent and he wanted something that would be able to write on wrapping paper and he invented this thing but unfortunately it was just a rubbish design.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 There were 350 ballpoint patents before Biro came up with this.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Wow, really?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Yeah, yeah, from your right John, John Loud in I think the 1880s all the way through the 1930s.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 The idea had been thought of a lot.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 It's just no one had made it work properly.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So it's weird that he had to wait for a marble to propel itself through a puddle.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Yeah, that's a bit weird, isn't it?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Considering there were 350 other inventions exactly the same as his.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 It's almost as though that did not happen.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 If we ever talked about just speaking of riots and police having to be called unexpectedly about the girl who put a Facebook invitation up and accidentally made it public, not private, the Dutch girl in 2012.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And she got 30,000 people responding saying that they would attend about a party.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 It was, yeah, it was about a party, but it meant to go to just her friends and apparently you have some private setting on Facebook.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 There's a movie about it, isn't there?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Is there?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Yeah, I can't remember what it's called.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Oh, no, it was based on that film.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 So that's why people did it.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 And then they turned up in T-shirt saying Project X Harin because it was in the town of Harin.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And yeah, like up to 5,000 people turned up and 600 right police had to be called and the girl fled her home to somewhere else.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Because she accidentally put this invitation on private.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 It sounds absolutely terrifying.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Yeah, it happens quite a lot.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 What, 5,000 people rocking up to an...

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 It certainly doesn't mind public.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 You did say up to 5,000 people.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 I mean, even if I add these parties, there's up to 5,000 people.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 And that is my fact.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 My fact this week is that not only was Lady Chatterley's lover banned from Australia, but a book about the ban was also banned.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Yeah, so Lady Chatterley's lover, famously a book that was banned in the UK.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 It was banned in Australia, many other countries.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 And what happened was in 1960, eventually after, I believe it was 1929, it was originally banned.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So huge amount of time and they finally got the ban lifted.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And it was such a weird trial.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Everyone who was at the trial reported about it at the time in 1960 because they had things like the fact that the jury who were forced to read the book weren't even allowed to bring the book out of the courtroom.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 So the jury had to just sit in the jury room and read the book.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Those are probably somebody really smugger who got to the end of it first before everybody else.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Yeah, just did all the spoilers.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 She shacks him. That reminds me of something I read that in the 90s or late 80s, early 90s, there was a pornographic TV channel called Red Hot Dutch, which came over to Britain because people could get it with their satellite dishes.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 And there was a big kind of moral crusade against it and the newspapers and stuff. And before the Parliament could debate it, they had to have a special viewing of the channel in the House of Parliament.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And apparently it was one of the most well-attended viewings of any thing that they had.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Wow.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Because you're allowed to watch some really steamy hot Dutch pornography, but you have to watch it in a room full of MPs.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 I'm not sure I'm like attending. So the really tricky thing when the book was going to be published is that this was all after a 1959 change in the law, which said that literary merit is a defense.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So it was an extremely sexual explicit book had been banned in 1929, but then this change in the law in '59 meant that suddenly there was a possible defense, which means that it could be published legally.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 And Penguin then announced, you know, for Lawrence anniversary, we are going to publish a huge run of this and they were intending to publish it for, I think, three shillings and six months, which is really cheap and would have put it well within the reach of working class people.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 So that was why the authorities, if you like, were spooked.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Yeah, because there was still the thing in law, which was an old Victorian thing, which was, it's all right for you to have something which is explicit and obscene and whatever.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 So long as only gentleman can read it, but once you do it, so that the poor people can read it, then it becomes a problem.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Yeah.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 And it's called variable obscenity.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Really?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Yeah.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 And so there's a very famous part of that trial where the chief prosecutor who's called Mervin Griffith Jones asked the jurors to consider if it was a kind of book that you would wish your wife

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 for servants to read.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 And in the newspapers, they all thought that was hilarious because, you know, this is the 1960s, we don't talk like that anymore.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 But of course, he was referring to the old Victorian law, which was, is it something that working class people or women or whatever can read as opposed to gentleman like me?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Yeah.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Yeah.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And so when they eventually lifted the ban and said it could be sold in shops, it's not dissimilar to the great ballpoint pen debut.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Shops were packed, people were not writing, but it was chaotic and it was mainly men who just heard so much about this book and copies that had been bought with them being resold just the hour later in Soho.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 This was a very quick read.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Yeah.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 But people, it's almost like when a huge superstar comes into town, you know, scalpers buy up the tickets and resell them for a hyped price.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So in Soho, they were hiking the price of these unread books that had just been bought in the London bookshops.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 So just to just to bring it back quickly to the opening fact.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 So what ended up happening was that the ban was lifted and that was great.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 And someone then went on to write a book called The Trial of Lady Charlie's Lover.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And that book then got released here in the UK and it attempted to get released in Australia, but Australia had not lifted their own ban.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 And so they decided to continue to ban anything to do with Lady Charlie and that was one of the books that wasn't allowed in.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So did this book have like excerpts from the original do you think?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Yeah, no, I'm not sure exactly what this book contains. It's actually quite hard to find it online.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Well, it's because you're part of Australian them.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 It's not allowed to read anything like it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 And yeah, what's really nice about this is that a group of Australians actually decided that they were going to sneakily import it and start selling it in shops.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 And they did and that kind of created a new conversation once they got caught because they were caught and the government attempted to prosecute them.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 And they said this shouldn't be done and a lot of other politicians agreed.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And as a result, that's what kind of kick started the whole thing about the relaxation laws of the obscenity laws in Australia.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 So it's interesting.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Lady Charlie itself did it here and in Australia, a book about the trial did it in Australia.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 It's kind of amazing. You'd have customs officials taking band books off people.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Apparently, when trains used to go from Europe into the Soviet Union, when they stopped on the board and they checked your passports,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 and there'd also be a guy going through going, "Bibles and pornography! Bibles and pornography!"

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 And so you had to give up your Bibles or pornography?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Oh, apparently.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I know what it looks like. It's just actually a very broadly interpreted Bible.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 My fact is that Henry VIII contributed to NASA's space suit design.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 I go on.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 So he had a suit of armour, which was built for him in 1520 for, I think, called the Field of the Cloth of Gold.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 It's a huge diplomatic jolly in France. And in 1962, one of the teams working on space suits for NASA, a firm called Garrett AI Research.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 They visited the suit and the Tower of London sent the firm data on it and they sent photos of it because they were trying to work out how to build better suits,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 which could completely overlap and completely cover the body. And that was sort of something that went into their research.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Yeah, so cool.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 And now you're going to have astronauts with massive cod pieces.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Yeah, that'd be good though, wouldn't it?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Great.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 So good.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 He did have a bigger one than everyone else didn't need a king, he's been with a bigger cod piece.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Yes, indeed.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Women in subsequent centuries used to put little pinpricks in them and it was hoped that that would make them fertile and bring them babies.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 That's the, isn't that at the Tower of London?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Yeah.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Were you there? We were shown around the Tower of London.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 No, when was that?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Oh, good few years ago, I was shown around the Royal Armories with Mollielfield, I think, for her book, The Secret Museum.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And they have the copies there and I think they have the actual one, which the pins were pricked in.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Oh, really?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 And really it had regular animals from a pig's bladder, didn't it?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 So I actually thought that this fact was going to be, I think I may have misread your email, that the space it was designed on Henry VIII's bottom.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 And so I did quite a lot of research into Henry VIII's bottom.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 So I was also reading about his toilet.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 And it's, they were really lavish, but I didn't really understand this.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 I think this was from Lucy Wasley, maybe, said Henry VIII's lavatory was lavishly covered in black velvet.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 It's lid opened to reveal inside a padded and beribboned interior covered with the same material.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Oh, God.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Those ribbons are going to be very nice for what you saw behind us.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 That's a really good point.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 I mean, I think there must have been a hole in the middle, which, and maybe you had to aim well and just make sure you didn't catch the padding and the ribbons on the outside, maybe.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 No, yeah.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 It feels like with that many animals they wouldn't be so good.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Oh, long after someone dies, is it not treason anymore?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 So he got very fat later in life.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Yeah.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 He was quite athletic when he was young, wasn't he, but he got really fat later on.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 And I read this that there was a 2009 study by the Royal Armories that found that his waist was 52 inches.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Okay.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 That's by looking at one of his suits, Varma.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 But brilliantly, by coincidence, Queen Victoria's bloomers that went on sale in 2012 were also 52 inch waist.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Wow.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 So they had exactly the same waistline, Queen Victoria and Henry VIII.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 So this factor is also about spacesuits and NASA.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Did you know spacesuits these days are called emus.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 That's what modern spacesuits are referred to.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 So the space you need to go and get into your emus.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 So about you is unit.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Not bad.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 Extra.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Yep.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 What's it going to be?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 I'll leave the next one to you, Anna.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Mission, um, memory.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 No, I know.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 I'm going to put us all out of all of our misery.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 It's extra vehicular mobility units.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 So where's the V?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 F mu.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Should be.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Yeah.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Except there's not a bird.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 But that's not a laughable creature.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Yeah.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 If you want to study ants in using an electron microscope, you would look at them in vacuum.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 And to get them in a vacuum, you have to put them in a tiny little space suit.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 No.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Well, they call it a tiny space suit.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So it's like you dip them in surfactant, which is a substance, which causes like a tiny little nano suit.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Basically that they go inside.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 And it actually can even repair itself if it gets broken.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 But yeah, they call it a tiny little ant space suit.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Is it individual ones for individual acts?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 I know.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 That is so incredible.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Have you seen, I was looking at amusing looking space suit designs from over the years.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 I've tried some pretty wacky stuff, but have you seen the AX-5 hard shell space suit?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 We've seen the AX-3, haven't we?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Yeah, we have.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 I knew you were up to date on this.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 So the AX-5, the point was that you wanted to be flexible inside it.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 So that's often a problem in space suits that you can't like move around enough.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And it had a flexibility rating of 95%.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Which means that the wearer can move into 95% of the positions that you can if you were naked.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 But what this basically means is, if you look it up.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Reverse cow go.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 What are the positions that you can't get?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 I don't know actually, maybe they don't tell you in case you try and break it.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 I'm not sure I can get into all that many positions, even when naked.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 You might only have a 75% thing even without the space suit on.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Oh god.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 And each year as I get older, it gets less, doesn't it?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Yeah.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Look, it's a funny space suit, it's not that morbid.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 It looks like someone's inflated.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 So if I wear this, if I wear this 95% space suit, does that mean I can now get into more positions?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 No.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 No.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 I'm afraid it's not 95% of the average persons, it's 95% of your positions naked.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Your naked is 100%.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 You could barely do anything.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 So I can actually get that to about 71.5%.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Don't buy it.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 If only you could transmit your consciousness into an AX5 space suit, then you'd be able to do more than you could today.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 How many percentage do you think you could do wearing just a cape?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 That's over 110.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Sorry, space suit.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Have you finished that?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 No.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I just need to describe how this works.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 The AX5 looks like a hugely inflated Michelin man.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 So essentially it's like being in a giant bubble where it seems like you can pull most of your limbs out of the sleeve

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 instead of your legs out of the legs and move around inside it.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Right.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 But it looks totally absurd because it looks like you put on a piece of clothing 20 sizes too big for you.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 So they decided not to let it go.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 But it's, you know, a good amount of roominess in there just with your head hanging onto the helmet and the rest of your body can swing around underneath it.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 That's a good idea actually.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Should we wrap up?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Oh, didn't do you want the French for cod pieces?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 I thought you'd go down that road.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 La pièce de croissant.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 It's not.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 It's bragett, spelled the same as baguette but with an arch.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 She seems to have so much room for confusion.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Bragettes for breakfast? Oh, really? For a French 16th century sitcom, wouldn't it?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Yeah, stupid fast.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Just put a braquette of your penis and get on with it.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Are you sure?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 The damselfway through each again.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
