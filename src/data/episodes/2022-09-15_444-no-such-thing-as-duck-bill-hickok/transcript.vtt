 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.840
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Edinburgh.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.320
 [APPLAUSE] My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.280
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.720
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that when Dick Loss,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 the president of the Montana Cowboy Association,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.280
 drove a car for the first time, he crashed it into a fence.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.920
 Because instead of using the brake pedal,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.800
 he pulled back on the steering wheel and yelled, whoa!

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.280
 >> Incredible.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.640
 >> Lot to unpack.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 >> So who was Dick Loss?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 >> He was the president of the Montana Cowboy Association.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.080
 >> Cool.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.720
 >> A cowboy.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 >> Who's a cowboy?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.000
 And I found this because he's just been inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.920
 Montana.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.040
 >> Cool.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.080
 >> He was a male carrier.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.160
 >> Do you keep tabs on the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Montana?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.520
 Every new person who's inducted, you know about it.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.480
 >> I do. >> He's got one of his phone,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.880
 he's got one of those notifications.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.800
 >> Do you want some other people who are in the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Montana?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.000
 >> Yeah, yes, so.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 >> Bob Fudge.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.800
 >> Bob Fudge.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.520
 >> Bob Fudge.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.720
 >> Oh no, the Fudge Gang are in town.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.840
 >> It's just a funny cowboy name.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600
 >> Bob Fudge, Fanny Steel.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 >> Fanny Steel, yeah.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.200
 >> Johnny Flowers, Carl Moss, Spud Creamer.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.160
 >> Spud Creamer, Chief Sitting Bull, and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.840
 the 1904 Fort Shore Indian School Girls Basketball Team.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.400
 >> Wow.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.840
 >> Did you say Spud Creamer?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 >> Spud Creamer.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.560
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 >> These are incredible.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.960
 >> It's a great name, he was incredibly dull, I have to say.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.160
 >> Really?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.000
 >> I read all of the,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 because they have the biographies of all these people, and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.920
 that's how I read this about Dick Loss.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.080
 Basically, I found this Hall of Fame, and they had all the names.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.960
 I don't know what drew me to Dick Loss, first of all, but I read his biography,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.440
 and it had this amazing thing.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.480
 But he was a male carrier, he was a cowboy.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.720
 He lived in a place called Square Butte, and it's pronounced Square Butte.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.800
 And every time we say the word But, it's spelled B-U-T-E.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.920
 We get loads of people writing in from Montana or Wyoming saying,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.620
 it's pronounced Butte, and I'm like, well, don't spell it like Butte then.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.960
 >> Yeah, yeah, good point.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.920
 I was looking up the meaning of whoa, whoa.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.480
 So there's some, I wouldn't go so far as to call it controversy.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.840
 But a little bit of debate, I was reading horsejournals.com.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.320
 Which is a great site, if you're into horses.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.680
 And Jack Ballew, who is, she's a horse trainer of many years experience.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.200
 She wrote a piece about the meaning of whoa.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000
 And her contention is that by and large, it means nothing.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.040
 It means nothing at all.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.520
 It's something for humans to say while they try and sort out the horse situation.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.200
 Horse doesn't care.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.160
 >> But it does have a meaning, doesn't it?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.120
 >> It has a meaning, yeah, yeah.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.360
 >> If you're running towards me and I say, whoa, you know what I mean.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.880
 >> Yeah, but I'm not a horse and neither are you.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.120
 >> So it's, she says, the word whoa is used with zero purpose.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.640
 This is in general, other than to fill silent air and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.920
 give our busy human minds something to work over and repeat incessantly.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 >> No. >> What is this person talking about?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.480
 We all know that whoa means slow down or stop.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.600
 This is person illiterate.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.760
 >> She's a very experienced professional horse trainer.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.720
 She said on some occasions it can really work if you say it just right.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.320
 >> Well, then it fucking works.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.280
 What is that?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.280
 >> It's like, but in general, I can't believe I'm having to, in general,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.400
 it means nothing. >> Ghost don't exist,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 except that one time when there was a genuine ghost.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.680
 >> Jeez, most of the time when horse people say, whoa,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.600
 they're just saying something to say, right?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.720
 >> Let's not talk about this now.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.680
 We'll take this backstage.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.200
 >> Okay, anyway, anyway, that's a distraction.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.800
 >> I did a bit of looking into cowboys and some of the cowboys that I love most

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 are movie cowboys, the sort of John Wayne and the Clint Eastwoods and so on.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.040
 And some of the cowboys were genuine cowboys that then

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.640
 became movie stars.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.720
 So they just found their way into Hollywood in the early days.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.600
 So there's a guy called Louis Burton Lindley Jr.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.200
 And he was a cowboy who got conscripted into the war.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.360
 And the only reason he really got into the world of Hollywood was when he

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.280
 enlisted into the war, they said, what is your occupation?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.640
 He said, rodeo.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.720
 And the person went, radio, okay, and then they put him down and

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.920
 he did radio throughout the war.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.360
 And he was like, this is pretty good. >> Well, after he'd done rodeo,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.600
 rodeo is a very easy to sit on.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.080
 >> So after the war, he was like, I really enjoyed that radio stuff.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.560
 And then he went into movies like Blazing Saddles and stuff like that.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.480
 >> Wow.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.600
 >> And then there was another guy who was, he wasn't a real cowboy in real life.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.440
 But James Arnes, and he was a famous actor in a TV show called Gunsmoke.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.280
 And Gunsmoke was really big.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.640
 During the war, his thing was, he was a really tall guy.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.760
 And so as a result, as the tallest man in the outfit of his platoon,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.560
 he was always sent down the ramp of a boat first to see how deep the water was.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.440
 >> He was the measuring stick, the human measuring stick.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.320
 >> Yeah, you mentioned John Wayne.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.240
 Middle name Marion, if you didn't know, anyone out there.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240
 >> Didn't know.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.160
 >> And didn't like it, didn't like the fact his middle name was Marion,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.760
 because he liked to get a bit of a macho image.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.940
 And he said he actually got bullied loads for it at school.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.880
 His full name was John Marion Robert Morrison, I think.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.720
 Sorry, his real first name was Marion, even worse.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.960
 >> Yeah, this is a Johnny Cash song, basically.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.080
 This is a boy named Sue.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.960
 >> This is the boy named Marion, yeah.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.400
 >> Is that where Johnny Cash got it from?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.080
 Or is it?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.160
 >> No. >> Okay.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.520
 >> But he changed his name, and he's actually credited in some films as Duke.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.040
 And he's often called Duke as a nickname.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.960
 And that was after his family dog.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.080
 And it was because he had this giant dog, this Airdale, who used to walk him to

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.680
 school every day when he was a boy, and they'd stop at the local fire station.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.920
 And the fireman called him Little Duke, and his dog Big Duke.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.600
 And so he had the name stuck.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.440
 >> That's very cool.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.280
 >> Yeah.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.160
 >> Can I give you some more, Montanon cow people?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.480
 >> Yeah, definitely.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.840
 >> Hilda Redwing is recently in the Hall of Fame in Montana.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.160
 She took part in a rodeo at the age of 90.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.120
 And during the rodeo, one of her friends who was running it,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.280
 his horse ran into her and broke her leg.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.120
 And she carried on doing the rodeo with a broken leg at the age of 90.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.360
 >> What?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.800
 >> Isn't that amazing?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.760
 >> Was she riding a bull or anything?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.360
 >> No, it was like a relatively calm horse.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.040
 >> Okay, okay.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.800
 >> Still amazing.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.440
 >> And I mentioned the 1904 Fort Shore Indian School Girls basketball team.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.360
 >> Yeah.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.800
 >> And they went to the St. Louis World's Fair, and they spent five months there

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.280
 as part of the anthropological exhibit that they did at that same time,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.840
 where they brought lots of Native Americans in to do stuff.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.680
 And during that, they started playing basketball against all comers.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.840
 And they beat anyone who came.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.200
 And so they were named champions of the world.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.000
 >> Wow.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.560
 >> That's great.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.320
 >> It's like a world.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.640
 >> And why does that get you into the Cowboy Hall of Fame?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.120
 >> I think really they were short of people.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.800
 >> Yeah.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.280
 >> Tough year.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.880
 >> They didn't, you know, they weren't in a shoot up, they didn't win a duel.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.000
 >> Have you guys heard, in Alaska, there are cowboys who ride helicopters instead of horses?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.200
 >> Yeah, that's cool.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.560
 >> When you say ride.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.520
 >> Well, they don't.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.040
 Obviously, yeah.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.120
 >> They're not spinning around on the-

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.200
 >> It's like- >> Definitely looking at some tick loss there, aren't you?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.080
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.160
 >> No, they round their cows up with helicopters.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.400
 But I didn't even know there were Alaskan cowboys.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.040
 >> No. >> And Hawaiian cowboys as well.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.760
 Which is a very famous thing in America.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.080
 >> Yeah, they're bloody everywhere, aren't they?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.960
 >> Yeah. >> And in fact, American US cowboys really

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.920
 nicked all of their gear, all of their cliches, all of their hats, their coats,

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.600
 their everything from Mexico.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.080
 So they're based on Mexican vaqueros.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.720
 And in fact, the word buckaroo, I didn't know, comes from vaquero.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.520
 >> Wow, really?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.200
 >> Yeah. >> And we get so many words all come from

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.840
 those Mexican cowboys.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.560
 So lasso, bronco, chaps, as in you're wearing chaps, not high chaps.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.040
 >> Yeah, and gouchos as well, the Argentinian version,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.640
 which I always think of the coolest.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.560
 The thing I like about gouchos, so Argentinian and Uruguayan cowboys,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.160
 is that they, again, they're just really cool cattle herders.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.120
 It seems like if you're in the Americas and you're herding cattle,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.560
 you become really cool.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.920
 And they were really fussy about the color of their horses.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.200
 And if you're a proper goucho, all of your horses have to be perfectly color

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.960
 matched.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.320
 And so you get pibled horses, like white with black splodges.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.880
 But you want the black splodges as perfectly matched as possible to each other.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.560
 >> Really?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.520
 >> Yeah, it's cool.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.000
 Apparently it was so that if your herds got mixed up,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.840
 you could tell which ones were yours.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.840
 >> Wazers.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.200
 >> Yeah. >> That's very cool.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200
 >> I think like a quarter of the cowboys,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.120
 what we would call them now were not whites, right?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.200
 >> Yeah. >> In the time of the cowboy,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.840
 basically, in the post-Civil War time.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.480
 And actually the word cowboy would be mostly used for

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.840
 African-American cowhands.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.120
 Like the white people would be called cowhands, and

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.280
 it was kind of a bit of a slur to say boy, do you know what I mean?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.440
 >> It was kind of diminutive. >> Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.520
 >> Wow, interesting.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.920
 >> I didn't realize how short the Wild West was after the Civil War,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.040
 before about 1900.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.760
 That was it.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.000
 >> Yeah. >> It was a really brief period.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.640
 >> Right. >> Here's a mind blowing thing.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.400
 Cowboys basically invented dust in America.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.440
 The reason that America is dusty is because of cowboys.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.680
 >> Really? >> Yeah.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.000
 So there's been this guy, Jason Neff, he's a geochemist.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.720
 I hadn't heard of that.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.000
 He studied the sediments laid down in various mountains in Colorado.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.160
 And he looked at the sediments that had been laid down in the lakes and

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.920
 things like that.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.240
 And he found there was basically no dust in America for 5000 years.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.640
 And the soil had this, it was vegetation, it had this crust,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.240
 this nice thick crust on it, right?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.760
 >> Yeah. >> No dust blowing around.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.480
 1860, the rates suddenly shoot up of dust in the atmosphere.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.000
 And it's because the cows had arrived, they stripped the grass.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.560
 And then their feet, their big clumping hooves broke through this gorgeous crust.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.800
 And as a result.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.640
 >> It must have been nice, when you first go through that crust.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.240
 Like breaking into a crème brûlée.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.760
 >> That's the least cowboy thing you've ever said.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 >> That bloody hell.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.000
 >> But we have dust, I get dust in my house, right?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.920
 >> That's nothing to do with the cowboys, you're right.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.120
 That's pre-existing dust, that's, yeah, yeah.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.400
 I just mean that the reason America is-

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.520
 >> So basically apart from that one example, this is true.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.300
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.440
 >> Just on names, Dick Loss, a friend of mine who's actually in

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.320
 the crowd tonight, Shona, sent this ridiculous fact.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.320
 I can't believe that it's true.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.580
 >> Any fact that comes from a friend of yours.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.080
 No, I meant Shona.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.600
 But there's some skepticism in the room.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.880
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.920
 >> So Wild Bill Hickok, right?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.440
 So the name Wild Bill, this really kick-ass name, scared people.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.600
 He was just like this beautiful, amazing cowboy.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.640
 Supposedly, the reason he got it is not because he was this incredible cowboy who

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.120
 could do dangerous things, is because his face, his nose and

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.400
 mouth look slightly like a duck.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.480
 And- >> No.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.600
 >> And Wild Bill is the bill of a duck.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.800
 But, and so he was sort of bullied, this is Shona's fact.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.000
 He was sort of bullied by his buddies, and then he changed it to be like,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.640
 no, I'm really cool and wild.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.360
 >> His brother was called Tame Bill Hickok, wasn't he?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.120
 >> Yes.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.000
 >> So did he have a face that looked like a normal duck's beak?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.920
 >> I will bet a decent number of doubloons that that is not true.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.120
 >> Okay, using a pirate currency, apparently, now?

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.480
 >> Pirate's Cowboys.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.720
 Sorry, what's it called, cowboy currency?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.920
 >> Like gold nuggets.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.840
 There you go, that's what I'll bet, I'm sorry.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.180
 >> You'd wager your parrot on it, wouldn't you, Anna?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.480
 >> I'm gonna have to move us on in a sec, guys, we gotta move on.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.840
 >> The Cowboys all went on strike in 1883, which I think is a very funny-

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.800
 >> Okay, there was a cowboy strike in 1883.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.480
 >> Well, they had very good unions, the Cowboys.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.000
 >> Right.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.200
 >> And, guys- >> [LAUGH]

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.920
 >> Peter, how to let Jeremy carbon in?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.040
 >> Yeah.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.680
 >> If you're equating the striking bin men with these Cowboys,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.560
 that's very fluttering to them, but we're all about the Cowboys here, and

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.960
 their unions- >> And pirates, don't forget the pirates.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.680
 >> And pirates, also very strong unions.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.040
 They were called the Turtles, they were the original Turtles, Cowboy unions.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.200
 >> The original Turtles.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.920
 >> Yeah.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.200
 >> What were they called, Turtles, do we know?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.480
 >> They were called Turtles, it was the Rodeo's Union, and so it was in response

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.480
 to bad-paying stuff, and they were called Turtles, because the idea is they're,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.000
 I don't know why they're proud of this, but they're slow to organise,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.560
 but once they do, they're unafraid to stick their neck out.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.640
 >> It's good.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.760
 >> I don't know if that's what you want.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.640
 >> Kind of good.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.760
 >> Yeah. >> I thought that when Turtles were afraid,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.360
 they didn't stick their neck out.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.600
 >> I think that might be true as well.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.240
 I don't know how much they knew about naturalism, the Cowboys.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.760
 [MUSIC]

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.720
 >> It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.040
 >> My fact this week is that until the 19th century, if someone shouted,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.160
 stop thief, you had no choice but to try and stop the thief.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.680
 >> Cool.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.280
 >> You were legally obliged on pain of being arrested and

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.640
 facing a penalty to chase the thief.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.360
 >> But with the crowd who were trying to stop the thief,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.240
 if you didn't join in, does some of the crowd then start chasing you?

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.760
 >> Yeah, good point.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.440
 Stop non-thief stopper.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.000
 >> Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.880
 >> Well, there was a time in, this was in 1760,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.760
 there was a Jewish second hand clothes dealer, and he followed this,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.600
 what was known as hue and cry.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.520
 And he was faster than everyone else, so he got at the front of the group, and

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.480
 then they thought that he was the one who was- >> No.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.560
 >> And so they grabbed him and arrested him.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.520
 >> My God.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.440
 >> That's like a scene out of life of Brian.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.960
 >> Yes, but that's a really good point.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.880
 What was the policing of that situation?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.080
 Because you've suddenly got potentially one criminal and then 30 criminals.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.080
 >> Yes, so I do think the crime of not stopping the thief wasn't as large as

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.400
 the crime of being the thief.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.000
 So your priority is still to chase the thief, but I think after you'd given chase

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 and you'd caught the thief, you can mention to the constable, by the way,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.440
 the old Angela who lives next door didn't even give chase, so.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.080
 >> Well, one reason was if you didn't chase them and they got away,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.520
 you became liable for the robberies, so you might have to pay money for

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.960
 the person who got the robberies.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.600
 >> Wait, if I just don't chase, because I'm halfway through doing something,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.320
 I'm liable for the stuff- >> Like a Sudoku or something.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.400
 >> Yeah, I'll have to do my Sudoku, and then I don't join the hue and cry.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.360
 I'm then on the hook for the theft.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.320
 >> You wouldn't go to prison for the theft, but you might have to pay some

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.640
 recompense to the person- >> Well, I refuse to pay, that's outrageous.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.840
 >> Well, then you are going to prison.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.880
 >> Yeah, prison.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.640
 >> Then I'll maybe have a bit of peace and

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.160
 bloody quiet to do my Sudoku.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.760
 >> Everyone's won.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.680
 >> Wow. >> You're going shopping must have been so

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.840
 stressful back in the day.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.560
 >> Yeah, well, this is what if it makes you guys feel better,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.720
 Dan and Andy, because I can see you're having trouble with this.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.400
 There were also penalties for raising a false hue and cry for exactly this reason,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.520
 because it was acknowledged that people would be busy working in the farms or

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.520
 doing Sudoku, and so it could interrupt the village economy.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.320
 Every time you shouted, stop thief.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.680
 So you did get in trouble for doing it falsely.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.400
 As some people did, I think there was one person who raised a hue and

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.360
 cry on his dog, I believe.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.760
 I think this is in the 15th century, and it was found his dog was chasing some sheep.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.400
 And so he did the stop thief, or the stop done my dog's chasing sheep hue and cry.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.000
 >> Right. >> And he was fine for that.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.920
 >> You know the descendants of Sigmund Freud,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.840
 Lucian Freud, Clement Freud, a big broadcaster and an artist.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.080
 When they were younger, they were going through a park, and

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.920
 they decided to challenge each other who could run faster to the destination they

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.480
 were getting to, and they both convinced that they were gonna be the person that

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.160
 could do it.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.880
 So they started running, and as they were going, Clement took over,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:11.320
 was going much faster, and so Lucian went, stop thief, he's taken my money.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.240
 And he was grabbed by Pastor Byes, who stopped him.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.200
 And Clement was so pissed off with him that the two of them barely spoke for

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.440
 the rest of their life.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.120
 That was the incident.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.040
 >> I knew they hated each other.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.480
 >> Lucian didn't even go to his funeral.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.640
 >> No way.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640
 >> They hated each other.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.360
 >> Because of that, what?

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.280
 >> That was the biggie.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.600
 That's what everyone says, well, it all comes back down to the stop thief moment.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.200
 When he did that, he said- >> You should have made his tombstone,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.680
 boy, you've stopped now, haven't you?

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.360
 >> Nice.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.840
 >> That would be good.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.880
 >> You didn't always have to shout stop thief, there are a few other things you

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.280
 might shout.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.920
 In Scotland, sometimes you would shout, oh, yay.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:55.680
 In Wales, you might shout, hubbub, and in Gloucestershire,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.720
 you might shout, utestes.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:04.240
 >> Isn't it like, you parabolics, you've nick my purse.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.600
 >> It's U-T-E-S-T-E-S, utestes.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.240
 >> Right, utestes.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240
 >> Okay.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.840
 >> Sounds like a Greek philosopher, doesn't it?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.840
 Utestes.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.840
 >> Yes.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.280
 >> He's just bouncing out a lot of bollocks all the time, yeah.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.280
 >> It's really interesting.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.680
 I think, so there was this thing.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.440
 There was a magazine, the magazine is putting it a bit strong.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.440
 It was a kind of a one sheet thing in the 1770s that was run by the Bow Street Magistrate

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:34.000
 in London, and it was full of unsolved crimes and details of criminals, and it was called

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.560
 general hue and cry, and it was distributed across the country, and it was a way of catching

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.080
 criminals, it was basically like an extremely long distance hue and cry.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.960
 You'd say this person has stolen this, and they look like this, so if you see them, please

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.920
 pick them up, and it worked.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.880
 Even in the 1770s, people were being picked up hundreds of miles away for crimes they

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880
 committed.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.200
 >> It just feels like being a civilian was a full-time job in those days.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.120
 You have to constantly, because again, it wasn't just that you had to give chase when

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120
 people cried.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.880
 You had to if you read it in the magazine, and also by the 17th century.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.320
 >> Sorry, what do you mean if you read it in the magazine?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.160
 >> No, you didn't have to chase when you read it in the magazine.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.680
 People desperately tried not to look at magazines, because then they're legally obliged.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.020
 >> It made it very hard to do the Sudoku, didn't it?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.600
 >> But warrants would be passed from parish to parish, so let's say you're looking for

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.160
 a thief, then you go to the next parish, and you give them a picture, a drawing of the

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.680
 criminal and a description of them, and you say, "Can you spread this around your parish?"

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.080
 And then everyone in that parish is obliged to keep an eye out for them.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.040
 So I don't know how anyone held down a job.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.000
 >> They had delayed hue and cry in the Scottish borders as well.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.760
 The reason being that you would have a lot of people from England coming over and trying

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.400
 to steal people's sheep and belongings and stuff like that.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.000
 And often what you would do is because they were armed, these people, it's a bit the Wild

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.240
 West really, and so you might kind of hide in your hedge or kind of just try and get

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.040
 all of your really expensive belongings and go there.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040
 >> In the hedge.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040
 >> In the hedge, yeah.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.040
 >> Yeah.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.040
 >> Anywhere really.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.040
 >> All your sheep in the hedge.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.040
 Entire block of sheep, one hedge.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.440
 >> And then someone comes out with a hedge trimmer and you go, "Oh, no!"

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.240
 So you would hide often because they were armed.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.480
 And so there's a special border law where you're allowed to do a counter raid as long

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.800
 as it was within the six days.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.120
 You still had to shout hue and cry as you went.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.600
 And you had to carry a lighted torch so that everyone knew you were on a legitimate return

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 mission.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600
 >> That's amazing.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600
 >> Wow.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600
 >> Yeah.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.840
 >> And then they had to join you on that.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.920
 >> No, that was just you getting your own back from the Cumbrians.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
 >> Got it.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.920
 Fair enough.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.360
 >> And these days, if you shout stop thief, you can get in trouble.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.040
 There's quite a few people who have sued, like, shop security because they've shouted

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040
 stop thief.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.960
 And they're like, "Well, I'm not a thief," and everyone's heard that, and everyone's

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960
 going to think that now.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960
 >> Yeah.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.880
 >> There was a guy in Dublin, he was 28 years old, and he claimed that he'd been wrongly

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.480
 accused of shoplifting a toy duck from a toy store.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.680
 He basically said he was deeply embarrassed and ashamed when a security guard approached

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.560
 me and said, "Where is the duck?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.560
 I know you have it."

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.880
 >> And the best part about it was they went to court, and they brought out the duck as

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.000
 evidence, and it was a talking duck, and they couldn't turn it off.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.600
 All the way through the court case, this duck was just talking all the way through.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.960
 >> Are you sure it was a talking duck and not Wild Bill Hickok sitting in the court?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.240
 I've heard they're identical.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.040
 Do you guys know the bloody code?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.040
 >> No.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040
 >> The bloody code.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.880
 >> Is that like a penal code, and you could be effectively executed for lots and lots

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880
 and lots of crimes?

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.680
 >> It's pretty much, yeah, dropping a handkerchief.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680
 Yeah.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.680
 Yeah.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:58.600
 This is in England, so Scotland tended to have a bit of a more, we might say better,

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.520
 we might say more lenient legal system in sort of later medieval time where you didn't

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.320
 get the death penalty for everything, but in England there was the bloody code, which

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.600
 was the English legal system from the 17th to the early 19th century, and I hadn't realised

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.160
 how many crimes you could be killed for, so there were over 200 crimes that were added

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.200
 to this code.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.040
 Crimes you could be executed for included damaging orchards or gardens, cutting down trees on

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:30.040
 an avenue, destroying a turnpike road, wrecking a fish pond.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.400
 >> I've got to say, Anna, I'm agreeing with all of this at the moment.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.120
 If I owned a fish pond, I would...

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.280
 >> You're very so proprietary about your garden, aren't you?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.280
 >> Wow.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:48.040
 But there was this thing where if you were done for a crime and the jury thought, oh,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.120
 we don't really want this person to be literally hanged to death, they would return at what

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.560
 was called a partial verdict, and they'd say he's guilty, but not as guilty as the judge

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.640
 is trying to make out.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.040
 So there was this thing called grand larceny, if you stole something worth more than a shilling,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.120
 that was the death penalty for you.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.240
 So a shilling is not a huge amount of money even then, but what juries would sometimes

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.660
 do is they would return a verdict of not grand larceny, but petty larceny.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.040
 So in 1751, for example, there was a crime where the accused had stolen a pound and seven

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.480
 shillings and sixpence, definitely way above the barrier for being hanged, but the jury

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:31.720
 said, we think those coins were actually only worth seven pence, so as a result, you get

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720
 off.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720
 So that meant fewer executions.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.760
 >> Well, you say Anna about them being a bit more lenient in Scotland is mostly true,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.000
 but then after the reformation, the law was sort of done by the Kirk, by the church, and

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.600
 they started bringing in laws for quite a lot of things that we would be surprised about

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600
 today.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:54.000
 So there were statues of 1661 in Scotland that said that if a child beat or cursed, either

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.080
 their father or mother, they should be put to death without mercy.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080
 >> Oh.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 >> Yeah.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080
 >> My numbers first.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:08.440
 >> If you were found guilty of the vice of, this is the exact words, filthy fornication,

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.560
 you would get a fine of 40 pounds, 40 Scottish pounds, which in those days was absolutely

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560
 enormous.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.340
 And in 1697, as late as then, there was a guy in Edinburgh called Thomas Aikenhead.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.080
 He was hanged for declaring that theology was a rhapsody of ill-invented nonsense.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080
 >> Oh.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.020
 >> He was hanged for that.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.020
 >> Yeah.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.600
 It wasn't, you know, the Norwegian today, it was slightly more lenient.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.360
 >> I was reading about, there's a classic book that was written by a guy called Havlock

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:42.180
 Ellis, and it's all about the study of what a criminal, the makeup of a criminal, and

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.920
 this was during Victorian times.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.080
 >> Like the face was supposed to look different if you were a criminal.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080
 >> Exactly.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.200
 So there was a guy called Salsotto who was someone who paid particular attention to

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.180
 different bits of the body to see if that, and he found, he believes that you're more

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:02.160
 likely to be a criminal as a woman if you have a hairy anus.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.760
 >> All right, so from a show of hands, ladies.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.040
 >> She said hands.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:18.840
 >> That is a terrible episode of "Cry Watch," isn't it?

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.240
 We've done a recreation of the cry.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.480
 >> Is that part of the search?

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.640
 Like who's the criminal?

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640
 That's, yeah.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.120
 Has everyone shaved their anus before we commit this crime?

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.620
 We don't want anyone caught.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.760
 But so he found it basically in seven out of 40 women that he studied.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760
 >> Seven out of 40.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760
 >> Who were criminals.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760
 >> Right.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760
 >> Had a hairy anus.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.280
 >> It's not a huge proportion.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.120
 >> It's enough that it made him write it down.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.520
 >> Did he study 40 non-criminals as well?

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.600
 Was there any control group in this experiment?

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 >> Yeah.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600
 All right.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 Okay.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.760
 >> Do we know the proportion of women that have under normal circumstances according

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760
 to him hairy anuses?

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.760
 >> That's what I'm saying.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.880
 >> Do we know what counts as a hairy anus?

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880
 >> Yeah.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.080
 Where's the anusometer of, you know.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.880
 >> How rigorous was this study?

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880
 Was it peer reviewed?

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.960
 >> It sounds like he wasn't a proper scientist at all.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.400
 >> This is in Victorian London.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.000
 >> Oh, Victorian London.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 >> Yeah.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 >> Fine.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 >> Okay.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 >> There was no science.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.160
 And I kept reading it because it's a lot about hair.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.040
 Like does hair mean you're a criminal?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.360
 I'm a really hairy guy.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.840
 You can probably see from the audience.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.600
 >> We can't see all of you.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.200
 >> But I am a really hairy guy.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.960
 And so I was reading on.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.080
 And it said it's worthwhile pointing out that there are frequent anomalies in the development

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.600
 of hair among idiots.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.120
 >> It's the hair.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.600
 That's what it is.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.600
 >> But yeah.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.160
 So any hairy anus women out there?

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.160
 >> Stop.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.360
 >> We're watching it.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.560
 >> Oh, my God.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.520
 >> Good grief.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:09.320
 >> It is time for fact number three.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.600
 And that is Andy.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.840
 >> My fact is that in 2016, scientists found a pocket of helium so big that it could make

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:24.260
 everyone on the planet sound squeaky for 20 minutes.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.480
 >> I mean, what great use of that helium.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480
 >> Incredible.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.200
 We would have had such a good time.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.720
 And then actually later on, they upgraded the estimate they thought and it would have

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.040
 been 40 minutes.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.640
 We could all have been squeaky for 40 minutes, everyone.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.240
 I'm sure that would have had quite serious health consequences for everybody, breathing

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.560
 non-oxygen for 40 minutes.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.000
 But nonetheless, this massive, massive amount, and this is the thing of helium is we're always

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.720
 running out of it and then suddenly always discovering more.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720
 >> Yeah.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720
 >> And it's just this constant sea salt.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720
 >> Where is this pocket?

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.120
 >> This was in Tanzania.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120
 >> Okay.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.120
 >> Under the ground, presumably.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.460
 >> It's in an area called Rukwa in Tanzania.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.680
 And Rukwa is also the place which has the largest number of crocodiles in the whole

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680
 of Tanzania.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:12.120
 And the interesting thing about that is if you give a crocodile helium, its voice doesn't

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.800
 go higher, it goes lower.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800
 >> Yeah.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800
 >> Really?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.560
 >> I remember we did it on QI and it's weird because the same thing is happening to, I think,

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.360
 is it the timbre of your voice that helium changes rather than the pitch?

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360
 >> Exactly.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360
 >> I think it is.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360
 >> Yeah.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.560
 >> So you'd think that a crocodile sounded like us, like it's going higher, but when

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.200
 the timbre of a crocodile's voice gets higher, it sounds to us deeper, so they sound more

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200
 sexy.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.200
 >> I don't think I've ever heard --

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.200
 [ Laughter ]

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.800
 >> Even more sexy.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 >> I feel that.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.800
 >> Even more.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.800
 >> I can feel that.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.800
 >> Hard to believe.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800
 >> Yeah.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800
 A crocodile hunter was a very sexy show, wasn't it?

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.800
 Steve Irwin was --

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.880
 >> Is that what he was doing to those crocodiles?

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.000
 >> Well, I've never heard a crocodile make any kind of noise.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 >> They kind of growl.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 They grunt.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Yeah.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Well, that --

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 [ Laughter ]

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 >> Okay.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Okay.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 That was hot.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 [ Laughter ]

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 >> Okay.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 So they growl.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Okay.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Cool.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.400
 >> And the other interesting thing, I suppose, is that on this whole thing is that we were

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.000
 running out of helium, and it was a big problem because we use it for MRI machines, we use

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.640
 it for all sorts of important stuff, not just balloons, and we were running out of it, and

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.480
 the price was getting higher and higher and higher, and this was the first time we'd ever

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.240
 really looked for it, and they started looking and they found shitloads of it, and so they

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.800
 think that maybe if we keep looking, we might find a lot more, and in fact, in 2017, some

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.720
 scientists at the University of Edinburgh found a huge amount of helium in the middle

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720
 of Scotland as well.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720
 >> Oh, really?

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720
 >> Yeah.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720
 >> Oh, thank God.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720
 The parties are saved.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720
 [ Laughter ]

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720
 >> No, it isn't.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 The parties are saved.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720
 >> It's really -- it's weird.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.240
 It's the second most abundant element in the entire universe, but it's incredibly hard

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240
 to keep here.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240
 >> That's crazy.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.360
 >> If you look at the deposits of it, they're mostly deposits of rock that are capped with

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.280
 some impermeable rock, so it's basically in a cave that you're looking for it.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280
 >> Yeah.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280
 >> Yeah.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.400
 Do you know the biggest amount of helium you can currently buy?

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400
 This is quite exciting.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400
 >> Oh, okay.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400
 >> This week.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400
 This is really thrilling.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400
 >> This week?

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.800
 Well, you would say they would come in those kind of canisters, right?

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.800
 >> Yep.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 Yep.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800
 >> A big one of those --

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.200
 >> It's even bigger than that.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200
 >> By weight?

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200
 Because --

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.440
 >> Well, it's -- I'm going to tell you by volume and by length.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440
 So --

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.440
 >> Okay.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.240
 >> So we could work out the width of the depths from that.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240
 >> This is GCSE math.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.880
 >> And you've just got a GCSE math.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.880
 Yeah.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.400
 No, the USA have just announced -- this is really thrilling stuff.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.200
 They are just announcing they are selling off the entire federal helium system because

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:44.160
 they nationalized it really early on, like in the 1920 or so, because they needed airships.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.440
 So they said we have to -- the government has to control the global supply, but we can

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440
 now get in on it.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440
 That's great news.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.320
 So if they decided we don't really need airships anymore, so we might as well come in.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320
 >> I don't know.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.840
 >> That was -- the Hindenburg wasn't able to use helium because of that global monopoly

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.840
 was --

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.840
 >> Exactly.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.840
 Yeah.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.840
 >> Exactly that.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.840
 >> Did you -- sorry, Andy, did you tell us the size of this?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840
 >> Actually, I didn't.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840
 Thank you very much, James.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 So --

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.600
 >> I could just tell that everyone in the room was like, "But, Andy, what is the length

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.760
 and the volume?"

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.520
 >> It includes -- thank you, James -- 700 kilometers of helium pipelines which are spread across

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.200
 Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, but I'm sure they can move them for an extra fee.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.920
 There's the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir, a 4,000-hectare rock formation, capped -- you'll

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.400
 be glad to know -- by two layers of non-porous calcium and hydrite, and it is likely to contain

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.880
 65 million cubic meters of federally-owned crude helium.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.520
 >> And are they going to deliver this in convenient packages, or do they just say it's there,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520
 get it yourself?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.000
 >> Because you can't come, and you know, like if you go to a supermarket and they say

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.320
 you do want a bag, and you're like, "Well, I think I can fit it in these pockets."

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.120
 You can't do that with that much helium, can you?

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120
 >> No, no, no.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.600
 I'm not sure who's going to buy it or what for.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:57.560
 >> Well, we might for helium airships, because, bizarrely, the UK has just decided to start

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.560
 investing in them again.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.560
 >> Really?

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.560
 >> Yeah.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:06.640
 After a bit of a hiatus, and it's air nostrum, the -- it's a sister airline of BA, and it's

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.440
 just put in a massive order for some helium airships, and, in fact, this venture is backed

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:18.360
 by Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson, who I think he's pretty into flying, isn't

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360
 he?

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.360
 >> He's a pilot, yeah.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360
 >> There you go.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.360
 That's why he's into flying.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.920
 So, he's into this idea, and the idea is that it slashes a lot of carbon use, because we

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.920
 could use them instead of aeroplanes, it'll slash carbon use by 90%.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.960
 I liked the fact that quasi-quarting, the business secretary said, "This is proof of

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:41.640
 how the UK's businesses are embracing new technology."

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.360
 Anyway, a prototype crash landed in 2016 on its second test, but it is going to be great,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360
 we're told.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360
 >> Oh, boy.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360
 Wow, that's so good.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:57.160
 >> Who would win, this is an open question, in a conflict between an airship and a submarine?

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.120
 >> Well, it depends where the conflict takes place.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.280
 >> Fair play.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.080
 >> Let's make it a neutral territory, let's make it above water.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:15.000
 You've got all the environments there apart from land, it's not on land.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 >> Because this has happened.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 >> Oh, has it?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 >> Yeah.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.400
 >> Specifically, though, as in they were pitted against each other.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.640
 >> No, it was during the Second World War, there wasn't time to set up like fun...

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.800
 >> It wasn't like Robot Wars.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.680
 >> It wasn't pay-per-view, airship versus submarine, okay.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.360
 >> So there were loads of US ships near the coast, which were sunk by German submarines

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.080
 during the war, and there were ships which went in convoys that were protected by airships.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.640
 You've got a ship on the sea, then an airship above it protecting because they can see when

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.400
 a submarine is approaching, they can detect it, and then drop depth charges.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.560
 You ordinarily wouldn't hit one, but it would just force the submarine to go lower and not

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.840
 use its torpedoes, and of the 90,000 ships that were in convoys escorted by airships,

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:06.400
 only one of them was ever sunk, but in 1943, a submarine fought a U-boat and the submarine

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.400
 won.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400
 >> Really?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.400
 >> Yeah.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400
 >> And what did it do?

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400
 >> Sorry, a submarine fought a U-boat, do you say?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.040
 >> Yep, I got that wrong.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.080
 That would have been a completely ordinary thing to happen in 1943.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.120
 >> It's not the best fact you've ever had.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:29.040
 >> I did a submarine fight against an airship, how did they shoot it, like torpedoes wouldn't

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.740
 go in the air, right?

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.240
 >> The account is quite vague on the method used.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.280
 I'm sure it wasn't a torpedo, but I think I might have been firing from the surface,

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.880
 because I think I might have had surface guns.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.280
 >> I can't believe you don't know the answer.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.120
 >> I know, I'm sorry, I don't know who won, I just don't have a fucking match report,

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.920
 you know, I'm sorry not to know.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.880
 >> If you take some helium and freeze it down to pretty much absolute zero just above it,

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.160
 and you put it in a teacup, and you start stirring it, and you go away, and you come

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.080
 back a million years later, it will still be stirring.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.080
 >> What?

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080
 >> That's so spooky.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.080
 >> I know.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.520
 >> It has no friction, doesn't it?

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520
 >> Exactly.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.520
 >> It's like this amazing capacity, but only when it's right and you're absolute zero.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.120
 >> It's because it doesn't go, like most things as they get colder, if you remember, from

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.960
 your GCSE chemistry, they turn into solids, helium doesn't turn into a solid no matter

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.120
 how cold it gets, unless you put it under loads and loads of pressure, and so it just

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.320
 has these amazing properties, like a superconductor would.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.760
 >> It also, if you leave it in a glass and you bring it right down, A, it'll fall through

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:42.320
 the glass, so like because, because it doesn't undergo friction at all, every tiny molecule

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.840
 sized hole in your glass, like I'm holding a glass now, there are molecule sized holes

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.960
 in it, most liquids stay in that because friction is holding them in, helium, when it's liquid,

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.200
 will just slip through, and it will climb up the sides of the glass, because gravity

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.760
 doesn't work the same way, gravity's not strong enough to hold it down, it's magic.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.560
 Can I quickly tell you my favourite helium story I've ever read?

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:12.280
 1999, headline was, helium blew women up like a balloon, she was fine, by the way, I just

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:22.320
 said the solid lips, she wasn't fine, she had a bad day, she was called, she was called

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.080
 Samantha Munn, she owned a toy shop, she was standing on a stepladder in her toy shop,

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:34.320
 she slipped off, and she was speared by the metal spike, which was in a helium tank, in

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:41.160
 her left thigh, thank God for that, and she looked down and she saw her left thigh and

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:47.280
 her stomach inflate like a balloon, they managed to get her to a hospital, where they extracted

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:58.920
 her from the helium tank, did she just kind of go, around the room, we don't have any

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.280
 beds for this patient, we'll just rubber it against your head and stick it to the wall.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.800
 Wouldn't it be great as well, because this was in a toy shop where they sell balloons

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:14.800
 to the brand of kid, can I get this mum, for an hour she's been walking around the shopping

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800
 mall.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.520
 This is just the kind of joke she dreaded happening after this story.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.520
 She's fine now, right?

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:27.040
 She's fine, they said a doctor x-rayed her left thigh, which showed that it was about

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.440
 twice the size of her right, which I would argue you could tell without an x-ray.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:40.840
 Time for our final fact for the show, and that is my fact.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:48.240
 My fact this week is if you look up humour on Wikipedia, the first thing you'll see

00:37:48.240 --> 00:38:07.560
 is a picture of my face, and this is something that as of the 21st of August, someone changed

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.440
 the photo on the article for humour, and very randomly they don't know who I am, they've

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.240
 made that very clear in their comment, going, I have no idea who this person is, if anyone's

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:22.760
 got a better picture, please replace it, but it hasn't been replaced, and I now find myself

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.240
 the global face of humour.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:34.560
 And in the photo, it's not just me, there's someone else, so the wording, the caption

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.560
 underneath is a viewer brackets Jimmy Wales left laughing at a comedian, Dan Schreiber

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.480
 right performing stand-up comedian, if you don't know who Jimmy Wales is, Jimmy Wales

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:53.600
 is the creator of Wikipedia, which is basically like making God laugh, right?

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.120
 So this is a very exciting development.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.840
 I imagine God's laughing a lot when he's looking over at you.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.640
 Now that is really cool.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.120
 I don't know, if you ever needed evidence that Wikipedia's an unreliable source, I think

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.840
 you're looking at it.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.280
 I wasn't there on this day, Dan.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.280
 You weren't?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.800
 So why are you not in the picture, Andy?

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.760
 I don't know, but I did look up the Wikipedia for Wanker recently, and very upsettingly,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.840
 no, no, no, but this was a thing called Wikimania, where they sort of have an annual conference

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.600
 all about Wikipedia and Wikipedians, and they have seminars, and they have fun quizzes,

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:36.400
 and yeah, Andy and I were actually at the Edinburgh Fringe when it was on, it was down

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.360
 in London, and I had this idea called Wikipedia the missing bits, and the idea was to do a

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:47.980
 stand-up show where a comedian would come up and present a set on a missing page on Wikipedia

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.600
 and their pitch for what should be involved in it, and Jimmy Wales came up, and actually

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.560
 Jimmy came on stage with you, Andy, and did a quiz.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:58.320
 Yeah, yeah, no one apparently took a fucking photo.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.640
 Didn't you try to edit Wikipedia on the way down to say something about yourself?

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.240
 No, there was a comedian who was on the show that day called Steve Cross, who was complaining

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.960
 that he doesn't have a Wikipedia page, so I created a page where I could put his name

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.860
 on, which was People Who Don't Have Wikipedia Pages, and he was the first on the list, but

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.860
 it got taken down immediately.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.560
 It was within a minute or something, it was amazingly fast editing by the people at Wikipedia.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.760
 All the four of us have Wikipedia pages, right, and I had a quick look at the editing online,

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:33.400
 because there's been a few times where comments that have been made on this show have made

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.840
 their way onto my Wikipedia, and I've had to go in, and I've complained about it, and

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.320
 no one changes it, so I've had to physically edit my change into it, and I'm now banned

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.840
 from Wikipedia, yeah, before editing my own page for factual accuracy.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:55.440
 So one of the things was, someone changed my name on it to Daniel Indiana, Craig Schreiber,

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.520
 because I once said that I almost changed my name to Daniel Indiana, to Indiana is my

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.640
 middle name, so for a while on Wikipedia it was Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber, Brackets,

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:15.440
 Dix, which is what James said on the podcast, is what's made it on, then a few years later,

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.640
 I had to change that, a few years later, Andy makes a joke, and it's a joke that I have

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:27.760
 an interest in, sort of, we were talking about Nazism, and stuff like that, you're an avid

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760
 collector.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:36.080
 Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber, aka Dix, is a radio producer living in the United Kingdom,

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:42.640
 others have claimed him to have an extreme fascination and an expertise in Nazism and

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.560
 Nazi sacred myths.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.720
 I hate to think what it's going to say about Heria-nesses after tonight's show.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:59.240
 And then some other dick put this on, I found this because this was in an edit, it said,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.680
 "Remove incorrect statement, Schreiber is not particularly noted for this catchphrase,"

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.440
 and then what originally was put into my account was, "Schreiber is famous for his hilarious

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:18.600
 catchphrase," yep, which he uses after Twitter handles are announced on no such thing as

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.600
 a fish.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:25.280
 It's such a good catchphrase, though, because you've called it like, "That's a biggie,"

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.960
 that's a huge word, oh my God, that's so good.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.600
 On Wikipedia pages, often it says, "Notable people," so if you had Bolton, for instance,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.320
 it might be notable people from Bolton, I thought I'd check where we are, if any of

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.240
 those things, so this is all that I could find.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:51.160
 I am mentioned in "Notable people" with Afantasia, because I don't have like a mind's eye, so

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.160
 I'm in that.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.880
 So James can't picture your face if you leave, he can't remember your face, that's all.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.120
 Uranus on the other hand?

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.760
 Photographic, absolutely.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.760
 Dan is mentioned as a notable Australian in the United Kingdom, and Anna is a notable

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:17.040
 person in the Poles in the United Kingdom, as in people from Poland.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.200
 Andy Murray is a notable tennis player.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200
 Wow.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.440
 I'm not joking, I genuinely searched, and I didn't find that phrase.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.600
 Thank you for looking.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:35.200
 There was a thing, so the editing can be used for good and for ill, as we've clearly seen

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.080
 from Dan's extensive list of grievances that he just read out, but a couple of years ago

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.760
 there was a bloke in Australia who was a really big fan of a band called Peaking Duck.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.960
 He was a bloke called David Spargo, and he was going to see them at a gig, and he really

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.480
 wanted to get backstage to see them, and so he changed the Wikipedia page of the band

00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:00.360
 Peaking Duck, creating an entry for family and listing himself as a family member.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.560
 And then when he got to the backstage bit of the gig, he said to the guys, "No, no,

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.920
 I'm their step-brother or cousin or whatever, show that to the security guys who let him

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920
 in."

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920
 Genius.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.720
 And the band just gave him a beer and said, "Fair play, that's a very funny thing you've

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.720
 done."

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:22.040
 They said, "I love this so much," they said, "He wasn't creepy at all, and was actually

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.280
 much more relaxed and cool than we would have expected from someone who went to those lengths."

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.280
 That's so good.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.720
 The band hasn't been seen since then, has it?

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.760
 You know on Wikipedia how there are multiple language Wikipedia's, and so there may be

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.480
 a translation of no such thing as a fish into, I don't know, Mandarin, for example, or whatever

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.800
 languages there are.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:47.680
 So there's a list of the articles where people and things have been the most translated,

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.440
 so it's the leaderboard of that.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.840
 So in terms of humans that are on that leaderboard, the top people are, the most translations

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.840
 is for Jesus.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.560
 Third is for Michael Jackson.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.560
 Third is for Barack Obama.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.000
 Fourth is for Donald Trump.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.720
 Fifth is for Adolf Hitler.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.000
 Sixth is for Albert Einstein.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.560
 Who do you think is seventh?

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560
 Is that Andy?

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560
 Please.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.600
 I need this, Dan.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.320
 I would have liked someone like Harry Potter, perhaps, or...

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.480
 It's got to be a real person.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.480
 Mr Bean?

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.480
 Oh, Rowan Atkinson.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480
 Oh, Rowan Atkinson.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.480
 Rowan Atkinson.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480
 Same answer, yeah.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480
 Yeah.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.480
 Is it another world leader?

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.480
 No.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:34.680
 And I called Corbin Blue, BLEU, who was initially at the time a supporting actor from the movie

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:44.320
 High School Musical, who, one enthusiastic fan, translated his account into every single

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:50.080
 language that he could, as using Google Translate and stuff like that, giving him over 200 different

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.240
 languages of translation.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:01.000
 So, he's just behind Albert Einstein, Julius Caesar's behind him, but it's, yeah, and it's

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.360
 the theory that it's one person who's been doing that.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360
 That's amazing.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360
 So, we just think...

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.080
 Because it sounds like that person is in tonight, if we do want to ask.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.440
 God people have a lot of time.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:17.200
 Like, so, on languages on Wikipedia, actually, there is a Scots language Wikipedia section.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:23.760
 It's got 41,000 articles, as in Scots, the sort of language Robbie Burns, kind of, some

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.480
 people will say it's a dialect of English, some people say it's its own language, but

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480
 you know the one.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:34.280
 Anyway, people started to notice that some of the Scots language articles were not entirely

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.720
 correct in terms of not really being written in the Scots language, they were really written

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.160
 in a parody version of it, or what someone who didn't actually speak the language might

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.280
 guess that it sounded like, and it turned out, it's because almost half of the articles

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.520
 had been written by a teenager in North Carolina who did not speak a word of Scots.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:58.760
 It's the most odd story, and he started off doing it, he was 12, I think, when he started

00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760
 doing it.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.080
 What a strange kid.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:09.240
 And they started at the top, all with the warning, "The Scots that was oozed in this

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:16.120
 article was written be a body that's Mithra-Tung, is now Scots.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:22.440
 Please improve this article, Guinea Can, which I think is translated as, this is all bollocks,

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.960
 please improve it."

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.840
 But then he took that away, and it was only a couple of years ago, it was revealed that

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.320
 it was just this boy in North Carolina who, I know, because then he felt so bad about

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.320
 it.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.320
 He felt so bad about it.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.320
 He hasn't been named, I think, which is good.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.760
 Now, we know his Wikipedia name, which is Amaryllis Gardiner, but I don't know if you

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.280
 can track him down with that.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.400
 And very sweetly, because a lot of people said we should scrap the whole Scots language

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.920
 page, the Michael Dempster, who's director of the Scots Language Center, said, "Look,

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.260
 this kid's put in an incredible amount of work.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:48:01.480
 It's a great resource, but it does need people who are literate in Scots to edit it now."

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480
 So get on it.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.200
 The editing of Wikipedia is such a hotly contested area, the behind-the-scenes of it is just

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.920
 constant fights going on.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.440
 One of the famous ones, which probably a lot of people here know about, is there is a page

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:25.400
 for a guy who's called Guy Standing, and in the photo, Guy Standing is sitting.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.920
 So the caption reads, "Guy Standing, sitting."

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920
 Beautiful.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.920
 That's great.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:37.880
 It's great, except it's a very contentious photo, which has now been edited away, brought

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.880
 back because people are saying you're making fun.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.480
 This is an obvious joke, and we're not about jokes here, we're about information.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.860
 So if you want jokes, head over to Dan Schreiber on the human point.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.480
 I just have one or two things about stock photos, because this is a stock photo, this

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:57.760
 is a public use photo, but the stock photo libraries that exist, they lead to all sorts

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.840
 of weird quirks and tangents.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:06.080
 So for example, in 2019, the New Zealand budget featured stock photos, a stock photo model

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.640
 on the front of it, and it turned out to be a woman called Vicky Freeman, who just had

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.480
 the picture taken and just sold the rights to it.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.480
 Anyway, she had moved to Australia because she could no longer afford to live in New

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.440
 Zealand, and was on the front page of the New Zealand budget document, all about making

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440
 life affordable.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.040
 And you don't really have many options, normally.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.480
 You can sometimes say, "I don't want to be used to advertise an extreme political

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.320
 view," or whatever, but you often just have no rights at all.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:38.280
 So in 2014, a woman called Samantha Ovens had years before done a photo shoot for colds

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280
 and illnesses.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.720
 You know, those sort of cold remedy photos, where you just have to pinch your brow and

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.360
 look a bit pained, or look a bit...

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360
 Yeah.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.880
 ...like you're having a slightly, "Oh, I've got a bit of a cold or a headache," or whatever.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.440
 Anyway, that then got used as the lead on a Guardian article, a confessional article

00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:01.880
 blind, "I fantasise about group sex with old obese men," and she just found people started

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.880
 contacting her, saying, "You're right, Samantha."

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.000
 A lot of old men getting in touch.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.200
 Honestly, Sam, see you dance, mate.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.640
 I'm going to have to wrap this up very shortly, guys.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640
 I know.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640
 We're nearing the end.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640
 Could I tell you one funny thing?

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640
 Yeah.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640
 I saw...

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.480
 Which is that, following one of the Football World Cups, Seth Blatter, who was the FIFA

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:30.520
 president, he was awarded this beautiful award, the Order of Companions of OR Tambo, for his

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:35.800
 contribution to the World Cup, and to announce it, the South African government put it on

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:42.160
 their webpage, but unfortunately, they took his name and details from his Wikipedia page,

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.840
 which had just been vandalised.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:54.000
 And so, what they announced on their website was an award for Joseph Sepp Bellend Blatter.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.120
 That is it, that is all of our facts.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.600

 Thank you so much, Edinburgh.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
