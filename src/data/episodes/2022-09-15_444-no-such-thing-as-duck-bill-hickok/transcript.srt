2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,020
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,840
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Edinburgh.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,320
 [APPLAUSE] My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,000
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,760
 favorite facts from the last seven days.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,280
 And in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,720
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that when Dick Loss,

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,720
 the president of the Montana Cowboy Association,

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,280
 drove a car for the first time, he crashed it into a fence.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
 Because instead of using the brake pedal,

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,800
 he pulled back on the steering wheel and yelled, whoa!

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,360
 >> [LAUGH]

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,280
 >> Incredible.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,560
 >> [LAUGH]

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,640
 >> Lot to unpack.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,360
 >> So who was Dick Loss?

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,200
 >> He was the president of the Montana Cowboy Association.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,800
 >> [LAUGH]

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,080
 >> Cool.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,720
 >> A cowboy.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
 >> Who's a cowboy?

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,000
 And I found this because he's just been inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame in

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
 Montana.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,040
 >> Cool.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,080
 >> He was a male carrier.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,160
 >> Do you keep tabs on the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Montana?

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,520
 Every new person who's inducted, you know about it.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,480
 >> I do. >> He's got one of his phone,

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,880
 he's got one of those notifications.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
 >> [LAUGH]

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,800
 >> Do you want some other people who are in the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Montana?

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
 >> Yeah, yes, so.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
 >> Bob Fudge.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,240
 >> [LAUGH]

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,800
 >> Bob Fudge.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,520
 >> Bob Fudge.

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,720
 >> Oh no, the Fudge Gang are in town.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,400
 >> [LAUGH]

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,840
 >> It's just a funny cowboy name.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
 >> Bob Fudge, Fanny Steel.

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,000
 >> [LAUGH]

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,960
 >> Fanny Steel, yeah.

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,200
 >> Johnny Flowers, Carl Moss, Spud Creamer.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
 >> [LAUGH]

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,160
 >> Spud Creamer, Chief Sitting Bull, and

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,840
 the 1904 Fort Shore Indian School Girls Basketball Team.

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,640
 >> [LAUGH]

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,400
 >> Wow.

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
 >> Did you say Spud Creamer?

53
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
 >> Spud Creamer.

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,560
 >> [LAUGH]

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,920
 >> These are incredible.

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,960
 >> It's a great name, he was incredibly dull, I have to say.

57
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
 >> Really?

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
 >> I read all of the,

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
 because they have the biographies of all these people, and

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
 that's how I read this about Dick Loss.

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,080
 Basically, I found this Hall of Fame, and they had all the names.

62
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,960
 I don't know what drew me to Dick Loss, first of all, but I read his biography,

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,440
 and it had this amazing thing.

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,480
 But he was a male carrier, he was a cowboy.

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,720
 He lived in a place called Square Butte, and it's pronounced Square Butte.

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,800
 And every time we say the word But, it's spelled B-U-T-E.

67
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,920
 We get loads of people writing in from Montana or Wyoming saying,

68
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,620
 it's pronounced Butte, and I'm like, well, don't spell it like Butte then.

69
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,960
 >> Yeah, yeah, good point.

70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,920
 I was looking up the meaning of whoa, whoa.

71
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,480
 So there's some, I wouldn't go so far as to call it controversy.

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,840
 But a little bit of debate, I was reading horsejournals.com.

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,320
 Which is a great site, if you're into horses.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,680
 And Jack Ballew, who is, she's a horse trainer of many years experience.

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,200
 She wrote a piece about the meaning of whoa.

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,000
 And her contention is that by and large, it means nothing.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,040
 It means nothing at all.

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,520
 It's something for humans to say while they try and sort out the horse situation.

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
 Horse doesn't care.

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,160
 >> But it does have a meaning, doesn't it?

81
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,120
 >> It has a meaning, yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,360
 >> If you're running towards me and I say, whoa, you know what I mean.

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
 >> Yeah, but I'm not a horse and neither are you.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,120
 >> So it's, she says, the word whoa is used with zero purpose.

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,640
 This is in general, other than to fill silent air and

86
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,920
 give our busy human minds something to work over and repeat incessantly.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
 >> No. >> What is this person talking about?

88
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,480
 We all know that whoa means slow down or stop.

89
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,600
 This is person illiterate.

90
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,760
 >> She's a very experienced professional horse trainer.

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,720
 She said on some occasions it can really work if you say it just right.

92
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,320
 >> Well, then it fucking works.

93
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,280
 What is that?

94
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,280
 >> It's like, but in general, I can't believe I'm having to, in general,

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
 it means nothing. >> Ghost don't exist,

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
 except that one time when there was a genuine ghost.

97
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,680
 >> Jeez, most of the time when horse people say, whoa,

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
 they're just saying something to say, right?

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,720
 >> Let's not talk about this now.

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,680
 We'll take this backstage.

101
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,200
 >> Okay, anyway, anyway, that's a distraction.

102
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,800
 >> I did a bit of looking into cowboys and some of the cowboys that I love most

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 are movie cowboys, the sort of John Wayne and the Clint Eastwoods and so on.

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,040
 And some of the cowboys were genuine cowboys that then

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,640
 became movie stars.

106
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,720
 So they just found their way into Hollywood in the early days.

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
 So there's a guy called Louis Burton Lindley Jr.

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,200
 And he was a cowboy who got conscripted into the war.

109
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,360
 And the only reason he really got into the world of Hollywood was when he

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,280
 enlisted into the war, they said, what is your occupation?

111
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,640
 He said, rodeo.

112
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,720
 And the person went, radio, okay, and then they put him down and

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,920
 he did radio throughout the war.

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,360
 And he was like, this is pretty good. >> Well, after he'd done rodeo,

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
 rodeo is a very easy to sit on.

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
 >> So after the war, he was like, I really enjoyed that radio stuff.

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,560
 And then he went into movies like Blazing Saddles and stuff like that.

118
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
 >> Wow.

119
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,600
 >> And then there was another guy who was, he wasn't a real cowboy in real life.

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,440
 But James Arnes, and he was a famous actor in a TV show called Gunsmoke.

121
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,280
 And Gunsmoke was really big.

122
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,640
 During the war, his thing was, he was a really tall guy.

123
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,760
 And so as a result, as the tallest man in the outfit of his platoon,

124
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,560
 he was always sent down the ramp of a boat first to see how deep the water was.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,800
 >> [LAUGH]

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,440
 >> He was the measuring stick, the human measuring stick.

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,320
 >> Yeah, you mentioned John Wayne.

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,240
 Middle name Marion, if you didn't know, anyone out there.

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
 >> Didn't know.

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,160
 >> And didn't like it, didn't like the fact his middle name was Marion,

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,760
 because he liked to get a bit of a macho image.

132
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,940
 And he said he actually got bullied loads for it at school.

133
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,880
 His full name was John Marion Robert Morrison, I think.

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,720
 Sorry, his real first name was Marion, even worse.

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,960
 >> Yeah, this is a Johnny Cash song, basically.

136
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
 This is a boy named Sue.

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
 >> This is the boy named Marion, yeah.

138
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,400
 >> Is that where Johnny Cash got it from?

139
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,080
 Or is it?

140
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,160
 >> No. >> Okay.

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,520
 >> But he changed his name, and he's actually credited in some films as Duke.

142
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,040
 And he's often called Duke as a nickname.

143
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,960
 And that was after his family dog.

144
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,080
 And it was because he had this giant dog, this Airdale, who used to walk him to

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
 school every day when he was a boy, and they'd stop at the local fire station.

146
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,920
 And the fireman called him Little Duke, and his dog Big Duke.

147
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,600
 And so he had the name stuck.

148
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
 >> That's very cool.

149
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
 >> Yeah.

150
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
 >> Can I give you some more, Montanon cow people?

151
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
 >> Yeah, definitely.

152
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,840
 >> Hilda Redwing is recently in the Hall of Fame in Montana.

153
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,160
 She took part in a rodeo at the age of 90.

154
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,120
 And during the rodeo, one of her friends who was running it,

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,280
 his horse ran into her and broke her leg.

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,120
 And she carried on doing the rodeo with a broken leg at the age of 90.

157
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,360
 >> What?

158
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
 >> Isn't that amazing?

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,760
 >> Was she riding a bull or anything?

160
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,360
 >> No, it was like a relatively calm horse.

161
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
 >> Okay, okay.

162
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,800
 >> Still amazing.

163
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,440
 >> And I mentioned the 1904 Fort Shore Indian School Girls basketball team.

164
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
 >> Yeah.

165
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,800
 >> And they went to the St. Louis World's Fair, and they spent five months there

166
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
 as part of the anthropological exhibit that they did at that same time,

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,840
 where they brought lots of Native Americans in to do stuff.

168
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,680
 And during that, they started playing basketball against all comers.

169
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,840
 And they beat anyone who came.

170
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,200
 And so they were named champions of the world.

171
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
 >> Wow.

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,560
 >> That's great.

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,320
 >> It's like a world.

174
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,640
 >> And why does that get you into the Cowboy Hall of Fame?

175
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,120
 >> I think really they were short of people.

176
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,800
 >> Yeah.

177
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,680
 >> [LAUGH]

178
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,280
 >> Tough year.

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,880
 >> They didn't, you know, they weren't in a shoot up, they didn't win a duel.

180
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,000
 >> Have you guys heard, in Alaska, there are cowboys who ride helicopters instead of horses?

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
 >> Yeah, that's cool.

182
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,560
 >> When you say ride.

183
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,520
 >> Well, they don't.

184
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,040
 Obviously, yeah.

185
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
 >> They're not spinning around on the-

186
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,200
 >> It's like- >> Definitely looking at some tick loss there, aren't you?

187
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,080
 >> [LAUGH]

188
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,160
 >> No, they round their cows up with helicopters.

189
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,400
 But I didn't even know there were Alaskan cowboys.

190
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,040
 >> No. >> And Hawaiian cowboys as well.

191
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
 Which is a very famous thing in America.

192
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,080
 >> Yeah, they're bloody everywhere, aren't they?

193
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,960
 >> Yeah. >> And in fact, American US cowboys really

194
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,920
 nicked all of their gear, all of their cliches, all of their hats, their coats,

195
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,600
 their everything from Mexico.

196
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,080
 So they're based on Mexican vaqueros.

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
 And in fact, the word buckaroo, I didn't know, comes from vaquero.

198
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
 >> Wow, really?

199
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,200
 >> Yeah. >> And we get so many words all come from

200
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,840
 those Mexican cowboys.

201
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,560
 So lasso, bronco, chaps, as in you're wearing chaps, not high chaps.

202
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,680
 >> [LAUGH]

203
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,040
 >> Yeah, and gouchos as well, the Argentinian version,

204
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,640
 which I always think of the coolest.

205
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,560
 The thing I like about gouchos, so Argentinian and Uruguayan cowboys,

206
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,160
 is that they, again, they're just really cool cattle herders.

207
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,120
 It seems like if you're in the Americas and you're herding cattle,

208
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
 you become really cool.

209
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,920
 And they were really fussy about the color of their horses.

210
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
 And if you're a proper goucho, all of your horses have to be perfectly color

211
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,960
 matched.

212
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,320
 And so you get pibled horses, like white with black splodges.

213
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,880
 But you want the black splodges as perfectly matched as possible to each other.

214
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,560
 >> Really?

215
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,520
 >> Yeah, it's cool.

216
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,000
 Apparently it was so that if your herds got mixed up,

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,840
 you could tell which ones were yours.

218
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 >> Wazers.

219
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
 >> Yeah. >> That's very cool.

220
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
 >> I think like a quarter of the cowboys,

221
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
 what we would call them now were not whites, right?

222
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,200
 >> Yeah. >> In the time of the cowboy,

223
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,840
 basically, in the post-Civil War time.

224
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,480
 And actually the word cowboy would be mostly used for

225
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,840
 African-American cowhands.

226
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,120
 Like the white people would be called cowhands, and

227
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,280
 it was kind of a bit of a slur to say boy, do you know what I mean?

228
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,440
 >> It was kind of diminutive. >> Yeah, exactly, yeah.

229
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
 >> Wow, interesting.

230
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,920
 >> I didn't realize how short the Wild West was after the Civil War,

231
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,040
 before about 1900.

232
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,760
 That was it.

233
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
 >> Yeah. >> It was a really brief period.

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,640
 >> Right. >> Here's a mind blowing thing.

235
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,400
 Cowboys basically invented dust in America.

236
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,440
 The reason that America is dusty is because of cowboys.

237
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
 >> Really? >> Yeah.

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,000
 So there's been this guy, Jason Neff, he's a geochemist.

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,720
 I hadn't heard of that.

240
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,000
 He studied the sediments laid down in various mountains in Colorado.

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,160
 And he looked at the sediments that had been laid down in the lakes and

242
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,920
 things like that.

243
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,240
 And he found there was basically no dust in America for 5000 years.

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
 And the soil had this, it was vegetation, it had this crust,

245
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
 this nice thick crust on it, right?

246
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
 >> Yeah. >> No dust blowing around.

247
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
 1860, the rates suddenly shoot up of dust in the atmosphere.

248
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
 And it's because the cows had arrived, they stripped the grass.

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,560
 And then their feet, their big clumping hooves broke through this gorgeous crust.

250
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,800
 And as a result.

251
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,640
 >> It must have been nice, when you first go through that crust.

252
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
 Like breaking into a crème brûlée.

253
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,760
 >> That's the least cowboy thing you've ever said.

254
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,400
 >> [LAUGH]

255
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
 >> That bloody hell.

256
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,000
 >> But we have dust, I get dust in my house, right?

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
 >> That's nothing to do with the cowboys, you're right.

258
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,120
 That's pre-existing dust, that's, yeah, yeah.

259
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,400
 I just mean that the reason America is-

260
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,520
 >> So basically apart from that one example, this is true.

261
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,640
 >> [LAUGH]

262
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,300
 >> Yeah, exactly.

263
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,440
 >> Just on names, Dick Loss, a friend of mine who's actually in

264
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,320
 the crowd tonight, Shona, sent this ridiculous fact.

265
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
 I can't believe that it's true.

266
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,580
 >> Any fact that comes from a friend of yours.

267
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,080
 No, I meant Shona.

268
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,600
 But there's some skepticism in the room.

269
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,880
 >> [LAUGH]

270
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,920
 >> So Wild Bill Hickok, right?

271
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,440
 So the name Wild Bill, this really kick-ass name, scared people.

272
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,600
 He was just like this beautiful, amazing cowboy.

273
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,640
 Supposedly, the reason he got it is not because he was this incredible cowboy who

274
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,120
 could do dangerous things, is because his face, his nose and

275
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
 mouth look slightly like a duck.

276
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,480
 And- >> No.

277
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,600
 >> And Wild Bill is the bill of a duck.

278
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,800
 But, and so he was sort of bullied, this is Shona's fact.

279
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,000
 He was sort of bullied by his buddies, and then he changed it to be like,

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,640
 no, I'm really cool and wild.

281
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,360
 >> His brother was called Tame Bill Hickok, wasn't he?

282
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,120
 >> Yes.

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
 >> So did he have a face that looked like a normal duck's beak?

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
 >> [LAUGH]

285
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,920
 >> I will bet a decent number of doubloons that that is not true.

286
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,120
 >> Okay, using a pirate currency, apparently, now?

287
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,240
 >> [LAUGH]

288
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,480
 >> Pirate's Cowboys.

289
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,720
 Sorry, what's it called, cowboy currency?

290
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,920
 >> Like gold nuggets.

291
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,840
 There you go, that's what I'll bet, I'm sorry.

292
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,180
 >> You'd wager your parrot on it, wouldn't you, Anna?

293
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,120
 >> [LAUGH]

294
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
 >> I'm gonna have to move us on in a sec, guys, we gotta move on.

295
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,840
 >> The Cowboys all went on strike in 1883, which I think is a very funny-

00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,360
 >> [LAUGH]

297
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,800
 >> Okay, there was a cowboy strike in 1883.

298
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,480
 >> Well, they had very good unions, the Cowboys.

299
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,000
 >> Right.

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
 >> Peter, how to let Jeremy carbon in?

302
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
 >> Yeah.

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,680
 >> If you're equating the striking bin men with these Cowboys,

304
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,560
 that's very fluttering to them, but we're all about the Cowboys here, and

305
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,960
 their unions- >> And pirates, don't forget the pirates.

306
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,680
 >> And pirates, also very strong unions.

307
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,040
 They were called the Turtles, they were the original Turtles, Cowboy unions.

308
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,200
 >> The original Turtles.

309
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,920
 >> Yeah.

 >> [LAUGH]

311
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
 >> What were they called, Turtles, do we know?

312
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,480
 >> They were called Turtles, it was the Rodeo's Union, and so it was in response

313
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,480
 to bad-paying stuff, and they were called Turtles, because the idea is they're,

314
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,000
 I don't know why they're proud of this, but they're slow to organise,

315
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,560
 but once they do, they're unafraid to stick their neck out.

317
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,640

 >> I don't know if that's what you want.

319
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
 >> Kind of good.

320
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,760
 >> Yeah. >> I thought that when Turtles were afraid,

321
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,360
 they didn't stick their neck out.

322
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,600
 >> I think that might be true as well.

323
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,240
 I don't know how much they knew about naturalism, the Cowboys.

 >> It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

326
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,040
 >> My fact this week is that until the 19th century, if someone shouted,

327
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,160
 stop thief, you had no choice but to try and stop the thief.

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,240
 >> [LAUGH]

329
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,680
 >> Cool.

330
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,280
 >> You were legally obliged on pain of being arrested and

331
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,640
 facing a penalty to chase the thief.

332
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,360
 >> But with the crowd who were trying to stop the thief,

333
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,240
 if you didn't join in, does some of the crowd then start chasing you?

334
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,760
 >> Yeah, good point.

335
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,440
 Stop non-thief stopper.

336
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,000
 >> Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,880
 >> Well, there was a time in, this was in 1760,

338
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,760
 there was a Jewish second hand clothes dealer, and he followed this,

339
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
 what was known as hue and cry.

340
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,520
 And he was faster than everyone else, so he got at the front of the group, and

341
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,480
 then they thought that he was the one who was- >> No.

342
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
 >> And so they grabbed him and arrested him.

343
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,520
 >> My God.

344
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,440
 >> That's like a scene out of life of Brian.

345
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,960
 >> Yes, but that's a really good point.

346
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,880
 What was the policing of that situation?

347
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,080
 Because you've suddenly got potentially one criminal and then 30 criminals.

348
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
 >> Yes, so I do think the crime of not stopping the thief wasn't as large as

349
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,400
 the crime of being the thief.

350
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,000
 So your priority is still to chase the thief, but I think after you'd given chase

351
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 and you'd caught the thief, you can mention to the constable, by the way,

352
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,440
 the old Angela who lives next door didn't even give chase, so.

353
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,080
 >> Well, one reason was if you didn't chase them and they got away,

354
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,520
 you became liable for the robberies, so you might have to pay money for

355
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,960
 the person who got the robberies.

356
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,600
 >> Wait, if I just don't chase, because I'm halfway through doing something,

357
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,320
 I'm liable for the stuff- >> Like a Sudoku or something.

358
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,400
 >> Yeah, I'll have to do my Sudoku, and then I don't join the hue and cry.

359
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,360
 I'm then on the hook for the theft.

360
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,320
 >> You wouldn't go to prison for the theft, but you might have to pay some

361
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,640
 recompense to the person- >> Well, I refuse to pay, that's outrageous.

362
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,840
 >> Well, then you are going to prison.

363
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
 >> Yeah, prison.

364
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,640
 >> Then I'll maybe have a bit of peace and

365
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,160
 bloody quiet to do my Sudoku.

366
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
 >> [LAUGH]

367
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
 >> Everyone's won.

368
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,680
 >> Wow. >> You're going shopping must have been so

369
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,840
 stressful back in the day.

370
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,360
 >> [LAUGH]

371
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,560
 >> Yeah, well, this is what if it makes you guys feel better,

372
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,720
 Dan and Andy, because I can see you're having trouble with this.

373
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,400
 There were also penalties for raising a false hue and cry for exactly this reason,

374
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,520
 because it was acknowledged that people would be busy working in the farms or

375
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,520
 doing Sudoku, and so it could interrupt the village economy.

376
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,320
 Every time you shouted, stop thief.

377
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,680
 So you did get in trouble for doing it falsely.

378
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,400
 As some people did, I think there was one person who raised a hue and

379
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,360
 cry on his dog, I believe.

380
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,760
 I think this is in the 15th century, and it was found his dog was chasing some sheep.

381
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,400
 And so he did the stop thief, or the stop done my dog's chasing sheep hue and cry.

382
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
 >> Right. >> And he was fine for that.

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,920
 >> You know the descendants of Sigmund Freud,

384
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,840
 Lucian Freud, Clement Freud, a big broadcaster and an artist.

385
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,080
 When they were younger, they were going through a park, and

386
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,920
 they decided to challenge each other who could run faster to the destination they

387
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,480
 were getting to, and they both convinced that they were gonna be the person that

388
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,160
 could do it.

389
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,880
 So they started running, and as they were going, Clement took over,

390
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,320
 was going much faster, and so Lucian went, stop thief, he's taken my money.

391
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,240
 And he was grabbed by Pastor Byes, who stopped him.

392
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,200
 And Clement was so pissed off with him that the two of them barely spoke for

393
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
 the rest of their life.

394
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,120
 That was the incident.

395
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,040
 >> I knew they hated each other.

396
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,480
 >> Lucian didn't even go to his funeral.

397
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,640
 >> No way.

398
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
 >> They hated each other.

399
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,360
 >> Because of that, what?

400
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,280
 >> That was the biggie.

401
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,600
 That's what everyone says, well, it all comes back down to the stop thief moment.

402
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,200
 When he did that, he said- >> You should have made his tombstone,

403
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,680
 boy, you've stopped now, haven't you?

404
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,360
 >> Nice.

405
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,840
 >> That would be good.

406
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,880
 >> You didn't always have to shout stop thief, there are a few other things you

407
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,280
 might shout.

408
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,920
 In Scotland, sometimes you would shout, oh, yay.

409
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:55,680
 In Wales, you might shout, hubbub, and in Gloucestershire,

410
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,720
 you might shout, utestes.

411
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,240
 >> Isn't it like, you parabolics, you've nick my purse.

412
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,600
 >> It's U-T-E-S-T-E-S, utestes.

413
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,240
 >> Right, utestes.

414
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
 >> Okay.

415
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
 >> Sounds like a Greek philosopher, doesn't it?

416
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
 Utestes.

417
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 >> Yes.

418
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,280
 >> He's just bouncing out a lot of bollocks all the time, yeah.

419
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 >> It's really interesting.

420
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,680
 I think, so there was this thing.

421
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,440
 There was a magazine, the magazine is putting it a bit strong.

422
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,440
 It was a kind of a one sheet thing in the 1770s that was run by the Bow Street Magistrate

423
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,000
 in London, and it was full of unsolved crimes and details of criminals, and it was called

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,560
 general hue and cry, and it was distributed across the country, and it was a way of catching

425
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,080
 criminals, it was basically like an extremely long distance hue and cry.

426
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,960
 You'd say this person has stolen this, and they look like this, so if you see them, please

427
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
 pick them up, and it worked.

428
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,880
 Even in the 1770s, people were being picked up hundreds of miles away for crimes they

429
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
 committed.

430
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,200
 >> It just feels like being a civilian was a full-time job in those days.

431
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,120
 You have to constantly, because again, it wasn't just that you had to give chase when

432
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
 people cried.

433
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,880
 You had to if you read it in the magazine, and also by the 17th century.

434
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,320
 >> Sorry, what do you mean if you read it in the magazine?

435
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,160
 >> No, you didn't have to chase when you read it in the magazine.

436
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,680
 People desperately tried not to look at magazines, because then they're legally obliged.

437
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,020
 >> It made it very hard to do the Sudoku, didn't it?

438
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,600
 >> But warrants would be passed from parish to parish, so let's say you're looking for

439
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,160
 a thief, then you go to the next parish, and you give them a picture, a drawing of the

440
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,680
 criminal and a description of them, and you say, "Can you spread this around your parish?"

441
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,080
 And then everyone in that parish is obliged to keep an eye out for them.

442
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,040
 So I don't know how anyone held down a job.

443
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,000
 >> They had delayed hue and cry in the Scottish borders as well.

444
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,760
 The reason being that you would have a lot of people from England coming over and trying

445
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,400
 to steal people's sheep and belongings and stuff like that.

446
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,000
 And often what you would do is because they were armed, these people, it's a bit the Wild

447
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,240
 West really, and so you might kind of hide in your hedge or kind of just try and get

448
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,040
 all of your really expensive belongings and go there.

449
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 >> In the hedge.

450
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
 >> In the hedge, yeah.

451
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
 >> Yeah.

452
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
 >> Anywhere really.

453
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
 >> All your sheep in the hedge.

454
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
 Entire block of sheep, one hedge.

455
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,440
 >> And then someone comes out with a hedge trimmer and you go, "Oh, no!"

456
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,240
 So you would hide often because they were armed.

457
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,480
 And so there's a special border law where you're allowed to do a counter raid as long

458
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,800
 as it was within the six days.

459
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,120
 You still had to shout hue and cry as you went.

460
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,600
 And you had to carry a lighted torch so that everyone knew you were on a legitimate return

461
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
 mission.

462
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
 >> That's amazing.

463
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
 >> Wow.

464
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
 >> Yeah.

465
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,840
 >> And then they had to join you on that.

466
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,920
 >> No, that was just you getting your own back from the Cumbrians.

467
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
 >> Got it.

468
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 Fair enough.

469
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,360
 >> And these days, if you shout stop thief, you can get in trouble.

470
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,040
 There's quite a few people who have sued, like, shop security because they've shouted

471
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
 stop thief.

472
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,960
 And they're like, "Well, I'm not a thief," and everyone's heard that, and everyone's

473
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
 going to think that now.

474
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
 >> Yeah.

475
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,880
 >> There was a guy in Dublin, he was 28 years old, and he claimed that he'd been wrongly

476
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,480
 accused of shoplifting a toy duck from a toy store.

477
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,680
 He basically said he was deeply embarrassed and ashamed when a security guard approached

478
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,560
 me and said, "Where is the duck?

479
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,560
 I know you have it."

480
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:19,880
 >> And the best part about it was they went to court, and they brought out the duck as

481
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,000
 evidence, and it was a talking duck, and they couldn't turn it off.

482
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,600
 All the way through the court case, this duck was just talking all the way through.

483
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,960
 >> Are you sure it was a talking duck and not Wild Bill Hickok sitting in the court?

484
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,240
 I've heard they're identical.

485
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,040
 Do you guys know the bloody code?

486
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
 >> No.

487
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
 >> The bloody code.

488
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,880
 >> Is that like a penal code, and you could be effectively executed for lots and lots

489
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
 and lots of crimes?

490
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,680
 >> It's pretty much, yeah, dropping a handkerchief.

491
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
 Yeah.

492
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
 Yeah.

493
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,600
 This is in England, so Scotland tended to have a bit of a more, we might say better,

494
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,520
 we might say more lenient legal system in sort of later medieval time where you didn't

495
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,320
 get the death penalty for everything, but in England there was the bloody code, which

496
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,600
 was the English legal system from the 17th to the early 19th century, and I hadn't realised

497
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,160
 how many crimes you could be killed for, so there were over 200 crimes that were added

498
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,200
 to this code.

499
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,040
 Crimes you could be executed for included damaging orchards or gardens, cutting down trees on

500
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,040
 an avenue, destroying a turnpike road, wrecking a fish pond.

501
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,400
 >> I've got to say, Anna, I'm agreeing with all of this at the moment.

502
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
 If I owned a fish pond, I would...

503
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,280
 >> You're very so proprietary about your garden, aren't you?

504
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 >> Wow.

505
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,040
 But there was this thing where if you were done for a crime and the jury thought, oh,

506
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,120
 we don't really want this person to be literally hanged to death, they would return at what

507
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,560
 was called a partial verdict, and they'd say he's guilty, but not as guilty as the judge

508
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,640
 is trying to make out.

509
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,040
 So there was this thing called grand larceny, if you stole something worth more than a shilling,

510
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,120
 that was the death penalty for you.

511
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,240
 So a shilling is not a huge amount of money even then, but what juries would sometimes

512
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,660
 do is they would return a verdict of not grand larceny, but petty larceny.

513
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,040
 So in 1751, for example, there was a crime where the accused had stolen a pound and seven

514
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,480
 shillings and sixpence, definitely way above the barrier for being hanged, but the jury

515
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,720
 said, we think those coins were actually only worth seven pence, so as a result, you get

516
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
 off.

517
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
 So that meant fewer executions.

518
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,760
 >> Well, you say Anna about them being a bit more lenient in Scotland is mostly true,

519
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,000
 but then after the reformation, the law was sort of done by the Kirk, by the church, and

520
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,600
 they started bringing in laws for quite a lot of things that we would be surprised about

521
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 today.

522
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,000
 So there were statues of 1661 in Scotland that said that if a child beat or cursed, either

523
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,080
 their father or mother, they should be put to death without mercy.

524
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 >> Oh.

525
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
 >> Yeah.

526
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 >> My numbers first.

527
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,440
 >> If you were found guilty of the vice of, this is the exact words, filthy fornication,

528
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,560
 you would get a fine of 40 pounds, 40 Scottish pounds, which in those days was absolutely

529
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
 enormous.

530
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,340
 And in 1697, as late as then, there was a guy in Edinburgh called Thomas Aikenhead.

531
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:24,080
 He was hanged for declaring that theology was a rhapsody of ill-invented nonsense.

532
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
 >> Oh.

533
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,020
 >> He was hanged for that.

534
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
 >> Yeah.

535
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,600
 It wasn't, you know, the Norwegian today, it was slightly more lenient.

536
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,360
 >> I was reading about, there's a classic book that was written by a guy called Havlock

537
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,180
 Ellis, and it's all about the study of what a criminal, the makeup of a criminal, and

538
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,920
 this was during Victorian times.

539
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,080
 >> Like the face was supposed to look different if you were a criminal.

540
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
 >> Exactly.

541
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,200
 So there was a guy called Salsotto who was someone who paid particular attention to

542
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,180
 different bits of the body to see if that, and he found, he believes that you're more

543
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:02,160
 likely to be a criminal as a woman if you have a hairy anus.

544
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,760
 >> All right, so from a show of hands, ladies.

545
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,040
 >> She said hands.

546
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:18,840
 >> That is a terrible episode of "Cry Watch," isn't it?

547
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,240
 We've done a recreation of the cry.

548
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
 >> Is that part of the search?

549
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,640
 Like who's the criminal?

550
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
 That's, yeah.

551
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,120
 Has everyone shaved their anus before we commit this crime?

552
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,620
 We don't want anyone caught.

553
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,760
 But so he found it basically in seven out of 40 women that he studied.

554
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
 >> Seven out of 40.

555
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
 >> Who were criminals.

556
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
 >> Right.

557
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
 >> Had a hairy anus.

558
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,280
 >> It's not a huge proportion.

559
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,120
 >> It's enough that it made him write it down.

560
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,520
 >> Did he study 40 non-criminals as well?

561
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
 Was there any control group in this experiment?

562
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 >> Yeah.

563
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 All right.

564
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 Okay.

565
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,760
 >> Do we know the proportion of women that have under normal circumstances according

566
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
 to him hairy anuses?

567
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
 >> That's what I'm saying.

568
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,880
 >> Do we know what counts as a hairy anus?

569
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 >> Yeah.

570
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,080
 Where's the anusometer of, you know.

571
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,880
 >> How rigorous was this study?

572
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
 Was it peer reviewed?

573
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,960
 >> It sounds like he wasn't a proper scientist at all.

574
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,400
 >> This is in Victorian London.

575
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
 >> Oh, Victorian London.

576
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 >> Yeah.

577
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 >> Fine.

578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 >> Okay.

579
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 >> There was no science.

580
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,160
 And I kept reading it because it's a lot about hair.

581
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,040
 Like does hair mean you're a criminal?

582
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,360
 I'm a really hairy guy.

583
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
 You can probably see from the audience.

584
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,600
 >> We can't see all of you.

585
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
 >> But I am a really hairy guy.

586
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,960
 And so I was reading on.

587
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,080
 And it said it's worthwhile pointing out that there are frequent anomalies in the development

588
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,600
 of hair among idiots.

589
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,120
 >> It's the hair.

590
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
 That's what it is.

591
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 >> But yeah.

592
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,160
 So any hairy anus women out there?

593
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
 >> Stop.

594
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,360
 >> We're watching it.

595
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,560
 >> Oh, my God.

596
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,520
 >> Good grief.

597
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:09,320
 >> It is time for fact number three.

598
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,600
 And that is Andy.

599
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,840
 >> My fact is that in 2016, scientists found a pocket of helium so big that it could make

600
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,260
 everyone on the planet sound squeaky for 20 minutes.

601
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,480
 >> I mean, what great use of that helium.

602
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
 >> Incredible.

603
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,200
 We would have had such a good time.

604
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,720
 And then actually later on, they upgraded the estimate they thought and it would have

605
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,040
 been 40 minutes.

606
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,640
 We could all have been squeaky for 40 minutes, everyone.

607
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,240
 I'm sure that would have had quite serious health consequences for everybody, breathing

608
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,560
 non-oxygen for 40 minutes.

609
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,000
 But nonetheless, this massive, massive amount, and this is the thing of helium is we're always

610
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,720
 running out of it and then suddenly always discovering more.

611
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 >> Yeah.

612
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 >> And it's just this constant sea salt.

613
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
 >> Where is this pocket?

614
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,120
 >> This was in Tanzania.

615
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
 >> Okay.

616
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
 >> Under the ground, presumably.

617
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,460
 >> It's in an area called Rukwa in Tanzania.

618
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,680
 And Rukwa is also the place which has the largest number of crocodiles in the whole

619
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
 of Tanzania.

620
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:12,120
 And the interesting thing about that is if you give a crocodile helium, its voice doesn't

621
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,800
 go higher, it goes lower.

622
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800

 >> Really?

624
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,560
 >> I remember we did it on QI and it's weird because the same thing is happening to, I think,

625
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,360
 is it the timbre of your voice that helium changes rather than the pitch?

626
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
 >> Exactly.

627
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360

 >> Yeah.

629
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,560
 >> So you'd think that a crocodile sounded like us, like it's going higher, but when

630
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,200
 the timbre of a crocodile's voice gets higher, it sounds to us deeper, so they sound more

658
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,000
 running out of helium, and it was a big problem because we use it for MRI machines, we use

659
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,640
 it for all sorts of important stuff, not just balloons, and we were running out of it, and

660
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,480
 the price was getting higher and higher and higher, and this was the first time we'd ever

661
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,240
 really looked for it, and they started looking and they found shitloads of it, and so they

662
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,800
 think that maybe if we keep looking, we might find a lot more, and in fact, in 2017, some

663
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,720
 scientists at the University of Edinburgh found a huge amount of helium in the middle

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
 >> Oh, okay.

683
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
 >> This week.

684
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
 This is really thrilling.

685
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
 >> This week?

686
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
 Well, you would say they would come in those kind of canisters, right?

687
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 >> Yep.

688
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
 Yep.

689
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 >> A big one of those --

690
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
 >> It's even bigger than that.

691
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 >> By weight?

692
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
 Because --

693
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,440
 >> Well, it's -- I'm going to tell you by volume and by length.

694
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
 So --

695
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
 >> Okay.

696
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,240
 >> So we could work out the width of the depths from that.

697
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
 >> This is GCSE math.

698
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,880
 >> And you've just got a GCSE math.

699
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
 Yeah.

700
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,400
 No, the USA have just announced -- this is really thrilling stuff.

701
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,200
 They are just announcing they are selling off the entire federal helium system because

702
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,160
 they nationalized it really early on, like in the 1920 or so, because they needed airships.

703
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,440
 So they said we have to -- the government has to control the global supply, but we can

704
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
 now get in on it.

705
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
 That's great news.

706
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,320
 So if they decided we don't really need airships anymore, so we might as well come in.

707
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 >> I don't know.

708
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,840
 >> That was -- the Hindenburg wasn't able to use helium because of that global monopoly

709
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
 was --

710
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
 >> Exactly.

711
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 Yeah.

712
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
 >> Exactly that.

713
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
 >> Did you -- sorry, Andy, did you tell us the size of this?

714
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 >> Actually, I didn't.

715
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
 Thank you very much, James.

716
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 So --

717
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,600
 >> I could just tell that everyone in the room was like, "But, Andy, what is the length

718
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,760
 and the volume?"

719
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,520
 >> It includes -- thank you, James -- 700 kilometers of helium pipelines which are spread across

720
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,200
 Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, but I'm sure they can move them for an extra fee.

721
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,920
 There's the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir, a 4,000-hectare rock formation, capped -- you'll

722
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,400
 be glad to know -- by two layers of non-porous calcium and hydrite, and it is likely to contain

723
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,880
 65 million cubic meters of federally-owned crude helium.

724
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,520
 >> And are they going to deliver this in convenient packages, or do they just say it's there,

725
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
 get it yourself?

726
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,000
 >> Because you can't come, and you know, like if you go to a supermarket and they say

727
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,320
 you do want a bag, and you're like, "Well, I think I can fit it in these pockets."

728
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,120
 You can't do that with that much helium, can you?

729
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
 >> No, no, no.

730
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,600
 I'm not sure who's going to buy it or what for.

731
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,560
 >> Well, we might for helium airships, because, bizarrely, the UK has just decided to start

732
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
 investing in them again.

733
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
 >> Really?

734
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
 >> Yeah.

735
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,640
 After a bit of a hiatus, and it's air nostrum, the -- it's a sister airline of BA, and it's

736
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,440
 just put in a massive order for some helium airships, and, in fact, this venture is backed

737
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,360
 by Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson, who I think he's pretty into flying, isn't

738
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
 he?

739
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
 >> He's a pilot, yeah.

740
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
 >> There you go.

741
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
 That's why he's into flying.

742
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,920
 So, he's into this idea, and the idea is that it slashes a lot of carbon use, because we

743
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,920
 could use them instead of aeroplanes, it'll slash carbon use by 90%.

744
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,960
 I liked the fact that quasi-quarting, the business secretary said, "This is proof of

745
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,640
 how the UK's businesses are embracing new technology."

746
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,360
 Anyway, a prototype crash landed in 2016 on its second test, but it is going to be great,

747
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
 we're told.

748
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
 >> Oh, boy.

749
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
 Wow, that's so good.

750
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:57,160
 >> Who would win, this is an open question, in a conflict between an airship and a submarine?

751
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,120
 >> Well, it depends where the conflict takes place.

752
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,280
 >> Fair play.

753
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,080
 >> Let's make it a neutral territory, let's make it above water.

754
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,000
 You've got all the environments there apart from land, it's not on land.

755
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 >> Because this has happened.

756
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 >> Oh, has it?

757
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 >> Yeah.

758
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,400
 >> Specifically, though, as in they were pitted against each other.

759
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,640
 >> No, it was during the Second World War, there wasn't time to set up like fun...

760
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,800
 >> It wasn't like Robot Wars.

761
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,680
 >> It wasn't pay-per-view, airship versus submarine, okay.

762
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,360
 >> So there were loads of US ships near the coast, which were sunk by German submarines

763
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,080
 during the war, and there were ships which went in convoys that were protected by airships.

764
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,640
 You've got a ship on the sea, then an airship above it protecting because they can see when

765
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,400
 a submarine is approaching, they can detect it, and then drop depth charges.

766
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,560
 You ordinarily wouldn't hit one, but it would just force the submarine to go lower and not

767
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,840
 use its torpedoes, and of the 90,000 ships that were in convoys escorted by airships,

768
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,400
 only one of them was ever sunk, but in 1943, a submarine fought a U-boat and the submarine

769
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
 won.

770
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
 >> Really?

771
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
 >> Yeah.

772
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
 >> And what did it do?

773
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
 >> Sorry, a submarine fought a U-boat, do you say?

774
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,040
 >> Yep, I got that wrong.

775
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,080
 That would have been a completely ordinary thing to happen in 1943.

776
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,120
 >> It's not the best fact you've ever had.

777
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:29,040
 >> I did a submarine fight against an airship, how did they shoot it, like torpedoes wouldn't

778
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,740
 go in the air, right?

779
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,240
 >> The account is quite vague on the method used.

780
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,280
 I'm sure it wasn't a torpedo, but I think I might have been firing from the surface,

781
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,880
 because I think I might have had surface guns.

782
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,280
 >> I can't believe you don't know the answer.

783
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,120
 >> I know, I'm sorry, I don't know who won, I just don't have a fucking match report,

784
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,920
 you know, I'm sorry not to know.

785
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,880
 >> If you take some helium and freeze it down to pretty much absolute zero just above it,

786
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,160
 and you put it in a teacup, and you start stirring it, and you go away, and you come

787
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,080
 back a million years later, it will still be stirring.

788
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
 >> What?

789
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
 >> That's so spooky.

790
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
 >> I know.

791
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,520
 >> It has no friction, doesn't it?

792
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
 >> Exactly.

793
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,520
 >> It's like this amazing capacity, but only when it's right and you're absolute zero.

794
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,120
 >> It's because it doesn't go, like most things as they get colder, if you remember, from

795
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,960
 your GCSE chemistry, they turn into solids, helium doesn't turn into a solid no matter

796
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,120
 how cold it gets, unless you put it under loads and loads of pressure, and so it just

797
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,320
 has these amazing properties, like a superconductor would.

798
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,760
 >> It also, if you leave it in a glass and you bring it right down, A, it'll fall through

799
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:42,320
 the glass, so like because, because it doesn't undergo friction at all, every tiny molecule

800
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,840
 sized hole in your glass, like I'm holding a glass now, there are molecule sized holes

801
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,960
 in it, most liquids stay in that because friction is holding them in, helium, when it's liquid,

802
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,200
 will just slip through, and it will climb up the sides of the glass, because gravity

803
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,760
 doesn't work the same way, gravity's not strong enough to hold it down, it's magic.

804
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,560
 Can I quickly tell you my favourite helium story I've ever read?

805
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:12,280
 1999, headline was, helium blew women up like a balloon, she was fine, by the way, I just

806
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:22,320
 said the solid lips, she wasn't fine, she had a bad day, she was called, she was called

807
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,080
 Samantha Munn, she owned a toy shop, she was standing on a stepladder in her toy shop,

808
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:34,320
 she slipped off, and she was speared by the metal spike, which was in a helium tank, in

809
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,160
 her left thigh, thank God for that, and she looked down and she saw her left thigh and

810
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,280
 her stomach inflate like a balloon, they managed to get her to a hospital, where they extracted

811
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:58,920
 her from the helium tank, did she just kind of go, around the room, we don't have any

812
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,280
 beds for this patient, we'll just rubber it against your head and stick it to the wall.

813
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,800
 Wouldn't it be great as well, because this was in a toy shop where they sell balloons

814
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,800
 to the brand of kid, can I get this mum, for an hour she's been walking around the shopping

815
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
 mall.

816
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,520
 This is just the kind of joke she dreaded happening after this story.

817
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
 She's fine now, right?

818
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,040
 She's fine, they said a doctor x-rayed her left thigh, which showed that it was about

819
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,440
 twice the size of her right, which I would argue you could tell without an x-ray.

820
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:40,840
 Time for our final fact for the show, and that is my fact.

821
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:48,240
 My fact this week is if you look up humour on Wikipedia, the first thing you'll see

822
00:37:48,240 --> 00:38:07,560
 is a picture of my face, and this is something that as of the 21st of August, someone changed

823
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,440
 the photo on the article for humour, and very randomly they don't know who I am, they've

824
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,240
 made that very clear in their comment, going, I have no idea who this person is, if anyone's

825
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,760
 got a better picture, please replace it, but it hasn't been replaced, and I now find myself

826
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,240
 the global face of humour.

827
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,560
 And in the photo, it's not just me, there's someone else, so the wording, the caption

828
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,560
 underneath is a viewer brackets Jimmy Wales left laughing at a comedian, Dan Schreiber

829
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,480
 right performing stand-up comedian, if you don't know who Jimmy Wales is, Jimmy Wales

830
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:53,600
 is the creator of Wikipedia, which is basically like making God laugh, right?

831
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,120
 So this is a very exciting development.

832
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,840
 I imagine God's laughing a lot when he's looking over at you.

833
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,640
 Now that is really cool.

834
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,120
 I don't know, if you ever needed evidence that Wikipedia's an unreliable source, I think

835
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,840
 you're looking at it.

836
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,280
 I wasn't there on this day, Dan.

837
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
 You weren't?

838
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
 So why are you not in the picture, Andy?

839
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,760
 I don't know, but I did look up the Wikipedia for Wanker recently, and very upsettingly,

840
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,840
 no, no, no, but this was a thing called Wikimania, where they sort of have an annual conference

841
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,600
 all about Wikipedia and Wikipedians, and they have seminars, and they have fun quizzes,

842
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,400
 and yeah, Andy and I were actually at the Edinburgh Fringe when it was on, it was down

843
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,360
 in London, and I had this idea called Wikipedia the missing bits, and the idea was to do a

844
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,980
 stand-up show where a comedian would come up and present a set on a missing page on Wikipedia

845
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,600
 and their pitch for what should be involved in it, and Jimmy Wales came up, and actually

846
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,560
 Jimmy came on stage with you, Andy, and did a quiz.

847
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,320
 Yeah, yeah, no one apparently took a fucking photo.

848
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,640
 Didn't you try to edit Wikipedia on the way down to say something about yourself?

849
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,240
 No, there was a comedian who was on the show that day called Steve Cross, who was complaining

850
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,960
 that he doesn't have a Wikipedia page, so I created a page where I could put his name

851
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,860
 on, which was People Who Don't Have Wikipedia Pages, and he was the first on the list, but

852
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
 it got taken down immediately.

853
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,560
 It was within a minute or something, it was amazingly fast editing by the people at Wikipedia.

854
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,760
 All the four of us have Wikipedia pages, right, and I had a quick look at the editing online,

855
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,400
 because there's been a few times where comments that have been made on this show have made

856
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,840
 their way onto my Wikipedia, and I've had to go in, and I've complained about it, and

857
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,320
 no one changes it, so I've had to physically edit my change into it, and I'm now banned

858
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,840
 from Wikipedia, yeah, before editing my own page for factual accuracy.

859
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:55,440
 So one of the things was, someone changed my name on it to Daniel Indiana, Craig Schreiber,

860
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,520
 because I once said that I almost changed my name to Daniel Indiana, to Indiana is my

861
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,640
 middle name, so for a while on Wikipedia it was Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber, Brackets,

862
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:15,440
 Dix, which is what James said on the podcast, is what's made it on, then a few years later,

863
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,640
 I had to change that, a few years later, Andy makes a joke, and it's a joke that I have

864
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,760
 an interest in, sort of, we were talking about Nazism, and stuff like that, you're an avid

865
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
 collector.

866
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,080
 Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber, aka Dix, is a radio producer living in the United Kingdom,

867
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:42,640
 others have claimed him to have an extreme fascination and an expertise in Nazism and

868
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,560
 Nazi sacred myths.

869
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,720
 I hate to think what it's going to say about Heria-nesses after tonight's show.

870
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:59,240
 And then some other dick put this on, I found this because this was in an edit, it said,

871
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,680
 "Remove incorrect statement, Schreiber is not particularly noted for this catchphrase,"

872
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,440
 and then what originally was put into my account was, "Schreiber is famous for his hilarious

873
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:18,600
 catchphrase," yep, which he uses after Twitter handles are announced on no such thing as

874
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
 a fish.

875
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,280
 It's such a good catchphrase, though, because you've called it like, "That's a biggie,"

876
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,960
 that's a huge word, oh my God, that's so good.

877
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,600
 On Wikipedia pages, often it says, "Notable people," so if you had Bolton, for instance,

878
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,320
 it might be notable people from Bolton, I thought I'd check where we are, if any of

879
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,240
 those things, so this is all that I could find.

880
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,160
 I am mentioned in "Notable people" with Afantasia, because I don't have like a mind's eye, so

881
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
 I'm in that.

882
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,880
 So James can't picture your face if you leave, he can't remember your face, that's all.

883
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,120
 Uranus on the other hand?

884
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,760
 Photographic, absolutely.

885
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,760
 Dan is mentioned as a notable Australian in the United Kingdom, and Anna is a notable

886
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:17,040
 person in the Poles in the United Kingdom, as in people from Poland.

887
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,200
 Andy Murray is a notable tennis player.

888
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
 Wow.

889
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,440
 I'm not joking, I genuinely searched, and I didn't find that phrase.

890
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,600
 Thank you for looking.

891
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:35,200
 There was a thing, so the editing can be used for good and for ill, as we've clearly seen

892
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,080
 from Dan's extensive list of grievances that he just read out, but a couple of years ago

893
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,760
 there was a bloke in Australia who was a really big fan of a band called Peaking Duck.

894
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,960
 He was a bloke called David Spargo, and he was going to see them at a gig, and he really

895
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,480
 wanted to get backstage to see them, and so he changed the Wikipedia page of the band

896
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,360
 Peaking Duck, creating an entry for family and listing himself as a family member.

897
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,560
 And then when he got to the backstage bit of the gig, he said to the guys, "No, no,

898
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,920
 I'm their step-brother or cousin or whatever, show that to the security guys who let him

899
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,920
 in."

900
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
 Genius.

901
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,720
 And the band just gave him a beer and said, "Fair play, that's a very funny thing you've

902
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
 done."

903
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:22,040
 They said, "I love this so much," they said, "He wasn't creepy at all, and was actually

904
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,280
 much more relaxed and cool than we would have expected from someone who went to those lengths."

905
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
 That's so good.

906
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,720
 The band hasn't been seen since then, has it?

907
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,760
 You know on Wikipedia how there are multiple language Wikipedia's, and so there may be

908
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,480
 a translation of no such thing as a fish into, I don't know, Mandarin, for example, or whatever

909
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,800
 languages there are.

910
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,680
 So there's a list of the articles where people and things have been the most translated,

911
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,440
 so it's the leaderboard of that.

912
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,840
 So in terms of humans that are on that leaderboard, the top people are, the most translations

913
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,840
 is for Jesus.

914
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,560
 Third is for Michael Jackson.

915
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
 Third is for Barack Obama.

916
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
 Fourth is for Donald Trump.

917
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,720
 Fifth is for Adolf Hitler.

918
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,000
 Sixth is for Albert Einstein.

919
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,560
 Who do you think is seventh?

920
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,560
 Is that Andy?

921
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,560
 Please.

922
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,600
 I need this, Dan.

923
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,320
 I would have liked someone like Harry Potter, perhaps, or...

924
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,480
 It's got to be a real person.

925
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
 Mr Bean?

926
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
 Oh, Rowan Atkinson.

927
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
 Oh, Rowan Atkinson.

928
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
 Rowan Atkinson.

929
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
 Same answer, yeah.

930
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
 Yeah.

931
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
 Is it another world leader?

932
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
 No.

933
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,680
 And I called Corbin Blue, BLEU, who was initially at the time a supporting actor from the movie

934
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:44,320
 High School Musical, who, one enthusiastic fan, translated his account into every single

935
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:50,080
 language that he could, as using Google Translate and stuff like that, giving him over 200 different

936
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,240
 languages of translation.

937
00:45:53,240 --> 00:46:01,000
 So, he's just behind Albert Einstein, Julius Caesar's behind him, but it's, yeah, and it's

938
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,360
 the theory that it's one person who's been doing that.

939
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
 That's amazing.

940
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
 So, we just think...

941
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,080
 Because it sounds like that person is in tonight, if we do want to ask.

942
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,440
 God people have a lot of time.

943
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,200
 Like, so, on languages on Wikipedia, actually, there is a Scots language Wikipedia section.

944
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,760
 It's got 41,000 articles, as in Scots, the sort of language Robbie Burns, kind of, some

945
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,480
 people will say it's a dialect of English, some people say it's its own language, but

946
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
 you know the one.

947
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,280
 Anyway, people started to notice that some of the Scots language articles were not entirely

948
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,720
 correct in terms of not really being written in the Scots language, they were really written

949
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,160
 in a parody version of it, or what someone who didn't actually speak the language might

950
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,280
 guess that it sounded like, and it turned out, it's because almost half of the articles

951
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,520
 had been written by a teenager in North Carolina who did not speak a word of Scots.

952
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,760
 It's the most odd story, and he started off doing it, he was 12, I think, when he started

953
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
 doing it.

954
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,080
 What a strange kid.

955
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:09,240
 And they started at the top, all with the warning, "The Scots that was oozed in this

956
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:16,120
 article was written be a body that's Mithra-Tung, is now Scots.

957
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:22,440
 Please improve this article, Guinea Can, which I think is translated as, this is all bollocks,

958
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,960
 please improve it."

959
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,840
 But then he took that away, and it was only a couple of years ago, it was revealed that

960
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,320
 it was just this boy in North Carolina who, I know, because then he felt so bad about

961
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
 it.

962
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,320
 He felt so bad about it.

963
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
 He hasn't been named, I think, which is good.

964
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,760
 Now, we know his Wikipedia name, which is Amaryllis Gardiner, but I don't know if you

965
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,280
 can track him down with that.

966
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,400
 And very sweetly, because a lot of people said we should scrap the whole Scots language

967
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,920
 page, the Michael Dempster, who's director of the Scots Language Center, said, "Look,

968
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,260
 this kid's put in an incredible amount of work.

969
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:01,480
 It's a great resource, but it does need people who are literate in Scots to edit it now."

970
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
 So get on it.

971
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:10,200
 The editing of Wikipedia is such a hotly contested area, the behind-the-scenes of it is just

972
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,920
 constant fights going on.

973
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,440
 One of the famous ones, which probably a lot of people here know about, is there is a page

974
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:25,400
 for a guy who's called Guy Standing, and in the photo, Guy Standing is sitting.

975
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,920
 So the caption reads, "Guy Standing, sitting."

976
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
 Beautiful.

977
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
 That's great.

978
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,880
 It's great, except it's a very contentious photo, which has now been edited away, brought

979
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,880
 back because people are saying you're making fun.

980
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,480
 This is an obvious joke, and we're not about jokes here, we're about information.

981
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,860
 So if you want jokes, head over to Dan Schreiber on the human point.

982
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,480
 I just have one or two things about stock photos, because this is a stock photo, this

983
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,760
 is a public use photo, but the stock photo libraries that exist, they lead to all sorts

984
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,840
 of weird quirks and tangents.

985
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:06,080
 So for example, in 2019, the New Zealand budget featured stock photos, a stock photo model

986
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,640
 on the front of it, and it turned out to be a woman called Vicky Freeman, who just had

987
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,480
 the picture taken and just sold the rights to it.

988
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,480
 Anyway, she had moved to Australia because she could no longer afford to live in New

989
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,440
 Zealand, and was on the front page of the New Zealand budget document, all about making

990
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
 life affordable.

991
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,040
 And you don't really have many options, normally.

992
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,480
 You can sometimes say, "I don't want to be used to advertise an extreme political

993
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,320
 view," or whatever, but you often just have no rights at all.

994
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:38,280
 So in 2014, a woman called Samantha Ovens had years before done a photo shoot for colds

995
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,280
 and illnesses.

996
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,720
 You know, those sort of cold remedy photos, where you just have to pinch your brow and

997
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,360
 look a bit pained, or look a bit...

998
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
 Yeah.

999
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,880
 ...like you're having a slightly, "Oh, I've got a bit of a cold or a headache," or whatever.

1000
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,440
 Anyway, that then got used as the lead on a Guardian article, a confessional article

1001
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,880
 blind, "I fantasise about group sex with old obese men," and she just found people started

1002
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,880
 contacting her, saying, "You're right, Samantha."

1003
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,000
 A lot of old men getting in touch.

1004
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,200
 Honestly, Sam, see you dance, mate.

1005
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,640
 I'm going to have to wrap this up very shortly, guys.

1006
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,640
 I know.

1007
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,640
 We're nearing the end.

1008
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,640
 Could I tell you one funny thing?

1009
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,640
 Yeah.

1010
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
 I saw...

1011
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,480
 Which is that, following one of the Football World Cups, Seth Blatter, who was the FIFA

1012
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,520
 president, he was awarded this beautiful award, the Order of Companions of OR Tambo, for his

1013
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,800
 contribution to the World Cup, and to announce it, the South African government put it on

1014
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:42,160
 their webpage, but unfortunately, they took his name and details from his Wikipedia page,

1015
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,840
 which had just been vandalised.

1016
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:54,000
 And so, what they announced on their website was an award for Joseph Sepp Bellend Blatter.

1017
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,120
 That is it, that is all of our facts.

1018
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,600
