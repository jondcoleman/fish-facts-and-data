00:00:10,00:00:16,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:23,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Edinburgh.
00:00:23,00:00:30,"[APPLAUSE] My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four"
00:00:36,00:00:38,favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:46,00:00:49,">> Okay, my fact this week is that when Dick Loss,"
00:00:49,00:00:55,"the president of the Montana Cowboy Association,"
00:00:55,00:01:03,"drove a car for the first time, he crashed it into a fence."
00:01:03,00:01:05,"Because instead of using the brake pedal,"
00:01:05,00:01:09,"he pulled back on the steering wheel and yelled, whoa!"
00:01:09,00:01:12,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:12,00:01:13,>> Incredible.
00:01:13,00:01:15,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:15,00:01:16,>> Lot to unpack.
00:01:16,00:01:18,>> So who was Dick Loss?
00:01:18,00:01:22,>> He was the president of the Montana Cowboy Association.
00:01:22,00:01:22,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:22,00:01:24,>> Cool.
00:01:24,00:01:24,>> A cowboy.
00:01:24,00:01:25,>> Who's a cowboy?
00:01:25,00:01:30,And I found this because he's just been inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame in
00:01:30,00:01:30,Montana.
00:01:30,00:01:32,>> Cool.
00:01:32,00:01:33,>> He was a male carrier.
00:01:33,00:01:35,>> Do you keep tabs on the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Montana?
00:01:35,00:01:37,"Every new person who's inducted, you know about it."
00:01:37,00:01:38,">> I do. >> He's got one of his phone,"
00:01:38,00:01:39,he's got one of those notifications.
00:01:39,00:01:41,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:41,00:01:43,>> Do you want some other people who are in the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Montana?
00:01:43,00:01:45,">> Yeah, yes, so."
00:01:45,00:01:45,>> Bob Fudge.
00:01:45,00:01:47,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:47,00:01:47,>> Bob Fudge.
00:01:47,00:01:48,>> Bob Fudge.
00:01:48,00:01:50,">> Oh no, the Fudge Gang are in town."
00:01:50,00:01:52,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:52,00:01:53,>> It's just a funny cowboy name.
00:01:53,00:01:55,">> Bob Fudge, Fanny Steel."
00:01:55,00:01:57,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:57,00:01:57,">> Fanny Steel, yeah."
00:01:57,00:02:01,">> Johnny Flowers, Carl Moss, Spud Creamer."
00:02:01,00:02:02,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:02,00:02:05,">> Spud Creamer, Chief Sitting Bull, and"
00:02:05,00:02:08,the 1904 Fort Shore Indian School Girls Basketball Team.
00:02:08,00:02:10,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:10,00:02:11,>> Wow.
00:02:11,00:02:12,>> Did you say Spud Creamer?
00:02:12,00:02:13,>> Spud Creamer.
00:02:13,00:02:14,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:14,00:02:15,>> These are incredible.
00:02:15,00:02:18,">> It's a great name, he was incredibly dull, I have to say."
00:02:18,00:02:20,>> Really?
00:02:20,00:02:21,">> I read all of the,"
00:02:21,00:02:22,"because they have the biographies of all these people, and"
00:02:22,00:02:25,that's how I read this about Dick Loss.
00:02:25,00:02:29,"Basically, I found this Hall of Fame, and they had all the names."
00:02:29,00:02:32,"I don't know what drew me to Dick Loss, first of all, but I read his biography,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,and it had this amazing thing.
00:02:34,00:02:37,"But he was a male carrier, he was a cowboy."
00:02:37,00:02:43,"He lived in a place called Square Butte, and it's pronounced Square Butte."
00:02:43,00:02:47,"And every time we say the word But, it's spelled B-U-T-E."
00:02:47,00:02:50,"We get loads of people writing in from Montana or Wyoming saying,"
00:02:50,00:02:54,"it's pronounced Butte, and I'm like, well, don't spell it like Butte then."
00:02:54,00:02:57,">> Yeah, yeah, good point."
00:02:57,00:03:02,"I was looking up the meaning of whoa, whoa."
00:03:02,00:03:06,"So there's some, I wouldn't go so far as to call it controversy."
00:03:06,00:03:12,"But a little bit of debate, I was reading horsejournals.com."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"Which is a great site, if you're into horses."
00:03:15,00:03:19,"And Jack Ballew, who is, she's a horse trainer of many years experience."
00:03:19,00:03:22,She wrote a piece about the meaning of whoa.
00:03:22,00:03:26,"And her contention is that by and large, it means nothing."
00:03:26,00:03:27,It means nothing at all.
00:03:27,00:03:30,It's something for humans to say while they try and sort out the horse situation.
00:03:30,00:03:32,Horse doesn't care.
00:03:32,00:03:34,">> But it does have a meaning, doesn't it?"
00:03:34,00:03:35,">> It has a meaning, yeah, yeah."
00:03:35,00:03:38,">> If you're running towards me and I say, whoa, you know what I mean."
00:03:38,00:03:39,">> Yeah, but I'm not a horse and neither are you."
00:03:39,00:03:45,">> So it's, she says, the word whoa is used with zero purpose."
00:03:45,00:03:47,"This is in general, other than to fill silent air and"
00:03:47,00:03:50,give our busy human minds something to work over and repeat incessantly.
00:03:50,00:03:52,>> No. >> What is this person talking about?
00:03:52,00:03:55,We all know that whoa means slow down or stop.
00:03:55,00:03:56,This is person illiterate.
00:03:56,00:04:01,>> She's a very experienced professional horse trainer.
00:04:01,00:04:05,She said on some occasions it can really work if you say it just right.
00:04:05,00:04:07,">> Well, then it fucking works."
00:04:07,00:04:08,What is that?
00:04:08,00:04:13,">> It's like, but in general, I can't believe I'm having to, in general,"
00:04:13,00:04:14,"it means nothing. >> Ghost don't exist,"
00:04:14,00:04:18,except that one time when there was a genuine ghost.
00:04:18,00:04:20,">> Jeez, most of the time when horse people say, whoa,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"they're just saying something to say, right?"
00:04:22,00:04:23,>> Let's not talk about this now.
00:04:23,00:04:24,We'll take this backstage.
00:04:24,00:04:27,">> Okay, anyway, anyway, that's a distraction."
00:04:27,00:04:30,>> I did a bit of looking into cowboys and some of the cowboys that I love most
00:04:30,00:04:34,"are movie cowboys, the sort of John Wayne and the Clint Eastwoods and so on."
00:04:34,00:04:38,And some of the cowboys were genuine cowboys that then
00:04:38,00:04:39,became movie stars.
00:04:39,00:04:42,So they just found their way into Hollywood in the early days.
00:04:42,00:04:45,So there's a guy called Louis Burton Lindley Jr.
00:04:45,00:04:50,And he was a cowboy who got conscripted into the war.
00:04:50,00:04:53,And the only reason he really got into the world of Hollywood was when he
00:04:53,00:04:56,"enlisted into the war, they said, what is your occupation?"
00:04:56,00:04:57,"He said, rodeo."
00:04:57,00:05:02,"And the person went, radio, okay, and then they put him down and"
00:05:02,00:05:04,he did radio throughout the war.
00:05:04,00:05:09,"And he was like, this is pretty good. >> Well, after he'd done rodeo,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,rodeo is a very easy to sit on.
00:05:11,00:05:14,">> So after the war, he was like, I really enjoyed that radio stuff."
00:05:14,00:05:17,And then he went into movies like Blazing Saddles and stuff like that.
00:05:17,00:05:18,>> Wow.
00:05:18,00:05:22,">> And then there was another guy who was, he wasn't a real cowboy in real life."
00:05:22,00:05:26,"But James Arnes, and he was a famous actor in a TV show called Gunsmoke."
00:05:26,00:05:28,And Gunsmoke was really big.
00:05:28,00:05:32,"During the war, his thing was, he was a really tall guy."
00:05:32,00:05:37,"And so as a result, as the tallest man in the outfit of his platoon,"
00:05:37,00:05:41,he was always sent down the ramp of a boat first to see how deep the water was.
00:05:41,00:05:44,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:44,00:05:48,">> He was the measuring stick, the human measuring stick."
00:05:48,00:05:51,">> Yeah, you mentioned John Wayne."
00:05:51,00:05:54,"Middle name Marion, if you didn't know, anyone out there."
00:05:54,00:05:55,>> Didn't know.
00:05:55,00:05:58,">> And didn't like it, didn't like the fact his middle name was Marion,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,because he liked to get a bit of a macho image.
00:06:00,00:06:03,And he said he actually got bullied loads for it at school.
00:06:03,00:06:08,"His full name was John Marion Robert Morrison, I think."
00:06:08,00:06:11,"Sorry, his real first name was Marion, even worse."
00:06:11,00:06:14,">> Yeah, this is a Johnny Cash song, basically."
00:06:14,00:06:16,This is a boy named Sue.
00:06:16,00:06:17,">> This is the boy named Marion, yeah."
00:06:17,00:06:19,>> Is that where Johnny Cash got it from?
00:06:19,00:06:20,Or is it?
00:06:20,00:06:21,>> No. >> Okay.
00:06:21,00:06:25,">> But he changed his name, and he's actually credited in some films as Duke."
00:06:25,00:06:28,And he's often called Duke as a nickname.
00:06:28,00:06:29,And that was after his family dog.
00:06:29,00:06:34,"And it was because he had this giant dog, this Airdale, who used to walk him to"
00:06:34,00:06:37,"school every day when he was a boy, and they'd stop at the local fire station."
00:06:37,00:06:40,"And the fireman called him Little Duke, and his dog Big Duke."
00:06:40,00:06:43,And so he had the name stuck.
00:06:43,00:06:44,>> That's very cool.
00:06:44,00:06:45,>> Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:48,">> Can I give you some more, Montanon cow people?"
00:06:48,00:06:49,">> Yeah, definitely."
00:06:49,00:06:53,>> Hilda Redwing is recently in the Hall of Fame in Montana.
00:06:53,00:06:57,She took part in a rodeo at the age of 90.
00:06:59,00:07:04,"And during the rodeo, one of her friends who was running it,"
00:07:04,00:07:07,his horse ran into her and broke her leg.
00:07:07,00:07:12,And she carried on doing the rodeo with a broken leg at the age of 90.
00:07:12,00:07:13,>> What?
00:07:13,00:07:14,>> Isn't that amazing?
00:07:14,00:07:17,>> Was she riding a bull or anything?
00:07:17,00:07:20,">> No, it was like a relatively calm horse."
00:07:20,00:07:21,">> Okay, okay."
00:07:21,00:07:22,>> Still amazing.
00:07:22,00:07:27,>> And I mentioned the 1904 Fort Shore Indian School Girls basketball team.
00:07:27,00:07:28,>> Yeah.
00:07:28,00:07:32,">> And they went to the St. Louis World's Fair, and they spent five months there"
00:07:32,00:07:37,"as part of the anthropological exhibit that they did at that same time,"
00:07:37,00:07:40,where they brought lots of Native Americans in to do stuff.
00:07:40,00:07:44,"And during that, they started playing basketball against all comers."
00:07:44,00:07:46,And they beat anyone who came.
00:07:46,00:07:49,And so they were named champions of the world.
00:07:49,00:07:50,>> Wow.
00:07:50,00:07:50,>> That's great.
00:07:50,00:07:51,>> It's like a world.
00:07:51,00:07:53,>> And why does that get you into the Cowboy Hall of Fame?
00:07:53,00:07:56,>> I think really they were short of people.
00:07:56,00:07:56,>> Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:58,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:58,00:07:59,>> Tough year.
00:07:59,00:08:03,">> They didn't, you know, they weren't in a shoot up, they didn't win a duel."
00:08:03,00:08:09,">> Have you guys heard, in Alaska, there are cowboys who ride helicopters instead of horses?"
00:08:09,00:08:10,">> Yeah, that's cool."
00:08:10,00:08:11,>> When you say ride.
00:08:11,00:08:12,">> Well, they don't."
00:08:12,00:08:13,"Obviously, yeah."
00:08:13,00:08:15,>> They're not spinning around on the-
00:08:15,00:08:18,">> It's like- >> Definitely looking at some tick loss there, aren't you?"
00:08:18,00:08:22,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:22,00:08:25,">> No, they round their cows up with helicopters."
00:08:25,00:08:27,But I didn't even know there were Alaskan cowboys.
00:08:27,00:08:29,>> No. >> And Hawaiian cowboys as well.
00:08:29,00:08:30,Which is a very famous thing in America.
00:08:30,00:08:32,">> Yeah, they're bloody everywhere, aren't they?"
00:08:32,00:08:35,">> Yeah. >> And in fact, American US cowboys really"
00:08:35,00:08:40,"nicked all of their gear, all of their cliches, all of their hats, their coats,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,their everything from Mexico.
00:08:43,00:08:46,So they're based on Mexican vaqueros.
00:08:46,00:08:50,"And in fact, the word buckaroo, I didn't know, comes from vaquero."
00:08:50,00:08:51,">> Wow, really?"
00:08:51,00:08:54,>> Yeah. >> And we get so many words all come from
00:08:54,00:08:55,those Mexican cowboys.
00:08:55,00:09:01,"So lasso, bronco, chaps, as in you're wearing chaps, not high chaps."
00:09:01,00:09:02,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:02,00:09:06,">> Yeah, and gouchos as well, the Argentinian version,"
00:09:06,00:09:07,which I always think of the coolest.
00:09:07,00:09:11,"The thing I like about gouchos, so Argentinian and Uruguayan cowboys,"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"is that they, again, they're just really cool cattle herders."
00:09:15,00:09:17,"It seems like if you're in the Americas and you're herding cattle,"
00:09:17,00:09:18,you become really cool.
00:09:18,00:09:21,And they were really fussy about the color of their horses.
00:09:21,00:09:25,"And if you're a proper goucho, all of your horses have to be perfectly color"
00:09:25,00:09:25,matched.
00:09:25,00:09:30,"And so you get pibled horses, like white with black splodges."
00:09:30,00:09:33,But you want the black splodges as perfectly matched as possible to each other.
00:09:33,00:09:34,>> Really?
00:09:34,00:09:35,">> Yeah, it's cool."
00:09:35,00:09:38,"Apparently it was so that if your herds got mixed up,"
00:09:38,00:09:39,you could tell which ones were yours.
00:09:39,00:09:40,>> Wazers.
00:09:40,00:09:42,>> Yeah. >> That's very cool.
00:09:42,00:09:45,">> I think like a quarter of the cowboys,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"what we would call them now were not whites, right?"
00:09:48,00:09:50,">> Yeah. >> In the time of the cowboy,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"basically, in the post-Civil War time."
00:09:52,00:09:56,And actually the word cowboy would be mostly used for
00:09:56,00:09:58,African-American cowhands.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"Like the white people would be called cowhands, and"
00:10:01,00:10:04,"it was kind of a bit of a slur to say boy, do you know what I mean?"
00:10:04,00:10:06,">> It was kind of diminutive. >> Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:10:06,00:10:07,">> Wow, interesting."
00:10:07,00:10:10,">> I didn't realize how short the Wild West was after the Civil War,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,before about 1900.
00:10:12,00:10:12,That was it.
00:10:12,00:10:14,>> Yeah. >> It was a really brief period.
00:10:14,00:10:15,>> Right. >> Here's a mind blowing thing.
00:10:15,00:10:19,Cowboys basically invented dust in America.
00:10:19,00:10:22,The reason that America is dusty is because of cowboys.
00:10:22,00:10:23,>> Really? >> Yeah.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"So there's been this guy, Jason Neff, he's a geochemist."
00:10:27,00:10:27,I hadn't heard of that.
00:10:27,00:10:31,He studied the sediments laid down in various mountains in Colorado.
00:10:31,00:10:33,And he looked at the sediments that had been laid down in the lakes and
00:10:33,00:10:33,things like that.
00:10:33,00:10:38,And he found there was basically no dust in America for 5000 years.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"And the soil had this, it was vegetation, it had this crust,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,"this nice thick crust on it, right?"
00:10:42,00:10:43,>> Yeah. >> No dust blowing around.
00:10:43,00:10:48,"1860, the rates suddenly shoot up of dust in the atmosphere."
00:10:48,00:10:51,"And it's because the cows had arrived, they stripped the grass."
00:10:51,00:10:55,"And then their feet, their big clumping hooves broke through this gorgeous crust."
00:10:55,00:10:56,And as a result.
00:10:56,00:11:00,">> It must have been nice, when you first go through that crust."
00:11:00,00:11:02,Like breaking into a crème brûlée.
00:11:02,00:11:06,>> That's the least cowboy thing you've ever said.
00:11:06,00:11:08,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:08,00:11:10,>> That bloody hell.
00:11:10,00:11:14,">> But we have dust, I get dust in my house, right?"
00:11:14,00:11:15,">> That's nothing to do with the cowboys, you're right."
00:11:15,00:11:19,"That's pre-existing dust, that's, yeah, yeah."
00:11:19,00:11:20,I just mean that the reason America is-
00:11:20,00:11:23,">> So basically apart from that one example, this is true."
00:11:23,00:11:24,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:24,00:11:27,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:11:27,00:11:31,">> Just on names, Dick Loss, a friend of mine who's actually in"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"the crowd tonight, Shona, sent this ridiculous fact."
00:11:35,00:11:37,I can't believe that it's true.
00:11:37,00:11:39,>> Any fact that comes from a friend of yours.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"No, I meant Shona."
00:11:41,00:11:42,But there's some skepticism in the room.
00:11:42,00:11:43,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:43,00:11:45,">> So Wild Bill Hickok, right?"
00:11:45,00:11:49,"So the name Wild Bill, this really kick-ass name, scared people."
00:11:49,00:11:52,"He was just like this beautiful, amazing cowboy."
00:11:52,00:11:56,"Supposedly, the reason he got it is not because he was this incredible cowboy who"
00:11:56,00:12:00,"could do dangerous things, is because his face, his nose and"
00:12:00,00:12:02,mouth look slightly like a duck.
00:12:02,00:12:03,And- >> No.
00:12:03,00:12:06,>> And Wild Bill is the bill of a duck.
00:12:06,00:12:10,"But, and so he was sort of bullied, this is Shona's fact."
00:12:10,00:12:15,"He was sort of bullied by his buddies, and then he changed it to be like,"
00:12:15,00:12:17,"no, I'm really cool and wild."
00:12:17,00:12:20,">> His brother was called Tame Bill Hickok, wasn't he?"
00:12:20,00:12:21,>> Yes.
00:12:21,00:12:24,>> So did he have a face that looked like a normal duck's beak?
00:12:24,00:12:26,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:26,00:12:30,>> I will bet a decent number of doubloons that that is not true.
00:12:30,00:12:33,">> Okay, using a pirate currency, apparently, now?"
00:12:33,00:12:35,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:35,00:12:36,>> Pirate's Cowboys.
00:12:36,00:12:37,"Sorry, what's it called, cowboy currency?"
00:12:37,00:12:38,>> Like gold nuggets.
00:12:38,00:12:42,"There you go, that's what I'll bet, I'm sorry."
00:12:42,00:12:45,">> You'd wager your parrot on it, wouldn't you, Anna?"
00:12:45,00:12:47,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:47,00:12:50,">> I'm gonna have to move us on in a sec, guys, we gotta move on."
00:12:50,00:12:53,">> The Cowboys all went on strike in 1883, which I think is a very funny-"
00:12:53,00:12:55,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:55,00:12:59,">> Okay, there was a cowboy strike in 1883."
00:12:59,00:13:02,">> Well, they had very good unions, the Cowboys."
00:13:02,00:13:03,>> Right.
00:13:03,00:13:04,">> And, guys- >> [LAUGH]"
00:13:04,00:13:05,">> Peter, how to let Jeremy carbon in?"
00:13:05,00:13:07,>> Yeah.
00:13:07,00:13:10,">> If you're equating the striking bin men with these Cowboys,"
00:13:10,00:13:15,"that's very fluttering to them, but we're all about the Cowboys here, and"
00:13:15,00:13:17,"their unions- >> And pirates, don't forget the pirates."
00:13:17,00:13:20,">> And pirates, also very strong unions."
00:13:20,00:13:25,"They were called the Turtles, they were the original Turtles, Cowboy unions."
00:13:25,00:13:26,>> The original Turtles.
00:13:26,00:13:26,>> Yeah.
00:13:26,00:13:29,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:29,00:13:31,">> What were they called, Turtles, do we know?"
00:13:31,00:13:35,">> They were called Turtles, it was the Rodeo's Union, and so it was in response"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"to bad-paying stuff, and they were called Turtles, because the idea is they're,"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"I don't know why they're proud of this, but they're slow to organise,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,"but once they do, they're unafraid to stick their neck out."
00:13:43,00:13:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:45,00:13:46,>> It's good.
00:13:46,00:13:47,>> I don't know if that's what you want.
00:13:47,00:13:48,>> Kind of good.
00:13:48,00:13:50,">> Yeah. >> I thought that when Turtles were afraid,"
00:13:50,00:13:52,they didn't stick their neck out.
00:13:52,00:13:53,>> I think that might be true as well.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"I don't know how much they knew about naturalism, the Cowboys."
00:13:57,00:14:02,[MUSIC]
00:14:02,00:14:07,">> It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:14:07,00:14:12,">> My fact this week is that until the 19th century, if someone shouted,"
00:14:12,00:14:17,"stop thief, you had no choice but to try and stop the thief."
00:14:17,00:14:19,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:19,00:14:19,>> Cool.
00:14:19,00:14:24,>> You were legally obliged on pain of being arrested and
00:14:24,00:14:27,facing a penalty to chase the thief.
00:14:27,00:14:31,">> But with the crowd who were trying to stop the thief,"
00:14:31,00:14:35,"if you didn't join in, does some of the crowd then start chasing you?"
00:14:35,00:14:37,">> Yeah, good point."
00:14:37,00:14:39,Stop non-thief stopper.
00:14:39,00:14:41,">> Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:14:41,00:14:43,">> Well, there was a time in, this was in 1760,"
00:14:43,00:14:47,"there was a Jewish second hand clothes dealer, and he followed this,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,what was known as hue and cry.
00:14:49,00:14:53,"And he was faster than everyone else, so he got at the front of the group, and"
00:14:53,00:14:56,then they thought that he was the one who was- >> No.
00:14:56,00:14:58,>> And so they grabbed him and arrested him.
00:14:58,00:15:00,>> My God.
00:15:00,00:15:02,>> That's like a scene out of life of Brian.
00:15:02,00:15:04,">> Yes, but that's a really good point."
00:15:04,00:15:07,What was the policing of that situation?
00:15:07,00:15:12,Because you've suddenly got potentially one criminal and then 30 criminals.
00:15:12,00:15:15,">> Yes, so I do think the crime of not stopping the thief wasn't as large as"
00:15:15,00:15:16,the crime of being the thief.
00:15:16,00:15:21,"So your priority is still to chase the thief, but I think after you'd given chase"
00:15:21,00:15:24,"and you'd caught the thief, you can mention to the constable, by the way,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,"the old Angela who lives next door didn't even give chase, so."
00:15:28,00:15:32,">> Well, one reason was if you didn't chase them and they got away,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"you became liable for the robberies, so you might have to pay money for"
00:15:35,00:15:36,the person who got the robberies.
00:15:36,00:15:40,">> Wait, if I just don't chase, because I'm halfway through doing something,"
00:15:40,00:15:42,I'm liable for the stuff- >> Like a Sudoku or something.
00:15:42,00:15:45,">> Yeah, I'll have to do my Sudoku, and then I don't join the hue and cry."
00:15:45,00:15:47,I'm then on the hook for the theft.
00:15:47,00:15:50,">> You wouldn't go to prison for the theft, but you might have to pay some"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"recompense to the person- >> Well, I refuse to pay, that's outrageous."
00:15:52,00:15:53,">> Well, then you are going to prison."
00:15:53,00:15:54,">> Yeah, prison."
00:15:54,00:15:56,>> Then I'll maybe have a bit of peace and
00:15:56,00:15:58,bloody quiet to do my Sudoku.
00:15:58,00:15:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:15:59,00:16:00,>> Everyone's won.
00:16:00,00:16:02,>> Wow. >> You're going shopping must have been so
00:16:02,00:16:03,stressful back in the day.
00:16:03,00:16:06,>> [LAUGH]
00:16:06,00:16:09,">> Yeah, well, this is what if it makes you guys feel better,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"Dan and Andy, because I can see you're having trouble with this."
00:16:11,00:16:15,"There were also penalties for raising a false hue and cry for exactly this reason,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,because it was acknowledged that people would be busy working in the farms or
00:16:18,00:16:22,"doing Sudoku, and so it could interrupt the village economy."
00:16:22,00:16:24,"Every time you shouted, stop thief."
00:16:24,00:16:26,So you did get in trouble for doing it falsely.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"As some people did, I think there was one person who raised a hue and"
00:16:30,00:16:33,"cry on his dog, I believe."
00:16:33,00:16:37,"I think this is in the 15th century, and it was found his dog was chasing some sheep."
00:16:37,00:16:42,"And so he did the stop thief, or the stop done my dog's chasing sheep hue and cry."
00:16:42,00:16:45,>> Right. >> And he was fine for that.
00:16:45,00:16:47,">> You know the descendants of Sigmund Freud,"
00:16:47,00:16:52,"Lucian Freud, Clement Freud, a big broadcaster and an artist."
00:16:52,00:16:55,"When they were younger, they were going through a park, and"
00:16:55,00:16:58,they decided to challenge each other who could run faster to the destination they
00:16:58,00:17:01,"were getting to, and they both convinced that they were gonna be the person that"
00:17:01,00:17:02,could do it.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"So they started running, and as they were going, Clement took over,"
00:17:05,00:17:11,"was going much faster, and so Lucian went, stop thief, he's taken my money."
00:17:11,00:17:15,"And he was grabbed by Pastor Byes, who stopped him."
00:17:15,00:17:19,And Clement was so pissed off with him that the two of them barely spoke for
00:17:19,00:17:20,the rest of their life.
00:17:20,00:17:23,That was the incident.
00:17:23,00:17:24,>> I knew they hated each other.
00:17:24,00:17:25,>> Lucian didn't even go to his funeral.
00:17:25,00:17:26,>> No way.
00:17:26,00:17:27,>> They hated each other.
00:17:27,00:17:28,">> Because of that, what?"
00:17:28,00:17:29,>> That was the biggie.
00:17:29,00:17:32,"That's what everyone says, well, it all comes back down to the stop thief moment."
00:17:32,00:17:36,"When he did that, he said- >> You should have made his tombstone,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,"boy, you've stopped now, haven't you?"
00:17:37,00:17:39,>> Nice.
00:17:39,00:17:40,>> That would be good.
00:17:40,00:17:43,">> You didn't always have to shout stop thief, there are a few other things you"
00:17:43,00:17:45,might shout.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"In Scotland, sometimes you would shout, oh, yay."
00:17:47,00:17:55,"In Wales, you might shout, hubbub, and in Gloucestershire,"
00:17:55,00:17:57,"you might shout, utestes."
00:17:57,00:18:04,">> Isn't it like, you parabolics, you've nick my purse."
00:18:04,00:18:06,">> It's U-T-E-S-T-E-S, utestes."
00:18:06,00:18:07,">> Right, utestes."
00:18:07,00:18:08,>> Okay.
00:18:08,00:18:09,">> Sounds like a Greek philosopher, doesn't it?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,Utestes.
00:18:10,00:18:12,>> Yes.
00:18:12,00:18:15,">> He's just bouncing out a lot of bollocks all the time, yeah."
00:18:15,00:18:17,>> It's really interesting.
00:18:17,00:18:18,"I think, so there was this thing."
00:18:18,00:18:22,"There was a magazine, the magazine is putting it a bit strong."
00:18:22,00:18:28,It was a kind of a one sheet thing in the 1770s that was run by the Bow Street Magistrate
00:18:28,00:18:34,"in London, and it was full of unsolved crimes and details of criminals, and it was called"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"general hue and cry, and it was distributed across the country, and it was a way of catching"
00:18:38,00:18:42,"criminals, it was basically like an extremely long distance hue and cry."
00:18:42,00:18:45,"You'd say this person has stolen this, and they look like this, so if you see them, please"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"pick them up, and it worked."
00:18:47,00:18:51,"Even in the 1770s, people were being picked up hundreds of miles away for crimes they"
00:18:51,00:18:52,committed.
00:18:52,00:18:56,>> It just feels like being a civilian was a full-time job in those days.
00:18:56,00:19:00,"You have to constantly, because again, it wasn't just that you had to give chase when"
00:19:00,00:19:01,people cried.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"You had to if you read it in the magazine, and also by the 17th century."
00:19:04,00:19:06,">> Sorry, what do you mean if you read it in the magazine?"
00:19:06,00:19:11,">> No, you didn't have to chase when you read it in the magazine."
00:19:11,00:19:14,"People desperately tried not to look at magazines, because then they're legally obliged."
00:19:14,00:19:19,">> It made it very hard to do the Sudoku, didn't it?"
00:19:19,00:19:22,">> But warrants would be passed from parish to parish, so let's say you're looking for"
00:19:22,00:19:26,"a thief, then you go to the next parish, and you give them a picture, a drawing of the"
00:19:26,00:19:29,"criminal and a description of them, and you say, ""Can you spread this around your parish?"""
00:19:29,00:19:33,And then everyone in that parish is obliged to keep an eye out for them.
00:19:33,00:19:36,So I don't know how anyone held down a job.
00:19:36,00:19:40,>> They had delayed hue and cry in the Scottish borders as well.
00:19:40,00:19:43,The reason being that you would have a lot of people from England coming over and trying
00:19:43,00:19:47,to steal people's sheep and belongings and stuff like that.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"And often what you would do is because they were armed, these people, it's a bit the Wild"
00:19:51,00:19:56,"West really, and so you might kind of hide in your hedge or kind of just try and get"
00:19:56,00:19:59,all of your really expensive belongings and go there.
00:19:59,00:20:00,>> In the hedge.
00:20:00,00:20:01,">> In the hedge, yeah."
00:20:01,00:20:02,>> Yeah.
00:20:02,00:20:03,>> Anywhere really.
00:20:03,00:20:04,>> All your sheep in the hedge.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"Entire block of sheep, one hedge."
00:20:05,00:20:09,">> And then someone comes out with a hedge trimmer and you go, ""Oh, no!"""
00:20:09,00:20:12,So you would hide often because they were armed.
00:20:12,00:20:16,And so there's a special border law where you're allowed to do a counter raid as long
00:20:16,00:20:18,as it was within the six days.
00:20:18,00:20:22,You still had to shout hue and cry as you went.
00:20:22,00:20:26,And you had to carry a lighted torch so that everyone knew you were on a legitimate return
00:20:26,00:20:27,mission.
00:20:27,00:20:28,>> That's amazing.
00:20:28,00:20:29,>> Wow.
00:20:29,00:20:30,>> Yeah.
00:20:30,00:20:31,>> And then they had to join you on that.
00:20:31,00:20:34,">> No, that was just you getting your own back from the Cumbrians."
00:20:34,00:20:35,>> Got it.
00:20:35,00:20:36,Fair enough.
00:20:36,00:20:41,">> And these days, if you shout stop thief, you can get in trouble."
00:20:41,00:20:47,"There's quite a few people who have sued, like, shop security because they've shouted"
00:20:47,00:20:48,stop thief.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"And they're like, ""Well, I'm not a thief,"" and everyone's heard that, and everyone's"
00:20:50,00:20:51,going to think that now.
00:20:51,00:20:52,>> Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:57,">> There was a guy in Dublin, he was 28 years old, and he claimed that he'd been wrongly"
00:20:57,00:21:02,accused of shoplifting a toy duck from a toy store.
00:21:02,00:21:07,He basically said he was deeply embarrassed and ashamed when a security guard approached
00:21:07,00:21:09,"me and said, ""Where is the duck?"
00:21:09,00:21:12,"I know you have it."""
00:21:12,00:21:19,">> And the best part about it was they went to court, and they brought out the duck as"
00:21:19,00:21:24,"evidence, and it was a talking duck, and they couldn't turn it off."
00:21:24,00:21:30,"All the way through the court case, this duck was just talking all the way through."
00:21:30,00:21:34,>> Are you sure it was a talking duck and not Wild Bill Hickok sitting in the court?
00:21:34,00:21:37,I've heard they're identical.
00:21:37,00:21:40,Do you guys know the bloody code?
00:21:40,00:21:41,>> No.
00:21:41,00:21:42,>> The bloody code.
00:21:42,00:21:47,">> Is that like a penal code, and you could be effectively executed for lots and lots"
00:21:47,00:21:48,and lots of crimes?
00:21:48,00:21:50,">> It's pretty much, yeah, dropping a handkerchief."
00:21:50,00:21:51,Yeah.
00:21:51,00:21:52,Yeah.
00:21:52,00:21:58,"This is in England, so Scotland tended to have a bit of a more, we might say better,"
00:21:58,00:22:03,we might say more lenient legal system in sort of later medieval time where you didn't
00:22:03,00:22:08,"get the death penalty for everything, but in England there was the bloody code, which"
00:22:08,00:22:12,"was the English legal system from the 17th to the early 19th century, and I hadn't realised"
00:22:12,00:22:16,"how many crimes you could be killed for, so there were over 200 crimes that were added"
00:22:16,00:22:18,to this code.
00:22:18,00:22:24,"Crimes you could be executed for included damaging orchards or gardens, cutting down trees on"
00:22:24,00:22:30,"an avenue, destroying a turnpike road, wrecking a fish pond."
00:22:30,00:22:35,">> I've got to say, Anna, I'm agreeing with all of this at the moment."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"If I owned a fish pond, I would..."
00:22:37,00:22:40,">> You're very so proprietary about your garden, aren't you?"
00:22:40,00:22:41,>> Wow.
00:22:41,00:22:48,"But there was this thing where if you were done for a crime and the jury thought, oh,"
00:22:48,00:22:53,"we don't really want this person to be literally hanged to death, they would return at what"
00:22:53,00:22:58,"was called a partial verdict, and they'd say he's guilty, but not as guilty as the judge"
00:22:58,00:22:59,is trying to make out.
00:22:59,00:23:04,"So there was this thing called grand larceny, if you stole something worth more than a shilling,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,that was the death penalty for you.
00:23:06,00:23:09,"So a shilling is not a huge amount of money even then, but what juries would sometimes"
00:23:09,00:23:14,"do is they would return a verdict of not grand larceny, but petty larceny."
00:23:14,00:23:20,"So in 1751, for example, there was a crime where the accused had stolen a pound and seven"
00:23:20,00:23:24,"shillings and sixpence, definitely way above the barrier for being hanged, but the jury"
00:23:24,00:23:31,"said, we think those coins were actually only worth seven pence, so as a result, you get"
00:23:31,00:23:32,off.
00:23:32,00:23:33,So that meant fewer executions.
00:23:33,00:23:37,">> Well, you say Anna about them being a bit more lenient in Scotland is mostly true,"
00:23:37,00:23:43,"but then after the reformation, the law was sort of done by the Kirk, by the church, and"
00:23:43,00:23:47,they started bringing in laws for quite a lot of things that we would be surprised about
00:23:47,00:23:48,today.
00:23:48,00:23:54,"So there were statues of 1661 in Scotland that said that if a child beat or cursed, either"
00:23:54,00:23:58,"their father or mother, they should be put to death without mercy."
00:23:58,00:23:59,>> Oh.
00:23:59,00:24:00,>> Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:01,>> My numbers first.
00:24:01,00:24:08,">> If you were found guilty of the vice of, this is the exact words, filthy fornication,"
00:24:08,00:24:12,"you would get a fine of 40 pounds, 40 Scottish pounds, which in those days was absolutely"
00:24:12,00:24:13,enormous.
00:24:13,00:24:18,"And in 1697, as late as then, there was a guy in Edinburgh called Thomas Aikenhead."
00:24:18,00:24:24,He was hanged for declaring that theology was a rhapsody of ill-invented nonsense.
00:24:24,00:24:25,>> Oh.
00:24:25,00:24:27,>> He was hanged for that.
00:24:27,00:24:28,>> Yeah.
00:24:28,00:24:32,"It wasn't, you know, the Norwegian today, it was slightly more lenient."
00:24:32,00:24:36,">> I was reading about, there's a classic book that was written by a guy called Havlock"
00:24:36,00:24:42,"Ellis, and it's all about the study of what a criminal, the makeup of a criminal, and"
00:24:42,00:24:43,this was during Victorian times.
00:24:43,00:24:47,>> Like the face was supposed to look different if you were a criminal.
00:24:47,00:24:48,>> Exactly.
00:24:48,00:24:52,So there was a guy called Salsotto who was someone who paid particular attention to
00:24:52,00:24:56,"different bits of the body to see if that, and he found, he believes that you're more"
00:24:56,00:25:02,likely to be a criminal as a woman if you have a hairy anus.
00:25:02,00:25:08,">> All right, so from a show of hands, ladies."
00:25:08,00:25:11,>> She said hands.
00:25:11,00:25:18,">> That is a terrible episode of ""Cry Watch,"" isn't it?"
00:25:18,00:25:22,We've done a recreation of the cry.
00:25:22,00:25:23,>> Is that part of the search?
00:25:23,00:25:24,Like who's the criminal?
00:25:24,00:25:25,"That's, yeah."
00:25:25,00:25:28,Has everyone shaved their anus before we commit this crime?
00:25:28,00:25:29,We don't want anyone caught.
00:25:29,00:25:34,But so he found it basically in seven out of 40 women that he studied.
00:25:34,00:25:35,>> Seven out of 40.
00:25:35,00:25:36,>> Who were criminals.
00:25:36,00:25:37,>> Right.
00:25:37,00:25:38,>> Had a hairy anus.
00:25:38,00:25:41,>> It's not a huge proportion.
00:25:41,00:25:43,>> It's enough that it made him write it down.
00:25:43,00:25:45,>> Did he study 40 non-criminals as well?
00:25:45,00:25:47,Was there any control group in this experiment?
00:25:47,00:25:48,>> Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:49,All right.
00:25:49,00:25:50,Okay.
00:25:50,00:25:53,>> Do we know the proportion of women that have under normal circumstances according
00:25:53,00:25:54,to him hairy anuses?
00:25:54,00:25:56,>> That's what I'm saying.
00:25:56,00:25:58,>> Do we know what counts as a hairy anus?
00:25:58,00:25:59,>> Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:03,"Where's the anusometer of, you know."
00:26:03,00:26:05,>> How rigorous was this study?
00:26:05,00:26:06,Was it peer reviewed?
00:26:06,00:26:10,>> It sounds like he wasn't a proper scientist at all.
00:26:10,00:26:13,>> This is in Victorian London.
00:26:13,00:26:15,">> Oh, Victorian London."
00:26:15,00:26:16,>> Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:17,>> Fine.
00:26:17,00:26:18,>> Okay.
00:26:18,00:26:19,>> There was no science.
00:26:19,00:26:22,And I kept reading it because it's a lot about hair.
00:26:22,00:26:24,Like does hair mean you're a criminal?
00:26:24,00:26:25,I'm a really hairy guy.
00:26:25,00:26:26,You can probably see from the audience.
00:26:26,00:26:30,>> We can't see all of you.
00:26:30,00:26:32,>> But I am a really hairy guy.
00:26:32,00:26:33,And so I was reading on.
00:26:33,00:26:39,And it said it's worthwhile pointing out that there are frequent anomalies in the development
00:26:39,00:26:41,of hair among idiots.
00:26:41,00:26:45,>> It's the hair.
00:26:45,00:26:47,That's what it is.
00:26:47,00:26:48,>> But yeah.
00:26:48,00:26:51,So any hairy anus women out there?
00:26:51,00:26:52,>> Stop.
00:26:52,00:26:54,>> We're watching it.
00:26:54,00:26:56,">> Oh, my God."
00:26:56,00:26:59,>> Good grief.
00:26:59,00:27:09,>> It is time for fact number three.
00:27:09,00:27:11,And that is Andy.
00:27:11,00:27:17,">> My fact is that in 2016, scientists found a pocket of helium so big that it could make"
00:27:17,00:27:24,everyone on the planet sound squeaky for 20 minutes.
00:27:24,00:27:26,">> I mean, what great use of that helium."
00:27:26,00:27:27,>> Incredible.
00:27:27,00:27:29,We would have had such a good time.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"And then actually later on, they upgraded the estimate they thought and it would have"
00:27:32,00:27:34,been 40 minutes.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"We could all have been squeaky for 40 minutes, everyone."
00:27:36,00:27:41,"I'm sure that would have had quite serious health consequences for everybody, breathing"
00:27:41,00:27:42,non-oxygen for 40 minutes.
00:27:42,00:27:47,"But nonetheless, this massive, massive amount, and this is the thing of helium is we're always"
00:27:47,00:27:49,running out of it and then suddenly always discovering more.
00:27:49,00:27:50,>> Yeah.
00:27:50,00:27:51,>> And it's just this constant sea salt.
00:27:51,00:27:52,>> Where is this pocket?
00:27:52,00:27:54,>> This was in Tanzania.
00:27:54,00:27:55,>> Okay.
00:27:55,00:27:56,">> Under the ground, presumably."
00:27:56,00:27:59,>> It's in an area called Rukwa in Tanzania.
00:27:59,00:28:03,And Rukwa is also the place which has the largest number of crocodiles in the whole
00:28:03,00:28:04,of Tanzania.
00:28:04,00:28:12,"And the interesting thing about that is if you give a crocodile helium, its voice doesn't"
00:28:12,00:28:13,"go higher, it goes lower."
00:28:13,00:28:14,>> Yeah.
00:28:14,00:28:15,>> Really?
00:28:15,00:28:20,">> I remember we did it on QI and it's weird because the same thing is happening to, I think,"
00:28:20,00:28:23,is it the timbre of your voice that helium changes rather than the pitch?
00:28:23,00:28:24,>> Exactly.
00:28:24,00:28:25,>> I think it is.
00:28:25,00:28:26,>> Yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:29,">> So you'd think that a crocodile sounded like us, like it's going higher, but when"
00:28:29,00:28:35,"the timbre of a crocodile's voice gets higher, it sounds to us deeper, so they sound more"
00:28:35,00:28:36,sexy.
00:28:36,00:28:37,>> I don't think I've ever heard --
00:28:37,00:28:38,[ Laughter ]
00:28:38,00:28:39,>> Even more sexy.
00:28:39,00:28:40,>> I feel that.
00:28:40,00:28:41,>> Even more.
00:28:41,00:28:42,>> I can feel that.
00:28:42,00:28:43,>> Hard to believe.
00:28:43,00:28:44,>> Yeah.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"A crocodile hunter was a very sexy show, wasn't it?"
00:28:45,00:28:46,Steve Irwin was --
00:28:46,00:28:49,>> Is that what he was doing to those crocodiles?
00:28:49,00:28:54,">> Well, I've never heard a crocodile make any kind of noise."
00:28:54,00:28:55,>> They kind of growl.
00:28:55,00:28:56,They grunt.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"Well, that --"
00:28:58,00:28:59,[ Laughter ]
00:28:59,00:29:00,>> Okay.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Okay.
00:29:01,00:29:02,That was hot.
00:29:02,00:29:03,[ Laughter ]
00:29:03,00:29:04,>> Okay.
00:29:04,00:29:05,So they growl.
00:29:05,00:29:06,Okay.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Cool.
00:29:07,00:29:11,">> And the other interesting thing, I suppose, is that on this whole thing is that we were"
00:29:11,00:29:16,"running out of helium, and it was a big problem because we use it for MRI machines, we use"
00:29:16,00:29:19,"it for all sorts of important stuff, not just balloons, and we were running out of it, and"
00:29:19,00:29:23,"the price was getting higher and higher and higher, and this was the first time we'd ever"
00:29:23,00:29:28,"really looked for it, and they started looking and they found shitloads of it, and so they"
00:29:28,00:29:33,"think that maybe if we keep looking, we might find a lot more, and in fact, in 2017, some"
00:29:33,00:29:38,scientists at the University of Edinburgh found a huge amount of helium in the middle
00:29:38,00:29:39,of Scotland as well.
00:29:39,00:29:40,">> Oh, really?"
00:29:40,00:29:41,>> Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:42,">> Oh, thank God."
00:29:42,00:29:43,The parties are saved.
00:29:43,00:29:44,[ Laughter ]
00:29:44,00:29:45,">> No, it isn't."
00:29:45,00:29:46,The parties are saved.
00:29:46,00:29:47,>> It's really -- it's weird.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"It's the second most abundant element in the entire universe, but it's incredibly hard"
00:29:51,00:29:52,to keep here.
00:29:52,00:29:53,>> That's crazy.
00:29:53,00:29:56,">> If you look at the deposits of it, they're mostly deposits of rock that are capped with"
00:29:56,00:30:01,"some impermeable rock, so it's basically in a cave that you're looking for it."
00:30:01,00:30:02,>> Yeah.
00:30:02,00:30:03,>> Yeah.
00:30:03,00:30:05,Do you know the biggest amount of helium you can currently buy?
00:30:05,00:30:06,This is quite exciting.
00:30:06,00:30:07,">> Oh, okay."
00:30:07,00:30:08,>> This week.
00:30:08,00:30:09,This is really thrilling.
00:30:09,00:30:10,>> This week?
00:30:10,00:30:11,"Well, you would say they would come in those kind of canisters, right?"
00:30:11,00:30:12,>> Yep.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Yep.
00:30:13,00:30:14,>> A big one of those --
00:30:14,00:30:16,>> It's even bigger than that.
00:30:16,00:30:17,>> By weight?
00:30:17,00:30:18,Because --
00:30:18,00:30:22,">> Well, it's -- I'm going to tell you by volume and by length."
00:30:22,00:30:23,So --
00:30:23,00:30:24,>> Okay.
00:30:24,00:30:28,>> So we could work out the width of the depths from that.
00:30:28,00:30:29,>> This is GCSE math.
00:30:29,00:30:30,>> And you've just got a GCSE math.
00:30:30,00:30:31,Yeah.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"No, the USA have just announced -- this is really thrilling stuff."
00:30:34,00:30:39,They are just announcing they are selling off the entire federal helium system because
00:30:39,00:30:44,"they nationalized it really early on, like in the 1920 or so, because they needed airships."
00:30:44,00:30:47,"So they said we have to -- the government has to control the global supply, but we can"
00:30:47,00:30:48,now get in on it.
00:30:48,00:30:49,That's great news.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"So if they decided we don't really need airships anymore, so we might as well come in."
00:30:53,00:30:54,>> I don't know.
00:30:54,00:30:57,>> That was -- the Hindenburg wasn't able to use helium because of that global monopoly
00:30:57,00:30:58,was --
00:30:58,00:30:59,>> Exactly.
00:30:59,00:31:00,Yeah.
00:31:00,00:31:01,>> Exactly that.
00:31:01,00:31:02,">> Did you -- sorry, Andy, did you tell us the size of this?"
00:31:02,00:31:03,">> Actually, I didn't."
00:31:03,00:31:04,"Thank you very much, James."
00:31:04,00:31:05,So --
00:31:05,00:31:08,">> I could just tell that everyone in the room was like, ""But, Andy, what is the length"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"and the volume?"""
00:31:10,00:31:15,">> It includes -- thank you, James -- 700 kilometers of helium pipelines which are spread across"
00:31:15,00:31:20,"Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, but I'm sure they can move them for an extra fee."
00:31:20,00:31:25,"There's the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir, a 4,000-hectare rock formation, capped -- you'll"
00:31:25,00:31:31,"be glad to know -- by two layers of non-porous calcium and hydrite, and it is likely to contain"
00:31:31,00:31:34,65 million cubic meters of federally-owned crude helium.
00:31:34,00:31:39,">> And are they going to deliver this in convenient packages, or do they just say it's there,"
00:31:39,00:31:40,get it yourself?
00:31:40,00:31:43,">> Because you can't come, and you know, like if you go to a supermarket and they say"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"you do want a bag, and you're like, ""Well, I think I can fit it in these pockets."""
00:31:46,00:31:49,"You can't do that with that much helium, can you?"
00:31:49,00:31:50,">> No, no, no."
00:31:50,00:31:51,I'm not sure who's going to buy it or what for.
00:31:51,00:31:57,">> Well, we might for helium airships, because, bizarrely, the UK has just decided to start"
00:31:57,00:31:58,investing in them again.
00:31:58,00:31:59,>> Really?
00:31:59,00:32:00,>> Yeah.
00:32:00,00:32:06,"After a bit of a hiatus, and it's air nostrum, the -- it's a sister airline of BA, and it's"
00:32:06,00:32:11,"just put in a massive order for some helium airships, and, in fact, this venture is backed"
00:32:11,00:32:18,"by Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson, who I think he's pretty into flying, isn't"
00:32:18,00:32:19,he?
00:32:19,00:32:20,">> He's a pilot, yeah."
00:32:20,00:32:21,>> There you go.
00:32:21,00:32:22,That's why he's into flying.
00:32:22,00:32:25,"So, he's into this idea, and the idea is that it slashes a lot of carbon use, because we"
00:32:25,00:32:29,"could use them instead of aeroplanes, it'll slash carbon use by 90%."
00:32:29,00:32:34,"I liked the fact that quasi-quarting, the business secretary said, ""This is proof of"
00:32:34,00:32:41,"how the UK's businesses are embracing new technology."""
00:32:41,00:32:47,"Anyway, a prototype crash landed in 2016 on its second test, but it is going to be great,"
00:32:47,00:32:48,we're told.
00:32:48,00:32:49,">> Oh, boy."
00:32:49,00:32:50,"Wow, that's so good."
00:32:50,00:32:57,">> Who would win, this is an open question, in a conflict between an airship and a submarine?"
00:32:57,00:33:01,">> Well, it depends where the conflict takes place."
00:33:01,00:33:03,>> Fair play.
00:33:03,00:33:09,">> Let's make it a neutral territory, let's make it above water."
00:33:09,00:33:15,"You've got all the environments there apart from land, it's not on land."
00:33:15,00:33:16,>> Because this has happened.
00:33:16,00:33:17,">> Oh, has it?"
00:33:17,00:33:18,>> Yeah.
00:33:18,00:33:21,">> Specifically, though, as in they were pitted against each other."
00:33:21,00:33:25,">> No, it was during the Second World War, there wasn't time to set up like fun..."
00:33:25,00:33:28,>> It wasn't like Robot Wars.
00:33:28,00:33:33,">> It wasn't pay-per-view, airship versus submarine, okay."
00:33:33,00:33:38,">> So there were loads of US ships near the coast, which were sunk by German submarines"
00:33:38,00:33:42,"during the war, and there were ships which went in convoys that were protected by airships."
00:33:42,00:33:47,"You've got a ship on the sea, then an airship above it protecting because they can see when"
00:33:47,00:33:51,"a submarine is approaching, they can detect it, and then drop depth charges."
00:33:51,00:33:54,"You ordinarily wouldn't hit one, but it would just force the submarine to go lower and not"
00:33:54,00:34:00,"use its torpedoes, and of the 90,000 ships that were in convoys escorted by airships,"
00:34:00,00:34:06,"only one of them was ever sunk, but in 1943, a submarine fought a U-boat and the submarine"
00:34:06,00:34:07,won.
00:34:07,00:34:08,>> Really?
00:34:08,00:34:09,>> Yeah.
00:34:09,00:34:10,>> And what did it do?
00:34:10,00:34:12,">> Sorry, a submarine fought a U-boat, do you say?"
00:34:12,00:34:15,">> Yep, I got that wrong."
00:34:15,00:34:18,That would have been a completely ordinary thing to happen in 1943.
00:34:18,00:34:21,>> It's not the best fact you've ever had.
00:34:21,00:34:29,">> I did a submarine fight against an airship, how did they shoot it, like torpedoes wouldn't"
00:34:29,00:34:30,"go in the air, right?"
00:34:30,00:34:34,>> The account is quite vague on the method used.
00:34:34,00:34:37,"I'm sure it wasn't a torpedo, but I think I might have been firing from the surface,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,because I think I might have had surface guns.
00:34:38,00:34:40,>> I can't believe you don't know the answer.
00:34:40,00:34:44,">> I know, I'm sorry, I don't know who won, I just don't have a fucking match report,"
00:34:44,00:34:48,"you know, I'm sorry not to know."
00:34:48,00:34:53,">> If you take some helium and freeze it down to pretty much absolute zero just above it,"
00:34:53,00:34:59,"and you put it in a teacup, and you start stirring it, and you go away, and you come"
00:34:59,00:35:02,"back a million years later, it will still be stirring."
00:35:02,00:35:03,>> What?
00:35:03,00:35:04,>> That's so spooky.
00:35:04,00:35:05,>> I know.
00:35:05,00:35:08,">> It has no friction, doesn't it?"
00:35:08,00:35:09,>> Exactly.
00:35:09,00:35:12,">> It's like this amazing capacity, but only when it's right and you're absolute zero."
00:35:12,00:35:16,">> It's because it doesn't go, like most things as they get colder, if you remember, from"
00:35:16,00:35:21,"your GCSE chemistry, they turn into solids, helium doesn't turn into a solid no matter"
00:35:21,00:35:25,"how cold it gets, unless you put it under loads and loads of pressure, and so it just"
00:35:25,00:35:28,"has these amazing properties, like a superconductor would."
00:35:28,00:35:34,">> It also, if you leave it in a glass and you bring it right down, A, it'll fall through"
00:35:34,00:35:42,"the glass, so like because, because it doesn't undergo friction at all, every tiny molecule"
00:35:42,00:35:45,"sized hole in your glass, like I'm holding a glass now, there are molecule sized holes"
00:35:45,00:35:49,"in it, most liquids stay in that because friction is holding them in, helium, when it's liquid,"
00:35:49,00:35:55,"will just slip through, and it will climb up the sides of the glass, because gravity"
00:35:55,00:36:00,"doesn't work the same way, gravity's not strong enough to hold it down, it's magic."
00:36:00,00:36:04,Can I quickly tell you my favourite helium story I've ever read?
00:36:04,00:36:12,"1999, headline was, helium blew women up like a balloon, she was fine, by the way, I just"
00:36:12,00:36:22,"said the solid lips, she wasn't fine, she had a bad day, she was called, she was called"
00:36:22,00:36:27,"Samantha Munn, she owned a toy shop, she was standing on a stepladder in her toy shop,"
00:36:27,00:36:34,"she slipped off, and she was speared by the metal spike, which was in a helium tank, in"
00:36:34,00:36:41,"her left thigh, thank God for that, and she looked down and she saw her left thigh and"
00:36:41,00:36:47,"her stomach inflate like a balloon, they managed to get her to a hospital, where they extracted"
00:36:47,00:36:58,"her from the helium tank, did she just kind of go, around the room, we don't have any"
00:36:58,00:37:03,"beds for this patient, we'll just rubber it against your head and stick it to the wall."
00:37:03,00:37:07,"Wouldn't it be great as well, because this was in a toy shop where they sell balloons"
00:37:07,00:37:14,"to the brand of kid, can I get this mum, for an hour she's been walking around the shopping"
00:37:14,00:37:15,mall.
00:37:15,00:37:21,This is just the kind of joke she dreaded happening after this story.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"She's fine now, right?"
00:37:22,00:37:27,"She's fine, they said a doctor x-rayed her left thigh, which showed that it was about"
00:37:27,00:37:30,"twice the size of her right, which I would argue you could tell without an x-ray."
00:37:30,00:37:40,"Time for our final fact for the show, and that is my fact."
00:37:40,00:37:48,"My fact this week is if you look up humour on Wikipedia, the first thing you'll see"
00:37:48,00:38:07,"is a picture of my face, and this is something that as of the 21st of August, someone changed"
00:38:07,00:38:12,"the photo on the article for humour, and very randomly they don't know who I am, they've"
00:38:12,00:38:17,"made that very clear in their comment, going, I have no idea who this person is, if anyone's"
00:38:17,00:38:22,"got a better picture, please replace it, but it hasn't been replaced, and I now find myself"
00:38:22,00:38:26,the global face of humour.
00:38:26,00:38:34,"And in the photo, it's not just me, there's someone else, so the wording, the caption"
00:38:34,00:38:40,"underneath is a viewer brackets Jimmy Wales left laughing at a comedian, Dan Schreiber"
00:38:40,00:38:44,"right performing stand-up comedian, if you don't know who Jimmy Wales is, Jimmy Wales"
00:38:44,00:38:53,"is the creator of Wikipedia, which is basically like making God laugh, right?"
00:38:53,00:38:56,So this is a very exciting development.
00:38:56,00:39:01,I imagine God's laughing a lot when he's looking over at you.
00:39:01,00:39:03,Now that is really cool.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"I don't know, if you ever needed evidence that Wikipedia's an unreliable source, I think"
00:39:07,00:39:09,you're looking at it.
00:39:09,00:39:12,"I wasn't there on this day, Dan."
00:39:12,00:39:13,You weren't?
00:39:13,00:39:15,"So why are you not in the picture, Andy?"
00:39:15,00:39:20,"I don't know, but I did look up the Wikipedia for Wanker recently, and very upsettingly,"
00:39:20,00:39:25,"no, no, no, but this was a thing called Wikimania, where they sort of have an annual conference"
00:39:25,00:39:30,"all about Wikipedia and Wikipedians, and they have seminars, and they have fun quizzes,"
00:39:30,00:39:36,"and yeah, Andy and I were actually at the Edinburgh Fringe when it was on, it was down"
00:39:36,00:39:41,"in London, and I had this idea called Wikipedia the missing bits, and the idea was to do a"
00:39:41,00:39:47,stand-up show where a comedian would come up and present a set on a missing page on Wikipedia
00:39:47,00:39:51,"and their pitch for what should be involved in it, and Jimmy Wales came up, and actually"
00:39:51,00:39:53,"Jimmy came on stage with you, Andy, and did a quiz."
00:39:53,00:39:58,"Yeah, yeah, no one apparently took a fucking photo."
00:39:58,00:40:01,Didn't you try to edit Wikipedia on the way down to say something about yourself?
00:40:01,00:40:06,"No, there was a comedian who was on the show that day called Steve Cross, who was complaining"
00:40:06,00:40:10,"that he doesn't have a Wikipedia page, so I created a page where I could put his name"
00:40:10,00:40:15,"on, which was People Who Don't Have Wikipedia Pages, and he was the first on the list, but"
00:40:15,00:40:16,it got taken down immediately.
00:40:16,00:40:21,"It was within a minute or something, it was amazingly fast editing by the people at Wikipedia."
00:40:21,00:40:26,"All the four of us have Wikipedia pages, right, and I had a quick look at the editing online,"
00:40:26,00:40:33,because there's been a few times where comments that have been made on this show have made
00:40:33,00:40:38,"their way onto my Wikipedia, and I've had to go in, and I've complained about it, and"
00:40:38,00:40:43,"no one changes it, so I've had to physically edit my change into it, and I'm now banned"
00:40:43,00:40:48,"from Wikipedia, yeah, before editing my own page for factual accuracy."
00:40:48,00:40:55,"So one of the things was, someone changed my name on it to Daniel Indiana, Craig Schreiber,"
00:40:55,00:40:59,"because I once said that I almost changed my name to Daniel Indiana, to Indiana is my"
00:40:59,00:41:04,"middle name, so for a while on Wikipedia it was Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber, Brackets,"
00:41:04,00:41:15,"Dix, which is what James said on the podcast, is what's made it on, then a few years later,"
00:41:15,00:41:20,"I had to change that, a few years later, Andy makes a joke, and it's a joke that I have"
00:41:20,00:41:27,"an interest in, sort of, we were talking about Nazism, and stuff like that, you're an avid"
00:41:27,00:41:28,collector.
00:41:28,00:41:36,"Daniel Indiana Craig Schreiber, aka Dix, is a radio producer living in the United Kingdom,"
00:41:36,00:41:42,others have claimed him to have an extreme fascination and an expertise in Nazism and
00:41:42,00:41:44,Nazi sacred myths.
00:41:44,00:41:50,I hate to think what it's going to say about Heria-nesses after tonight's show.
00:41:50,00:41:59,"And then some other dick put this on, I found this because this was in an edit, it said,"
00:41:59,00:42:04,"""Remove incorrect statement, Schreiber is not particularly noted for this catchphrase,"""
00:42:04,00:42:09,"and then what originally was put into my account was, ""Schreiber is famous for his hilarious"
00:42:09,00:42:18,"catchphrase,"" yep, which he uses after Twitter handles are announced on no such thing as"
00:42:18,00:42:19,a fish.
00:42:19,00:42:25,"It's such a good catchphrase, though, because you've called it like, ""That's a biggie,"""
00:42:25,00:42:31,"that's a huge word, oh my God, that's so good."
00:42:31,00:42:36,"On Wikipedia pages, often it says, ""Notable people,"" so if you had Bolton, for instance,"
00:42:36,00:42:41,"it might be notable people from Bolton, I thought I'd check where we are, if any of"
00:42:41,00:42:44,"those things, so this is all that I could find."
00:42:44,00:42:51,"I am mentioned in ""Notable people"" with Afantasia, because I don't have like a mind's eye, so"
00:42:51,00:42:52,I'm in that.
00:42:52,00:42:55,"So James can't picture your face if you leave, he can't remember your face, that's all."
00:42:55,00:42:59,Uranus on the other hand?
00:42:59,00:43:01,"Photographic, absolutely."
00:43:01,00:43:07,"Dan is mentioned as a notable Australian in the United Kingdom, and Anna is a notable"
00:43:07,00:43:17,"person in the Poles in the United Kingdom, as in people from Poland."
00:43:17,00:43:20,Andy Murray is a notable tennis player.
00:43:20,00:43:21,Wow.
00:43:21,00:43:25,"I'm not joking, I genuinely searched, and I didn't find that phrase."
00:43:25,00:43:28,Thank you for looking.
00:43:28,00:43:35,"There was a thing, so the editing can be used for good and for ill, as we've clearly seen"
00:43:35,00:43:39,"from Dan's extensive list of grievances that he just read out, but a couple of years ago"
00:43:39,00:43:43,there was a bloke in Australia who was a really big fan of a band called Peaking Duck.
00:43:43,00:43:48,"He was a bloke called David Spargo, and he was going to see them at a gig, and he really"
00:43:48,00:43:54,"wanted to get backstage to see them, and so he changed the Wikipedia page of the band"
00:43:54,00:44:00,"Peaking Duck, creating an entry for family and listing himself as a family member."
00:44:00,00:44:03,"And then when he got to the backstage bit of the gig, he said to the guys, ""No, no,"
00:44:03,00:44:07,"I'm their step-brother or cousin or whatever, show that to the security guys who let him"
00:44:07,00:44:08,"in."""
00:44:08,00:44:09,Genius.
00:44:09,00:44:14,"And the band just gave him a beer and said, ""Fair play, that's a very funny thing you've"
00:44:14,00:44:15,"done."""
00:44:15,00:44:22,"They said, ""I love this so much,"" they said, ""He wasn't creepy at all, and was actually"
00:44:22,00:44:26,"much more relaxed and cool than we would have expected from someone who went to those lengths."""
00:44:26,00:44:28,That's so good.
00:44:28,00:44:30,"The band hasn't been seen since then, has it?"
00:44:30,00:44:35,"You know on Wikipedia how there are multiple language Wikipedia's, and so there may be"
00:44:35,00:44:40,"a translation of no such thing as a fish into, I don't know, Mandarin, for example, or whatever"
00:44:40,00:44:41,languages there are.
00:44:41,00:44:47,"So there's a list of the articles where people and things have been the most translated,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,so it's the leaderboard of that.
00:44:49,00:44:54,"So in terms of humans that are on that leaderboard, the top people are, the most translations"
00:44:54,00:44:56,is for Jesus.
00:44:56,00:44:58,Third is for Michael Jackson.
00:44:58,00:45:00,Third is for Barack Obama.
00:45:00,00:45:02,Fourth is for Donald Trump.
00:45:02,00:45:03,Fifth is for Adolf Hitler.
00:45:03,00:45:06,Sixth is for Albert Einstein.
00:45:06,00:45:07,Who do you think is seventh?
00:45:07,00:45:08,Is that Andy?
00:45:08,00:45:09,Please.
00:45:09,00:45:14,"I need this, Dan."
00:45:14,00:45:17,"I would have liked someone like Harry Potter, perhaps, or..."
00:45:17,00:45:18,It's got to be a real person.
00:45:18,00:45:19,Mr Bean?
00:45:19,00:45:20,"Oh, Rowan Atkinson."
00:45:20,00:45:21,"Oh, Rowan Atkinson."
00:45:21,00:45:22,Rowan Atkinson.
00:45:22,00:45:23,"Same answer, yeah."
00:45:23,00:45:24,Yeah.
00:45:24,00:45:25,Is it another world leader?
00:45:25,00:45:26,No.
00:45:26,00:45:34,"And I called Corbin Blue, BLEU, who was initially at the time a supporting actor from the movie"
00:45:34,00:45:44,"High School Musical, who, one enthusiastic fan, translated his account into every single"
00:45:44,00:45:50,"language that he could, as using Google Translate and stuff like that, giving him over 200 different"
00:45:50,00:45:53,languages of translation.
00:45:53,00:46:01,"So, he's just behind Albert Einstein, Julius Caesar's behind him, but it's, yeah, and it's"
00:46:01,00:46:03,the theory that it's one person who's been doing that.
00:46:03,00:46:04,That's amazing.
00:46:04,00:46:05,"So, we just think..."
00:46:05,00:46:10,"Because it sounds like that person is in tonight, if we do want to ask."
00:46:10,00:46:11,God people have a lot of time.
00:46:11,00:46:17,"Like, so, on languages on Wikipedia, actually, there is a Scots language Wikipedia section."
00:46:17,00:46:23,"It's got 41,000 articles, as in Scots, the sort of language Robbie Burns, kind of, some"
00:46:23,00:46:27,"people will say it's a dialect of English, some people say it's its own language, but"
00:46:27,00:46:28,you know the one.
00:46:28,00:46:34,"Anyway, people started to notice that some of the Scots language articles were not entirely"
00:46:34,00:46:37,"correct in terms of not really being written in the Scots language, they were really written"
00:46:37,00:46:42,"in a parody version of it, or what someone who didn't actually speak the language might"
00:46:42,00:46:47,"guess that it sounded like, and it turned out, it's because almost half of the articles"
00:46:47,00:46:52,had been written by a teenager in North Carolina who did not speak a word of Scots.
00:46:52,00:46:58,"It's the most odd story, and he started off doing it, he was 12, I think, when he started"
00:46:58,00:46:59,doing it.
00:46:59,00:47:02,What a strange kid.
00:47:02,00:47:09,"And they started at the top, all with the warning, ""The Scots that was oozed in this"
00:47:09,00:47:16,"article was written be a body that's Mithra-Tung, is now Scots."
00:47:16,00:47:22,"Please improve this article, Guinea Can, which I think is translated as, this is all bollocks,"
00:47:22,00:47:23,"please improve it."""
00:47:23,00:47:27,"But then he took that away, and it was only a couple of years ago, it was revealed that"
00:47:27,00:47:33,"it was just this boy in North Carolina who, I know, because then he felt so bad about"
00:47:33,00:47:34,it.
00:47:34,00:47:35,He felt so bad about it.
00:47:35,00:47:36,"He hasn't been named, I think, which is good."
00:47:36,00:47:40,"Now, we know his Wikipedia name, which is Amaryllis Gardiner, but I don't know if you"
00:47:40,00:47:43,can track him down with that.
00:47:43,00:47:46,"And very sweetly, because a lot of people said we should scrap the whole Scots language"
00:47:46,00:47:50,"page, the Michael Dempster, who's director of the Scots Language Center, said, ""Look,"
00:47:50,00:47:54,this kid's put in an incredible amount of work.
00:47:54,00:48:01,"It's a great resource, but it does need people who are literate in Scots to edit it now."""
00:48:01,00:48:02,So get on it.
00:48:02,00:48:10,"The editing of Wikipedia is such a hotly contested area, the behind-the-scenes of it is just"
00:48:10,00:48:11,constant fights going on.
00:48:11,00:48:16,"One of the famous ones, which probably a lot of people here know about, is there is a page"
00:48:16,00:48:25,"for a guy who's called Guy Standing, and in the photo, Guy Standing is sitting."
00:48:25,00:48:28,"So the caption reads, ""Guy Standing, sitting."""
00:48:28,00:48:29,Beautiful.
00:48:29,00:48:30,That's great.
00:48:30,00:48:37,"It's great, except it's a very contentious photo, which has now been edited away, brought"
00:48:37,00:48:39,back because people are saying you're making fun.
00:48:39,00:48:43,"This is an obvious joke, and we're not about jokes here, we're about information."
00:48:43,00:48:47,"So if you want jokes, head over to Dan Schreiber on the human point."
00:48:47,00:48:52,"I just have one or two things about stock photos, because this is a stock photo, this"
00:48:52,00:48:57,"is a public use photo, but the stock photo libraries that exist, they lead to all sorts"
00:48:57,00:48:59,of weird quirks and tangents.
00:48:59,00:49:06,"So for example, in 2019, the New Zealand budget featured stock photos, a stock photo model"
00:49:06,00:49:09,"on the front of it, and it turned out to be a woman called Vicky Freeman, who just had"
00:49:09,00:49:12,the picture taken and just sold the rights to it.
00:49:12,00:49:16,"Anyway, she had moved to Australia because she could no longer afford to live in New"
00:49:16,00:49:21,"Zealand, and was on the front page of the New Zealand budget document, all about making"
00:49:21,00:49:22,life affordable.
00:49:22,00:49:25,"And you don't really have many options, normally."
00:49:25,00:49:28,"You can sometimes say, ""I don't want to be used to advertise an extreme political"
00:49:28,00:49:31,"view,"" or whatever, but you often just have no rights at all."
00:49:31,00:49:38,"So in 2014, a woman called Samantha Ovens had years before done a photo shoot for colds"
00:49:38,00:49:39,and illnesses.
00:49:39,00:49:43,"You know, those sort of cold remedy photos, where you just have to pinch your brow and"
00:49:43,00:49:45,"look a bit pained, or look a bit..."
00:49:45,00:49:46,Yeah.
00:49:46,00:49:49,"...like you're having a slightly, ""Oh, I've got a bit of a cold or a headache,"" or whatever."
00:49:49,00:49:54,"Anyway, that then got used as the lead on a Guardian article, a confessional article"
00:49:54,00:50:01,"blind, ""I fantasise about group sex with old obese men,"" and she just found people started"
00:50:01,00:50:04,"contacting her, saying, ""You're right, Samantha."""
00:50:04,00:50:09,A lot of old men getting in touch.
00:50:09,00:50:11,"Honestly, Sam, see you dance, mate."
00:50:11,00:50:13,"I'm going to have to wrap this up very shortly, guys."
00:50:13,00:50:14,I know.
00:50:14,00:50:15,We're nearing the end.
00:50:15,00:50:16,Could I tell you one funny thing?
00:50:16,00:50:17,Yeah.
00:50:17,00:50:18,I saw...
00:50:18,00:50:24,"Which is that, following one of the Football World Cups, Seth Blatter, who was the FIFA"
00:50:24,00:50:30,"president, he was awarded this beautiful award, the Order of Companions of OR Tambo, for his"
00:50:30,00:50:35,"contribution to the World Cup, and to announce it, the South African government put it on"
00:50:35,00:50:42,"their webpage, but unfortunately, they took his name and details from his Wikipedia page,"
00:50:42,00:50:44,which had just been vandalised.
00:50:44,00:50:54,"And so, what they announced on their website was an award for Joseph Sepp Bellend Blatter."
00:50:54,00:51:01,"That is it, that is all of our facts."
