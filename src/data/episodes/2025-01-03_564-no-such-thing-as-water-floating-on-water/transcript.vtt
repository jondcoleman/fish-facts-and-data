00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.560
 - Hi everyone, Merry Christmas and a happy new year

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.200
 from all of us at No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.360
 Hope you had a nice Christmas.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 If not, I hope it was manageable at least

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.880
 and I hope we're all looking forward to

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.040
 what is in store for 2025.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.600
 We've taken a little bit of a break this week

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.360
 after a very, very busy year

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.320
 where we've written all sorts of books

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200
 and been on tour around the world

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.960
 and what we have for you instead of a normal episode

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.680
 is a compilation of the best bits

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.600
 that didn't quite make it into the show

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.440
 from our UK, Ireland and Sweden leg of our tour.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.560
 So what you'll get here is lots of silly things

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.880
 that didn't quite fit in the show.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.840
 You get loads and loads of extra facts.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.320
 Really hope you enjoy it.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.480
 But I don't really wanna keep up any more of your time

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.840
 so all I'll say is happy new year and on with the podcast.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.420
 (upbeat music)

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.020
 (upbeat music)

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:14.780
 - We ran out of QI by himself.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.620
 - Yeah.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.500
 - Which was No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.660
 - No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.220
 - No, seriously, it's in the OX office.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.260
 - From the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.100
 - And then at the end,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.220
 it turns out you get to run over by a train.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.300
 - Let me just do one more thing about Mars.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.860
 - Oh my God, I'm surrounded by idiots.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.440
 (upbeat music)

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.020
 (upbeat music)

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.600
 (upbeat music)

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.180
 (upbeat music)

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.760
 (upbeat music)

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.340
 (upbeat music)

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.920
 (upbeat music)

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.500
 (upbeat music)

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.080
 (upbeat music)

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.660
 (upbeat music)

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.240
 (upbeat music)

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:18.740
 (upbeat music)

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:27.100
 - Good evening and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.000
 Are you ready for the show?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.740
 (audience cheering)

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.260
 Then please welcome to the stage,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.520
 No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.460
 (audience cheering)

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.780
 - Hi everyone.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.780
 (audience cheering)

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.220
 Wow.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.260
 - Holy moly.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.100
 - Hey guys.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.460
 Thanks so much for coming.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.800
 - Hello.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.440
 - How are you guys doing?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.660
 (audience cheering)

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.960
 Let's do this.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.440
 Welcome to our 10 year anniversary show.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.400
 Tonight is gonna be a party.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.340
 It's gonna be an awesome night.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.240
 We're gonna be celebrating your facts as well.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.200
 You've sent a bunch in.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.320
 Thank you very much.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.900
 James, you've been collecting them, right?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.680
 - Yes, I've got a few here.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.280
 For instance, Napoleon fell in love with Josephine

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.880
 because she could do a naughty act called the zigzags.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.840
 And nobody knows what the zigzags were.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.040
 - Wow.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.180
 Really?

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.620
 - Well, according to random person who texted me.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620
 - Wow.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.620
 - And there's no better sauce than that.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.200
 Can we get the lights up on the audience, please?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.880
 Oh, hello.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.720
 - Oh.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.560
 - Oh, wow.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.600
 Oh, you guys are much more attractive

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.140
 than I thought you were gonna be.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.300
 (audience laughing)

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.960
 Okay, here is a fact sent by someone in this room.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.040
 This is brilliant, actually.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.640
 Between Heathrow and Rome, from takeoff to touchdown,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.320
 the flight time is the exact run length time

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.400
 of the 2000 film "Gladiator."

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240
 If you've got a window seat on the right side of the plane,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.840
 you'll be flying over the Colosseum as Maximus and Commodus

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960
 enter the arena for the final battle.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.880
 - Fuck off.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.720
 - That's great.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.560
 - That's amazing.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 - That's great.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.560
 - Wow.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.400
 Isn't that great?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.360
 - Very good thing.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.740
 - The blue whale produces the largest fart bubble.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.880
 (audience laughing)

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.520
 It's so large, a zebra who makes the loudest fart

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.600
 can fit in it.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.680
 (audience laughing)

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.560
 - Oh, gold.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.520
 - In Tudor, England, there was a type of criminal

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.640
 called a bear top trickster.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.600
 A woman would flash her breasts to lure men into a house.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.680
 Once he'd come inside, brackets, the house,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.720
 he would be robbed.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.480
 (audience laughing)

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.320
 - He would be what?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.160
 - Robbed.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160
 - Oh, he would be robbed.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.000
 - Oh, okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.820
 - That's very cool.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.320
 - Yeah, the funny bit was the brackets bit, really.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.000
 That's good, thanks.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.200
 When dragonflies get tired, they suck water up their bum

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.920
 and jet it out to propel themselves forward.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.160
 (audience laughing)

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.440
 - That's so cool.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.280
 - It's funny 'cause I would have thought

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.960
 that's quite tiring in itself.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.440
 - It does feel tiring, doesn't it?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.280
 - Yeah.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.920
 - I'm just clenching now, and yeah, yeah.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.160
 - Have you guys read about a story I love last year

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.740
 is about probably the two most influential writers,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.860
 academics, who write about honesty,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.640
 who have released a bunch of papers.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.000
 We definitely have come across them in our work.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.860
 They released a very famous paper

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.560
 sort of showing that basically,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.400
 if you nudge people a certain way,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.000
 they'll be more honest.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.080
 So, for instance, in a dinner.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.960
 - Which part of their body do you have to touch?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.980
 (audience laughing)

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.820
 - No one did that.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.080
 It's against sort of like study principles,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.560
 but if you have to sign a bit at the top

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.840
 of your tax return that says,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.020
 "I promise I've told the truth,"

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.440
 rather than at the bottom,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.740
 the study showed that people are more honest

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.180
 'cause they've just signed this.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.600
 The thing is, these two famous people,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.880
 one of whom, Dan Ariely, wrote a book called

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.280
 The Honest Truth About Dishonesty,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.680
 were cheating in the paper, allegedly, I have to say,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.640
 but were cheated in the paper,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.040
 and the data was falsified.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.880
 And not only falsified, but falsified in a way

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.000
 that even I could tell because it's in two different fonts.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 (audience laughing)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.960
 They just, the data that was true was in Calibri font,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.140
 and then there was a bunch of Cambria thrown in.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.980
 (audience laughing)

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.040
 - Hey, I found the equivalent

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.320
 to the American movie, 127 Hours.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.640
 You know where Ann Rolston gets stuck

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.760
 while he's out on his own,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.440
 and his arm gets trapped underneath a boulder.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.880
 He eventually has to chop off his arm

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.720
 in order to survive,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.880
 and he does that 127 hours into it.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.440
 So I found the British edition of it.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.860
 It should be called 60 Hours.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.720
 This is a man called Joe Galliat from Yoval in Somerset,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.360
 who spent two days underneath his sofa after it fell on him,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.560
 and he couldn't get out of it

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.200
 because he had a few back problems,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.640
 and he only survived because when the sofa fell over,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.600
 a bottle of whiskey rolled towards him,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.840
 (audience laughing)

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.120
 and he survived sipping whiskey for two days.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.960
 - What kind of substance?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.080
 - Until a neighbor noticed

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.000
 that his curtains hadn't moved in two days

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.680
 and thought something's wrong with Joe,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.040
 and they went and they found him,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.960
 and then he survived.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.360
 He spent five days in hospital,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.880
 but he said he was there for two whole days.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.040
 And at first he said, I took a sip of the whiskey,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.040
 and I thought, oh, well, this isn't too bad.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.040
 (audience laughing)

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.560
 - What are they called?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.480
 The door sausages.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.320
 - Yeah, door sausages.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.360
 - What are they called?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.320
 - Trapped excluders.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.160
 - Yes.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.120
 - Door sausages, is that what you mean?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.400
 (audience laughing)

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.360
 - Another insight into the Murray home life.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.880
 (audience laughing)

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.920
 Another veil ripped away

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.520
 from my carefully crafted persona.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.440
 (audience laughing)

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440
 Oh, well.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.760
 - I have to go as a translator

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.560
 whenever you go to DFS, don't I, Andy?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.600
 (audience laughing)

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.760
 He wants one of those brown marshmallow sitting things.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.480
 Sofa, yeah, he wants a sofa.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.520
 - Wow, what's James Harkin?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.440
 - Oh, there are no anagrams of that.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440
 (audience laughing)

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.440
 - Hey, speaking of storytellers from overseas.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.240
 Surely Shane Jerkin.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.840
 No, does that work?

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.280
 - Wow, you just did that?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.840
 - Well, I don't know if it's right.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.760
 (audience laughing)

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.720
 Come back in a few minutes.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.360
 (audience laughing)

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.040
 So there's another thing which happens around the world,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.080
 which, okay, no, let's just pause and watch Andy write.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.440
 (audience laughing)

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.560
 - No, oh. - Use the E twice.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.400
 (imitates sound)

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.240
 It worked.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.120
 No, it's Shane Jerkin.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.440
 (audience laughing)

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.640
 - I worked at some more.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.840
 (audience laughing)

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.040
 - You know who was one of the most rich people in America

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.200
 off the back of Beavers?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.040
 Was John Jacob Astor.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.520
 And he became a billionaire,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.240
 and he's a name that a few of you might be going,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.120
 "John Jacob Astor, how do I know that name?"

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.160
 He was at the time of the sinking of the Titanic,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.040
 possibly the richest man in America,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.440
 maybe even the world,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.760
 and he's one of the men who died on the Titanic.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.640
 And so his fortune was largely about Beavers.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.840
 And when I read that, I just thought,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.520
 I do wonder if in the final seconds of his life,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.240
 if he thought, "Friendly, we had a bunch of Beavers here,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.480
 "and we could have plugged this whole up in instinct."

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.800
 - Yeah.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.080
 - What do you think?

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.480
 - Maybe, maybe that was his final thought.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.200
 Or maybe, oh, I wish I'd worn my entire full body

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.800
 Beaver onesie tonight, and then I could just swim away.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.640
 - Yes.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.000
 - I think that's weighing you down.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
 I do.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.800
 I think even lying on that door is not gonna keep you up

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.920
 if you're wearing the full Beaver onesie.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.280
 - This is how I'd use my time travel moment.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.720
 If I got one time in a machine, that's where I'd go.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.920
 Not to save him, just to go,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.080
 "Andy and I have a bit of a bet going."

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.760
 (audience laughing)

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.600
 - Actually, did you know that,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.200
 sorry, speaking of ambassadors and names,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.080
 that the U.S. ambassador to Denmark

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.760
 used to be called Dick Sweat?

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.560
 (audience laughing)

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.040
 And there was, this is 1998, 2001.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.240
 - When this goes out, someone who knows it's going,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.080
 "Dick, you made, you were on, no such thing as a fish,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.920
 "you gotta have a listen."

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.840
 - No, I don't know why they're laughing at your name.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.560
 (audience laughing)

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.800
 - They must have cut out the interesting bit

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.000
 they said about you afterwards.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.240
 (audience laughing)

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.080
 - Yes, he was.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.200
 His opponent actually campaigned to have his name removed

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.480
 from the ballot paper 'cause he said,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.200
 "In the phone book, he's listed as Lantos Sweat,

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.920
 "so it's not legally correct."

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.320
 But obviously, his opponents just worried

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.800
 that everyone's gonna vote for Dick Sweat

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.640
 if they see it, right?

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.880
 I like, there was a guy called Soren Sorensen Adams

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.920
 who invented a type of itching powder

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.320
 which basically transformed the world of jokes, right?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.040
 - Like this guy, I can't believe he's not a name

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.160
 that I have known before this.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.840
 He did itching powder, he did the--

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.680
 - The joy buzzer.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.000
 - The joy buzzer in your hand.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 - He did, what did he do?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.640
 He did sneezing powder.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.640
 - The squirting flower.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.600
 - Squirting flower, the guy was a genius.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.680
 - He refused to do the whoopie cushion.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.520
 - Did he?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.880
 - He said that was vulgar.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.720
 - Wow.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.560
 - Yeah.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.080
 - And this was the man behind the dirty Fido

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.640
 plastic toy thing.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.480
 - What's that?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.720
 - That's the sort of fake dog poo.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.280
 - Oh yeah, and then fake vomit, he did as well.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.120
 - Did fake vomit?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.600
 And he said, no, whoopie cushion is too far.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.080
 So they went elsewhere.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.960
 - One of your earliest facts down was that whoopie cushion

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.120
 was invented by a great ancient Roman.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.720
 So for him to say that was lowbrow.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.400
 - Oh, come on, you know, it's credited to an emperor

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.920
 called Elagabalus, but his birth name was Bacianus.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.280
 (audience laughing)

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.520
 The whoopie cushion was invented by Bacianus.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.080
 Like, it's the greatest fact that I've ever,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.320
 I feel like I was the first person to notice it.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.240
 Like--

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.840
 - Unbelievable, the classical scholars

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.360
 haven't pointed that out before.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.280
 (audience laughing)

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.120
 - Fools.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.480
 - How many people do you think you could fit in a phone box?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.320
 - Oh, that's good.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.480
 - 'Cause this was a thing, wasn't it?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.280
 In the 1950s and '60s.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.120
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.200
 - Sort of classic red wall.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.080
 - You would get one of these classic phone boxes.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.960
 You would stuff as many students in as you can.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.440
 Well, they would stuff themselves in.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.280
 You wouldn't be able to do that.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.720
 - It was 'cause it was before the age of group Zoom calls,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.560
 wasn't it?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.280
 (all laughing)

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.760
 - What ages are we talking here?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.600
 Like, are we allowed--

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.560
 - They tended to be students,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.880
 so there would have been, I guess, teenagers.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.920
 - But you look down on if there's a tiny corner left

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.200
 and you shove a one-year-old in there.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.040
 Like, is that--

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.320
 (audience laughing)

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.480
 - Well, this is the interesting thing.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.280
 Like, there were loads of different rules,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.120
 but the official rules, basically,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.400
 you had to be more or less adult-sized.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.600
 You had to get at least part of the greater portion

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.520
 of your body into a standard upright phone booth.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.200
 - I'm going to say low ball and say three.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.160
 (all laughing)

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.000
 - Ooh, yeah, two.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.280
 (all laughing)

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.120
 - Nine.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.800
 - I'm going to say 15.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.160
 - Okay, well, the answer,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.120
 the official record from March 20th, 1959, was 25.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.960
 - Whoa! - Whoa!

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.000
 - But there was a Canadian school

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.040
 that claimed to have got 40 students in a phone box,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.960
 but it was later found that they'd turned it on its side

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.520
 and they used a much larger phone box than normal.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.760
 (all laughing)

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.640
 So then they put the official rules in,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.120
 and the really amazing thing is that only in England,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.840
 they had an additional rule

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.840
 that as well as all getting in there,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.360
 the group had to be able to either place

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.600
 or answer a phone call while they were in there.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.200
 - Amazing. - So good.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.960
 (all laughing)

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.760
 - In 2011, Chinese magician called Fu Yandong

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.360
 his pièce de résistance was six goldfish

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.880
 doing synchronized swimming.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.720
 (all laughing)

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.560
 - Really?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.160
 - Yeah, 53 different animal rights groups complained

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.920
 (all laughing)

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.080
 saying it is quite clearly magnets in their stomachs

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.760
 and they are being interviewed.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.880
 - Oh, God!

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.720
 - Yeah.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.000
 - Oh, my God. - Oh, God, Andy.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.520
 - Do they check Olympians for that, for magnets?

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.960
 (all laughing)

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.480
 - Do you know that Simon Cowell and Ricky Gervais

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.760
 look like Stonehenge?

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.960
 - This is according to the clothing company, Jackamo,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.200
 who made the thing called the architecture of man.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.560
 And this doesn't really make any sense,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.120
 but apparently to train their staff,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.280
 they would choose famous people

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.280
 and say what monuments they look like.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.320
 And that supposedly would help their staff

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.720
 work out people's sizes.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.920
 I know, it doesn't make any sense at all.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.320
 - Why do you just say you look a bit like Ricky Gervais?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.960
 - Why goes through the needless answer to the step of,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.560
 you look like Stone7 from Stonehenge?

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.400
 - I reckon probably less people would be insulted

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.920
 by saying they look like Stonehenge

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.080
 than they look like Ricky Gervais.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.920
 - Very true.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.840
 - Perhaps.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.360
 But yeah, so Ricky Gervais and Simon Cowell

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.680
 look like Stonehenge.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.520
 Russell Crowe and Jay-Z look like the Tine Bridge.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.840
 And James Corden looks like the Gherkin.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.160
 (all laughing)

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.480
 - That's amazing.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.640
 - Sorry, personal addings though.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.640
 But my friend, we were at a party once,

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.920
 you guys know him, and he was a packed party

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.760
 and he really needed the toilet.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.400
 And the window that was at the room led to an alleyway.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.600
 So he thought there's no one going to be walking there.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.280
 So he opened up the window and he peed out the window, right?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.600
 And about five minutes later the door gets kicked

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.920
 into the room and this soaked man comes walking in,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.560
 going, who fucking pissed on me?

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.800
 And we all had to go, that didn't happen here, I don't know.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.680
 But it's really hard to keep a straight face

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.800
 when a man soaked in urine is angry at you.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.640
 - Sorry, that man must have stood still.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.480
 - I don't know.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.800
 - Underneath.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.960
 What sounds like quite a thick shower of urine.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.760
 - I never questioned why he was so soaked, yeah.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.720
 - Speak up your reaction.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.800
 - Who did that?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.440
 That's not in my life, you.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.480
 Give me your number.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.320
 - Oh God.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.840
 Wow, wow.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.880
 - If you're itching, you know why it's scratching works.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.840
 It's kind of interesting this.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.680
 - Oh yeah?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.160
 - I'm not sure it's funny, but it is interesting, okay.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.840
 Basically you scratch it and your body thinks

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.840
 that something bad is happening to you

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.720
 and that is more important than the itch itself.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.000
 And so the scratch sort of blocks off

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.960
 the pathways to your brain.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.680
 So you've got a little itch, you scratch

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.120
 and your body thinks, oh my God, someone's scratching me.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.240
 And then it concentrates way more on that

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.880
 than it does on the itch itself.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.600
 What that means is if you have an itch,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.920
 it also works if you tickle yourself.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.080
 And it also works if you press down on it

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.520
 or if you put something cold on it, it all does the same thing.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.160
 - So we could have been tickling ourselves all these years

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.360
 rather than scratching.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.200
 - Exactly.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.520
 - Well there's even been studies that if you have an itch

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.680
 on one side, it likes you on your left side of your body,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.840
 if you look in a mirror and you scratch

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.120
 the other side of your body because it has the idea

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.600
 that then you will get rid of the itch, yeah.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.680
 - Does that work for everyone or just idiots?

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.520
 (audience laughing)

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.120
 - Well, it works for idiots and me because I tested it

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.880
 and it does work.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.400
 We sort of have Beethoven to thank for CDs.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.240
 Not the entire technology, but one very important bit,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.040
 which is the reason that CDs are the diameter that they are

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.120
 and the length of time that they can take on as a recording

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.760
 is because the man who invented them

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.320
 wanted to be able to play all of Beethoven's ninth symphony

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.480
 in one go without having to change the CD.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.960
 So he needed 75 minutes worth of music on there

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.680
 in order to do it and that's what defined it.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.840
 That was his condition.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.440
 - That's really cool.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.440
 - And if you don't know what CD is, you can Google it.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.040
 - When Osama bin Laden was killed,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.160
 it was by SEAL Team Six, right?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.400
 Two days after SEAL Team Six took him out,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.960
 guess who tried to trademark SEAL Team Six?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.240
 - SEAL?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.600
 - That would be incredible.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.440
 - The singer SEAL.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.040
 - Yeah, the singer SEAL, no, Walt Disney.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.200
 The Walt Disney company tried, they--

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.080
 - How would we have guessed that?

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.360
 (audience laughs)

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360
 - Good point, yeah.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.440
 - It just would have been a long, first off.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.280
 - It was a long game.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.000
 - Is it because, well, is it because they were gonna make

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.160
 like a cartoon with loads of SEALs

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.880
 who went around killing terrorists?

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.680
 - They were gonna, 'cause Disney's gone, obviously,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.760
 into more dramas, like, yeah.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.840
 And so they thought, wow, this would be an amazing series.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.200
 We'll do SEAL Team Six.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.480
 And so that was their first thought though,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.120
 immediately after Osama bin Laden died.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.840
 They have someone in their company who does that and goes,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.680
 let's trademark that.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.520
 And so, yeah.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.080
 But Disney are famously a benevolent

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.480
 and charming corporation, I don't understand.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.320
 - What do you want them to do?

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.220
 Have a month of mourning for Osama bin Laden?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.720
 I think fair enough, Disney.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.000
 - Bit of respect for the great man, he'd been good.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.280
 (audience laughs)

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.760
 - And let's end on that, Dan.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.280
 - We actually do need to move on.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.200
 So that's annoying that we are ending on that, but.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.560
 (audience laughs)

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.120
 Not great for my career.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.700
 (upbeat music)

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.540
 (audience cheers)

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.220
 - Yeah.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.060
 - How are we doing?

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.380
 - Has anyone spotted what's missing from the stage?

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.060
 And there's wine, that's correct.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.900
 - Yeah, I'm gonna have to do something so unprofessional.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.260
 I thought I'd save it for this.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.620
 Someone backstage, I forgot to bring my wine on

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.820
 and I won't be able to make it through without.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.780
 Could you possibly fill right to the brim?

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.020
 (audience laughs)

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.860
 Thanks.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.380
 As you were.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.860
 (Dan laughs)

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.220
 - It's like working with Gilgud himself.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.780
 (audience laughs)

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.660
 - Quickly, 'cause you did say Gilgud,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.260
 laughingly compared me to Gilgud, but.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.580
 - Here's James, everybody.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.260
 Here's our tour manager, James.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.660
 - James Hingley, everyone.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.980
 (audience cheers)

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.980
 - Save the show for this.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.020
 - As if Gilgud was the epitome of professionalism.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.700
 Was it not him who was once in the audience of a play

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.140
 really pissed, he'd been at the pub all day,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.860
 he was with his mate and he leaned over to his mate

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.540
 and whispered, oh, this is really good,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.900
 this is where I come on.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.940
 (audience laughs)

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.540
 Pretty sure, so.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.540
 - Yeah.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.740
 - There's kind of caricatures that you get

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.460
 on the street these days, where they're just rude about you

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.580
 and you have to pay them with a tenner,

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.420
 or whatever it is.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.260
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.420
 - I've never had that done.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.020
 - Haven't you? - Because I'm too afraid to,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.860
 basically.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.860
 - But the thing is about you, Andy,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.620
 is you have no discernible features.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.460
 - Wow.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.660
 (audience laughs)

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.500
 - Wow.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.540
 - Do you remember when people would draw fan art of us

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.100
 and they'd have silly hair, glasses, woman's hair,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.260
 and just a stick figure?

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.740
 - A guy, just a guy.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.580
 - Generic stick man for Andy.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.420
 - That did happen.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.140
 - Weirdly, it looks exactly like you

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.220
 whenever we saw them.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.740
 (audience laughs)

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.980
 - He actually, did you read,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.740
 there's just one other thing about George Cookshack.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.700
 So he was famous for being Dickens Illustrator as well,

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.060
 he illustrated a lot of Dickens books,

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.500
 and he claimed that he actually came up

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.180
 with the whole plot for Oliver Twist

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.620
 and said he wanted to call it Frank Foundling.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.940
 And so I think him and Dickens ended on slightly bad terms.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.940
 - Frank Foundling.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.780
 - Frank Foundling.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.600
 - Bad man.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.440
 - It could have been.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.280
 - It works, yeah.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.100
 - It could have been.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.940
 - It's a bit decadent, yeah.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.660
 - But he was an obsessive bore of a T-totaler,

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.540
 and he was once burgled, and he caught the burglar,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.780
 and while grasping him with one hand,

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.420
 he felt his pulse with the other hand,

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.540
 and noticed that it was the usual 75 beats a minute.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.300
 Therefore, had not been increased

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.460
 by the exertion and the excitement at all,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.260
 and so he started expounding on the benefits of temperance

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.380
 to the burglar that he'd caught, explaining,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.300
 "You see, it's because I don't drink, my pulse, feel it."

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.440
 So the police came along,

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.800
 he's still lecturing this poor burglar

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.560
 who bit off more than he could chew about not drinking.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.420
 - That's so funny.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.240
 - What is a lunette?

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.080
 Not the lunette, you might say.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.200
 - A lawn yet was the perspectacle, wasn't it?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.640
 A lunette is a light, a whole full of light.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.840
 - Torture thing?

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.360
 - Yes, it's a torture thing.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.200
 - French torture thing?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.040
 - Yes.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.880
 - French accent?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.720
 - Not the lunette.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.300
 (laughing)

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.480
 - It is the hole where you put your head through in a guillotine.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.000
 - Oh, very good.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.120
 - It's a lunette.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.600
 Probably they mostly just said not the guillotine, surely?

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.440
 - Not the lunette.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.400
 - I don't think the specific detail of the hole

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.240
 is what's worrying.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.960
 It's more what's above the lunette.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.080
 - I just like the idea of the guy who's gonna do the,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.520
 with the axe of the mask on going,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.140
 "Ugh, a connoisseur."

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.280
 (laughing)

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.620
 - Pleasure to meet you.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.640
 - Am I right that actually,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.760
 if you're having your head chopped off,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.560
 you never have to see the lunette,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.020
 because you can't fit your head through that hole, can't you?

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.820
 Don't you put your neck on the, on the dip?

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.620
 - Would you put it on the block?

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.500
 - And then they put the thing down over your neck.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.320
 - Yeah, right.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.220
 - Maybe in some design.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.820
 So perhaps the one sweet relief

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.660
 is that you don't have to see the lunette.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.580
 - You never see the lunette.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.540
 - Another cool protester,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.300
 I just like really, Wavy Gravy.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.620
 - Oh yeah, Wavy Gravy.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.460
 - I thought you'd be a Wavy Gravy fan.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.020
 He was the emcee for Woodstock,

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.340
 hung out with all those beat generation people,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.340
 and he nominated nobody to be president in 1976.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.080
 I think it was.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.840
 And he was just really cool.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.320
 He had a son called

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.380
 Howdy Doogood Gravy Tomahawk Truck Stock Romney.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.780
 - Is he in relation to Mitt Romney?

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.080
 And do they socialize?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.280
 - Yeah, brothers, yeah.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.740
 He goes by the name Jordan.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.840
 - Here's a weird thing about the Queen's car.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.320
 She had multiple cars,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.480
 but they all had the same license plate number.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.780
 It was the same, she, yeah, had the red license.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.160
 - D1 GL1Z, was it, or something like that?

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160
 - No, it was a.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.400
 - Took a little while for some of you to work that out.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.980
 - It was, no, it was Jiggy 280.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.820
 - Jiggy?

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.020
 - Yeah, Jgy 280.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.300
 And at any time that she got a new car,

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.900
 she had that as the personalized license plate.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.020
 And I can't see if there's something

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.540
 that was a reason behind it.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.900
 - What could it stand for?

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.740
 - Yeah.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.820
 - It was just gallivanting.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.980
 You help me out here.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.180
 - Yeah, come here on the map.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.920
 - I thought it was very interesting,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.640
 researching this, that in China, they hate new car smell.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.840
 It's so weird.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.540
 So we famously love new car smell.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.240
 And they're always trying to replicate

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.080
 that smell of a new car.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.880
 - So what, this is when you buy a new car.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.840
 - Yeah.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.980
 And it's got all the surfaces in it,

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.340
 still have the new chemicals on them

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.600
 that are gradually being released.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.140
 And, yeah, it's like.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.040
 - Delicious carcinogens, isn't it?

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.880
 - Yes, exactly.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.200
 - Is it bad for you, new car smell?

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.040
 - I believe it's bad for you.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.580
 - It's slightly bad for you.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.200
 They've done studies and it's like,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.860
 it's a little bit above what we'd recommend

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.900
 you're inhaling.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.580
 So don't just sniff the seat,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.300
 let the seats in your car day after day.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.820
 But new car smell, the Brits really like it.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.200
 But in China, they've actually,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.420
 Ford have had to come up with an odour remover

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.860
 for car smells because in China,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.460
 they hate it so much.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.260
 And in 2018, it was affecting car sales.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.140
 So they hired, in 2017, Ford hired 18 golden noses,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.500
 which were human beings whose job it was

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.940
 to go inside a car and rate the smell

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.420
 from not perceptible to extremely disturbing.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.180
 And then they'd work out ways to get rid of it.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.980
 And they patented a device in the end,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.060
 which basically drives your car to a clean area,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.900
 winds down the windows and airs it out.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.940
 And then senses when the car smells gone.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.780
 - Right.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.620
 - And then drives it back.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.460
 - That's cool.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.100
 - And Chinese people to buy it, isn't that weird?

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.100
 - Yeah, do you know also,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.780
 you said that the new car smell being leather.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.780
 But actually, so Rolls Royce had a lot of complaints

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.440
 that their cars had lost the leathery smell.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.700
 So they sent in this team,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.180
 they were called SG Gordon Limited,

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.500
 to try and distill new car smell

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500
 so that they could put it into their new cars

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.080
 that don't have new car smell,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.780
 so that it smells like a new car.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.620
 - Okay.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.680
 - And what ended up happening is that they discovered

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.320
 that it wasn't the leather predominantly

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.160
 that gave the smell.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.220
 It wasn't the wood that you would get in certain cars.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.420
 So a lot of cars now have replaced wood with plastic.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.260
 And so the mixture is-

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.900
 - Who has a wooden car these days?

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.980
 - Well, Rolls Royce, particularly,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.860
 yeah, would still have the idea.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.580
 I mean, it doesn't even matter who has that anymore.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.700
 That's where the smell of the old car came from.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.540
 - Oh, interesting.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.580
 But there are still some wooden cars.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.180
 And I think it is a combination of wooden surfaces.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.020
 I don't know.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.860
 - Yeah.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.780
 - I'm driving a car with wood in it.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.900
 Not a wooden car.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.780
 Like the Hogany on the inside and stuff.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.620
 - Ooh.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.460
 - Yeah.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.760
 It's when I was dating the queen.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.240
 (audience laughing)

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.400
 - Bruce Lee against Superman.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.760
 That doesn't even work because he, in the movie,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.280
 he plays Kato from the Green Hornet,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.560
 which was the big TV show that Bruce Lee starred in in America.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.200
 So he had a big kung fu career in Hong Kong

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.400
 and Chinese movies,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.720
 but he also had an amazing American career.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.440
 And Kato, as the Green Hornet was one.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.700
 So he's against Superman,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.640
 but Kato's part of the Batman universe.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.600
 So, oh wait, that's the same universe.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.760
 Scratch that, everyone.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.720
 (audience laughing)

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.700
 I'll hand my nerd credentials back in.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.540
 (audience laughing)

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.860
 There you go.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.940
 - I'll be honest, you lost me about two minutes ago.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.740
 - Yeah, take those credentials back, please.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.500
 - Do you know that water flows?

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.340
 Do you know that water flows?

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.460
 - Yeah, water flows.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.980
 - I would have to, otherwise it would all sink

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.380
 to the bottom of the sea, wouldn't it?

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.100
 - Hang on, some of it floats on the top, though.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.940
 - Water flows.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.420
 If you drop a meter of water in the middle

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.620
 of some other water, it'll just stay there.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.740
 - So like different kind of water to--

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.680
 - Oh no, they're different, yeah, yeah.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.000
 Like salt water and fresh water

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.020
 are different densities, I believe, so yeah.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.320
 - But if you've got a whole body of normal tap water

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.100
 and then you drop some more tap water in,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.040
 then it'll just stay there, bobbing around,

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.200
 like it's the same place.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.040
 - It doesn't sort of like integrate,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.080
 it just sits on top.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.880
 - It doesn't sit on top like a Lego brick

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.600
 on top of more Lego, it goes--

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.720
 - Isn't that what floating is?

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.680
 (audience laughing)

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.320
 - Yeah, I mean, the other water's gotta move out of the way.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.440
 If you move your, I guess what I'm trying to say--

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.060
 - Kyle and Andy, why is it that if I'm in a bath

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.580
 and I want to make it hotter, and I turn on the hot tap,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.180
 I don't just get a small cube of really hot water

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.740
 after the tap, and I don't have to put different--

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.420
 - Well, that's 'cause you're swishing around

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.460
 with your rubber duck and all that.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.500
 That's like, that's you being the wave sister.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.500
 But milk doesn't float despite the name, Milk Float.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.340
 - Right.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.500
 (audience laughing)

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.840
 Jesus Christ.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.080
 So don't leave your cube of milk on top of the ocean.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.660
 (audience laughing)

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.780
 You'll never see it again.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.580
 - There is a thing called, what is it, dendrophilia,

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.460
 which is basically the sexualization of trees.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.140
 I mean, that is a real thing that happens.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.340
 I found a Wikipedia page on it.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.020
 It's the most interesting write-up I've ever read

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.900
 on a Wikipedia page, says many people use vegetables

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.780
 and fruits such as cucumbers or carrots

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.620
 to insert into their anus.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.460
 - Whoa, whoa.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.620
 (audience laughing)

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.520
 As an object to receive sexual pleasure or orgasms

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.060
 when they masturbate, in men, holes can be used

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.800
 inside trees or trunks, assimilating the shape

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.480
 of a vagina through which the penis is inserted.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.040
 - Why are you reading this, Dad?

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.800
 (audience laughing)

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.380
 - Well, this is the relevant bit.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.540
 (audience laughing)

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.600
 - Why did you have to read all that film?

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.240
 - Many people experience feelings toward plants

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.920
 after having sex in a garden, forest, greenhouse,

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.860
 or bedroom with many plants.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.780
 (audience laughing)

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.340
 The use of flowers to caress the body

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.040
 is also included in tendrophilia.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.420
 And that's, so it's a big thing.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.900
 - Can I tell you a cool thing about smell

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.860
 that is amazing in insane?

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.220
 Okay, get this.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.860
 Right, what do you smell with?

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.700
 - Your nose.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.540
 (burps)

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.940
 - You don't smell with your, so this is amazing.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.660
 The nose is merely the pipe that takes the smells

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.260
 to where you really smell.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.100
 (audience laughing)

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.900
 The place you smell, I'm gonna do a big boop

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.220
 with my finger pointing to where you actually smell.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.580
 - Oh, this'll be great on audio.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.580
 (audience laughing)

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.860
 (burps)

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.700
 - Wow.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.540
 - Your eyebrows?

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.540
 - In the level of your eyebrows--

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.860
 - In between your eyebrows.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.780
 - Right in between your eyebrows.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.580
 Okay, the air goes up into your nose.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.020
 Sure, we all know that.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.780
 And then it curls around these little structures

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.220
 which carry the scent molecules

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.300
 of what you're trying to smell, right?

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.780
 That's the most important thing.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.740
 They stop on the mucous membrane,

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.780
 and this is where it is.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.060
 It's level with your eyebrows,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.140
 and that's where the smell molecules actually get detected

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.340
 and received by this mucous membrane.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.580
 - So could you cut out the middle man

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.220
 and just drill a hole in between,

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.900
 in like the Frida Carlos spot?

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.700
 - Yep, yep, yep, you could, yeah, yeah.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.540
 - We should do that.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.380
 - We recommend it.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.380
 (audience laughing)

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.220
 - Wow.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.060
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.900
 - Yeah.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.740
 - That's where you smell.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.580
 - Very cool.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.420
 - You think you smell with your nose, sure,

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.700
 but you don't.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.340
 - Yeah, it's just a vehicle.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.020
 - Why isn't anyone more shocked about this?

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.740
 - They're stunned into silence.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.260
 - It's not your nose is a place pretty close to your nose.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.260
 (audience laughing)

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.780
 Inside what probably you could probably say is your nose.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.220
 (audience laughing)

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.700
 - Wait, let me do the eyes now, let me do the eyes.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.620
 (audience laughing)

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.460
 - I got one thing as well,

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.060
 which is this is just for anyone

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.700
 who's listened to this fact and gone,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.220
 ah, if only I could read something

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.180
 about someone having sex with a tree.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.180
 I just realized I read an entire novel in my 20s

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.340
 about this exact thing.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.460
 It's called a melon for ecstasy,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.180
 and it's all about a guy who goes around shagging trees, right?

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.540
 - So, Dan, I am not remotely surprised

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.460
 that you read this novel.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.620
 I feel like I'd be stagnant if you hadn't read it.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.540
 - Also, when does Dan's butt club podcast come out?

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.820
 (audience laughing)

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.640
 - Yeah, so basically the increased holes

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.500
 bored into the trunks of local trees,

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.240
 all of them 33 inches from the ground

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.540
 at an angle at between 15 and 20 degrees

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.540
 to the horizontal attracts the suspicion of the police.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.580
 (audience laughing)

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.900
 It infuriates the council who see it as vandalism

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.060
 and excites ornithological society members

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.580
 who believe it indicates the return

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.700
 of the fabulously requested woodpecker.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.260
 And the whole story is about the guy.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.220
 - There's some kind of pecker that is chasing.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.260
 (audience laughing)

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.340
 It's an amazing book, a melon for ecstasy.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340
 Everyone needs to get it.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.060
 Yeah, his main worry is not being caught.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.980
 It's all the splinters he gets as he's doing it.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.320
 - Oh my God.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.660
 - Anyway, we should move on, right?

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.180
 (audience laughing)

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.580
 - That was your choice to do that.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.420
 - I know.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.580
 (audience laughing)

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.420
 - Oh, I did it.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.000
 (upbeat music)

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.860
 - You ready for more facts?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.700
 (audience cheering)

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.060
 Thank you everyone who sent in a fact to us already.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.580
 So James, what do you got, mate?

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.220
 - Oh yes, and this is the bit where I read one out, isn't it?

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.260
 That's fine.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.100
 - Slick.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.860
 - We spend a lot of time rehearsing this show.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.180
 - Here's the fact.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.580
 At Prince Now King Charles and Diana's wedding,

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.180
 the head waiter got a black eye from the queen.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.140
 I know this because said head waiter of Claridge's

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.880
 is my grandfather.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.720
 - Wow.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.860
 - Wow.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.980
 - Is this from Dan?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.780
 (audience laughing)

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.460
 - Extra details.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.220
 She, the queen, danced into a giant apple decoration

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.320
 which swung into his face.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.160
 (audience laughing)

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.040
 She then followed him into the kitchen

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.620
 to make sure he was okay.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.460
 - That's nice.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.300
 - Nice, isn't it?

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.260
 Okay, here's another eyebrow one.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.100
 - Yeah.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.320
 - The common adjectives used before breasts in books

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.320
 are in order, left, full, big, right, and ample.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.260
 - I thought in...

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.180
 (audience laughing)

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.300
 I thought in order was one of them when you said that.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.700
 (audience laughing)

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.780
 - And that was said by someone who had

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.060
 a large machine learning data set at work

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.260
 and worked it out for themselves.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.260
 - Wow.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.540
 That actually, that was another death by the way,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.380
 like a torture thing that they used to do according to legend

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.700
 which is they would take two trees

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.300
 and they would tie them together.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.540
 So they would bend them right in

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.180
 and they would hold a rope that was holding them tight

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.500
 and then they would take the offending criminal

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.420
 and they would attach a rope to either side of the tree.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.500
 Some say with just one leg to each tree

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.860
 and they would cut the rope

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.640
 and the trees would fling away

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.140
 and you would be ripped in half.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:53.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.020
 - But is it like a wishbone where

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.980
 whichever tree got the big at heart?

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.180
 (audience laughing)

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.380
 - You're right, it should be like a cracker.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.460
 There should be a joke on one side of that, yeah.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.740
 - That was a thing that did happen,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.220
 not just in the personal part, I think,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.580
 'cause Saint Corona died in that way.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.420
 - Really?

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.660
 - Yeah, patron saint of viruses.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.820
 - Really?

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.660
 - No.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.500
 - No, but like Saint Corona, I don't know what--

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.380
 - Saint Corona had a giant mime shoved into his throat.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.560
 I'm pretty sure.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.780
 - Do you know how a tosser died actually?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.620
 - No.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.140
 - This is according to a Spasius

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.420
 who was writing in the first century.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.940
 So quite a long time after,

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.100
 but a Spasius said she was killed

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.500
 and eaten by her son Xerxes in a fit of distraction.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.820
 - A fit of distraction?

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.820
 - Oh, further information.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.740
 And I don't even know who was distracted.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.580
 Who was he?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.580
 He was eating a steak

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.700
 and accidentally got his mum on the way.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.340
 - Oh my God.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.260
 Hey, you know, just super quickly back

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.700
 to Dennis Popp and Ace of Base.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.300
 There was a thing that he used to do,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.660
 which eventually a lot of other pop musicians would do as well,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.780
 which was called the LA Car Test.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.540
 And the idea was you were gonna be able to make it in America

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.260
 if your song was good enough to be played in a car in LA.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.660
 So what he would do is he would take finished songs

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.620
 and he would send them over to LA

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.500
 and he would people over there, drive on the highways,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.540
 listening to the songs in cars, going, "Yeah, man, groovy."

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.380
 - That's cool.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.820
 - Yeah, and that's the LA Car Test.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.460
 So songs were deliberately like fixed or given a boost

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.940
 simply by what the response was.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.780
 - That's so interesting.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.380
 'Cause like we always, like with podcasts as well,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.940
 you're supposed to play it in a car as well

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.620
 because the audio is slightly different.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.660
 So if your audio is not quite right,

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.300
 it's different if you hear it in headphones

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.740
 than if you hear it in a car.

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.820
 So I wonder if it's something like that.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.300
 - Do you do that when you're editing our show?

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.380
 Do you go out for a drive?

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.620
 - No, 'cause it's so funny.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.220
 I would just veer off the road.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.580
 No, if there's a slight audio problem,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.540
 I will do that, yeah.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.380
 - Do you?

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.220
 - Yes.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.060
 (laughing)

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:50.900
 - Get in the car.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.740
 - That's amazing.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.460
 (laughing)

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.060
 I think that's really cool.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.020
 I think that's really cool, guys.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.140
 - Don't you agree?

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.540
 Yeah, there you go.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.620
 - I don't think they,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.300
 that didn't sound like you really meant that.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.140
 - No.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.580
 (laughing)

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.060
 - Can I just, on older people lying about things,

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.980
 there was a big thing in the 1950s.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.860
 There was suddenly this hunt

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.260
 for the last remaining US Civil War veterans.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.580
 And there was a guy called Walter Williams

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.100
 who was declared in 1959 to have been

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.220
 the last surviving veteran who then died.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.700
 And there was this massive week of official mourning

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.500
 in Houston, there was a funeral procession,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.500
 more than 100,000 people came to line the streets

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.380
 to say farewell to this guy,

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.780
 the last person who'd been there.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.860
 In the 90s, a researcher looked into it,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.020
 found out that he'd been eight when the war ended

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.740
 and definitely had not fought in the American Civil War.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.420
 But not only that, looked into all the other veterans

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.460
 in the 1950s who were saying they were the oldest surviving

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.180
 and they were all fake.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.980
 So, the person who acclaimed the oldest living veteran,

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.380
 the oldest surviving veteran title from, was another phony.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.300
 The researcher found that every one of the 12

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.660
 last remaining people to have survived the Civil War

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.700
 had not fought in the Civil War.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.700
 There'd been a--

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.820
 - Did they meet up and just occasionally look at each other

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.740
 and go, "I know, I know, me either."

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.540
 - They did, there was a reunion.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.220
 He said there'd been a veteran's reunion

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.180
 and all the veterans who'd gone must have just been going,

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.220
 "Yeah, you remember Alamo, was that Alamo?"

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.380
 Yeah, and Dave, yeah.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.660
 - How weird is that?

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.260
 - This is from 2011.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.820
 This is a statement that was put on a paintballing website,

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.460
 okay, these are the words.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.060
 "Due to an incident at our Croydon Paintballing Center,

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.900
 "you will be given special information

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.580
 "on the dangers of paintballing with enhanced boobs

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.740
 "and asked to sign a disclaimer.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.500
 "You will also be issued with extra padding

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.020
 "to protect your implants while paintballing."

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.700
 This was put up there because during a paintball session,

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.820
 someone was shot in the boob and it exploded.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.780
 And apparently it was ruptured after it was hit

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.100
 and this has been a huge problem, apparently.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.380
 It's very dangerous to have enhanced boobs while paintballing.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.140
 - A huge problem. - Yeah.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.980
 - That's it.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.420
 I was looking up some well-known clowns

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.260
 and a well-known one in Britain working today

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.260
 is Matty Faint, who's co-curator of the Clown Museum,

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.420
 or who was that a couple of years ago, at least,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.500
 and he does kids parties and a lot of clowns now lament

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.460
 the decline of the clown and they blame Disney.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.420
 Like a lot of entertainers now come to kids parties

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.780
 dressed as Disney characters instead of clowns,

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.740
 things like that.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.740
 But he said recently he did a kids party,

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:33.220
 so he went to the kids' house and he performed as a clown

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.740
 and it went down dreadfully well.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.820
 20 children laughing their asses off.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.660
 And then the mum said, "Thanks very much."

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.140
 Paid him by and then he went upstairs to get changed

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.180
 into his normal clothes and he came downstairs,

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.180
 at which point the mother turned around,

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.460
 saw him, grabbed him by the throat, shouting,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.060
 "Who are you? What are you doing in my house?"

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.900
 LAUGHTER

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.380
 'Cause to her, it's just a weird man

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.100
 and normal clothes coming down her staircase.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.780
 That's so good. It's a dangerous job.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.660
 Here's a great Croydon Flight anecdote

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.500
 from the Golden Age of Travel, right?

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.700
 Uh-huh. And this is at a time when pilot nicknames included

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.620
 Dizzy, Count Vodka, and Scruffy the Undertaker Robinson.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.220
 So there's a, like, you're in safe hands.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.660
 This is in 1924. There was a flight from Croydon to Paris

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.540
 and someone looked out of the window and saw,

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.860
 on the wing of the plane, as the plane was in the air,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.660
 a mechanic on the wing trying to fix the throttle mid-air.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.740
 Wow. Because he was trying to repair it.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.660
 He realised he couldn't, so he just stayed on the wing of the plane

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.260
 for the entire flight to Paris.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.180
 Hang on. He had got on after it took off, right?

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.740
 It wasn't like he was doing it on the ground

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.380
 and then they forgot to tell him they were taking off.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.900
 I am not sure.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.660
 I think he climbed out in mid-air.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.060
 How do you do that, Andy? How do you do that, Andy?

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.220
 He just held it open until the plane landed.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.380
 Well, they didn't use to fly very high, did they?

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.460
 They flew really, really low. Yeah, they were going at 30,000 feet.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.220
 But they still fly fast.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.100
 Again, at the time, not very fast.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.460
 It's still scary.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.860
 There's no height of plane flight where I'm like,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.220
 "It's not actually that high. Don't really mind."

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.300
 Yeah, I'll get on the wing.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.420
 It is scary. That's why this was a news story at the time

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.100
 and why I think it's a relevant anecdote now.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.100
 Yeah. Yeah. It was scary and hard for the guy.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.180
 That's the point. Yeah.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.380
 So there was a study in 2019 about learning from your failures.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.540
 And basically, the conclusion was that failure

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.340
 is an essential ingredient to success.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.900
 You have to fail to be successful.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.220
 But that doesn't alone make you successful.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.460
 You have to learn from your mistakes.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.540
 But I just found it so interesting in terms of, like,

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.860
 the cold, hard-eye of academia, the way they worked this out.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.860
 It was a huge study and it looked at three different things.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.900
 So it looked at 777,000 grant applications

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.340
 submitted to the Institute of Health

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.580
 to see if they were successful or failures.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.660
 It looked at 46 years' worth of startup investments

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.420
 to see if businesses were successful

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.860
 or whether they were failures and what was the cause of that.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.820
 And it looked at 170,000 terrorist attacks

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.260
 to see if they were failures.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.060
 And I think that's a bold thing.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.660
 And I don't know what involved, but it concluded,

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.620
 and it looked, you know, a successful terrorist attack

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.340
 is obviously a failure for most of us,

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.220
 but a success for certain people.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.700
 So reassuringly, the test found that for,

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.140
 if you're looking for a grant,

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.340
 if you're trying to get a grant from the Institute of Health,

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.900
 the average failure rate is 2.03 failures before you succeed.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.220
 For a startup, 1.5, and terrorists fail almost four times

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.860
 before they succeed.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.620
 So, and we've got to cheer one person

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.380
 cheering for the anti-terrorist brigade.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.220
 Well, as we all know,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.260
 Dan thinks her son of the laden is a great guy, so...

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.340
 It's Maria Therese, the Queen of France.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.660
 So she was Spanish, but she was the wife of Louis XIV.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.340
 She was in labor in 1661.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.580
 And in the old days, if you were royal,

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.580
 it was basically open season for your birth.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.740
 Oh, everyone would come and watch?

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.260
 Everyone just came and watched.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.500
 So when Maria and Therese gave birth,

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.980
 there were nearly 200 people in her chambers,

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.140
 mostly in an outer room,

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.980
 but quite a few in the inner room as well.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.780
 And when Maria Therese, sort of a century earlier,

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:04.660
 was giving birth,

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.540
 lots of princesses and various dukes

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.100
 started coming in to witness her giving birth.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.620
 And she hated it. She kept shouting,

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.620
 "I don't want to give birth. I want to die."

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.020
 And she had to shout that

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.020
 because there were Spanish actors and musicians

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.580
 dancing a ballet beneath the windows.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.300
 And they had guitars and casinettes

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.300
 to remind her that she was Spanish.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.300
 (LAUGHTER)

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.460
 There is another study.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.260
 This is an amazing one, where they looked at surgeons

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.500
 who were doing coronary bypasses.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.500
 Right.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.020
 And they looked at ones that were successful

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.020
 and the ones that were failures.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.860
 And they saw, if you did a failure,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.380
 were you going to be more successful in the future?

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.100
 So have you learned from your mistakes?

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.100
 Yeah.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.820
 And what they found was that actually that is true.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.620
 So surgeons who made mistakes,

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.460
 they did tend to get much more successful as they went on,

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.460
 but only to a certain level.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.620
 And after a certain amount of failing again and again and again,

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.580
 you just get really, really shitted it.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.580
 Really?

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.180
 Because you're just like, "Oh, I can't do this."

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.380
 You just lose all confidence.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.380
 Yeah, right.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380
 You're stuck in a rut.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.380
 I have that with getting facts right.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.940
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.460
 I've just given up at this point.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.460
 Yeah.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.060
 So I named my son Ted.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.060
 His middle name is Harpo after the Marx brother Harpo.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.300
 But Harpo is Oprah Winfrey's company as well.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.980
 I would assume that that would have been trademarked,

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.180
 but I had no problems.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.180
 Oh, my God.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.180
 Oprah is Harpo backwards.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.580
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.580
 Yes.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.380
 And that's why she named the company that.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.380
 Oh, she knows that.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.380
 Okay, fine.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.380
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.220
 Well, um...

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.780
 What a wild ride for you for five seconds.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.780
 That was huge.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.780
 I've got to move this on.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.780
 Oh, really?

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.780
 Yeah, we need to get out of here.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.780
 Can I tell you about Mandels?

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.780
 What?

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.780
 Oh, I don't know.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.780
 Mandels.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.780
 These are male candles.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.780
 Okay.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.780
 'Cause there's a big problem for the candle industry,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.780
 which is that they're only hitting half the population.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.780
 Women tend to buy, like, more than 90% of candles.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.780
 Men tend not to buy them.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.780
 Okay.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.780
 And there have been consistent attempts to get blokes to buy candles.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.780
 So scents published have included aftershave, fine.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.780
 Chrome.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.780
 Fine.

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.780
 The browser.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.780
 Smoked leather.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.780
 Okay.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.780
 Rome.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:11.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.780
 Not a Roman candle like a firework.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.780
 Just the smells of Rome.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.780
 And there's one exhaust.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:17.780
 And I just wanted to read you the...

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.780
 Like, here's the blurb.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:20.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.780
 Do you find yourself taking a minute in the morning to enjoy the unique scent of exhaust

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.780
 when you turn your car on?

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.780
 We pray that you do not get down on your knees and enjoy the musky smell straight from the

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.780
 sauce, but we do pray you buy our candles so you can enjoy the smell with light.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.780
 We do pray you buy our candles so you can enjoy the smell with less danger.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.780
 Avoid the headache.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.780
 Good God.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.780
 Yeah.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.780
 Wow.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.780
 They've really got men, haven't they?

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780
 Yeah.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.780
 So my parents opened up a salon in Hong Kong.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.780
 First customer my mum ever did was Robert Kwok.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.780
 And he immediately...

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.780
 He's too rich to keep that in the show, please.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.780
 Okay.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.780
 Here's the thing.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.780
 Do you think you learn from your failures?

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.780
 Yeah, I think so.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.780
 No question.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.780
 I reckon.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.780
 That's the whole point, isn't it?

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.780
 Well, there's this common idea that, you know, oh, well, actually I just failed my way until

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.780
 I succeeded.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.780
 But you learn from your mistakes, right?

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.780
 But I think people don't tend to.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.780
 Like failing repeatedly is not a good way to succeed.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.780
 You do actually have to think about why you fail, don't you, and then act on it.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.780
 Yes.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.780
 And people...

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.780
 So it's quite hard to do experiments on whether you learn from your failures, but here is one

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.780
 experiment.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.780
 Scientists got people to do a practice test, right?

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:32.780
 They gave them feedback, fake feedback on how they performed, and then they would do a real

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:33.780
 test.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.780
 And they were asked how happy it would make them if they did well.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.780
 So the people who got negative feedback immediately said, "Oh, well, I wouldn't care at all if

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.780
 I did well on the real test."

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:45.780
 They were lying.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.780
 They were protecting themselves, you know.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.780
 And then when they did the second test, they got given fake feedback again.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.780
 And so you got full marks.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.780
 And they were thrilled.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.780
 They were so happy that they'd done well.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.780
 So people try and protect their self-image as competent people.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.780
 And when they get proof that they're wrong, it does away with that image.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.780
 I've just realized I read out the wrong fact in relation to the leading, which makes this

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.780
 bit of the show something I will not learn from.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.780
 But it was all part of the plan.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.780
 It's a bit about failure.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.780
 You're living it right now.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.780
 That's insane.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.780
 You failed literally in the moment, as you were telling us.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.780
 Beautiful.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.780
 The thing that seems relevant to me about what you were saying.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.780
 Yeah.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.780
 And I wonder if this is what you meant to say.

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:23.780
 Let me know.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.780
 Hang on, Andy's going through something right now.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.780
 I feel like we should all pause and just watch it.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.780
 You know, like in an Edinburgh documentary where you don't interfere?

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.780
 I feel like...

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.780
 Is that what you do when someone really fucks up?

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.780
 You get everyone to pause and watch it?

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.780
 Yeah.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:44.780
 And then something in the background goes, "Here we see the podcaster struggling with his words."

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:56.780
