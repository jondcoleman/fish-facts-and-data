1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,560
 - Hi everyone, Merry Christmas and a happy new year

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,200
 from all of us at No Such Thing as a Fish.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,360
 Hope you had a nice Christmas.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,040
 If not, I hope it was manageable at least

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,880
 and I hope we're all looking forward to

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,040
 what is in store for 2025.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,600
 We've taken a little bit of a break this week

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,360
 after a very, very busy year

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,320
 where we've written all sorts of books

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,200
 and been on tour around the world

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,960
 and what we have for you instead of a normal episode

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,680
 is a compilation of the best bits

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,600
 that didn't quite make it into the show

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,440
 from our UK, Ireland and Sweden leg of our tour.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,560
 So what you'll get here is lots of silly things

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,880
 that didn't quite fit in the show.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,840
 You get loads and loads of extra facts.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,320
 Really hope you enjoy it.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,480
 But I don't really wanna keep up any more of your time

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,840
 so all I'll say is happy new year and on with the podcast.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,420
 (upbeat music)

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,020
 (upbeat music)

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:14,780
 - We ran out of QI by himself.

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,620
 - Yeah.

26
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,500
 - Which was No Such Thing as a Fish.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,660
 - No Such Thing as a Fish.

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,220
 - No, seriously, it's in the OX office.

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,260
 - From the QI offices in Covent Garden.

30
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,100
 - And then at the end,

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,220
 it turns out you get to run over by a train.

32
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,300
 - Let me just do one more thing about Mars.

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,860
 - Oh my God, I'm surrounded by idiots.

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,440
 (upbeat music)

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,020
 (upbeat music)

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,600
 (upbeat music)

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,180
 (upbeat music)

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,760
 (upbeat music)

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,340
 (upbeat music)

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,920
 (upbeat music)

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,500
 (upbeat music)

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,080
 (upbeat music)

43
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,660
 (upbeat music)

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,240
 (upbeat music)

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:18,740
 (upbeat music)

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:27,100
 - Good evening and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish.

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,000
 Are you ready for the show?

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,740
 (audience cheering)

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,260
 Then please welcome to the stage,

50
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,520
 No Such Thing as a Fish.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,460
 (audience cheering)

52
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,780
 - Hi everyone.

53
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
 (audience cheering)

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,220
 Wow.

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,260
 - Holy moly.

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,100
 - Hey guys.

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,460
 Thanks so much for coming.

58
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,800
 - Hello.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
 - How are you guys doing?

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,660
 (audience cheering)

61
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,960
 Let's do this.

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,440
 Welcome to our 10 year anniversary show.

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,400
 Tonight is gonna be a party.

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,340
 It's gonna be an awesome night.

65
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,240
 We're gonna be celebrating your facts as well.

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,200
 You've sent a bunch in.

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
 Thank you very much.

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,900
 James, you've been collecting them, right?

69
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,680
 - Yes, I've got a few here.

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,280
 For instance, Napoleon fell in love with Josephine

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,880
 because she could do a naughty act called the zigzags.

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,840
 And nobody knows what the zigzags were.

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
 - Wow.

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,180
 Really?

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,620
 - Well, according to random person who texted me.

76
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,620
 - Wow.

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,620
 - And there's no better sauce than that.

78
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,200
 Can we get the lights up on the audience, please?

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
 Oh, hello.

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
 - Oh.

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,560
 - Oh, wow.

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,600
 Oh, you guys are much more attractive

83
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,140
 than I thought you were gonna be.

84
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,300
 (audience laughing)

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,960
 Okay, here is a fact sent by someone in this room.

86
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
 This is brilliant, actually.

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,640
 Between Heathrow and Rome, from takeoff to touchdown,

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,320
 the flight time is the exact run length time

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,400
 of the 2000 film "Gladiator."

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,240
 If you've got a window seat on the right side of the plane,

91
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,840
 you'll be flying over the Colosseum as Maximus and Commodus

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,960
 enter the arena for the final battle.

93
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,880
 - Fuck off.

94
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
 - That's great.

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
 - That's amazing.

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,400
 - That's great.

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,560
 - Wow.

98
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,400
 Isn't that great?

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
 - Very good thing.

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,740
 - The blue whale produces the largest fart bubble.

101
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,880
 (audience laughing)

102
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,520
 It's so large, a zebra who makes the loudest fart

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,600
 can fit in it.

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
 (audience laughing)

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
 - Oh, gold.

106
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,520
 - In Tudor, England, there was a type of criminal

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,640
 called a bear top trickster.

108
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,600
 A woman would flash her breasts to lure men into a house.

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,680
 Once he'd come inside, brackets, the house,

110
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
 he would be robbed.

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
 (audience laughing)

112
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
 - He would be what?

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
 - Robbed.

114
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
 - Oh, he would be robbed.

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
 - Oh, okay.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,820
 - That's very cool.

117
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,320
 - Yeah, the funny bit was the brackets bit, really.

118
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
 That's good, thanks.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,200
 When dragonflies get tired, they suck water up their bum

121
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,920
 and jet it out to propel themselves forward.

122
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,160
 (audience laughing)

123
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,440
 - That's so cool.

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
 - It's funny 'cause I would have thought

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
 that's quite tiring in itself.

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,440
 - It does feel tiring, doesn't it?

127
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 - Yeah.

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,920
 - I'm just clenching now, and yeah, yeah.

129
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,160
 - Have you guys read about a story I love last year

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,740
 is about probably the two most influential writers,

131
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,860
 academics, who write about honesty,

132
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,640
 who have released a bunch of papers.

133
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,000
 We definitely have come across them in our work.

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,860
 They released a very famous paper

135
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,560
 sort of showing that basically,

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
 if you nudge people a certain way,

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
 they'll be more honest.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
 So, for instance, in a dinner.

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,960
 - Which part of their body do you have to touch?

140
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,980
 (audience laughing)

141
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,820
 - No one did that.

142
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,080
 It's against sort of like study principles,

143
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,560
 but if you have to sign a bit at the top

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
 of your tax return that says,

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,020
 "I promise I've told the truth,"

146
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,440
 rather than at the bottom,

147
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,740
 the study showed that people are more honest

148
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,180
 'cause they've just signed this.

149
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,600
 The thing is, these two famous people,

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
 one of whom, Dan Ariely, wrote a book called

151
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,280
 The Honest Truth About Dishonesty,

152
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,680
 were cheating in the paper, allegedly, I have to say,

153
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,640
 but were cheated in the paper,

154
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,040
 and the data was falsified.

155
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,880
 And not only falsified, but falsified in a way

156
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,000
 that even I could tell because it's in two different fonts.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 (audience laughing)

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,960
 They just, the data that was true was in Calibri font,

159
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,140
 and then there was a bunch of Cambria thrown in.

160
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,980
 (audience laughing)

161
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,040
 - Hey, I found the equivalent

162
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,320
 to the American movie, 127 Hours.

163
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,640
 You know where Ann Rolston gets stuck

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,760
 while he's out on his own,

165
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,440
 and his arm gets trapped underneath a boulder.

166
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
 He eventually has to chop off his arm

167
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
 in order to survive,

168
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,880
 and he does that 127 hours into it.

169
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,440
 So I found the British edition of it.

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,860
 It should be called 60 Hours.

171
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,720
 This is a man called Joe Galliat from Yoval in Somerset,

172
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,360
 who spent two days underneath his sofa after it fell on him,

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
 and he couldn't get out of it

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,200
 because he had a few back problems,

175
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,640
 and he only survived because when the sofa fell over,

176
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,600
 a bottle of whiskey rolled towards him,

177
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,840
 (audience laughing)

178
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,120
 and he survived sipping whiskey for two days.

179
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
 - What kind of substance?

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
 - Until a neighbor noticed

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
 that his curtains hadn't moved in two days

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
 and thought something's wrong with Joe,

183
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
 and they went and they found him,

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
 and then he survived.

185
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,360
 He spent five days in hospital,

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,880
 but he said he was there for two whole days.

187
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,040
 And at first he said, I took a sip of the whiskey,

188
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
 and I thought, oh, well, this isn't too bad.

189
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,040
 (audience laughing)

190
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,560
 - What are they called?

191
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,480
 The door sausages.

192
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,320
 - Yeah, door sausages.

193
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,360
 - What are they called?

194
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,320
 - Trapped excluders.

195
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
 - Yes.

196
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,120
 - Door sausages, is that what you mean?

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
 (audience laughing)

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,360
 - Another insight into the Murray home life.

199
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,880
 (audience laughing)

200
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,920
 Another veil ripped away

201
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,520
 from my carefully crafted persona.

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,440
 (audience laughing)

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Oh, well.

204
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,760
 - I have to go as a translator

205
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,560
 whenever you go to DFS, don't I, Andy?

206
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,600
 (audience laughing)

207
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,760
 He wants one of those brown marshmallow sitting things.

208
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,480
 Sofa, yeah, he wants a sofa.

209
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,520
 - Wow, what's James Harkin?

210
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,440
 - Oh, there are no anagrams of that.

211
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,440
 (audience laughing)

212
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 - Hey, speaking of storytellers from overseas.

213
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,240
 Surely Shane Jerkin.

214
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,840
 No, does that work?

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,280
 - Wow, you just did that?

216
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
 - Well, I don't know if it's right.

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,760
 (audience laughing)

218
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,720
 Come back in a few minutes.

219
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,360
 (audience laughing)

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,040
 So there's another thing which happens around the world,

222
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,080
 which, okay, no, let's just pause and watch Andy write.

223
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,440
 (audience laughing)

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,560
 - No, oh. - Use the E twice.

225
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,400
 (imitates sound)

226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
 It worked.

227
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,120
 No, it's Shane Jerkin.

228
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
 (audience laughing)

229
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,640
 - I worked at some more.

230
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,840
 (audience laughing)

231
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,040
 - You know who was one of the most rich people in America

232
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,200
 off the back of Beavers?

233
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,040
 Was John Jacob Astor.

234
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,520
 And he became a billionaire,

235
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,240
 and he's a name that a few of you might be going,

236
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,120
 "John Jacob Astor, how do I know that name?"

237
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,160
 He was at the time of the sinking of the Titanic,

238
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,040
 possibly the richest man in America,

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,440
 maybe even the world,

240
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,760
 and he's one of the men who died on the Titanic.

241
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,640
 And so his fortune was largely about Beavers.

242
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,840
 And when I read that, I just thought,

243
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,520
 I do wonder if in the final seconds of his life,

244
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,240
 if he thought, "Friendly, we had a bunch of Beavers here,

245
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
 "and we could have plugged this whole up in instinct."

246
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
 - Yeah.

247
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,080
 - What do you think?

248
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,480
 - Maybe, maybe that was his final thought.

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,200
 Or maybe, oh, I wish I'd worn my entire full body

250
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,800
 Beaver onesie tonight, and then I could just swim away.

251
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
 - Yes.

252
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,000
 - I think that's weighing you down.

253
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
 I do.

254
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,800
 I think even lying on that door is not gonna keep you up

255
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,920
 if you're wearing the full Beaver onesie.

256
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,280
 - This is how I'd use my time travel moment.

257
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,720
 If I got one time in a machine, that's where I'd go.

258
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
 Not to save him, just to go,

259
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
 "Andy and I have a bit of a bet going."

260
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,760
 (audience laughing)

261
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
 - Actually, did you know that,

262
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
 sorry, speaking of ambassadors and names,

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,080
 that the U.S. ambassador to Denmark

264
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,760
 used to be called Dick Sweat?

265
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,560
 (audience laughing)

266
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,040
 And there was, this is 1998, 2001.

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,240
 - When this goes out, someone who knows it's going,

268
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,080
 "Dick, you made, you were on, no such thing as a fish,

269
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
 "you gotta have a listen."

270
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,840
 - No, I don't know why they're laughing at your name.

271
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,560
 (audience laughing)

272
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,800
 - They must have cut out the interesting bit

273
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
 they said about you afterwards.

274
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
 (audience laughing)

275
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
 - Yes, he was.

276
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200
 His opponent actually campaigned to have his name removed

277
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
 from the ballot paper 'cause he said,

278
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,200
 "In the phone book, he's listed as Lantos Sweat,

279
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,920
 "so it's not legally correct."

280
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
 But obviously, his opponents just worried

281
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,800
 that everyone's gonna vote for Dick Sweat

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
 if they see it, right?

283
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

284
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,880
 I like, there was a guy called Soren Sorensen Adams

285
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,920
 who invented a type of itching powder

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,320
 which basically transformed the world of jokes, right?

287
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

288
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,040
 - Like this guy, I can't believe he's not a name

289
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,160
 that I have known before this.

290
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,840
 He did itching powder, he did the--

291
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,680
 - The joy buzzer.

292
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
 - The joy buzzer in your hand.

293
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 - He did, what did he do?

294
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,640
 He did sneezing powder.

295
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
 - The squirting flower.

296
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,600
 - Squirting flower, the guy was a genius.

297
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
 - He refused to do the whoopie cushion.

298
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,520
 - Did he?

299
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,880
 - He said that was vulgar.

300
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,720
 - Wow.

301
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,560
 - Yeah.

302
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,080
 - And this was the man behind the dirty Fido

303
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,640
 plastic toy thing.

304
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
 - What's that?

305
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,720
 - That's the sort of fake dog poo.

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,280
 - Oh yeah, and then fake vomit, he did as well.

307
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,120
 - Did fake vomit?

308
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,600
 And he said, no, whoopie cushion is too far.

309
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,080
 So they went elsewhere.

310
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,960
 - One of your earliest facts down was that whoopie cushion

311
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,120
 was invented by a great ancient Roman.

312
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
 So for him to say that was lowbrow.

313
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,400
 - Oh, come on, you know, it's credited to an emperor

314
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,920
 called Elagabalus, but his birth name was Bacianus.

315
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,280
 (audience laughing)

316
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,520
 The whoopie cushion was invented by Bacianus.

317
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,080
 Like, it's the greatest fact that I've ever,

318
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,320
 I feel like I was the first person to notice it.

319
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
 Like--

320
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
 - Unbelievable, the classical scholars

321
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,360
 haven't pointed that out before.

322
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
 (audience laughing)

323
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,120
 - Fools.

324
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
 - How many people do you think you could fit in a phone box?

325
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
 - Oh, that's good.

326
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,480
 - 'Cause this was a thing, wasn't it?

327
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,280
 In the 1950s and '60s.

328
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

329
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,200
 - Sort of classic red wall.

330
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,080
 - You would get one of these classic phone boxes.

331
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,960
 You would stuff as many students in as you can.

332
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,440
 Well, they would stuff themselves in.

333
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
 You wouldn't be able to do that.

334
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,720
 - It was 'cause it was before the age of group Zoom calls,

335
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,560
 wasn't it?

336
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,280
 (all laughing)

337
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,760
 - What ages are we talking here?

338
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
 Like, are we allowed--

339
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,560
 - They tended to be students,

340
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,880
 so there would have been, I guess, teenagers.

341
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,920
 - But you look down on if there's a tiny corner left

342
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,200
 and you shove a one-year-old in there.

343
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,040
 Like, is that--

344
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,320
 (audience laughing)

345
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
 - Well, this is the interesting thing.

346
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,280
 Like, there were loads of different rules,

347
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,120
 but the official rules, basically,

348
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
 you had to be more or less adult-sized.

349
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,600
 You had to get at least part of the greater portion

350
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,520
 of your body into a standard upright phone booth.

351
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,200
 - I'm going to say low ball and say three.

352
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,160
 (all laughing)

353
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,000
 - Ooh, yeah, two.

354
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,280
 (all laughing)

355
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
 - Nine.

356
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,800
 - I'm going to say 15.

357
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,160
 - Okay, well, the answer,

358
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,120
 the official record from March 20th, 1959, was 25.

359
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,960
 - Whoa! - Whoa!

360
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,000
 - But there was a Canadian school

361
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,040
 that claimed to have got 40 students in a phone box,

362
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,960
 but it was later found that they'd turned it on its side

363
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,520
 and they used a much larger phone box than normal.

364
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,760
 (all laughing)

365
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,640
 So then they put the official rules in,

366
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,120
 and the really amazing thing is that only in England,

367
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,840
 they had an additional rule

368
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
 that as well as all getting in there,

369
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,360
 the group had to be able to either place

370
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,600
 or answer a phone call while they were in there.

371
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
 - Amazing. - So good.

372
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,960
 (all laughing)

373
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,760
 - In 2011, Chinese magician called Fu Yandong

374
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,360
 his pièce de résistance was six goldfish

375
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,880
 doing synchronized swimming.

376
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,720
 (all laughing)

377
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,560
 - Really?

378
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,160
 - Yeah, 53 different animal rights groups complained

379
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,920
 (all laughing)

380
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,080
 saying it is quite clearly magnets in their stomachs

381
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,760
 and they are being interviewed.

382
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,880
 - Oh, God!

383
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,720
 - Yeah.

384
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,000
 - Oh, my God. - Oh, God, Andy.

385
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,520
 - Do they check Olympians for that, for magnets?

386
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,960
 (all laughing)

387
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,480
 - Do you know that Simon Cowell and Ricky Gervais

388
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
 look like Stonehenge?

389
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,960
 - This is according to the clothing company, Jackamo,

390
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,200
 who made the thing called the architecture of man.

391
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,560
 And this doesn't really make any sense,

392
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,120
 but apparently to train their staff,

393
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,280
 they would choose famous people

394
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,280
 and say what monuments they look like.

395
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,320
 And that supposedly would help their staff

396
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,720
 work out people's sizes.

397
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,920
 I know, it doesn't make any sense at all.

398
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
 - Why do you just say you look a bit like Ricky Gervais?

399
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,960
 - Why goes through the needless answer to the step of,

400
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,560
 you look like Stone7 from Stonehenge?

401
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,400
 - I reckon probably less people would be insulted

402
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,920
 by saying they look like Stonehenge

403
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,080
 than they look like Ricky Gervais.

404
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
 - Very true.

405
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,840
 - Perhaps.

406
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,360
 But yeah, so Ricky Gervais and Simon Cowell

407
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,680
 look like Stonehenge.

408
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,520
 Russell Crowe and Jay-Z look like the Tine Bridge.

409
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,840
 And James Corden looks like the Gherkin.

410
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,160
 (all laughing)

411
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,480
 - That's amazing.

412
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,640
 - Sorry, personal addings though.

413
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,640
 But my friend, we were at a party once,

414
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,920
 you guys know him, and he was a packed party

415
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,760
 and he really needed the toilet.

416
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,400
 And the window that was at the room led to an alleyway.

417
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
 So he thought there's no one going to be walking there.

418
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,280
 So he opened up the window and he peed out the window, right?

419
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,600
 And about five minutes later the door gets kicked

420
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,920
 into the room and this soaked man comes walking in,

421
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
 going, who fucking pissed on me?

422
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,800
 And we all had to go, that didn't happen here, I don't know.

423
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,680
 But it's really hard to keep a straight face

424
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
 when a man soaked in urine is angry at you.

425
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,640
 - Sorry, that man must have stood still.

426
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,480
 - I don't know.

427
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
 - Underneath.

428
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,960
 What sounds like quite a thick shower of urine.

429
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,760
 - I never questioned why he was so soaked, yeah.

430
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,720
 - Speak up your reaction.

431
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,800
 - Who did that?

432
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,440
 That's not in my life, you.

433
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
 Give me your number.

434
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,320
 - Oh God.

435
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,840
 Wow, wow.

436
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,880
 - If you're itching, you know why it's scratching works.

437
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,840
 It's kind of interesting this.

438
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,680
 - Oh yeah?

439
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
 - I'm not sure it's funny, but it is interesting, okay.

440
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,840
 Basically you scratch it and your body thinks

441
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
 that something bad is happening to you

442
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,720
 and that is more important than the itch itself.

443
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,000
 And so the scratch sort of blocks off

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,960
 the pathways to your brain.

445
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,680
 So you've got a little itch, you scratch

446
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,120
 and your body thinks, oh my God, someone's scratching me.

447
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,240
 And then it concentrates way more on that

448
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,880
 than it does on the itch itself.

449
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,600
 What that means is if you have an itch,

450
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,920
 it also works if you tickle yourself.

451
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,080
 And it also works if you press down on it

452
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,520
 or if you put something cold on it, it all does the same thing.

453
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,160
 - So we could have been tickling ourselves all these years

454
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,360
 rather than scratching.

455
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,200
 - Exactly.

456
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,520
 - Well there's even been studies that if you have an itch

457
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,680
 on one side, it likes you on your left side of your body,

458
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,840
 if you look in a mirror and you scratch

459
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,120
 the other side of your body because it has the idea

460
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,600
 that then you will get rid of the itch, yeah.

461
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,680
 - Does that work for everyone or just idiots?

462
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,520
 (audience laughing)

463
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,120
 - Well, it works for idiots and me because I tested it

464
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
 and it does work.

465
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,400
 We sort of have Beethoven to thank for CDs.

466
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,240
 Not the entire technology, but one very important bit,

467
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,040
 which is the reason that CDs are the diameter that they are

468
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,120
 and the length of time that they can take on as a recording

469
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,760
 is because the man who invented them

470
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,320
 wanted to be able to play all of Beethoven's ninth symphony

471
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,480
 in one go without having to change the CD.

472
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,960
 So he needed 75 minutes worth of music on there

473
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,680
 in order to do it and that's what defined it.

474
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
 That was his condition.

475
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,440
 - That's really cool.

476
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,440
 - And if you don't know what CD is, you can Google it.

477
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,040
 - When Osama bin Laden was killed,

478
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
 it was by SEAL Team Six, right?

479
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,400
 Two days after SEAL Team Six took him out,

480
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,960
 guess who tried to trademark SEAL Team Six?

481
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
 - SEAL?

482
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,600
 - That would be incredible.

483
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,440
 - The singer SEAL.

484
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,040
 - Yeah, the singer SEAL, no, Walt Disney.

485
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,200
 The Walt Disney company tried, they--

486
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,080
 - How would we have guessed that?

487
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,360
 (audience laughs)

488
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
 - Good point, yeah.

489
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,440
 - It just would have been a long, first off.

490
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,280
 - It was a long game.

491
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,000
 - Is it because, well, is it because they were gonna make

492
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,160
 like a cartoon with loads of SEALs

493
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,880
 who went around killing terrorists?

494
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,680
 - They were gonna, 'cause Disney's gone, obviously,

495
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,760
 into more dramas, like, yeah.

496
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,840
 And so they thought, wow, this would be an amazing series.

497
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,200
 We'll do SEAL Team Six.

498
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,480
 And so that was their first thought though,

499
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,120
 immediately after Osama bin Laden died.

500
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,840
 They have someone in their company who does that and goes,

501
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,680
 let's trademark that.

502
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,520
 And so, yeah.

503
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,080
 But Disney are famously a benevolent

504
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,480
 and charming corporation, I don't understand.

505
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,320
 - What do you want them to do?

506
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,220
 Have a month of mourning for Osama bin Laden?

507
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,720
 I think fair enough, Disney.

508
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,000
 - Bit of respect for the great man, he'd been good.

509
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,280
 (audience laughs)

510
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,760
 - And let's end on that, Dan.

511
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,280
 - We actually do need to move on.

512
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,200
 So that's annoying that we are ending on that, but.

513
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,560
 (audience laughs)

514
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,120
 Not great for my career.

515
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,700
 (upbeat music)

516
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,540
 (audience cheers)

517
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,220
 - Yeah.

518
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,060
 - How are we doing?

519
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,380
 - Has anyone spotted what's missing from the stage?

520
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,060
 And there's wine, that's correct.

521
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,900
 - Yeah, I'm gonna have to do something so unprofessional.

522
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,260
 I thought I'd save it for this.

523
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,620
 Someone backstage, I forgot to bring my wine on

524
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,820
 and I won't be able to make it through without.

525
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,780
 Could you possibly fill right to the brim?

526
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,020
 (audience laughs)

527
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,860
 Thanks.

528
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,380
 As you were.

529
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,860
 (Dan laughs)

530
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,220
 - It's like working with Gilgud himself.

531
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,780
 (audience laughs)

532
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,660
 - Quickly, 'cause you did say Gilgud,

533
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,260
 laughingly compared me to Gilgud, but.

534
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,580
 - Here's James, everybody.

535
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,260
 Here's our tour manager, James.

536
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,660
 - James Hingley, everyone.

537
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,980
 (audience cheers)

538
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
 - Save the show for this.

539
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,020
 - As if Gilgud was the epitome of professionalism.

540
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,700
 Was it not him who was once in the audience of a play

541
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,140
 really pissed, he'd been at the pub all day,

542
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,860
 he was with his mate and he leaned over to his mate

543
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,540
 and whispered, oh, this is really good,

544
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,900
 this is where I come on.

545
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,940
 (audience laughs)

546
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,540
 Pretty sure, so.

547
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
 - Yeah.

548
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,740
 - There's kind of caricatures that you get

549
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,460
 on the street these days, where they're just rude about you

550
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,580
 and you have to pay them with a tenner,

551
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,420
 or whatever it is.

552
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,260
 - Yeah, exactly.

553
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,420
 - I've never had that done.

554
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,020
 - Haven't you? - Because I'm too afraid to,

555
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,860
 basically.

556
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
 - But the thing is about you, Andy,

557
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,620
 is you have no discernible features.

558
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,460
 - Wow.

559
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,660
 (audience laughs)

560
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,500
 - Wow.

561
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,540
 - Do you remember when people would draw fan art of us

562
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,100
 and they'd have silly hair, glasses, woman's hair,

563
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,260
 and just a stick figure?

564
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,740
 - A guy, just a guy.

565
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,580
 - Generic stick man for Andy.

566
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,420
 - That did happen.

567
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,140
 - Weirdly, it looks exactly like you

568
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,220
 whenever we saw them.

569
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,740
 (audience laughs)

570
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,980
 - He actually, did you read,

571
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,740
 there's just one other thing about George Cookshack.

572
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,700
 So he was famous for being Dickens Illustrator as well,

573
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,060
 he illustrated a lot of Dickens books,

574
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,500
 and he claimed that he actually came up

575
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,180
 with the whole plot for Oliver Twist

576
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,620
 and said he wanted to call it Frank Foundling.

577
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,940
 And so I think him and Dickens ended on slightly bad terms.

578
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
 - Frank Foundling.

579
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,780
 - Frank Foundling.

580
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,600
 - Bad man.

581
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,440
 - It could have been.

582
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,280
 - It works, yeah.

583
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,100
 - It could have been.

584
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,940
 - It's a bit decadent, yeah.

585
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,660
 - But he was an obsessive bore of a T-totaler,

586
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,540
 and he was once burgled, and he caught the burglar,

587
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,780
 and while grasping him with one hand,

588
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,420
 he felt his pulse with the other hand,

589
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,540
 and noticed that it was the usual 75 beats a minute.

590
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,300
 Therefore, had not been increased

591
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,460
 by the exertion and the excitement at all,

592
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,260
 and so he started expounding on the benefits of temperance

593
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,380
 to the burglar that he'd caught, explaining,

594
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,300
 "You see, it's because I don't drink, my pulse, feel it."

595
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,440
 So the police came along,

596
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,800
 he's still lecturing this poor burglar

597
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,560
 who bit off more than he could chew about not drinking.

598
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,420
 - That's so funny.

599
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,240
 - What is a lunette?

600
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,080
 Not the lunette, you might say.

601
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,200
 - A lawn yet was the perspectacle, wasn't it?

602
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,640
 A lunette is a light, a whole full of light.

603
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,840
 - Torture thing?

604
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,360
 - Yes, it's a torture thing.

605
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,200
 - French torture thing?

606
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
 - Yes.

607
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,880
 - French accent?

608
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,720
 - Not the lunette.

609
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,300
 (laughing)

610
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,480
 - It is the hole where you put your head through in a guillotine.

611
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,000
 - Oh, very good.

612
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,120
 - It's a lunette.

613
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
 Probably they mostly just said not the guillotine, surely?

614
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,440
 - Not the lunette.

615
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,400
 - I don't think the specific detail of the hole

616
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
 is what's worrying.

617
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,960
 It's more what's above the lunette.

618
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,080
 - I just like the idea of the guy who's gonna do the,

619
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,520
 with the axe of the mask on going,

620
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,140
 "Ugh, a connoisseur."

621
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,280
 (laughing)

622
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,620
 - Pleasure to meet you.

623
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,640
 - Am I right that actually,

624
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,760
 if you're having your head chopped off,

625
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,560
 you never have to see the lunette,

626
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,020
 because you can't fit your head through that hole, can't you?

627
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,820
 Don't you put your neck on the, on the dip?

628
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,620
 - Would you put it on the block?

629
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,500
 - And then they put the thing down over your neck.

630
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,320
 - Yeah, right.

631
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,160
 - Oh, yeah.

632
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,220
 - Maybe in some design.

633
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,820
 So perhaps the one sweet relief

634
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,660
 is that you don't have to see the lunette.

635
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,580
 - You never see the lunette.

636
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,540
 - Another cool protester,

637
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,300
 I just like really, Wavy Gravy.

638
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,620
 - Oh yeah, Wavy Gravy.

639
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,460
 - I thought you'd be a Wavy Gravy fan.

640
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,020
 He was the emcee for Woodstock,

641
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,340
 hung out with all those beat generation people,

642
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,340
 and he nominated nobody to be president in 1976.

643
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,080
 I think it was.

644
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
 And he was just really cool.

645
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,320
 He had a son called

646
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,380
 Howdy Doogood Gravy Tomahawk Truck Stock Romney.

647
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,780
 - Is he in relation to Mitt Romney?

648
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,080
 And do they socialize?

649
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
 - Yeah, brothers, yeah.

650
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,740
 He goes by the name Jordan.

651
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,840
 - Here's a weird thing about the Queen's car.

652
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
 She had multiple cars,

653
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,480
 but they all had the same license plate number.

654
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,780
 It was the same, she, yeah, had the red license.

655
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,160
 - D1 GL1Z, was it, or something like that?

656
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
 - No, it was a.

657
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,400
 - Took a little while for some of you to work that out.

658
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,980
 - It was, no, it was Jiggy 280.

659
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,820
 - Jiggy?

660
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,020
 - Yeah, Jgy 280.

661
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,300
 And at any time that she got a new car,

662
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,900
 she had that as the personalized license plate.

663
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,020
 And I can't see if there's something

664
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,540
 that was a reason behind it.

665
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,900
 - What could it stand for?

666
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,740
 - Yeah.

667
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,820
 - It was just gallivanting.

668
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,980
 You help me out here.

669
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,180
 - Yeah, come here on the map.

670
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,920
 - I thought it was very interesting,

671
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,640
 researching this, that in China, they hate new car smell.

672
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
 It's so weird.

673
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,540
 So we famously love new car smell.

674
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,240
 And they're always trying to replicate

675
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,080
 that smell of a new car.

676
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
 - So what, this is when you buy a new car.

677
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,840
 - Yeah.

678
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,980
 And it's got all the surfaces in it,

679
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,340
 still have the new chemicals on them

680
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,600
 that are gradually being released.

681
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,140
 And, yeah, it's like.

682
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,040
 - Delicious carcinogens, isn't it?

683
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,880
 - Yes, exactly.

684
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,200
 - Is it bad for you, new car smell?

685
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,040
 - I believe it's bad for you.

686
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,580
 - It's slightly bad for you.

687
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,200
 They've done studies and it's like,

688
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,860
 it's a little bit above what we'd recommend

689
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,900
 you're inhaling.

690
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,580
 So don't just sniff the seat,

691
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,300
 let the seats in your car day after day.

692
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,820
 But new car smell, the Brits really like it.

693
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,200
 But in China, they've actually,

694
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,420
 Ford have had to come up with an odour remover

695
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,860
 for car smells because in China,

696
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,460
 they hate it so much.

697
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,260
 And in 2018, it was affecting car sales.

698
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,140
 So they hired, in 2017, Ford hired 18 golden noses,

699
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,500
 which were human beings whose job it was

700
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,940
 to go inside a car and rate the smell

701
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,420
 from not perceptible to extremely disturbing.

702
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,180
 And then they'd work out ways to get rid of it.

703
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,980
 And they patented a device in the end,

704
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,060
 which basically drives your car to a clean area,

705
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,900
 winds down the windows and airs it out.

706
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,940
 And then senses when the car smells gone.

707
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,780
 - Right.

708
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,620
 - And then drives it back.

709
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
 - That's cool.

710
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,100
 - And Chinese people to buy it, isn't that weird?

711
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
 - Yeah, do you know also,

712
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,780
 you said that the new car smell being leather.

713
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,780
 But actually, so Rolls Royce had a lot of complaints

714
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,440
 that their cars had lost the leathery smell.

715
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,700
 So they sent in this team,

716
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,180
 they were called SG Gordon Limited,

717
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,500
 to try and distill new car smell

718
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 so that they could put it into their new cars

719
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,080
 that don't have new car smell,

720
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,780
 so that it smells like a new car.

721
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,620
 - Okay.

722
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,680
 - And what ended up happening is that they discovered

723
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,320
 that it wasn't the leather predominantly

724
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,160
 that gave the smell.

725
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,220
 It wasn't the wood that you would get in certain cars.

726
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,420
 So a lot of cars now have replaced wood with plastic.

727
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,260
 And so the mixture is-

728
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,900
 - Who has a wooden car these days?

729
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,980
 - Well, Rolls Royce, particularly,

730
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,860
 yeah, would still have the idea.

731
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,580
 I mean, it doesn't even matter who has that anymore.

732
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,700
 That's where the smell of the old car came from.

733
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,540
 - Oh, interesting.

734
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,580
 But there are still some wooden cars.

735
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,180
 And I think it is a combination of wooden surfaces.

736
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
 I don't know.

737
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,860
 - Yeah.

738
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,780
 - I'm driving a car with wood in it.

739
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,900
 Not a wooden car.

740
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,780
 Like the Hogany on the inside and stuff.

741
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,620
 - Ooh.

742
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,460
 - Yeah.

743
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,760
 It's when I was dating the queen.

744
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
 (audience laughing)

745
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,400
 - Bruce Lee against Superman.

746
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,760
 That doesn't even work because he, in the movie,

747
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,280
 he plays Kato from the Green Hornet,

748
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,560
 which was the big TV show that Bruce Lee starred in in America.

749
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,200
 So he had a big kung fu career in Hong Kong

750
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
 and Chinese movies,

751
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
 but he also had an amazing American career.

752
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
 And Kato, as the Green Hornet was one.

753
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,700
 So he's against Superman,

754
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,640
 but Kato's part of the Batman universe.

755
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,600
 So, oh wait, that's the same universe.

756
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,760
 Scratch that, everyone.

757
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,720
 (audience laughing)

758
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,700
 I'll hand my nerd credentials back in.

759
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,540
 (audience laughing)

760
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,860
 There you go.

761
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,940
 - I'll be honest, you lost me about two minutes ago.

762
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,740
 - Yeah, take those credentials back, please.

763
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,500
 - Do you know that water flows?

764
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,340
 Do you know that water flows?

765
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,460
 - Yeah, water flows.

766
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,980
 - I would have to, otherwise it would all sink

767
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,380
 to the bottom of the sea, wouldn't it?

768
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,100
 - Hang on, some of it floats on the top, though.

769
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
 - Water flows.

770
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,420
 If you drop a meter of water in the middle

771
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,620
 of some other water, it'll just stay there.

772
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,740
 - So like different kind of water to--

773
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,680
 - Oh no, they're different, yeah, yeah.

774
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,000
 Like salt water and fresh water

775
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,020
 are different densities, I believe, so yeah.

776
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,320
 - But if you've got a whole body of normal tap water

777
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,100
 and then you drop some more tap water in,

778
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,040
 then it'll just stay there, bobbing around,

779
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,200
 like it's the same place.

780
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,040
 - It doesn't sort of like integrate,

781
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,080
 it just sits on top.

782
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,880
 - It doesn't sit on top like a Lego brick

783
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,600
 on top of more Lego, it goes--

784
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,720
 - Isn't that what floating is?

785
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,680
 (audience laughing)

786
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,320
 - Yeah, I mean, the other water's gotta move out of the way.

787
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,440
 If you move your, I guess what I'm trying to say--

788
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,060
 - Kyle and Andy, why is it that if I'm in a bath

789
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,580
 and I want to make it hotter, and I turn on the hot tap,

790
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,180
 I don't just get a small cube of really hot water

791
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,740
 after the tap, and I don't have to put different--

792
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,420
 - Well, that's 'cause you're swishing around

793
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,460
 with your rubber duck and all that.

794
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,500
 That's like, that's you being the wave sister.

795
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 But milk doesn't float despite the name, Milk Float.

796
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,340
 - Right.

797
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,500
 (audience laughing)

798
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,840
 Jesus Christ.

799
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,080
 So don't leave your cube of milk on top of the ocean.

800
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,660
 (audience laughing)

801
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,780
 You'll never see it again.

802
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,580
 - There is a thing called, what is it, dendrophilia,

803
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,460
 which is basically the sexualization of trees.

804
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,140
 I mean, that is a real thing that happens.

805
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,340
 I found a Wikipedia page on it.

806
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,020
 It's the most interesting write-up I've ever read

807
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,900
 on a Wikipedia page, says many people use vegetables

808
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,780
 and fruits such as cucumbers or carrots

809
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,620
 to insert into their anus.

810
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,460
 - Whoa, whoa.

811
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,620
 (audience laughing)

812
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,520
 As an object to receive sexual pleasure or orgasms

813
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,060
 when they masturbate, in men, holes can be used

814
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,800
 inside trees or trunks, assimilating the shape

815
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,480
 of a vagina through which the penis is inserted.

816
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,040
 - Why are you reading this, Dad?

817
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,800
 (audience laughing)

818
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,380
 - Well, this is the relevant bit.

819
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,540
 (audience laughing)

820
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,600
 - Why did you have to read all that film?

821
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,240
 - Many people experience feelings toward plants

822
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,920
 after having sex in a garden, forest, greenhouse,

823
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,860
 or bedroom with many plants.

824
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,780
 (audience laughing)

825
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,340
 The use of flowers to caress the body

826
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,040
 is also included in tendrophilia.

827
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,420
 And that's, so it's a big thing.

828
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,900
 - Can I tell you a cool thing about smell

829
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,860
 that is amazing in insane?

830
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,220
 Okay, get this.

831
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,860
 Right, what do you smell with?

832
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,700
 - Your nose.

833
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,540
 (burps)

834
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,940
 - You don't smell with your, so this is amazing.

835
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,660
 The nose is merely the pipe that takes the smells

836
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,260
 to where you really smell.

837
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,100
 (audience laughing)

838
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,900
 The place you smell, I'm gonna do a big boop

839
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,220
 with my finger pointing to where you actually smell.

840
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,580
 - Oh, this'll be great on audio.

841
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,580
 (audience laughing)

842
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,860
 (burps)

843
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,700
 - Wow.

844
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,540
 - Your eyebrows?

845
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,540
 - In the level of your eyebrows--

846
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,860
 - In between your eyebrows.

847
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,780
 - Right in between your eyebrows.

848
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,580
 Okay, the air goes up into your nose.

849
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,020
 Sure, we all know that.

850
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,780
 And then it curls around these little structures

851
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,220
 which carry the scent molecules

852
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,300
 of what you're trying to smell, right?

853
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,780
 That's the most important thing.

854
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,740
 They stop on the mucous membrane,

855
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,780
 and this is where it is.

856
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,060
 It's level with your eyebrows,

857
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,140
 and that's where the smell molecules actually get detected

858
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,340
 and received by this mucous membrane.

859
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,580
 - So could you cut out the middle man

860
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,220
 and just drill a hole in between,

861
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,900
 in like the Frida Carlos spot?

862
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,700
 - Yep, yep, yep, you could, yeah, yeah.

863
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,540
 - We should do that.

864
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,380
 - We recommend it.

865
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
 (audience laughing)

866
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,220
 - Wow.

867
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,060
 - Isn't that amazing?

868
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,900
 - Yeah.

869
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,740
 - That's where you smell.

870
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,580
 - Very cool.

871
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,420
 - You think you smell with your nose, sure,

872
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,700
 but you don't.

873
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,340
 - Yeah, it's just a vehicle.

874
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,020
 - Why isn't anyone more shocked about this?

875
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,740
 - They're stunned into silence.

876
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,260
 - It's not your nose is a place pretty close to your nose.

877
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
 (audience laughing)

878
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,780
 Inside what probably you could probably say is your nose.

879
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,220
 (audience laughing)

880
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,700
 - Wait, let me do the eyes now, let me do the eyes.

881
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,620
 (audience laughing)

882
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,460
 - I got one thing as well,

883
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,060
 which is this is just for anyone

884
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,700
 who's listened to this fact and gone,

885
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,220
 ah, if only I could read something

886
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,180
 about someone having sex with a tree.

887
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,180
 I just realized I read an entire novel in my 20s

888
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,340
 about this exact thing.

889
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,460
 It's called a melon for ecstasy,

890
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,180
 and it's all about a guy who goes around shagging trees, right?

891
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,540
 - So, Dan, I am not remotely surprised

892
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,460
 that you read this novel.

893
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,620
 I feel like I'd be stagnant if you hadn't read it.

894
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,540
 - Also, when does Dan's butt club podcast come out?

895
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,820
 (audience laughing)

896
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,640
 - Yeah, so basically the increased holes

897
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,500
 bored into the trunks of local trees,

898
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,240
 all of them 33 inches from the ground

899
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,540
 at an angle at between 15 and 20 degrees

900
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,540
 to the horizontal attracts the suspicion of the police.

901
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,580
 (audience laughing)

902
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,900
 It infuriates the council who see it as vandalism

903
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,060
 and excites ornithological society members

904
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,580
 who believe it indicates the return

905
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,700
 of the fabulously requested woodpecker.

906
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,260
 And the whole story is about the guy.

907
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,220
 - There's some kind of pecker that is chasing.

908
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,260
 (audience laughing)

909
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,340
 It's an amazing book, a melon for ecstasy.

910
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
 Everyone needs to get it.

911
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,060
 Yeah, his main worry is not being caught.

912
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,980
 It's all the splinters he gets as he's doing it.

913
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,320
 - Oh my God.

914
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,660
 - Anyway, we should move on, right?

915
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,180
 (audience laughing)

916
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,580
 - That was your choice to do that.

917
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,420
 - I know.

918
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,580
 (audience laughing)

919
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,420
 - Oh, I did it.

920
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,000
 (upbeat music)

921
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,860
 - You ready for more facts?

922
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,700
 (audience cheering)

923
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,060
 Thank you everyone who sent in a fact to us already.

924
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,580
 So James, what do you got, mate?

925
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,220
 - Oh yes, and this is the bit where I read one out, isn't it?

926
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,260
 That's fine.

927
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
 - Slick.

928
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,860
 - We spend a lot of time rehearsing this show.

929
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,180
 - Here's the fact.

930
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,580
 At Prince Now King Charles and Diana's wedding,

931
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,180
 the head waiter got a black eye from the queen.

932
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,140
 I know this because said head waiter of Claridge's

933
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,880
 is my grandfather.

934
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
 - Wow.

935
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,860
 - Wow.

936
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,980
 - Is this from Dan?

937
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,780
 (audience laughing)

938
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,460
 - Extra details.

939
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,220
 She, the queen, danced into a giant apple decoration

940
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,320
 which swung into his face.

941
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,160
 (audience laughing)

942
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,040
 She then followed him into the kitchen

943
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,620
 to make sure he was okay.

944
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,460
 - That's nice.

945
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,300
 - Nice, isn't it?

946
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,260
 Okay, here's another eyebrow one.

947
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,100
 - Yeah.

948
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,320
 - The common adjectives used before breasts in books

949
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,320
 are in order, left, full, big, right, and ample.

950
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,260
 - I thought in...

951
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,180
 (audience laughing)

952
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,300
 I thought in order was one of them when you said that.

953
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,700
 (audience laughing)

954
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,780
 - And that was said by someone who had

955
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,060
 a large machine learning data set at work

956
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,260
 and worked it out for themselves.

957
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
 - Wow.

958
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,540
 That actually, that was another death by the way,

959
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,380
 like a torture thing that they used to do according to legend

960
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,700
 which is they would take two trees

961
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,300
 and they would tie them together.

962
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,540
 So they would bend them right in

963
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,180
 and they would hold a rope that was holding them tight

964
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,500
 and then they would take the offending criminal

965
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,420
 and they would attach a rope to either side of the tree.

966
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,500
 Some say with just one leg to each tree

967
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,860
 and they would cut the rope

968
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,640
 and the trees would fling away

969
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,140
 and you would be ripped in half.

970
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,980
 - Yeah, yeah.

971
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,020
 - But is it like a wishbone where

972
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,980
 whichever tree got the big at heart?

973
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,180
 (audience laughing)

974
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,380
 - You're right, it should be like a cracker.

975
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,460
 There should be a joke on one side of that, yeah.

976
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,740
 - That was a thing that did happen,

977
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,220
 not just in the personal part, I think,

978
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,580
 'cause Saint Corona died in that way.

979
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,420
 - Really?

980
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,660
 - Yeah, patron saint of viruses.

981
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,820
 - Really?

982
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,660
 - No.

983
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,500
 - No, but like Saint Corona, I don't know what--

984
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,380
 - Saint Corona had a giant mime shoved into his throat.

985
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,560
 I'm pretty sure.

986
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,780
 - Do you know how a tosser died actually?

987
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,620
 - No.

988
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,140
 - This is according to a Spasius

989
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,420
 who was writing in the first century.

990
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,940
 So quite a long time after,

991
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,100
 but a Spasius said she was killed

992
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,500
 and eaten by her son Xerxes in a fit of distraction.

993
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,820
 - A fit of distraction?

994
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
 - Oh, further information.

995
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,740
 And I don't even know who was distracted.

996
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,580
 Who was he?

997
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,580
 He was eating a steak

998
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,700
 and accidentally got his mum on the way.

999
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,340
 - Oh my God.

1000
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,260
 Hey, you know, just super quickly back

1001
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,700
 to Dennis Popp and Ace of Base.

1002
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
 There was a thing that he used to do,

1003
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,660
 which eventually a lot of other pop musicians would do as well,

1004
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,780
 which was called the LA Car Test.

1005
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,540
 And the idea was you were gonna be able to make it in America

1006
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,260
 if your song was good enough to be played in a car in LA.

1007
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,660
 So what he would do is he would take finished songs

1008
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,620
 and he would send them over to LA

1009
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,500
 and he would people over there, drive on the highways,

1010
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,540
 listening to the songs in cars, going, "Yeah, man, groovy."

1011
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,380
 - That's cool.

1012
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,820
 - Yeah, and that's the LA Car Test.

1013
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,460
 So songs were deliberately like fixed or given a boost

1014
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,940
 simply by what the response was.

1015
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,780
 - That's so interesting.

1016
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,380
 'Cause like we always, like with podcasts as well,

1017
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,940
 you're supposed to play it in a car as well

1018
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,620
 because the audio is slightly different.

1019
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,660
 So if your audio is not quite right,

1020
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,300
 it's different if you hear it in headphones

1021
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,740
 than if you hear it in a car.

1022
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,820
 So I wonder if it's something like that.

1023
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,300
 - Do you do that when you're editing our show?

1024
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,380
 Do you go out for a drive?

1025
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,620
 - No, 'cause it's so funny.

1026
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,220
 I would just veer off the road.

1027
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,580
 No, if there's a slight audio problem,

1028
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,540
 I will do that, yeah.

1029
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,380
 - Do you?

1030
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,220
 - Yes.

1031
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,060
 (laughing)

1032
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,900
 - Get in the car.

1033
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,740
 - That's amazing.

1034
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,460
 (laughing)

1035
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,060
 I think that's really cool.

1036
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,020
 I think that's really cool, guys.

1037
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,140
 - Don't you agree?

1038
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,540
 Yeah, there you go.

1039
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,620
 - I don't think they,

1040
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,300
 that didn't sound like you really meant that.

1041
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,140
 - No.

1042
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,580
 (laughing)

1043
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,060
 - Can I just, on older people lying about things,

1044
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,980
 there was a big thing in the 1950s.

1045
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,860
 There was suddenly this hunt

1046
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,260
 for the last remaining US Civil War veterans.

1047
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,580
 And there was a guy called Walter Williams

1048
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,100
 who was declared in 1959 to have been

1049
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,220
 the last surviving veteran who then died.

1050
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,700
 And there was this massive week of official mourning

1051
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,500
 in Houston, there was a funeral procession,

1052
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
 more than 100,000 people came to line the streets

1053
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,380
 to say farewell to this guy,

1054
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,780
 the last person who'd been there.

1055
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,860
 In the 90s, a researcher looked into it,

1056
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,020
 found out that he'd been eight when the war ended

1057
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,740
 and definitely had not fought in the American Civil War.

1058
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,420
 But not only that, looked into all the other veterans

1059
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,460
 in the 1950s who were saying they were the oldest surviving

1060
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,180
 and they were all fake.

1061
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,980
 So, the person who acclaimed the oldest living veteran,

1062
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,380
 the oldest surviving veteran title from, was another phony.

1063
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,300
 The researcher found that every one of the 12

1064
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,660
 last remaining people to have survived the Civil War

1065
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,700
 had not fought in the Civil War.

1066
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
 There'd been a--

1067
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,820
 - Did they meet up and just occasionally look at each other

1068
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,740
 and go, "I know, I know, me either."

1069
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,540
 - They did, there was a reunion.

1070
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,220
 He said there'd been a veteran's reunion

1071
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,180
 and all the veterans who'd gone must have just been going,

1072
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,220
 "Yeah, you remember Alamo, was that Alamo?"

1073
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,380
 Yeah, and Dave, yeah.

1074
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,660
 - How weird is that?

1075
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,260
 - This is from 2011.

1076
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,820
 This is a statement that was put on a paintballing website,

1077
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,460
 okay, these are the words.

1078
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,060
 "Due to an incident at our Croydon Paintballing Center,

1079
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,900
 "you will be given special information

1080
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,580
 "on the dangers of paintballing with enhanced boobs

1081
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,740
 "and asked to sign a disclaimer.

1082
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,500
 "You will also be issued with extra padding

1083
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,020
 "to protect your implants while paintballing."

1084
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,700
 This was put up there because during a paintball session,

1085
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,820
 someone was shot in the boob and it exploded.

1086
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,780
 And apparently it was ruptured after it was hit

1087
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,100
 and this has been a huge problem, apparently.

1088
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,380
 It's very dangerous to have enhanced boobs while paintballing.

1089
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,140
 - A huge problem. - Yeah.

1090
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,980
 - That's it.

1091
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,420
 I was looking up some well-known clowns

1092
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,260
 and a well-known one in Britain working today

1093
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,260
 is Matty Faint, who's co-curator of the Clown Museum,

1094
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,420
 or who was that a couple of years ago, at least,

1095
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,500
 and he does kids parties and a lot of clowns now lament

1096
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,460
 the decline of the clown and they blame Disney.

1097
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,420
 Like a lot of entertainers now come to kids parties

1098
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,780
 dressed as Disney characters instead of clowns,

1099
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,740
 things like that.

1100
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,740
 But he said recently he did a kids party,

1101
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,220
 so he went to the kids' house and he performed as a clown

1102
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,740
 and it went down dreadfully well.

1103
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,820
 20 children laughing their asses off.

1104
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,660
 And then the mum said, "Thanks very much."

1105
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,140
 Paid him by and then he went upstairs to get changed

1106
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,180
 into his normal clothes and he came downstairs,

1107
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,180
 at which point the mother turned around,

1108
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,460
 saw him, grabbed him by the throat, shouting,

1109
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,060
 "Who are you? What are you doing in my house?"

1110
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,900
 LAUGHTER

1111
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,380
 'Cause to her, it's just a weird man

1112
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,100
 and normal clothes coming down her staircase.

1113
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,780
 That's so good. It's a dangerous job.

1114
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,660
 Here's a great Croydon Flight anecdote

1115
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,500
 from the Golden Age of Travel, right?

1116
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,700
 Uh-huh. And this is at a time when pilot nicknames included

1117
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,620
 Dizzy, Count Vodka, and Scruffy the Undertaker Robinson.

1118
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,220
 So there's a, like, you're in safe hands.

1119
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,660
 This is in 1924. There was a flight from Croydon to Paris

1120
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,540
 and someone looked out of the window and saw,

1121
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,860
 on the wing of the plane, as the plane was in the air,

1122
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,660
 a mechanic on the wing trying to fix the throttle mid-air.

1123
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,740
 Wow. Because he was trying to repair it.

1124
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,660
 He realised he couldn't, so he just stayed on the wing of the plane

1125
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,260
 for the entire flight to Paris.

1126
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,180
 Hang on. He had got on after it took off, right?

1127
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,740
 It wasn't like he was doing it on the ground

1128
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,380
 and then they forgot to tell him they were taking off.

1129
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,900
 I am not sure.

1130
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,660
 I think he climbed out in mid-air.

1131
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,060
 How do you do that, Andy? How do you do that, Andy?

1132
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,220
 He just held it open until the plane landed.

1133
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,380
 Well, they didn't use to fly very high, did they?

1134
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,460
 They flew really, really low. Yeah, they were going at 30,000 feet.

1135
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,220
 But they still fly fast.

1136
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,100
 Again, at the time, not very fast.

1137
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,460
 It's still scary.

1138
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,860
 There's no height of plane flight where I'm like,

1139
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,220
 "It's not actually that high. Don't really mind."

1140
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,300
 Yeah, I'll get on the wing.

1141
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,420
 It is scary. That's why this was a news story at the time

1142
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,100
 and why I think it's a relevant anecdote now.

1143
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,100
 Yeah. Yeah. It was scary and hard for the guy.

1144
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,180
 That's the point. Yeah.

1145
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,380
 So there was a study in 2019 about learning from your failures.

1146
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,540
 And basically, the conclusion was that failure

1147
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,340
 is an essential ingredient to success.

1148
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,900
 You have to fail to be successful.

1149
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,220
 But that doesn't alone make you successful.

1150
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,460
 You have to learn from your mistakes.

1151
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,540
 But I just found it so interesting in terms of, like,

1152
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,860
 the cold, hard-eye of academia, the way they worked this out.

1153
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,860
 It was a huge study and it looked at three different things.

1154
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,900
 So it looked at 777,000 grant applications

1155
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,340
 submitted to the Institute of Health

1156
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,580
 to see if they were successful or failures.

1157
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,660
 It looked at 46 years' worth of startup investments

1158
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,420
 to see if businesses were successful

1159
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,860
 or whether they were failures and what was the cause of that.

1160
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,820
 And it looked at 170,000 terrorist attacks

1161
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,260
 to see if they were failures.

1162
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,060
 And I think that's a bold thing.

1163
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,660
 And I don't know what involved, but it concluded,

1164
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,620
 and it looked, you know, a successful terrorist attack

1165
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,340
 is obviously a failure for most of us,

1166
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,220
 but a success for certain people.

1167
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,700
 So reassuringly, the test found that for,

1168
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,140
 if you're looking for a grant,

1169
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,340
 if you're trying to get a grant from the Institute of Health,

1170
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,900
 the average failure rate is 2.03 failures before you succeed.

1171
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,220
 For a startup, 1.5, and terrorists fail almost four times

1172
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,860
 before they succeed.

1173
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,620
 So, and we've got to cheer one person

1174
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,380
 cheering for the anti-terrorist brigade.

1175
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,220
 Well, as we all know,

1176
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,260
 Dan thinks her son of the laden is a great guy, so...

1177
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,340
 It's Maria Therese, the Queen of France.

1178
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,660
 So she was Spanish, but she was the wife of Louis XIV.

1179
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
 Oh, yeah.

1180
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,340
 She was in labor in 1661.

1181
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,580
 And in the old days, if you were royal,

1182
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,580
 it was basically open season for your birth.

1183
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,740
 Oh, everyone would come and watch?

1184
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,260
 Everyone just came and watched.

1185
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,500
 So when Maria and Therese gave birth,

1186
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,980
 there were nearly 200 people in her chambers,

1187
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,140
 mostly in an outer room,

1188
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,980
 but quite a few in the inner room as well.

1189
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,780
 And when Maria Therese, sort of a century earlier,

1190
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,660
 was giving birth,

1191
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,540
 lots of princesses and various dukes

1192
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,100
 started coming in to witness her giving birth.

1193
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,620
 And she hated it. She kept shouting,

1194
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
 "I don't want to give birth. I want to die."

1195
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,020
 And she had to shout that

1196
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
 because there were Spanish actors and musicians

1197
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,580
 dancing a ballet beneath the windows.

1198
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,300
 And they had guitars and casinettes

1199
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
 to remind her that she was Spanish.

1200
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,300
 (LAUGHTER)

1201
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,460
 There is another study.

1202
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,260
 This is an amazing one, where they looked at surgeons

1203
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,500
 who were doing coronary bypasses.

1204
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
 Right.

1205
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,020
 And they looked at ones that were successful

1206
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
 and the ones that were failures.

1207
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,860
 And they saw, if you did a failure,

1208
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,380
 were you going to be more successful in the future?

1209
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,100
 So have you learned from your mistakes?

1210
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
 Yeah.

1211
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,820
 And what they found was that actually that is true.

1212
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,620
 So surgeons who made mistakes,

1213
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,460
 they did tend to get much more successful as they went on,

1214
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,460
 but only to a certain level.

1215
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,620
 And after a certain amount of failing again and again and again,

1216
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,580
 you just get really, really shitted it.

1217
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,580
 Really?

1218
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,180
 Because you're just like, "Oh, I can't do this."

1219
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,380
 You just lose all confidence.

1220
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
 Yeah, right.

1221
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,380
 You're stuck in a rut.

1222
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,380
 I have that with getting facts right.

1223
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,940
 (LAUGHTER)

1224
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,460
 I've just given up at this point.

1225
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
 Yeah.

1226
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,060
 So I named my son Ted.

1227
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,060
 His middle name is Harpo after the Marx brother Harpo.

1228
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,300
 But Harpo is Oprah Winfrey's company as well.

1229
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,980
 I would assume that that would have been trademarked,

1230
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,180
 but I had no problems.

1231
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,180
 Oh, my God.

1232
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,180
 Oprah is Harpo backwards.

1233
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,580
 (LAUGHTER)

1234
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,580
 Yes.

1235
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,380
 And that's why she named the company that.

1236
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
 Oh, she knows that.

1237
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,380
 Okay, fine.

1238
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,380
 (LAUGHTER)

1239
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,220
 Well, um...

1240
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,780
 What a wild ride for you for five seconds.

1241
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
 That was huge.

1242
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
 I've got to move this on.

1243
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
 Oh, really?

1244
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
 Yeah, we need to get out of here.

1245
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,780
 Can I tell you about Mandels?

1246
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,780
 What?

1247
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
 Oh, I don't know.

1248
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
 Mandels.

1249
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
 These are male candles.

1250
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
 Okay.

1251
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,780
 'Cause there's a big problem for the candle industry,

1252
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,780
 which is that they're only hitting half the population.

1253
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
 Women tend to buy, like, more than 90% of candles.

1254
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,780
 Men tend not to buy them.

1255
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
 Okay.

1256
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,780
 And there have been consistent attempts to get blokes to buy candles.

1257
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,780
 So scents published have included aftershave, fine.

1258
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,780
 Chrome.

1259
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1260
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
 Fine.

1261
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,780
 The browser.

1262
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,780
 Smoked leather.

1263
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
 Okay.

1264
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
 Rome.

1265
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1266
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,780
 Not a Roman candle like a firework.

1267
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
 Just the smells of Rome.

1268
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1269
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,780
 And there's one exhaust.

1270
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
 And I just wanted to read you the...

1271
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1272
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
 Like, here's the blurb.

1273
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1274
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,780
 Do you find yourself taking a minute in the morning to enjoy the unique scent of exhaust

1275
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
 when you turn your car on?

1276
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1277
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,780
 We pray that you do not get down on your knees and enjoy the musky smell straight from the

1278
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,780
 sauce, but we do pray you buy our candles so you can enjoy the smell with light.

1279
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,780
 We do pray you buy our candles so you can enjoy the smell with less danger.

1280
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
 Avoid the headache.

1281
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
 Good God.

1282
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
 Yeah.

1283
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
 Wow.

1284
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
 They've really got men, haven't they?

1285
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
 Yeah.

1286
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1287
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,780
 So my parents opened up a salon in Hong Kong.

1288
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,780
 First customer my mum ever did was Robert Kwok.

1289
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,780
 And he immediately...

1290
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1291
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
 He's too rich to keep that in the show, please.

1292
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
 (LAUGHTER)

1293
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
 Okay.

1294
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
 Here's the thing.

1295
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
 Do you think you learn from your failures?

1296
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
 Yeah, I think so.

1297
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
 No question.

1298
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
 I reckon.

1299
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
 That's the whole point, isn't it?

1300
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,780
 Well, there's this common idea that, you know, oh, well, actually I just failed my way until

1301
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
 I succeeded.

1302
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
 But you learn from your mistakes, right?

1303
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,780
 But I think people don't tend to.

1304
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,780
 Like failing repeatedly is not a good way to succeed.

1305
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,780
 You do actually have to think about why you fail, don't you, and then act on it.

1306
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,780
 Yes.

1307
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,780
 And people...

1308
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,780
 So it's quite hard to do experiments on whether you learn from your failures, but here is one

1309
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
 experiment.

1310
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
 Scientists got people to do a practice test, right?

1311
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,780
 They gave them feedback, fake feedback on how they performed, and then they would do a real

1312
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
 test.

1313
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,780
 And they were asked how happy it would make them if they did well.

1314
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,780
 So the people who got negative feedback immediately said, "Oh, well, I wouldn't care at all if

1315
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
 I did well on the real test."

1316
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,780
 They were lying.

1317
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,780
 They were protecting themselves, you know.

1318
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,780
 And then when they did the second test, they got given fake feedback again.

1319
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,780
 And so you got full marks.

1320
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,780
 And they were thrilled.

1321
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,780
 They were so happy that they'd done well.

1322
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,780
 So people try and protect their self-image as competent people.

1323
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,780
 And when they get proof that they're wrong, it does away with that image.

1324
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,780
 I've just realized I read out the wrong fact in relation to the leading, which makes this

1325
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,780
 bit of the show something I will not learn from.

1326
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,780
 But it was all part of the plan.

1327
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,780
 It's a bit about failure.

1328
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
 You're living it right now.

1329
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,780
 That's insane.

1330
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,780
 You failed literally in the moment, as you were telling us.

1331
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
 Beautiful.

1332
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,780
 The thing that seems relevant to me about what you were saying.

1333
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,780
 Yeah.

1334
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,780
 And I wonder if this is what you meant to say.

1335
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,780
 Let me know.

1336
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,780
 Hang on, Andy's going through something right now.

1337
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,780
 I feel like we should all pause and just watch it.

1338
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,780
 You know, like in an Edinburgh documentary where you don't interfere?

1339
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
 I feel like...

1340
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
 Is that what you do when someone really fucks up?

1341
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,780
 You get everyone to pause and watch it?

1342
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
 Yeah.

1343
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,780
 And then something in the background goes, "Here we see the podcaster struggling with his words."

1344
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:56,780
