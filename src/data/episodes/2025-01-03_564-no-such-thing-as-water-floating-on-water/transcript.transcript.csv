00:00:09,00:00:11,Hope you had a nice Christmas.
00:00:11,00:00:14,"If not, I hope it was manageable at least"
00:00:14,00:00:15,and I hope we're all looking forward to
00:00:15,00:00:19,what is in store for 2025.
00:00:19,00:00:21,We've taken a little bit of a break this week
00:00:21,00:00:23,"after a very, very busy year"
00:00:23,00:00:25,where we've written all sorts of books
00:00:25,00:00:27,and been on tour around the world
00:00:27,00:00:29,and what we have for you instead of a normal episode
00:00:29,00:00:32,is a compilation of the best bits
00:00:32,00:00:34,that didn't quite make it into the show
00:00:34,00:00:39,"from our UK, Ireland and Sweden leg of our tour."
00:00:39,00:00:42,So what you'll get here is lots of silly things
00:00:42,00:00:43,that didn't quite fit in the show.
00:00:43,00:00:45,You get loads and loads of extra facts.
00:00:45,00:00:47,Really hope you enjoy it.
00:00:47,00:00:49,But I don't really wanna keep up any more of your time
00:00:49,00:00:53,so all I'll say is happy new year and on with the podcast.

00:00:59,00:01:14,- We ran out of QI by himself.
00:01:14,00:01:15,- Yeah.
00:01:15,00:01:17,- Which was No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:01:17,00:01:18,- No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:01:18,00:01:22,"- No, seriously, it's in the OX office."
00:01:22,00:01:24,- From the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:01:24,00:01:25,"- And then at the end,"
00:01:25,00:01:27,it turns out you get to run over by a train.
00:01:27,00:01:29,- Let me just do one more thing about Mars.
00:01:29,00:01:31,"- Oh my God, I'm surrounded by idiots."

00:02:52,00:02:53,- Hey guys.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Thanks so much for coming.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- Hello.
00:02:55,00:02:57,- How are you guys doing?
00:02:57,00:02:59,(audience cheering)
00:02:59,00:03:00,Let's do this.
00:03:00,00:03:04,Welcome to our 10 year anniversary show.
00:03:04,00:03:06,Tonight is gonna be a party.
00:03:06,00:03:07,It's gonna be an awesome night.
00:03:07,00:03:09,We're gonna be celebrating your facts as well.
00:03:09,00:03:10,You've sent a bunch in.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Thank you very much.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"James, you've been collecting them, right?"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- Yes, I've got a few here."
00:03:14,00:03:18,"For instance, Napoleon fell in love with Josephine"
00:03:18,00:03:22,because she could do a naughty act called the zigzags.
00:03:22,00:03:25,And nobody knows what the zigzags were.
00:03:25,00:03:27,- Wow.
00:03:27,00:03:28,Really?
00:03:28,00:03:30,"- Well, according to random person who texted me."
00:03:30,00:03:31,- Wow.
00:03:31,00:03:33,- And there's no better sauce than that.
00:03:33,00:03:37,"Can we get the lights up on the audience, please?"
00:03:37,00:03:38,"Oh, hello."
00:03:38,00:03:39,- Oh.
00:03:39,00:03:40,"- Oh, wow."
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Oh, you guys are much more attractive"
00:03:41,00:03:43,than I thought you were gonna be.
00:03:43,00:03:46,(audience laughing)
00:03:46,00:03:49,"Okay, here is a fact sent by someone in this room."
00:03:49,00:03:51,"This is brilliant, actually."
00:03:51,00:03:54,"Between Heathrow and Rome, from takeoff to touchdown,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,the flight time is the exact run length time
00:03:57,00:04:00,"of the 2000 film ""Gladiator."""
00:04:00,00:04:03,"If you've got a window seat on the right side of the plane,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,you'll be flying over the Colosseum as Maximus and Commodus
00:04:06,00:04:08,enter the arena for the final battle.
00:04:08,00:04:09,- Fuck off.
00:04:09,00:04:10,- That's great.
00:04:10,00:04:11,- That's amazing.
00:04:11,00:04:12,- That's great.
00:04:12,00:04:13,- Wow.
00:04:13,00:04:14,Isn't that great?
00:04:14,00:04:15,- Very good thing.
00:04:15,00:04:18,- The blue whale produces the largest fart bubble.
00:04:18,00:04:19,(audience laughing)
00:04:19,00:04:23,"It's so large, a zebra who makes the loudest fart"
00:04:23,00:04:24,can fit in it.
00:04:24,00:04:25,(audience laughing)
00:04:25,00:04:27,"- Oh, gold."
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- In Tudor, England, there was a type of criminal"
00:04:29,00:04:31,called a bear top trickster.
00:04:31,00:04:35,A woman would flash her breasts to lure men into a house.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"Once he'd come inside, brackets, the house,"
00:04:38,00:04:39,he would be robbed.
00:04:39,00:04:41,(audience laughing)
00:04:41,00:04:42,- He would be what?
00:04:42,00:04:43,- Robbed.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- Oh, he would be robbed."
00:04:44,00:04:45,"- Oh, okay."
00:04:45,00:04:45,- That's very cool.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"- Yeah, the funny bit was the brackets bit, really."
00:04:47,00:04:48,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:04:48,00:04:49,"That's good, thanks."
00:04:49,00:04:52,"When dragonflies get tired, they suck water up their bum"
00:04:52,00:04:54,and jet it out to propel themselves forward.
00:04:54,00:04:57,(audience laughing)
00:04:57,00:04:58,- That's so cool.
00:04:58,00:04:59,- It's funny 'cause I would have thought
00:04:59,00:05:00,that's quite tiring in itself.
00:05:00,00:05:02,"- It does feel tiring, doesn't it?"
00:05:02,00:05:03,- Yeah.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"- I'm just clenching now, and yeah, yeah."
00:05:06,00:05:10,- Have you guys read about a story I love last year
00:05:10,00:05:13,"is about probably the two most influential writers,"
00:05:13,00:05:16,"academics, who write about honesty,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,who have released a bunch of papers.
00:05:18,00:05:21,We definitely have come across them in our work.
00:05:21,00:05:22,They released a very famous paper
00:05:22,00:05:26,"sort of showing that basically,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,"if you nudge people a certain way,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,they'll be more honest.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"So, for instance, in a dinner."
00:05:32,00:05:33,- Which part of their body do you have to touch?
00:05:33,00:05:35,(audience laughing)
00:05:35,00:05:36,- No one did that.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"It's against sort of like study principles,"
00:05:39,00:05:42,but if you have to sign a bit at the top
00:05:42,00:05:43,"of your tax return that says,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"""I promise I've told the truth,"""
00:05:45,00:05:46,"rather than at the bottom,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,the study showed that people are more honest
00:05:48,00:05:50,'cause they've just signed this.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"The thing is, these two famous people,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"one of whom, Dan Ariely, wrote a book called"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"The Honest Truth About Dishonesty,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"were cheating in the paper, allegedly, I have to say,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"but were cheated in the paper,"
00:06:01,00:06:04,and the data was falsified.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"And not only falsified, but falsified in a way"
00:06:05,00:06:09,that even I could tell because it's in two different fonts.
00:06:09,00:06:12,(audience laughing)
00:06:12,00:06:15,"They just, the data that was true was in Calibri font,"
00:06:15,00:06:18,and then there was a bunch of Cambria thrown in.
00:06:18,00:06:18,(audience laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:21,"- Hey, I found the equivalent"
00:06:21,00:06:24,"to the American movie, 127 Hours."
00:06:24,00:06:26,You know where Ann Rolston gets stuck
00:06:26,00:06:27,"while he's out on his own,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,and his arm gets trapped underneath a boulder.
00:06:29,00:06:30,He eventually has to chop off his arm
00:06:30,00:06:31,"in order to survive,"
00:06:31,00:06:33,and he does that 127 hours into it.
00:06:33,00:06:35,So I found the British edition of it.
00:06:35,00:06:36,It should be called 60 Hours.
00:06:36,00:06:40,"This is a man called Joe Galliat from Yoval in Somerset,"
00:06:40,00:06:45,"who spent two days underneath his sofa after it fell on him,"
00:06:45,00:06:46,and he couldn't get out of it
00:06:46,00:06:48,"because he had a few back problems,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,"and he only survived because when the sofa fell over,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"a bottle of whiskey rolled towards him,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,(audience laughing)
00:06:54,00:06:58,and he survived sipping whiskey for two days.
00:06:58,00:06:58,- What kind of substance?
00:06:58,00:07:00,- Until a neighbor noticed
00:07:00,00:07:02,that his curtains hadn't moved in two days
00:07:02,00:07:03,"and thought something's wrong with Joe,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,"and they went and they found him,"
00:07:05,00:07:05,and then he survived.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"He spent five days in hospital,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,but he said he was there for two whole days.
00:07:09,00:07:12,"And at first he said, I took a sip of the whiskey,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"and I thought, oh, well, this isn't too bad."
00:07:14,00:07:17,(audience laughing)
00:07:17,00:07:19,- What are they called?
00:07:19,00:07:20,The door sausages.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"- Yeah, door sausages."
00:07:21,00:07:22,- What are they called?
00:07:22,00:07:23,- Trapped excluders.
00:07:23,00:07:25,- Yes.
00:07:25,00:07:27,"- Door sausages, is that what you mean?"
00:07:27,00:07:28,(audience laughing)
00:07:28,00:07:30,- Another insight into the Murray home life.
00:07:30,00:07:31,(audience laughing)
00:07:31,00:07:32,Another veil ripped away
00:07:32,00:07:34,from my carefully crafted persona.
00:07:34,00:07:35,(audience laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:36,"Oh, well."
00:07:36,00:07:37,- I have to go as a translator
00:07:37,00:07:39,"whenever you go to DFS, don't I, Andy?"
00:07:39,00:07:41,(audience laughing)
00:07:41,00:07:45,He wants one of those brown marshmallow sitting things.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"Sofa, yeah, he wants a sofa."
00:07:47,00:07:50,"- Wow, what's James Harkin?"
00:07:50,00:07:52,"- Oh, there are no anagrams of that."
00:07:52,00:07:55,(audience laughing)
00:07:55,00:07:57,"- Hey, speaking of storytellers from overseas."
00:07:57,00:07:59,Surely Shane Jerkin.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"No, does that work?"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"- Wow, you just did that?"
00:08:02,00:08:03,"- Well, I don't know if it's right."
00:08:03,00:08:06,(audience laughing)
00:08:06,00:08:07,Come back in a few minutes.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:08,00:08:11,(audience laughing)
00:08:11,00:08:14,"So there's another thing which happens around the world,"
00:08:14,00:08:17,"which, okay, no, let's just pause and watch Andy write."
00:08:17,00:08:19,(audience laughing)
00:08:19,00:08:21,"- No, oh. - Use the E twice."
00:08:21,00:08:22,(imitates sound)
00:08:22,00:08:23,It worked.
00:08:23,00:08:27,"No, it's Shane Jerkin."
00:08:27,00:08:28,(audience laughing)
00:08:28,00:08:29,- I worked at some more.
00:08:29,00:08:30,(audience laughing)
00:08:30,00:08:33,- You know who was one of the most rich people in America
00:08:33,00:08:34,off the back of Beavers?
00:08:34,00:08:37,Was John Jacob Astor.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"And he became a billionaire,"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"and he's a name that a few of you might be going,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"""John Jacob Astor, how do I know that name?"""
00:08:42,00:08:45,"He was at the time of the sinking of the Titanic,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"possibly the richest man in America,"
00:08:47,00:08:48,"maybe even the world,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,and he's one of the men who died on the Titanic.
00:08:50,00:08:53,And so his fortune was largely about Beavers.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"And when I read that, I just thought,"
00:08:55,00:08:59,"I do wonder if in the final seconds of his life,"
00:08:59,00:09:02,"if he thought, ""Friendly, we had a bunch of Beavers here,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,"""and we could have plugged this whole up in instinct."""
00:09:04,00:09:05,- Yeah.
00:09:05,00:09:07,- What do you think?
00:09:07,00:09:10,"- Maybe, maybe that was his final thought."
00:09:10,00:09:14,"Or maybe, oh, I wish I'd worn my entire full body"
00:09:14,00:09:16,"Beaver onesie tonight, and then I could just swim away."
00:09:16,00:09:17,- Yes.
00:09:17,00:09:19,- I think that's weighing you down.
00:09:19,00:09:19,I do.
00:09:19,00:09:21,I think even lying on that door is not gonna keep you up
00:09:21,00:09:23,if you're wearing the full Beaver onesie.
00:09:23,00:09:26,- This is how I'd use my time travel moment.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"If I got one time in a machine, that's where I'd go."
00:09:28,00:09:29,"Not to save him, just to go,"
00:09:29,00:09:32,"""Andy and I have a bit of a bet going."""
00:09:32,00:09:34,(audience laughing)
00:09:34,00:09:35,"- Actually, did you know that,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,"sorry, speaking of ambassadors and names,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,that the U.S. ambassador to Denmark
00:09:39,00:09:40,used to be called Dick Sweat?
00:09:40,00:09:42,(audience laughing)
00:09:42,00:09:47,"And there was, this is 1998, 2001."
00:09:47,00:09:49,"- When this goes out, someone who knows it's going,"
00:09:49,00:09:52,"""Dick, you made, you were on, no such thing as a fish,"
00:09:52,00:09:52,"""you gotta have a listen."""
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- No, I don't know why they're laughing at your name."
00:09:54,00:09:56,(audience laughing)
00:09:56,00:09:57,- They must have cut out the interesting bit
00:09:57,00:09:59,they said about you afterwards.
00:09:59,00:10:00,(audience laughing)
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- Yes, he was."
00:10:01,00:10:04,His opponent actually campaigned to have his name removed
00:10:04,00:10:05,"from the ballot paper 'cause he said,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"""In the phone book, he's listed as Lantos Sweat,"
00:10:08,00:10:09,"""so it's not legally correct."""
00:10:09,00:10:11,"But obviously, his opponents just worried"
00:10:11,00:10:12,that everyone's gonna vote for Dick Sweat
00:10:12,00:10:13,"if they see it, right?"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:15,00:10:17,"I like, there was a guy called Soren Sorensen Adams"
00:10:17,00:10:19,who invented a type of itching powder
00:10:19,00:10:23,"which basically transformed the world of jokes, right?"
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- Like this guy, I can't believe he's not a name"
00:10:26,00:10:28,that I have known before this.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"He did itching powder, he did the--"
00:10:30,00:10:31,- The joy buzzer.
00:10:31,00:10:33,- The joy buzzer in your hand.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"- He did, what did he do?"
00:10:35,00:10:36,He did sneezing powder.
00:10:36,00:10:37,- The squirting flower.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"- Squirting flower, the guy was a genius."
00:10:39,00:10:41,- He refused to do the whoopie cushion.
00:10:41,00:10:42,- Did he?
00:10:42,00:10:43,- He said that was vulgar.
00:10:43,00:10:44,- Wow.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:47,- And this was the man behind the dirty Fido
00:10:47,00:10:48,plastic toy thing.
00:10:48,00:10:49,- What's that?
00:10:49,00:10:50,- That's the sort of fake dog poo.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"- Oh yeah, and then fake vomit, he did as well."
00:10:52,00:10:53,- Did fake vomit?
00:10:53,00:10:55,"And he said, no, whoopie cushion is too far."
00:10:55,00:10:57,So they went elsewhere.
00:10:57,00:10:58,- One of your earliest facts down was that whoopie cushion
00:10:58,00:11:01,was invented by a great ancient Roman.
00:11:01,00:11:02,So for him to say that was lowbrow.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"- Oh, come on, you know, it's credited to an emperor"
00:11:05,00:11:09,"called Elagabalus, but his birth name was Bacianus."
00:11:09,00:11:11,(audience laughing)
00:11:11,00:11:13,The whoopie cushion was invented by Bacianus.
00:11:13,00:11:16,"Like, it's the greatest fact that I've ever,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,I feel like I was the first person to notice it.
00:11:18,00:11:19,Like--
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- Unbelievable, the classical scholars"
00:11:20,00:11:22,haven't pointed that out before.
00:11:22,00:11:23,(audience laughing)
00:11:23,00:11:24,- Fools.
00:11:24,00:11:26,- How many people do you think you could fit in a phone box?
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- Oh, that's good."
00:11:27,00:11:28,"- 'Cause this was a thing, wasn't it?"
00:11:28,00:11:30,In the 1950s and '60s.
00:11:30,00:11:31,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:11:31,00:11:32,- Sort of classic red wall.
00:11:32,00:11:34,- You would get one of these classic phone boxes.
00:11:34,00:11:35,You would stuff as many students in as you can.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"Well, they would stuff themselves in."
00:11:37,00:11:39,You wouldn't be able to do that.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"- It was 'cause it was before the age of group Zoom calls,"
00:11:41,00:11:42,wasn't it?
00:11:42,00:11:44,(all laughing)
00:11:44,00:11:45,- What ages are we talking here?
00:11:45,00:11:46,"Like, are we allowed--"
00:11:46,00:11:47,"- They tended to be students,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"so there would have been, I guess, teenagers."
00:11:49,00:11:51,- But you look down on if there's a tiny corner left
00:11:51,00:11:53,and you shove a one-year-old in there.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"Like, is that--"
00:11:54,00:11:55,(audience laughing)
00:11:55,00:11:56,"- Well, this is the interesting thing."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"Like, there were loads of different rules,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,"but the official rules, basically,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,you had to be more or less adult-sized.
00:12:02,00:12:05,You had to get at least part of the greater portion
00:12:05,00:12:08,of your body into a standard upright phone booth.
00:12:08,00:12:11,- I'm going to say low ball and say three.
00:12:11,00:12:13,(all laughing)
00:12:13,00:12:15,"- Ooh, yeah, two."
00:12:15,00:12:17,(all laughing)
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Nine.
00:12:18,00:12:19,- I'm going to say 15.
00:12:19,00:12:21,"- Okay, well, the answer,"
00:12:21,00:12:25,"the official record from March 20th, 1959, was 25."
00:12:25,00:12:25,- Whoa! - Whoa!
00:12:25,00:12:29,- But there was a Canadian school
00:12:29,00:12:33,"that claimed to have got 40 students in a phone box,"
00:12:33,00:12:35,but it was later found that they'd turned it on its side
00:12:35,00:12:38,and they used a much larger phone box than normal.
00:12:38,00:12:39,(all laughing)
00:12:39,00:12:41,"So then they put the official rules in,"
00:12:41,00:12:44,"and the really amazing thing is that only in England,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,they had an additional rule
00:12:45,00:12:47,"that as well as all getting in there,"
00:12:47,00:12:50,the group had to be able to either place
00:12:50,00:12:52,or answer a phone call while they were in there.
00:12:52,00:12:54,- Amazing. - So good.
00:12:54,00:12:55,(all laughing)
00:12:55,00:12:58,"- In 2011, Chinese magician called Fu Yandong"
00:12:58,00:13:02,his pièce de résistance was six goldfish
00:13:02,00:13:03,doing synchronized swimming.
00:13:03,00:13:04,(all laughing)
00:13:04,00:13:05,- Really?
00:13:05,00:13:08,"- Yeah, 53 different animal rights groups complained"
00:13:08,00:13:09,(all laughing)
00:13:09,00:13:13,saying it is quite clearly magnets in their stomachs
00:13:13,00:13:14,and they are being interviewed.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"- Oh, God!"
00:13:15,00:13:16,- Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"- Oh, my God. - Oh, God, Andy."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"- Do they check Olympians for that, for magnets?"
00:13:21,00:13:23,(all laughing)
00:13:23,00:13:26,- Do you know that Simon Cowell and Ricky Gervais
00:13:26,00:13:27,look like Stonehenge?
00:13:28,00:13:32,"- This is according to the clothing company, Jackamo,"
00:13:32,00:13:36,who made the thing called the architecture of man.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"And this doesn't really make any sense,"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"but apparently to train their staff,"
00:13:41,00:13:44,they would choose famous people
00:13:44,00:13:47,and say what monuments they look like.
00:13:47,00:13:49,And that supposedly would help their staff
00:13:49,00:13:51,work out people's sizes.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"I know, it doesn't make any sense at all."
00:13:53,00:13:56,- Why do you just say you look a bit like Ricky Gervais?
00:13:56,00:13:57,"- Why goes through the needless answer to the step of,"
00:13:57,00:14:00,you look like Stone7 from Stonehenge?
00:14:00,00:14:03,- I reckon probably less people would be insulted
00:14:03,00:14:04,by saying they look like Stonehenge
00:14:04,00:14:06,than they look like Ricky Gervais.
00:14:06,00:14:06,- Very true.
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Perhaps.
00:14:07,00:14:10,"But yeah, so Ricky Gervais and Simon Cowell"
00:14:10,00:14:11,look like Stonehenge.
00:14:11,00:14:14,Russell Crowe and Jay-Z look like the Tine Bridge.
00:14:14,00:14:16,And James Corden looks like the Gherkin.
00:14:16,00:14:19,(all laughing)
00:14:19,00:14:20,- That's amazing.
00:14:20,00:14:21,"- Sorry, personal addings though."
00:14:21,00:14:24,"But my friend, we were at a party once,"
00:14:24,00:14:28,"you guys know him, and he was a packed party"
00:14:28,00:14:30,and he really needed the toilet.
00:14:30,00:14:34,And the window that was at the room led to an alleyway.
00:14:34,00:14:36,So he thought there's no one going to be walking there.
00:14:36,00:14:39,"So he opened up the window and he peed out the window, right?"
00:14:39,00:14:43,And about five minutes later the door gets kicked
00:14:43,00:14:47,"into the room and this soaked man comes walking in,"
00:14:47,00:14:50,"going, who fucking pissed on me?"
00:14:50,00:14:53,"And we all had to go, that didn't happen here, I don't know."
00:14:53,00:14:55,But it's really hard to keep a straight face
00:14:55,00:14:58,when a man soaked in urine is angry at you.
00:14:58,00:15:01,"- Sorry, that man must have stood still."
00:15:01,00:15:02,- I don't know.
00:15:02,00:15:03,- Underneath.
00:15:03,00:15:06,What sounds like quite a thick shower of urine.
00:15:06,00:15:10,"- I never questioned why he was so soaked, yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:12,- Speak up your reaction.
00:15:12,00:15:13,- Who did that?
00:15:13,00:15:15,"That's not in my life, you."
00:15:15,00:15:16,Give me your number.
00:15:16,00:15:17,- Oh God.
00:15:17,00:15:19,"Wow, wow."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- If you're itching, you know why it's scratching works."
00:15:21,00:15:22,It's kind of interesting this.
00:15:22,00:15:23,- Oh yeah?
00:15:23,00:15:26,"- I'm not sure it's funny, but it is interesting, okay."
00:15:26,00:15:28,Basically you scratch it and your body thinks
00:15:28,00:15:30,that something bad is happening to you
00:15:30,00:15:33,and that is more important than the itch itself.
00:15:33,00:15:36,And so the scratch sort of blocks off
00:15:36,00:15:37,the pathways to your brain.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"So you've got a little itch, you scratch"
00:15:40,00:15:43,"and your body thinks, oh my God, someone's scratching me."
00:15:43,00:15:45,And then it concentrates way more on that
00:15:45,00:15:46,than it does on the itch itself.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"What that means is if you have an itch,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,it also works if you tickle yourself.
00:15:50,00:15:53,And it also works if you press down on it
00:15:53,00:15:55,"or if you put something cold on it, it all does the same thing."
00:15:55,00:15:57,- So we could have been tickling ourselves all these years
00:15:57,00:15:58,rather than scratching.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- Exactly.
00:15:59,00:16:01,- Well there's even been studies that if you have an itch
00:16:01,00:16:03,"on one side, it likes you on your left side of your body,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,if you look in a mirror and you scratch
00:16:05,00:16:08,the other side of your body because it has the idea
00:16:08,00:16:10,"that then you will get rid of the itch, yeah."
00:16:10,00:16:12,- Does that work for everyone or just idiots?
00:16:12,00:16:15,(audience laughing)
00:16:15,00:16:19,"- Well, it works for idiots and me because I tested it"
00:16:19,00:16:20,and it does work.
00:16:20,00:16:25,We sort of have Beethoven to thank for CDs.
00:16:25,00:16:28,"Not the entire technology, but one very important bit,"
00:16:28,00:16:32,which is the reason that CDs are the diameter that they are
00:16:32,00:16:35,and the length of time that they can take on as a recording
00:16:35,00:16:36,is because the man who invented them
00:16:36,00:16:40,wanted to be able to play all of Beethoven's ninth symphony
00:16:40,00:16:43,in one go without having to change the CD.
00:16:43,00:16:46,So he needed 75 minutes worth of music on there
00:16:46,00:16:48,in order to do it and that's what defined it.
00:16:48,00:16:49,That was his condition.
00:16:49,00:16:51,- That's really cool.
00:16:51,00:16:56,"- And if you don't know what CD is, you can Google it."
00:16:56,00:16:59,"- When Osama bin Laden was killed,"
00:16:59,00:17:02,"it was by SEAL Team Six, right?"
00:17:02,00:17:05,"Two days after SEAL Team Six took him out,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,guess who tried to trademark SEAL Team Six?
00:17:07,00:17:09,- SEAL?
00:17:09,00:17:10,- That would be incredible.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- The singer SEAL.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"- Yeah, the singer SEAL, no, Walt Disney."
00:17:14,00:17:16,"The Walt Disney company tried, they--"
00:17:16,00:17:18,- How would we have guessed that?
00:17:18,00:17:20,(audience laughs)
00:17:20,00:17:21,"- Good point, yeah."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"- It just would have been a long, first off."
00:17:23,00:17:24,- It was a long game.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"- Is it because, well, is it because they were gonna make"
00:17:27,00:17:30,like a cartoon with loads of SEALs
00:17:30,00:17:31,who went around killing terrorists?
00:17:31,00:17:33,"- They were gonna, 'cause Disney's gone, obviously,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"into more dramas, like, yeah."
00:17:35,00:17:38,"And so they thought, wow, this would be an amazing series."
00:17:38,00:17:40,We'll do SEAL Team Six.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"And so that was their first thought though,"
00:17:42,00:17:46,immediately after Osama bin Laden died.
00:17:46,00:17:47,"They have someone in their company who does that and goes,"
00:17:47,00:17:48,let's trademark that.
00:17:48,00:17:49,"And so, yeah."
00:17:49,00:17:51,But Disney are famously a benevolent
00:17:51,00:17:53,"and charming corporation, I don't understand."
00:17:53,00:17:54,- What do you want them to do?
00:17:54,00:17:56,Have a month of mourning for Osama bin Laden?
00:17:56,00:17:57,"I think fair enough, Disney."
00:17:57,00:18:01,"- Bit of respect for the great man, he'd been good."
00:18:01,00:18:03,(audience laughs)
00:18:03,00:18:04,"- And let's end on that, Dan."
00:18:04,00:18:07,- We actually do need to move on.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"So that's annoying that we are ending on that, but."
00:18:10,00:18:11,(audience laughs)
00:18:11,00:18:13,Not great for my career.
00:18:13,00:18:16,(upbeat music)
00:18:16,00:18:19,(audience cheers)
00:18:19,00:18:24,- Yeah.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- How are we doing?
00:18:25,00:18:28,- Has anyone spotted what's missing from the stage?
00:18:28,00:18:30,"And there's wine, that's correct."
00:18:30,00:18:31,"- Yeah, I'm gonna have to do something so unprofessional."
00:18:31,00:18:33,I thought I'd save it for this.
00:18:33,00:18:35,"Someone backstage, I forgot to bring my wine on"
00:18:35,00:18:37,and I won't be able to make it through without.
00:18:37,00:18:40,Could you possibly fill right to the brim?
00:18:40,00:18:42,(audience laughs)
00:18:42,00:18:42,Thanks.
00:18:42,00:18:45,As you were.
00:18:45,00:18:46,(Dan laughs)
00:18:46,00:18:49,- It's like working with Gilgud himself.
00:18:49,00:18:50,(audience laughs)
00:18:50,00:18:52,"- Quickly, 'cause you did say Gilgud,"
00:18:52,00:18:55,"laughingly compared me to Gilgud, but."
00:18:55,00:18:57,"- Here's James, everybody."
00:18:57,00:18:59,"Here's our tour manager, James."
00:18:59,00:19:00,"- James Hingley, everyone."
00:19:00,00:19:02,(audience cheers)
00:19:02,00:19:04,- Save the show for this.
00:19:04,00:19:07,- As if Gilgud was the epitome of professionalism.
00:19:07,00:19:09,Was it not him who was once in the audience of a play
00:19:09,00:19:11,"really pissed, he'd been at the pub all day,"
00:19:11,00:19:12,he was with his mate and he leaned over to his mate
00:19:12,00:19:14,"and whispered, oh, this is really good,"
00:19:14,00:19:15,this is where I come on.
00:19:15,00:19:17,(audience laughs)
00:19:17,00:19:19,"Pretty sure, so."
00:19:19,00:19:20,- Yeah.
00:19:20,00:19:21,- There's kind of caricatures that you get
00:19:21,00:19:24,"on the street these days, where they're just rude about you"
00:19:24,00:19:25,"and you have to pay them with a tenner,"
00:19:25,00:19:26,or whatever it is.
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:19:27,00:19:28,- I've never had that done.
00:19:28,00:19:30,"- Haven't you? - Because I'm too afraid to,"
00:19:30,00:19:30,basically.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"- But the thing is about you, Andy,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,is you have no discernible features.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- Wow.
00:19:34,00:19:35,(audience laughs)
00:19:35,00:19:36,- Wow.
00:19:36,00:19:39,- Do you remember when people would draw fan art of us
00:19:39,00:19:43,"and they'd have silly hair, glasses, woman's hair,"
00:19:43,00:19:44,and just a stick figure?
00:19:44,00:19:45,"- A guy, just a guy."
00:19:45,00:19:47,- Generic stick man for Andy.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- That did happen.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"- Weirdly, it looks exactly like you"
00:19:50,00:19:51,whenever we saw them.
00:19:51,00:19:52,(audience laughs)
00:19:52,00:19:53,"- He actually, did you read,"
00:19:53,00:19:55,there's just one other thing about George Cookshack.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"So he was famous for being Dickens Illustrator as well,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"he illustrated a lot of Dickens books,"
00:20:00,00:20:01,and he claimed that he actually came up
00:20:01,00:20:03,with the whole plot for Oliver Twist
00:20:03,00:20:05,and said he wanted to call it Frank Foundling.
00:20:05,00:20:08,And so I think him and Dickens ended on slightly bad terms.
00:20:08,00:20:09,- Frank Foundling.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Frank Foundling.
00:20:10,00:20:11,- Bad man.
00:20:11,00:20:12,- It could have been.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- It works, yeah."
00:20:13,00:20:14,- It could have been.
00:20:14,00:20:14,"- It's a bit decadent, yeah."
00:20:14,00:20:17,"- But he was an obsessive bore of a T-totaler,"
00:20:17,00:20:20,"and he was once burgled, and he caught the burglar,"
00:20:20,00:20:22,"and while grasping him with one hand,"
00:20:22,00:20:25,"he felt his pulse with the other hand,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,and noticed that it was the usual 75 beats a minute.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"Therefore, had not been increased"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"by the exertion and the excitement at all,"
00:20:32,00:20:35,and so he started expounding on the benefits of temperance
00:20:35,00:20:37,"to the burglar that he'd caught, explaining,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,"""You see, it's because I don't drink, my pulse, feel it."""
00:20:40,00:20:42,"So the police came along,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,he's still lecturing this poor burglar
00:20:44,00:20:47,who bit off more than he could chew about not drinking.
00:20:47,00:20:49,- That's so funny.
00:20:49,00:20:51,- What is a lunette?
00:20:51,00:20:54,"Not the lunette, you might say."
00:20:54,00:20:57,"- A lawn yet was the perspectacle, wasn't it?"
00:20:57,00:20:59,"A lunette is a light, a whole full of light."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- Torture thing?
00:21:00,00:21:02,"- Yes, it's a torture thing."
00:21:02,00:21:03,- French torture thing?
00:21:03,00:21:04,- Yes.
00:21:04,00:21:04,- French accent?
00:21:04,00:21:05,- Not the lunette.
00:21:05,00:21:07,(laughing)
00:21:07,00:21:11,- It is the hole where you put your head through in a guillotine.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"- Oh, very good."
00:21:13,00:21:15,- It's a lunette.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"Probably they mostly just said not the guillotine, surely?"
00:21:17,00:21:18,- Not the lunette.
00:21:18,00:21:20,- I don't think the specific detail of the hole
00:21:20,00:21:22,is what's worrying.
00:21:22,00:21:24,It's more what's above the lunette.
00:21:24,00:21:27,"- I just like the idea of the guy who's gonna do the,"
00:21:27,00:21:28,"with the axe of the mask on going,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"""Ugh, a connoisseur."""
00:21:30,00:21:32,(laughing)
00:21:32,00:21:33,- Pleasure to meet you.
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- Am I right that actually,"
00:21:34,00:21:35,"if you're having your head chopped off,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"you never have to see the lunette,"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"because you can't fit your head through that hole, can't you?"
00:21:40,00:21:42,"Don't you put your neck on the, on the dip?"
00:21:42,00:21:44,- Would you put it on the block?
00:21:44,00:21:46,- And then they put the thing down over your neck.
00:21:46,00:21:47,"- Yeah, right."
00:21:47,00:21:48,"- Oh, yeah."
00:21:48,00:21:49,- Maybe in some design.
00:21:49,00:21:50,So perhaps the one sweet relief
00:21:50,00:21:51,is that you don't have to see the lunette.
00:21:51,00:21:52,- You never see the lunette.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"- Another cool protester,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"I just like really, Wavy Gravy."
00:21:56,00:21:57,"- Oh yeah, Wavy Gravy."
00:21:57,00:21:59,- I thought you'd be a Wavy Gravy fan.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"He was the emcee for Woodstock,"
00:22:01,00:22:03,"hung out with all those beat generation people,"
00:22:03,00:22:08,and he nominated nobody to be president in 1976.
00:22:08,00:22:10,I think it was.
00:22:10,00:22:11,And he was just really cool.
00:22:11,00:22:13,He had a son called
00:22:13,00:22:16,Howdy Doogood Gravy Tomahawk Truck Stock Romney.
00:22:16,00:22:19,- Is he in relation to Mitt Romney?
00:22:19,00:22:22,And do they socialize?
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- Yeah, brothers, yeah."
00:22:23,00:22:24,He goes by the name Jordan.
00:22:24,00:22:27,- Here's a weird thing about the Queen's car.
00:22:27,00:22:29,"She had multiple cars,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,but they all had the same license plate number.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"It was the same, she, yeah, had the red license."
00:22:34,00:22:38,"- D1 GL1Z, was it, or something like that?"
00:22:38,00:22:39,"- No, it was a."
00:22:39,00:22:44,- Took a little while for some of you to work that out.
00:22:44,00:22:46,"- It was, no, it was Jiggy 280."
00:22:46,00:22:47,- Jiggy?
00:22:47,00:22:51,"- Yeah, Jgy 280."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"And at any time that she got a new car,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,she had that as the personalized license plate.
00:22:55,00:22:58,And I can't see if there's something
00:22:58,00:22:59,that was a reason behind it.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- What could it stand for?
00:23:00,00:23:01,- Yeah.
00:23:01,00:23:04,- It was just gallivanting.
00:23:04,00:23:05,You help me out here.
00:23:05,00:23:08,"- Yeah, come here on the map."
00:23:08,00:23:09,"- I thought it was very interesting,"
00:23:09,00:23:13,"researching this, that in China, they hate new car smell."
00:23:13,00:23:14,It's so weird.
00:23:14,00:23:17,So we famously love new car smell.
00:23:17,00:23:19,And they're always trying to replicate
00:23:19,00:23:20,that smell of a new car.
00:23:20,00:23:21,"- So what, this is when you buy a new car."
00:23:21,00:23:22,- Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:24,"And it's got all the surfaces in it,"
00:23:24,00:23:26,still have the new chemicals on them
00:23:26,00:23:28,that are gradually being released.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"And, yeah, it's like."
00:23:30,00:23:32,"- Delicious carcinogens, isn't it?"
00:23:32,00:23:32,"- Yes, exactly."
00:23:32,00:23:34,"- Is it bad for you, new car smell?"
00:23:34,00:23:35,- I believe it's bad for you.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- It's slightly bad for you.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"They've done studies and it's like,"
00:23:38,00:23:39,it's a little bit above what we'd recommend
00:23:39,00:23:40,you're inhaling.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"So don't just sniff the seat,"
00:23:42,00:23:44,let the seats in your car day after day.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"But new car smell, the Brits really like it."
00:23:46,00:23:48,"But in China, they've actually,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,Ford have had to come up with an odour remover
00:23:50,00:23:51,"for car smells because in China,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,they hate it so much.
00:23:53,00:23:56,"And in 2018, it was affecting car sales."
00:23:56,00:24:01,"So they hired, in 2017, Ford hired 18 golden noses,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,which were human beings whose job it was
00:24:04,00:24:06,to go inside a car and rate the smell
00:24:06,00:24:10,from not perceptible to extremely disturbing.
00:24:10,00:24:13,And then they'd work out ways to get rid of it.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"And they patented a device in the end,"
00:24:14,00:24:19,"which basically drives your car to a clean area,"
00:24:19,00:24:20,winds down the windows and airs it out.
00:24:20,00:24:22,And then senses when the car smells gone.
00:24:22,00:24:23,- Right.
00:24:23,00:24:24,- And then drives it back.
00:24:24,00:24:25,- That's cool.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- And Chinese people to buy it, isn't that weird?"
00:24:27,00:24:28,"- Yeah, do you know also,"
00:24:28,00:24:31,you said that the new car smell being leather.
00:24:31,00:24:34,"But actually, so Rolls Royce had a lot of complaints"
00:24:34,00:24:37,that their cars had lost the leathery smell.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"So they sent in this team,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,"they were called SG Gordon Limited,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,to try and distill new car smell
00:24:44,00:24:46,so that they could put it into their new cars
00:24:46,00:24:48,"that don't have new car smell,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,so that it smells like a new car.
00:24:49,00:24:50,- Okay.
00:24:50,00:24:52,- And what ended up happening is that they discovered
00:24:52,00:24:54,that it wasn't the leather predominantly
00:24:54,00:24:55,that gave the smell.
00:24:55,00:24:58,It wasn't the wood that you would get in certain cars.
00:24:58,00:25:00,So a lot of cars now have replaced wood with plastic.
00:25:00,00:25:01,And so the mixture is-
00:25:01,00:25:02,- Who has a wooden car these days?
00:25:02,00:25:04,"- Well, Rolls Royce, particularly,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"yeah, would still have the idea."
00:25:06,00:25:09,"I mean, it doesn't even matter who has that anymore."
00:25:09,00:25:11,That's where the smell of the old car came from.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"- Oh, interesting."
00:25:12,00:25:13,But there are still some wooden cars.
00:25:13,00:25:16,And I think it is a combination of wooden surfaces.
00:25:16,00:25:17,I don't know.
00:25:17,00:25:17,- Yeah.
00:25:17,00:25:18,- I'm driving a car with wood in it.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Not a wooden car.
00:25:19,00:25:22,Like the Hogany on the inside and stuff.
00:25:22,00:25:23,- Ooh.
00:25:23,00:25:24,- Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:25,It's when I was dating the queen.
00:25:25,00:25:28,(audience laughing)
00:25:28,00:25:29,- Bruce Lee against Superman.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"That doesn't even work because he, in the movie,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"he plays Kato from the Green Hornet,"
00:25:35,00:25:38,which was the big TV show that Bruce Lee starred in in America.
00:25:38,00:25:41,So he had a big kung fu career in Hong Kong
00:25:41,00:25:42,"and Chinese movies,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,but he also had an amazing American career.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"And Kato, as the Green Hornet was one."
00:25:47,00:25:48,"So he's against Superman,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,but Kato's part of the Batman universe.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"So, oh wait, that's the same universe."
00:25:52,00:25:53,"Scratch that, everyone."
00:25:53,00:25:54,(audience laughing)
00:25:54,00:25:56,I'll hand my nerd credentials back in.
00:25:56,00:25:57,(audience laughing)
00:25:57,00:25:58,There you go.
00:25:58,00:26:01,"- I'll be honest, you lost me about two minutes ago."
00:26:01,00:26:04,"- Yeah, take those credentials back, please."
00:26:04,00:26:06,- Do you know that water flows?
00:26:06,00:26:08,Do you know that water flows?
00:26:08,00:26:09,"- Yeah, water flows."
00:26:09,00:26:10,"- I would have to, otherwise it would all sink"
00:26:10,00:26:12,"to the bottom of the sea, wouldn't it?"
00:26:12,00:26:15,"- Hang on, some of it floats on the top, though."
00:26:15,00:26:15,- Water flows.
00:26:15,00:26:17,If you drop a meter of water in the middle
00:26:17,00:26:19,"of some other water, it'll just stay there."
00:26:19,00:26:21,- So like different kind of water to--
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- Oh no, they're different, yeah, yeah."
00:26:23,00:26:25,Like salt water and fresh water
00:26:25,00:26:27,"are different densities, I believe, so yeah."
00:26:27,00:26:29,- But if you've got a whole body of normal tap water
00:26:29,00:26:31,"and then you drop some more tap water in,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"then it'll just stay there, bobbing around,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,like it's the same place.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"- It doesn't sort of like integrate,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,it just sits on top.
00:26:38,00:26:39,- It doesn't sit on top like a Lego brick
00:26:39,00:26:41,"on top of more Lego, it goes--"
00:26:41,00:26:42,- Isn't that what floating is?
00:26:42,00:26:44,(audience laughing)
00:26:44,00:26:46,"- Yeah, I mean, the other water's gotta move out of the way."
00:26:46,00:26:49,"If you move your, I guess what I'm trying to say--"
00:26:49,00:26:53,"- Kyle and Andy, why is it that if I'm in a bath"
00:26:53,00:26:55,"and I want to make it hotter, and I turn on the hot tap,"
00:26:55,00:26:59,I don't just get a small cube of really hot water
00:26:59,00:27:01,"after the tap, and I don't have to put different--"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"- Well, that's 'cause you're swishing around"
00:27:03,00:27:04,with your rubber duck and all that.
00:27:04,00:27:07,"That's like, that's you being the wave sister."
00:27:07,00:27:12,"But milk doesn't float despite the name, Milk Float."
00:27:12,00:27:13,- Right.
00:27:13,00:27:16,(audience laughing)
00:27:16,00:27:17,Jesus Christ.
00:27:17,00:27:22,So don't leave your cube of milk on top of the ocean.
00:27:22,00:27:23,(audience laughing)
00:27:23,00:27:25,You'll never see it again.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"- There is a thing called, what is it, dendrophilia,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,which is basically the sexualization of trees.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"I mean, that is a real thing that happens."
00:27:33,00:27:35,I found a Wikipedia page on it.
00:27:35,00:27:38,It's the most interesting write-up I've ever read
00:27:38,00:27:40,"on a Wikipedia page, says many people use vegetables"
00:27:40,00:27:42,and fruits such as cucumbers or carrots
00:27:42,00:27:44,to insert into their anus.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"- Whoa, whoa."
00:27:45,00:27:46,(audience laughing)
00:27:46,00:27:49,As an object to receive sexual pleasure or orgasms
00:27:49,00:27:52,"when they masturbate, in men, holes can be used"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"inside trees or trunks, assimilating the shape"
00:27:54,00:27:57,of a vagina through which the penis is inserted.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"- Why are you reading this, Dad?"
00:27:59,00:28:00,(audience laughing)
00:28:00,00:28:02,"- Well, this is the relevant bit."
00:28:02,00:28:04,(audience laughing)
00:28:04,00:28:06,- Why did you have to read all that film?
00:28:06,00:28:10,- Many people experience feelings toward plants
00:28:10,00:28:12,"after having sex in a garden, forest, greenhouse,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,or bedroom with many plants.
00:28:14,00:28:16,(audience laughing)
00:28:16,00:28:18,The use of flowers to caress the body
00:28:18,00:28:20,is also included in tendrophilia.
00:28:20,00:28:22,"And that's, so it's a big thing."
00:28:22,00:28:23,- Can I tell you a cool thing about smell
00:28:23,00:28:25,that is amazing in insane?
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Okay, get this."
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Right, what do you smell with?"
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Your nose.
00:28:29,00:28:30,(burps)
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- You don't smell with your, so this is amazing."
00:28:32,00:28:35,The nose is merely the pipe that takes the smells
00:28:35,00:28:37,to where you really smell.
00:28:37,00:28:39,(audience laughing)
00:28:39,00:28:42,"The place you smell, I'm gonna do a big boop"
00:28:42,00:28:45,with my finger pointing to where you actually smell.
00:28:45,00:28:46,"- Oh, this'll be great on audio."
00:28:46,00:28:49,(audience laughing)
00:28:49,00:28:51,(burps)
00:28:51,00:28:52,- Wow.
00:28:52,00:28:53,- Your eyebrows?
00:28:53,00:28:55,- In the level of your eyebrows--
00:28:55,00:28:56,- In between your eyebrows.
00:28:56,00:28:57,- Right in between your eyebrows.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"Okay, the air goes up into your nose."
00:28:59,00:29:01,"Sure, we all know that."
00:29:01,00:29:02,And then it curls around these little structures
00:29:02,00:29:04,which carry the scent molecules
00:29:04,00:29:05,"of what you're trying to smell, right?"
00:29:05,00:29:06,That's the most important thing.
00:29:06,00:29:08,"They stop on the mucous membrane,"
00:29:08,00:29:09,and this is where it is.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"It's level with your eyebrows,"
00:29:12,00:29:16,and that's where the smell molecules actually get detected
00:29:16,00:29:18,and received by this mucous membrane.
00:29:18,00:29:19,- So could you cut out the middle man
00:29:19,00:29:21,"and just drill a hole in between,"
00:29:21,00:29:22,in like the Frida Carlos spot?
00:29:22,00:29:24,"- Yep, yep, yep, you could, yeah, yeah."
00:29:24,00:29:25,- We should do that.
00:29:25,00:29:26,- We recommend it.
00:29:26,00:29:27,(audience laughing)
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Wow.
00:29:28,00:29:29,- Isn't that amazing?
00:29:29,00:29:29,- Yeah.
00:29:29,00:29:30,- That's where you smell.
00:29:30,00:29:31,- Very cool.
00:29:31,00:29:32,"- You think you smell with your nose, sure,"
00:29:32,00:29:33,but you don't.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- Yeah, it's just a vehicle."
00:29:35,00:29:38,- Why isn't anyone more shocked about this?
00:29:38,00:29:39,- They're stunned into silence.
00:29:39,00:29:43,- It's not your nose is a place pretty close to your nose.
00:29:43,00:29:45,(audience laughing)
00:29:45,00:29:48,Inside what probably you could probably say is your nose.
00:29:48,00:29:50,(audience laughing)
00:29:50,00:29:52,"- Wait, let me do the eyes now, let me do the eyes."
00:29:52,00:29:54,(audience laughing)
00:29:54,00:29:55,"- I got one thing as well,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,which is this is just for anyone
00:29:57,00:29:58,"who's listened to this fact and gone,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,"ah, if only I could read something"
00:30:00,00:30:02,about someone having sex with a tree.
00:30:02,00:30:06,I just realized I read an entire novel in my 20s
00:30:06,00:30:07,about this exact thing.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"It's called a melon for ecstasy,"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"and it's all about a guy who goes around shagging trees, right?"
00:30:13,00:30:16,"- So, Dan, I am not remotely surprised"
00:30:16,00:30:17,that you read this novel.
00:30:17,00:30:20,I feel like I'd be stagnant if you hadn't read it.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"- Also, when does Dan's butt club podcast come out?"
00:30:23,00:30:24,(audience laughing)
00:30:24,00:30:27,"- Yeah, so basically the increased holes"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"bored into the trunks of local trees,"
00:30:29,00:30:32,all of them 33 inches from the ground
00:30:32,00:30:34,at an angle at between 15 and 20 degrees
00:30:34,00:30:37,to the horizontal attracts the suspicion of the police.
00:30:37,00:30:38,(audience laughing)
00:30:38,00:30:40,It infuriates the council who see it as vandalism
00:30:40,00:30:44,and excites ornithological society members
00:30:44,00:30:45,who believe it indicates the return
00:30:45,00:30:48,of the fabulously requested woodpecker.
00:30:48,00:30:50,And the whole story is about the guy.
00:30:50,00:30:52,- There's some kind of pecker that is chasing.
00:30:52,00:30:53,(audience laughing)
00:30:53,00:30:55,"It's an amazing book, a melon for ecstasy."
00:30:55,00:30:56,Everyone needs to get it.
00:30:56,00:30:58,"Yeah, his main worry is not being caught."
00:30:58,00:30:59,It's all the splinters he gets as he's doing it.
00:30:59,00:31:01,- Oh my God.
00:31:01,00:31:02,"- Anyway, we should move on, right?"
00:31:02,00:31:04,(audience laughing)
00:31:04,00:31:05,- That was your choice to do that.
00:31:05,00:31:06,- I know.
00:31:06,00:31:07,(audience laughing)
00:31:07,00:31:08,"- Oh, I did it."
00:31:08,00:31:11,(upbeat music)
00:31:11,00:31:14,- You ready for more facts?
00:31:14,00:31:16,(audience cheering)
00:31:16,00:31:19,Thank you everyone who sent in a fact to us already.
00:31:19,00:31:20,"So James, what do you got, mate?"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"- Oh yes, and this is the bit where I read one out, isn't it?"
00:31:24,00:31:25,That's fine.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- Slick.
00:31:26,00:31:27,- We spend a lot of time rehearsing this show.
00:31:27,00:31:29,- Here's the fact.
00:31:29,00:31:32,"At Prince Now King Charles and Diana's wedding,"
00:31:32,00:31:36,the head waiter got a black eye from the queen.
00:31:36,00:31:39,I know this because said head waiter of Claridge's
00:31:39,00:31:40,is my grandfather.
00:31:40,00:31:41,- Wow.
00:31:41,00:31:42,- Wow.
00:31:42,00:31:43,- Is this from Dan?
00:31:43,00:31:46,(audience laughing)
00:31:46,00:31:48,- Extra details.
00:31:48,00:31:52,"She, the queen, danced into a giant apple decoration"
00:31:52,00:31:54,which swung into his face.
00:31:54,00:31:55,(audience laughing)
00:31:55,00:31:57,She then followed him into the kitchen
00:31:57,00:31:58,to make sure he was okay.
00:31:58,00:31:59,- That's nice.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"- Nice, isn't it?"
00:32:00,00:32:02,"Okay, here's another eyebrow one."
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:06,- The common adjectives used before breasts in books
00:32:06,00:32:11,"are in order, left, full, big, right, and ample."
00:32:11,00:32:13,- I thought in...
00:32:13,00:32:15,(audience laughing)
00:32:15,00:32:17,I thought in order was one of them when you said that.
00:32:17,00:32:19,(audience laughing)
00:32:19,00:32:21,- And that was said by someone who had
00:32:21,00:32:24,a large machine learning data set at work
00:32:24,00:32:25,and worked it out for themselves.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Wow.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"That actually, that was another death by the way,"
00:32:28,00:32:31,like a torture thing that they used to do according to legend
00:32:31,00:32:33,which is they would take two trees
00:32:33,00:32:35,and they would tie them together.
00:32:35,00:32:37,So they would bend them right in
00:32:37,00:32:40,and they would hold a rope that was holding them tight
00:32:40,00:32:42,and then they would take the offending criminal
00:32:42,00:32:45,and they would attach a rope to either side of the tree.
00:32:45,00:32:48,Some say with just one leg to each tree
00:32:48,00:32:49,and they would cut the rope
00:32:49,00:32:51,and the trees would fling away
00:32:51,00:32:53,and you would be ripped in half.
00:32:53,00:32:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:53,00:32:55,- But is it like a wishbone where
00:32:55,00:32:56,whichever tree got the big at heart?
00:32:56,00:32:58,(audience laughing)
00:32:58,00:32:59,"- You're right, it should be like a cracker."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"There should be a joke on one side of that, yeah."
00:33:02,00:33:04,"- That was a thing that did happen,"
00:33:04,00:33:06,"not just in the personal part, I think,"
00:33:06,00:33:09,'cause Saint Corona died in that way.
00:33:09,00:33:10,- Really?
00:33:10,00:33:11,"- Yeah, patron saint of viruses."
00:33:11,00:33:12,- Really?
00:33:12,00:33:13,- No.
00:33:13,00:33:16,"- No, but like Saint Corona, I don't know what--"
00:33:16,00:33:19,- Saint Corona had a giant mime shoved into his throat.
00:33:19,00:33:20,I'm pretty sure.
00:33:20,00:33:23,- Do you know how a tosser died actually?
00:33:23,00:33:24,- No.
00:33:24,00:33:26,- This is according to a Spasius
00:33:26,00:33:27,who was writing in the first century.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"So quite a long time after,"
00:33:28,00:33:32,but a Spasius said she was killed
00:33:32,00:33:35,and eaten by her son Xerxes in a fit of distraction.
00:33:35,00:33:37,- A fit of distraction?
00:33:37,00:33:39,"- Oh, further information."
00:33:39,00:33:41,And I don't even know who was distracted.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Who was he?
00:33:42,00:33:43,He was eating a steak
00:33:43,00:33:45,and accidentally got his mum on the way.
00:33:45,00:33:47,- Oh my God.
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Hey, you know, just super quickly back"
00:33:49,00:33:51,to Dennis Popp and Ace of Base.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"There was a thing that he used to do,"
00:33:53,00:33:56,"which eventually a lot of other pop musicians would do as well,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,which was called the LA Car Test.
00:33:58,00:34:02,And the idea was you were gonna be able to make it in America
00:34:02,00:34:06,if your song was good enough to be played in a car in LA.
00:34:06,00:34:08,So what he would do is he would take finished songs
00:34:08,00:34:10,and he would send them over to LA
00:34:10,00:34:13,"and he would people over there, drive on the highways,"
00:34:13,00:34:16,"listening to the songs in cars, going, ""Yeah, man, groovy."""
00:34:16,00:34:17,- That's cool.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"- Yeah, and that's the LA Car Test."
00:34:18,00:34:22,So songs were deliberately like fixed or given a boost
00:34:22,00:34:23,simply by what the response was.
00:34:23,00:34:24,- That's so interesting.
00:34:24,00:34:27,"'Cause like we always, like with podcasts as well,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,you're supposed to play it in a car as well
00:34:29,00:34:31,because the audio is slightly different.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"So if your audio is not quite right,"
00:34:33,00:34:35,it's different if you hear it in headphones
00:34:35,00:34:36,than if you hear it in a car.
00:34:36,00:34:37,So I wonder if it's something like that.
00:34:37,00:34:39,- Do you do that when you're editing our show?
00:34:39,00:34:40,Do you go out for a drive?
00:34:40,00:34:41,"- No, 'cause it's so funny."
00:34:41,00:34:43,I would just veer off the road.
00:34:43,00:34:46,"No, if there's a slight audio problem,"
00:34:46,00:34:47,"I will do that, yeah."
00:34:47,00:34:48,- Do you?
00:34:48,00:34:49,- Yes.
00:34:49,00:34:50,(laughing)
00:34:50,00:34:50,- Get in the car.
00:34:50,00:34:51,- That's amazing.
00:34:51,00:34:53,(laughing)
00:34:53,00:34:55,I think that's really cool.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"I think that's really cool, guys."
00:34:57,00:34:58,- Don't you agree?
00:34:58,00:35:00,"Yeah, there you go."
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- I don't think they,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,that didn't sound like you really meant that.
00:35:03,00:35:04,- No.
00:35:04,00:35:05,(laughing)
00:35:05,00:35:08,"- Can I just, on older people lying about things,"
00:35:08,00:35:11,there was a big thing in the 1950s.
00:35:11,00:35:12,There was suddenly this hunt
00:35:12,00:35:15,for the last remaining US Civil War veterans.
00:35:15,00:35:17,And there was a guy called Walter Williams
00:35:17,00:35:20,who was declared in 1959 to have been
00:35:20,00:35:23,the last surviving veteran who then died.
00:35:23,00:35:25,And there was this massive week of official mourning
00:35:25,00:35:27,"in Houston, there was a funeral procession,"
00:35:27,00:35:31,"more than 100,000 people came to line the streets"
00:35:31,00:35:33,"to say farewell to this guy,"
00:35:33,00:35:34,the last person who'd been there.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"In the 90s, a researcher looked into it,"
00:35:36,00:35:40,found out that he'd been eight when the war ended
00:35:40,00:35:42,and definitely had not fought in the American Civil War.
00:35:42,00:35:46,"But not only that, looked into all the other veterans"
00:35:46,00:35:49,in the 1950s who were saying they were the oldest surviving
00:35:49,00:35:51,and they were all fake.
00:35:51,00:35:54,"So, the person who acclaimed the oldest living veteran,"
00:35:54,00:35:58,"the oldest surviving veteran title from, was another phony."
00:35:58,00:36:01,The researcher found that every one of the 12
00:36:01,00:36:03,last remaining people to have survived the Civil War
00:36:03,00:36:05,had not fought in the Civil War.
00:36:05,00:36:06,There'd been a--
00:36:06,00:36:08,- Did they meet up and just occasionally look at each other
00:36:08,00:36:11,"and go, ""I know, I know, me either."""
00:36:11,00:36:13,"- They did, there was a reunion."
00:36:13,00:36:15,He said there'd been a veteran's reunion
00:36:15,00:36:18,"and all the veterans who'd gone must have just been going,"
00:36:18,00:36:22,"""Yeah, you remember Alamo, was that Alamo?"""
00:36:22,00:36:24,"Yeah, and Dave, yeah."
00:36:24,00:36:25,- How weird is that?
00:36:25,00:36:27,- This is from 2011.
00:36:27,00:36:30,"This is a statement that was put on a paintballing website,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,"okay, these are the words."
00:36:32,00:36:36,"""Due to an incident at our Croydon Paintballing Center,"
00:36:36,00:36:37,"""you will be given special information"
00:36:37,00:36:41,"""on the dangers of paintballing with enhanced boobs"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"""and asked to sign a disclaimer."
00:36:43,00:36:45,"""You will also be issued with extra padding"
00:36:45,00:36:48,"""to protect your implants while paintballing."""
00:36:48,00:36:50,"This was put up there because during a paintball session,"
00:36:50,00:36:52,someone was shot in the boob and it exploded.
00:36:52,00:36:56,And apparently it was ruptured after it was hit
00:36:56,00:36:59,"and this has been a huge problem, apparently."
00:36:59,00:37:01,It's very dangerous to have enhanced boobs while paintballing.
00:37:01,00:37:03,- A huge problem. - Yeah.
00:37:03,00:37:03,- That's it.
00:37:03,00:37:07,I was looking up some well-known clowns
00:37:07,00:37:10,and a well-known one in Britain working today
00:37:10,00:37:13,"is Matty Faint, who's co-curator of the Clown Museum,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,"or who was that a couple of years ago, at least,"
00:37:15,00:37:19,and he does kids parties and a lot of clowns now lament
00:37:19,00:37:21,the decline of the clown and they blame Disney.
00:37:21,00:37:23,Like a lot of entertainers now come to kids parties
00:37:23,00:37:25,"dressed as Disney characters instead of clowns,"
00:37:25,00:37:26,things like that.
00:37:26,00:37:29,"But he said recently he did a kids party,"
00:37:29,00:37:33,so he went to the kids' house and he performed as a clown
00:37:33,00:37:34,and it went down dreadfully well.
00:37:34,00:37:36,20 children laughing their asses off.
00:37:36,00:37:39,"And then the mum said, ""Thanks very much."""
00:37:39,00:37:43,Paid him by and then he went upstairs to get changed
00:37:43,00:37:46,"into his normal clothes and he came downstairs,"
00:37:46,00:37:48,"at which point the mother turned around,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,"saw him, grabbed him by the throat, shouting,"
00:37:50,00:37:53,"""Who are you? What are you doing in my house?"""
00:37:53,00:37:54,LAUGHTER
00:37:54,00:37:58,"'Cause to her, it's just a weird man"
00:37:58,00:38:01,and normal clothes coming down her staircase.
00:38:01,00:38:03,That's so good. It's a dangerous job.
00:38:03,00:38:06,Here's a great Croydon Flight anecdote
00:38:06,00:38:08,"from the Golden Age of Travel, right?"
00:38:08,00:38:11,Uh-huh. And this is at a time when pilot nicknames included
00:38:11,00:38:16,"Dizzy, Count Vodka, and Scruffy the Undertaker Robinson."
00:38:16,00:38:20,"So there's a, like, you're in safe hands."
00:38:20,00:38:24,This is in 1924. There was a flight from Croydon to Paris
00:38:24,00:38:27,"and someone looked out of the window and saw,"
00:38:27,00:38:29,"on the wing of the plane, as the plane was in the air,"
00:38:29,00:38:33,a mechanic on the wing trying to fix the throttle mid-air.
00:38:33,00:38:36,Wow. Because he was trying to repair it.
00:38:36,00:38:39,"He realised he couldn't, so he just stayed on the wing of the plane"
00:38:39,00:38:42,for the entire flight to Paris.
00:38:42,00:38:44,"Hang on. He had got on after it took off, right?"
00:38:44,00:38:45,It wasn't like he was doing it on the ground
00:38:45,00:38:47,and then they forgot to tell him they were taking off.
00:38:47,00:38:48,I am not sure.
00:38:48,00:38:50,I think he climbed out in mid-air.
00:38:50,00:38:52,"How do you do that, Andy? How do you do that, Andy?"
00:38:52,00:38:53,He just held it open until the plane landed.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"Well, they didn't use to fly very high, did they?"
00:38:55,00:38:57,"They flew really, really low. Yeah, they were going at 30,000 feet."
00:38:57,00:38:59,But they still fly fast.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"Again, at the time, not very fast."
00:39:01,00:39:02,It's still scary.
00:39:02,00:39:04,"There's no height of plane flight where I'm like,"
00:39:04,00:39:07,"""It's not actually that high. Don't really mind."""
00:39:07,00:39:08,"Yeah, I'll get on the wing."
00:39:08,00:39:10,It is scary. That's why this was a news story at the time
00:39:10,00:39:12,and why I think it's a relevant anecdote now.
00:39:12,00:39:15,Yeah. Yeah. It was scary and hard for the guy.
00:39:15,00:39:16,That's the point. Yeah.
00:39:16,00:39:21,So there was a study in 2019 about learning from your failures.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"And basically, the conclusion was that failure"
00:39:23,00:39:25,is an essential ingredient to success.
00:39:25,00:39:26,You have to fail to be successful.
00:39:26,00:39:29,But that doesn't alone make you successful.
00:39:29,00:39:30,You have to learn from your mistakes.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"But I just found it so interesting in terms of, like,"
00:39:32,00:39:35,"the cold, hard-eye of academia, the way they worked this out."
00:39:35,00:39:39,It was a huge study and it looked at three different things.
00:39:39,00:39:43,"So it looked at 777,000 grant applications"
00:39:43,00:39:45,submitted to the Institute of Health
00:39:45,00:39:47,to see if they were successful or failures.
00:39:47,00:39:50,It looked at 46 years' worth of startup investments
00:39:50,00:39:52,to see if businesses were successful
00:39:52,00:39:54,or whether they were failures and what was the cause of that.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"And it looked at 170,000 terrorist attacks"
00:39:57,00:40:00,to see if they were failures.
00:40:00,00:40:02,And I think that's a bold thing.
00:40:02,00:40:03,"And I don't know what involved, but it concluded,"
00:40:03,00:40:05,"and it looked, you know, a successful terrorist attack"
00:40:05,00:40:08,"is obviously a failure for most of us,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,but a success for certain people.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"So reassuringly, the test found that for,"
00:40:13,00:40:15,"if you're looking for a grant,"
00:40:15,00:40:17,"if you're trying to get a grant from the Institute of Health,"
00:40:17,00:40:21,the average failure rate is 2.03 failures before you succeed.
00:40:21,00:40:25,"For a startup, 1.5, and terrorists fail almost four times"
00:40:25,00:40:26,before they succeed.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"So, and we've got to cheer one person"
00:40:29,00:40:33,cheering for the anti-terrorist brigade.
00:40:33,00:40:34,"Well, as we all know,"
00:40:34,00:40:38,"Dan thinks her son of the laden is a great guy, so..."
00:40:38,00:40:40,"It's Maria Therese, the Queen of France."
00:40:40,00:40:42,"So she was Spanish, but she was the wife of Louis XIV."
00:40:42,00:40:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:44,00:40:46,She was in labor in 1661.
00:40:46,00:40:48,"And in the old days, if you were royal,"
00:40:48,00:40:51,it was basically open season for your birth.
00:40:51,00:40:52,"Oh, everyone would come and watch?"
00:40:52,00:40:54,Everyone just came and watched.
00:40:54,00:40:55,"So when Maria and Therese gave birth,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,"there were nearly 200 people in her chambers,"
00:40:57,00:40:59,"mostly in an outer room,"
00:40:59,00:41:00,but quite a few in the inner room as well.
00:41:00,00:41:03,"And when Maria Therese, sort of a century earlier,"
00:41:03,00:41:04,"was giving birth,"
00:41:04,00:41:06,lots of princesses and various dukes
00:41:06,00:41:09,started coming in to witness her giving birth.
00:41:09,00:41:10,"And she hated it. She kept shouting,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,"""I don't want to give birth. I want to die."""
00:41:12,00:41:15,And she had to shout that
00:41:15,00:41:17,because there were Spanish actors and musicians
00:41:17,00:41:19,dancing a ballet beneath the windows.
00:41:19,00:41:21,And they had guitars and casinettes
00:41:21,00:41:23,to remind her that she was Spanish.
00:41:23,00:41:26,(LAUGHTER)
00:41:26,00:41:28,There is another study.
00:41:28,00:41:31,"This is an amazing one, where they looked at surgeons"
00:41:31,00:41:33,who were doing coronary bypasses.
00:41:33,00:41:34,Right.
00:41:34,00:41:36,And they looked at ones that were successful
00:41:36,00:41:38,and the ones that were failures.
00:41:38,00:41:39,"And they saw, if you did a failure,"
00:41:39,00:41:42,were you going to be more successful in the future?
00:41:42,00:41:44,So have you learned from your mistakes?
00:41:44,00:41:45,Yeah.
00:41:45,00:41:46,And what they found was that actually that is true.
00:41:46,00:41:48,"So surgeons who made mistakes,"
00:41:48,00:41:51,"they did tend to get much more successful as they went on,"
00:41:51,00:41:53,but only to a certain level.
00:41:53,00:41:56,"And after a certain amount of failing again and again and again,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"you just get really, really shitted it."
00:41:58,00:41:59,Really?
00:41:59,00:42:01,"Because you're just like, ""Oh, I can't do this."""
00:42:01,00:42:02,You just lose all confidence.
00:42:02,00:42:03,"Yeah, right."
00:42:03,00:42:04,You're stuck in a rut.
00:42:04,00:42:06,I have that with getting facts right.
00:42:06,00:42:07,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:07,00:42:09,I've just given up at this point.
00:42:09,00:42:10,Yeah.
00:42:10,00:42:13,So I named my son Ted.
00:42:13,00:42:16,His middle name is Harpo after the Marx brother Harpo.
00:42:16,00:42:18,But Harpo is Oprah Winfrey's company as well.
00:42:18,00:42:19,"I would assume that that would have been trademarked,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,but I had no problems.
00:42:21,00:42:22,"Oh, my God."
00:42:22,00:42:24,Oprah is Harpo backwards.
00:42:24,00:42:25,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yes.
00:42:26,00:42:30,And that's why she named the company that.
00:42:30,00:42:31,"Oh, she knows that."
00:42:31,00:42:32,"Okay, fine."
00:42:32,00:42:34,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:34,00:42:36,"Well, um..."
00:42:36,00:42:38,What a wild ride for you for five seconds.
00:42:38,00:42:39,That was huge.
00:42:39,00:42:40,I've got to move this on.
00:42:40,00:42:41,"Oh, really?"
00:42:41,00:42:42,"Yeah, we need to get out of here."
00:42:42,00:42:43,Can I tell you about Mandels?
00:42:43,00:42:44,What?
00:42:44,00:42:45,"Oh, I don't know."
00:42:45,00:42:46,Mandels.
00:42:46,00:42:47,These are male candles.
00:42:47,00:42:48,Okay.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"'Cause there's a big problem for the candle industry,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,which is that they're only hitting half the population.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"Women tend to buy, like, more than 90% of candles."
00:42:54,00:42:55,Men tend not to buy them.
00:42:55,00:42:56,Okay.
00:42:56,00:42:59,And there have been consistent attempts to get blokes to buy candles.
00:42:59,00:43:03,"So scents published have included aftershave, fine."
00:43:03,00:43:04,Chrome.
00:43:04,00:43:05,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:05,00:43:06,Fine.
00:43:06,00:43:07,The browser.
00:43:07,00:43:08,Smoked leather.
00:43:08,00:43:09,Okay.
00:43:09,00:43:10,Rome.
00:43:10,00:43:11,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:11,00:43:13,Not a Roman candle like a firework.
00:43:13,00:43:14,Just the smells of Rome.
00:43:14,00:43:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:15,00:43:16,And there's one exhaust.
00:43:16,00:43:17,And I just wanted to read you the...
00:43:17,00:43:18,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:18,00:43:19,"Like, here's the blurb."
00:43:19,00:43:20,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:20,00:43:25,Do you find yourself taking a minute in the morning to enjoy the unique scent of exhaust
00:43:25,00:43:26,when you turn your car on?
00:43:26,00:43:27,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:27,00:43:30,We pray that you do not get down on your knees and enjoy the musky smell straight from the
00:43:30,00:43:34,"sauce, but we do pray you buy our candles so you can enjoy the smell with light."
00:43:34,00:43:38,We do pray you buy our candles so you can enjoy the smell with less danger.
00:43:38,00:43:39,Avoid the headache.
00:43:39,00:43:40,Good God.
00:43:40,00:43:41,Yeah.
00:43:41,00:43:42,Wow.
00:43:42,00:43:43,"They've really got men, haven't they?"
00:43:43,00:43:44,Yeah.
00:43:44,00:43:45,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:45,00:43:48,So my parents opened up a salon in Hong Kong.
00:43:48,00:43:51,First customer my mum ever did was Robert Kwok.
00:43:51,00:43:52,And he immediately...
00:43:52,00:43:53,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:53,00:43:55,"He's too rich to keep that in the show, please."
00:43:55,00:43:56,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:56,00:43:57,Okay.
00:43:57,00:43:58,Here's the thing.
00:43:58,00:43:59,Do you think you learn from your failures?
00:43:59,00:44:00,"Yeah, I think so."
00:44:00,00:44:01,No question.
00:44:01,00:44:02,I reckon.
00:44:02,00:44:03,"That's the whole point, isn't it?"
00:44:03,00:44:08,"Well, there's this common idea that, you know, oh, well, actually I just failed my way until"
00:44:08,00:44:09,I succeeded.
00:44:09,00:44:10,"But you learn from your mistakes, right?"
00:44:10,00:44:12,But I think people don't tend to.
00:44:12,00:44:14,Like failing repeatedly is not a good way to succeed.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"You do actually have to think about why you fail, don't you, and then act on it."
00:44:18,00:44:19,Yes.
00:44:19,00:44:20,And people...
00:44:20,00:44:24,"So it's quite hard to do experiments on whether you learn from your failures, but here is one"
00:44:24,00:44:25,experiment.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"Scientists got people to do a practice test, right?"
00:44:27,00:44:32,"They gave them feedback, fake feedback on how they performed, and then they would do a real"
00:44:32,00:44:33,test.
00:44:33,00:44:36,And they were asked how happy it would make them if they did well.
00:44:36,00:44:42,"So the people who got negative feedback immediately said, ""Oh, well, I wouldn't care at all if"
00:44:42,00:44:44,"I did well on the real test."""
00:44:44,00:44:45,They were lying.
00:44:45,00:44:46,"They were protecting themselves, you know."
00:44:46,00:44:49,"And then when they did the second test, they got given fake feedback again."
00:44:49,00:44:51,And so you got full marks.
00:44:51,00:44:52,And they were thrilled.
00:44:52,00:44:54,They were so happy that they'd done well.
00:44:54,00:44:57,So people try and protect their self-image as competent people.
00:44:57,00:45:00,"And when they get proof that they're wrong, it does away with that image."
00:45:00,00:45:05,"I've just realized I read out the wrong fact in relation to the leading, which makes this"
00:45:05,00:45:08,bit of the show something I will not learn from.
00:45:08,00:45:10,But it was all part of the plan.
00:45:10,00:45:11,It's a bit about failure.
00:45:11,00:45:12,You're living it right now.
00:45:12,00:45:13,That's insane.
00:45:13,00:45:15,"You failed literally in the moment, as you were telling us."
00:45:15,00:45:16,Beautiful.
00:45:16,00:45:19,The thing that seems relevant to me about what you were saying.
00:45:19,00:45:20,Yeah.
00:45:20,00:45:22,And I wonder if this is what you meant to say.
00:45:22,00:45:23,Let me know.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"Hang on, Andy's going through something right now."
00:45:27,00:45:30,I feel like we should all pause and just watch it.
00:45:30,00:45:33,"You know, like in an Edinburgh documentary where you don't interfere?"
00:45:33,00:45:34,I feel like...
00:45:34,00:45:36,Is that what you do when someone really fucks up?
00:45:36,00:45:38,You get everyone to pause and watch it?
00:45:38,00:45:39,Yeah.
00:45:39,00:45:44,"And then something in the background goes, ""Here we see the podcaster struggling with his words."""
