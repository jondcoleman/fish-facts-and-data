00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.440
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.400
 Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered around

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.200
 the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.720
 here we go, starting with fact number one and that's Anna. My fact this week is that in India

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 you automatically get a government job if you qualify for the Olympics and if you win a medal

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.080
 you get a promotion. Wow, does the size of the promotion depend on the size of the medal,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.280
 not the size of the medal, the material from which the medal is made?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 Yeah, you don't get sort of giant gold medals do you? It does, yeah, essentially. I think the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 level of promotion depends on how well you do generally and it's not just at the Olympics,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 it's in various other sporting competitions. So this is a system which seems to exist state to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 state, they have various different policies from one state to the next and it seems to also exist

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 at a federal level and the truth is that to train to qualify for the Olympics is basically a full-time

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.160
 job and a lot of people can't afford to take time out of work, like where do you find the money

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.520
 to support that? The athlete's diet can be very expensive and so the way the Indian government

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.920
 and state governments encourage their citizens to get sporty is to give them government jobs,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.200
 which is like monthly salary, you can't be fired, you get medical care, you get a pension,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.520
 but they do actually have to turn up to work. So there's... I have a question. Yeah, go on.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.960
 Are the government jobs you get related to the sport that you do? So if you're a really good

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.680
 high jumper, do they sometimes give you a job like turning on light switches on very big walls?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.920
 Oh, yeah, those really high light switches that are purposely beyond normal humidity.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.280
 I guess the reason they put them there in the first place is because they were installed by

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.880
 high jumpers. Exactly, yeah, it's a vicious circle, it's the whole thing. Is it like that?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 It's not, though, is it? No, it is the answer. It's exactly like that, yeah, it's a very good

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.600
 question. They almost all work for the railways, don't they? Are a lot of them. Yeah, police force

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.120
 as well. The biggest employers are the railway, the police force, the army, but various government

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.640
 departments. So there's an air rifle world record holder called suma shiro and she got a job on

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.120
 the railway, for instance, and she had to turn up to work sort of. No, I don't think every day,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.360
 but quite regularly and just did data entry and literally sitting at a computer doing data entry

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.400
 in order to claim her government salary. Well, did she do it from a computer which was 10 meters

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.720
 away from her because she's so good at air rifle? Well, she was shooting it. Like she has to shoot

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.200
 each key. There was an old game called duck hunts which came out before any of you guys were born,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.560
 which probably would be quite useful for that. Exactly. Yeah, that's how she trained. I think

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.400
 I stretched this beyond the point. But it seems like in some cases that it's the other way round,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.040
 they became athletes and tried to get into competitions just to secure a lifetime government

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.960
 job. Wow. So because you get, as Anna said, the pensions, you get medical, you get lifetime job

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.840
 basically. But surely that would be easier to just get the job than becoming an elite athlete,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.760
 considering how difficult it is to become an, you know, you have to get to the Olympics. That's

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.680
 pretty hard. It must be easier. Some people are very bad at data entry, James, but naturally quite

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.600
 fit. It's amazing how badly India does at the Olympics relative to the population size. So

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.520
 they've won 28 medals total at the Olympics, which is the same as Michael Phelps has won.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.000
 Wow. Now, it's obviously Michael Phelps is very, very good at the Olympics, but India has roughly

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.960
 a billion people. And in 2008, they won one medal per 383 million of their population.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.200
 So that's a low hit rate, basically. That's what people say, isn't it? Like it's not really fair

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.200
 the Olympics because, you know, you might say, well, it's not fair that, you know, some countries

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 in the Eastern Bloc might have used drugs or whatever. But also it's not really fair that

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.000
 the rich countries just get to do way better because we have way better diets, we have better

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.520
 facilities, we have better everything in the Western world. So yeah, it's pretty hard to be

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.120
 just a lowly born Indian person and get into the Olympics. And that's a huge amount of the population

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.320
 are basically excluded because of, for financial reasons, from even ever having this as an option

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.880
 in their life. So it's not really a billion people who are, you know, in the pool to be selected.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.960
 But they do, there's a stat that I read in an article talking about this, where they say that

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.920
 there's more than 100 billionaires in India. That's a lot of billionaires, which mean there

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.240
 must be a lot of millionaires, which must mean there must be a middle class that is good at

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.120
 sport and have the facilities and have the training. That's true. They just don't do it for some reason.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.040
 Well, there's a saying, there's a popular Hindi saying, and this is the translation of it. It's

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.280
 "If you study hard, you will live like a king. But if you play sports, you will ruin your life."

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.840
 So it might be a cultural thing as well.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.800
 I think there's a bit of a disadvantage as well to the people who have grown up wanting to work

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.000
 and get high up in the railway services. You know, imagine you're like, I want to kick ass and be

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.640
 at the height of this job. And then you've suddenly got this Olympian who's won a silver medal,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.680
 getting promoted over you, because that's part of the... Like there's a guy called Sandeep Sejwal,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.080
 who he competed in Breaststroke at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And he's never been to the office

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.520
 because he's always training, but he's got this full-time job. And he says, "If you swim continuously

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 and win a medal at the Nationals, or just represent the Indian Railways at the National

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.200
 level, you can get promoted. So I'm going to file for a promotion. Hopefully I get it,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.680
 and then I'll be the boss." He might be the boss of some guy who's worked his whole life to get

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.360
 up the railway. It's mad. The system's crazy. I think we'll know when the Indian, entire Indian

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.120
 railway infrastructure falls apart. It's because of this Breaststroke professional who's risen to

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.400
 the top and ruined it. But it's good for the state departments, because what they get in return is

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.320
 PR, right? So it's sort of seen as them representing the police, or the army, or the railways when

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.000
 they go and compete. That's what they get in return. Also, the Indian Railway competes in

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.520
 national championships of things. So you might have American colleges competing, or at least

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.680
 on a semi-professional level they play. But the Indian Railway has teams that are in all of these

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.600
 different spots. So it does give them, like Anna says, a lot of good PR. Have you guys heard

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:49.440
 of Abhinav Bindra? No. He's great. He is an air rifle champ. India is actually really good at

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.040
 the air rifle for some reason that countries just have to think that they're really good at.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:00.080
 So when he won, his training was amazing for it. So he ordered 10,000 specially Chinese-made

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.840
 air rifle pellets, right? And he weighed every single one of them on the super sensitive scale,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.240
 and he looked at each one under a magnifying glass. And if there was any irregularity in it,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.480
 it went in the bin. Wow. You see, that's where the admin skills come in, isn't it?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.160
 Right. That's data rendering. He's got a spreadsheet with 10,000 pellets in it.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.920
 He, Abhinav Bindra, is India's only gold medallist, isn't he? He's the only individual to win a gold

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.800
 medal. An individual, right. Yeah. So they won, basically, India's won a very large number of

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.760
 gold medals in hockey. To be fair to them, they did really dominate. 1920 to 1980, they won 11

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.000
 medals in 12 Olympics in hockey, and eight of them were gold. And the highlight was 1948,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.120
 and this really must have felt good, 1948. So immediately after independence for India,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.040
 when the final or the silver gold, you know, showdown over the Olympic works, was against

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.080
 Britain, and they beat Britain 4-0. That must have been fun. Well, they had that golden period

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.520
 where they were winning golds. It was 1928, 1932, 1936. They won the golds, and they had this one

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.680
 amazing guy called Richard Allen, who was the goalkeeper for the team. And in that time,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.240
 in those three Olympics, he only conceded three goals. One of them was in 1932, when they were

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:28.240
 playing in LA, they beat America, they beat the USA 24-1. And the only reason they scored the goal

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.520
 was because Richard Allen was off field, signing autographs for Fads. No. He just sort of went

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.000
 off to site. Yeah, and that's the only time that they got a goal. I would say that's bad goalkeeping.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 That's amazing. At the 1948 one, the hockey team, when they won, would have got their gold medals,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.480
 but no ribbons, because this was the austerity Olympics. So this was held in Britain and was,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.920
 you know, rationing was still happening. Everyone was bit poor. There was that whole war thing that

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.560
 just happened. And so as the austerity Olympics, medals were given without ribbons. I can't believe

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.600
 that they made the saving on the ribbon. I can't believe they looked at the big gold medal and

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:12.320
 ribbon. But you can't just give people a ribbon. So this rule in India, they've changed it slightly

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.400
 this year. So there's more sports that you can do, which will allow you to get your government job.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.480
 So if you are in the tug of war, you can get it now. If you play roll ball, or if you play Malakamb,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.920
 so those are the three main new sports that have come in. Two of them are traditional,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.600
 well, two of them are Indian sports. Roll ball isn't traditional Indian. That was invented quite

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.200
 recently. And that's kind of, it's like basketball on roller skates. And Malakamb is a traditional

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.600
 Indian sport. And there was a Malakamb team who have already got Olympic medals. So Malakamb is

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.920
 a sport where you get a big, huge pole and you have to balance on top of it while doing yoga moves.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:02.000
 Okay. So this is a really awesome sport in India. And in 1936, there was a Malakamba group who went

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.600
 to Germany and they showed off their skills. And Adolf Hitler was so impressed that he gave them

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:15.760
 all Olympic medals. Wow. I read a tiny bit about Malakamb. Is it true that the pole in Malakamb

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.560
 represents the phallus of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god? And did Hitler know that when he

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.600
 gave out these medals? I think probably. Yeah. I do know you have to lubricate it before you get on

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:36.400
 it. So you don't get any wood burns. Wow. That's fair. But a lubricated pole would not be a very

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.440
 stable slip, wouldn't you? That's the sport, Dan. Yeah. Right. There's a different levels of

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.200
 lubrications, I suppose. You can have like just covered in butter or you can have it just slightly

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.520
 smooth so you don't like get any splinters. And I think it's closer to the second one.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.440
 Is it? Are they doing the yoga moves on top of the pole? Yeah, they're kind of balancing. So I

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.240
 imagine a yoga move where you're on one foot and then your other foot is kind of wrapped around your

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.240
 head or something. Well, you're doing that, but your foot on the ground isn't on the ground. It's

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.640
 on top of a massive pole. And is there, on the top of the pole, is there a little platform you

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.680
 can squeeze your foot on? Or is it just the end of a pole? It's the end of a pole. But it's kind of...

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.800
 That's very difficult. Well, that's the least sport for you.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:28.560
 Again, I think probably easier to just do the exam to get into the government job.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.760
 I'll stick to data entry. It feels like it's a time with the pole vault that they should be able

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.760
 to do. As in you start doing the pole vault, but of the way on when you get right to the top, you

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.680
 just stay there. Oh, you're downward dogged. Yeah. That occasionally does happen with pole vault,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.480
 where they kind of get to the top and they run out of momentum. And they almost... It looks like

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.240
 they're just going to stay there. And then what happens is the weight of the person kind of bends

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.320
 the pole down and they get sprung off like a cartoon. That does happen on occasions.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.600
 They never get stuck at the top. That's funny. Eventually, the Olympics just goes home.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.760
 Okay, it's time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the photo of

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.400
 the Wright Brothers first flight was taken by a man who had never used a camera before.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.800
 So we're lucky it's not just a picture of someone's feet.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.400
 Lucky he didn't have it on selfie mode or something.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.960
 It's his first ever photo.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.680
 His first ever photo? I read that he'd never seen a camera before.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.920
 Yeah, exactly. Like every... Imagine the day for that guy, he's seeing a camera,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.200
 he's seeing a photo, a plane's flying. This is a big day. This is magic. Yeah. So this is a guy

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.320
 called John T. Daniels. And he was working at the life-saving station at Kill Devil's Hill,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.720
 which is where the first flight took place on December 17th, 1903. And he was positioned with

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.200
 the camera by the Wright Brothers, who were obsessed with cameras. They told him everything

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.240
 he needed to do. And there's really a lot of risk when you think about it as well, because

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.000
 they needed to position the camera at a place where they believed the plane was going to take

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.760
 off, having never took off before on a plane. They needed to tell him the exact moment for him to

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.240
 press this button that would allow them to capture the perfect shot. And they were giving it to a

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.200
 man who, as we said, not only had not seen a camera before, but was about to witness flight,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.400
 man-powered flight. And so there was a genuine moment where he almost forgot to press it,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.720
 because he was so in awe of the historical thing that he was seeing. And at the last second kind

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:46.000
 of shook himself and took the photo. And by some insane magic, we have the perfect shot. It

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.880
 developed perfectly. It caught it perfectly in flight. And it's an amazing photo.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.680
 It's a cool thing to reflect. Actually, when you look at that picture, which I guess people have

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.400
 probably seen before, to think how unlikely that was. So that was actually going to work. I mean,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.000
 how did they pick the exact spot? Because you can't swivel it around, can you?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.480
 Exactly. I don't think they had a turn. Even if they did, the guy wouldn't have known what to do.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:15.840
 And from the account of it, he was also that day involved in the first-ever plane crash.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.120
 Because after they landed it, after their flight, it blew away. Because it was a

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.720
 really light. It was basically a glider with a little bit of an engine. And he got tangled up in

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.200
 it. He tried to grab it as it blew away, just tried to stop it from blowing away. And he got

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.720
 sort of caught up in it and had to be helped out. And he was injured.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.960
 Yeah. When he flipped over, he was holding onto a strut. And all the others let go, but he desperately

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.000
 didn't want this thing to break. And so he flipped over with it. And he was a bit mangled, but he was

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.200
 fine. But they let him keep the strut that he was holding onto, which he kept forever for the rest

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.680
 of his life. And he would carry it round with him. And every time he told this story, this amazing

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.160
 story of being the first person to be in a plane crash, he would take out a pen knife.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.840
 And as he was telling it, he would shave off a little bit of the strut and he would give it to

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.080
 the person he was telling the story to. Yeah. You've got to limit the number of times you

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.240
 tell that story. Towards the end of your life. I'm really sorry. I can't tell it today. I've

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.400
 just got a bit of sawdust left, to be honest. Oh, just find another piece of wood.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.640
 Exactly. It must be like the crucifixion, you know, the true cross.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.320
 Yeah, relics. There's a billion Wright brothers planes worth of strut shavings out there now.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.760
 But you say so, he thought he was witnessing this incredible historic moment,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.680
 which he did. And I think there were sort of four or five people there who did think that.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.160
 But I hadn't quite realized that the rest of the world, A thought it was nothing,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.760
 what happened, and B didn't believe it. So they were completely ignored by the press for five years

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.920
 after 1903, that first flight. Newspapers and journalists just didn't believe them. They told

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.320
 newspapers on the day that this is what they were trying to do. And they basically thought these

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.080
 guys were crazy crackpots. It's such a slam to say not only did nothing happen, we don't even

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:06.160
 believe that nothing happened. I know. I know. Quite nicely, the only paper that did report on them

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.240
 in that on that first day was a paper called the Virginia pilot by chance. But the way they got the

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.600
 story was the Wright brothers once they'd achieved flight, they telegraphed their families to be like,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.720
 "Hey, mum, hey dad, we've flown." And so the telegraph operator said, "Oh, couldn't help but

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.400
 notice that message you just let me give you a mum and dad. Do you mind if I tell the press?"

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.560
 And they said, "No, don't want you to tell the press because they wanted the press in Ohio where

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.520
 they were from to get the story first." And the telegraph operator ignored that, told the Virginia

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.480
 pilot, but Virginia pilot knew nothing about it. So they completely made up what had happened.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.000
 And so they had them flying for sort of three miles. You know, I think we've said before,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.240
 they only flew for about 100 feet, 120 feet. They were like, they flew for three miles. They

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.000
 were 60 foot in the air when actually they were 12 foot above the ground or something.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.440
 They said Wilbur was flying the plane when it was Orville. And so the first account of the

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.600
 Wright brothers flight was total fiction from the Virginia pilot. I thought it was in a B magazine

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.760
 that they were first reported in. It was Gleanings and B culture. So that I think those are the

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.920
 later, because they kept flying. I don't know if you guys know that, but they actually did more

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.920
 flights after their first ones. I'd say quit while you're ahead.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:24.480
 But they were doing these flights. Oh, where exactly was it? I can't remember if it was

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.240
 still a killed one. In Dayton, though. In Dayton. Okay, yeah. And this was in 1904 and 1905 when

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.320
 they were making flights up to 40 minutes long and nobody paid any attention. It was amazing.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:41.680
 I mean, it doesn't. But this guy, Amos Ives Root, he had kind of heard about it and he saw them flying

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.000
 because they were out in the sticks. They weren't near a major population centre.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.120
 And he wrote to Scientific American and Scientific American didn't reply.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.400
 So he wrote it in Gleanings and B culture along articles, which are things like

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.640
 beekeeping in the Southwest and midwinter flights of cellar bees. And it's just mixed in with that.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.680
 Do you think they got complaint letters from bee fans saying, I couldn't really see what

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.440
 relevance your article about the first ever powered flight had? Amos Ives Root was so cool.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.200
 So he owned the first ever bicycle in Ohio. That makes him cool.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:22.720
 Definitely. Yeah, he was friends with them, wasn't he? And he had, I think he just had his own kind

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.400
 of comment page in Gleanings and B culture where he was allowed to write about whatever he wanted,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.240
 even if it wasn't about bees. That's so cool. The first lot, what was the hill called, Dan?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.760
 It was called Kill Devil Hill. So Kill Devil Hill. And that was in Kitty Hawk, wasn't it?

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:45.040
 That's where they did it. And the reason that they went there is Wilbur. Well, when you're flying,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.000
 you need like some wind coming straight towards you. It helps you to take off right.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.120
 And he wanted to find out where the best place in the US to go for that was. So he wrote to the

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.880
 US Weather Bureau who sent him data on the wind velocity in more than 100 places around America.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.200
 And he settled on this place where he knew there was a hill. He knew that they had really good,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.480
 steady wind always coming in their favor. And then he went to Kitty Hawk because it was just

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.200
 like a bit of nothing kind of marsh, not marsh ground, but kind of wilderness ground. There

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.120
 was nothing there. There was like 50 households. They were all descended from sailors who'd been

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.600
 shipwrecked there over the years. So they were all like it was like a sailing community.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.080
 And the richest person that lived in that town was a guy called Doc Cogswell. And he was the

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:40.240
 richest because his brother owed him $15,000. That's the worst kind of wealth. I'm broke,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.280
 but I'm owed it. It sounds miserable when their conditions, when they were living there, because

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.480
 they had to dig for water. They had to catch their own fish. One of them said that there

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.240
 were so many mosquitoes, they almost darkened the sun. I know, it just sounds like really

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.600
 unpleasant living conditions, but they went out there for weeks and weeks on end.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.640
 Yeah, only it's got such an ominous name. If I were trying to fly for the first time ever,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.800
 I would ask not to fly on a place called Kill Devil. I don't want either of those words

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.320
 in the place I'm attempting to fly.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:18.480
 And it was a thing that people not only didn't believe it, but they didn't think it was possible

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.520
 that we could fly. And there's a few, you got some famous quotes from that period before they

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.760
 went up of people saying this will never happen. There was one bishop who was asked if he thought

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.320
 that flying would ever happen. And he said, what a nonsensical idea, flight is reserved for the

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.680
 birds and the angels. And that bishop was called Bishop Wright. And that was the father of the

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:48.800
 brothers. Yeah, he absolutely thought there was no way. And once they did it, and after the years

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.520
 of them doing it, he actually loved it. He used to go up with the brothers separately. He had a

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.000
 rule they couldn't fly together. He didn't want to lose them both in a crash, but he would fly

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.400
 with one of them and he'd go higher, higher, get me higher. I think he went up just once, didn't

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.160
 he? It was the one day he allowed the brothers to fly together in 1910. It was that day when he

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.720
 did that. They didn't all go up in the same plane though, because that would have been really

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:22.320
 all eggs in one basket. You just got mum left. Not the bishop. But it wouldn't have been just mum

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.920
 left because there were two other Wright brothers. And the Wright sister. Yes, they had more weird

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.920
 names. The other brothers were called Ruchlin, Reuchlin and Lauren. And they just worked as

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.000
 bookkeepers and they appear to have had no interest in flight. Whereas the Wright sister

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.120
 is the reason that we kind of accept the Wright brothers as the first flyers today because

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.480
 the Smithsonian, they thought that the first person to fly was a guy called Samuel Langley,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.960
 which he did in 1903, nine days before the Wright brothers. But what he actually did was fly his

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.720
 plane for about maybe about half a meter before it smashed straight into a lake or something.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.640
 But they said they didn't believe the Wright brothers at all. And so they decided that this

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.360
 guy Langley was the first person. But then for years and years, Catherine Wright, who was the

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.680
 sister, it was her life's job to try and make sure that people believed that the Wright brothers

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.880
 were the first people to do it. And she was super famous in her day. Wasn't she Catherine Wright?

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.640
 Yeah, it was pretty much the three of them who were equally famous, it seemed, because the Wright

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.400
 brothers were bad with the press. I think they were not good media personalities. They were very

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.920
 shy, whereas Catherine Wright was very gregarious. And so she was like the front facing Wright.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.160
 And so she met the King of Spain and the Prince of Prussia and spoke with them at events.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.520
 She got the French lesion donner, which they gave the Wright brothers and Catherine at the

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.760
 same time, the highest order of merit you can get in France. And yeah, she was great.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.960
 And she was the first woman ever to attend the Aero Club de France, because basically when they

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.960
 went to France, which was when they became massive really, because in America, they were kind of

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.640
 ignored, especially they tried to sell the plane to the military and the military just

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.040
 weren't having it. So they said, fuck, it will go to France instead. But the French, they love kind

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.920
 of aerospace. They loved the balloons. They loved their new gliders, things like that. And so when

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.880
 they saw the Wright brothers, they absolutely loved it. And Catherine was the main face for that.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.720
 Very cool. She had kind of a sad end. So they were incredibly close. And they seemed to have had a

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.640
 pact, Wilbur, Orville and Catherine, that none of them would ever marry. I think we think that's

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.720
 what happened. And they made this pact very, very early on. And she stuck to it. She was incredibly

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.600
 close to Orville. So Wilbur died in 1912, I think, but Orville, a long time, very close to him. But

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.760
 eventually, 1926, age 51, she decided she wanted to marry her childhood sweetheart. And Orville

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.960
 completely stopped speaking to her. That is mean. That is harsh. Very harsh. Childhood sweetheart.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.400
 If you've waited about 45 years to marry someone. It is harsh because they seem to have had that

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.480
 pact where none of them will marry. But for Orville and Wilbur, it seemed to be quite an easy thing

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.440
 to keep. Because they were particularly good with the press, but they just weren't good in social

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.920
 situations at all. Were they? Whereas like Catherine, she was just everywhere. She was...

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:16.160
 So were the two brothers just not sort of romantic people at all? And they've got this mega babe

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.680
 sister. But they keep saying, no, no, no, we made a pact when we were all nine. Nobody will ever

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.280
 get married. The brothers, they lived together, worked together, ate together. And they even

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.640
 shared a joint bank account, Orville and Wilbur. Really? So yeah, it was kind of easy. And then

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.440
 Catherine went on to become a suffragist, didn't she? And also the vicar went on the march with her.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.640
 Not the vicar. What was he called? The bishop. The bishop. Yeah, the bishop, sorry. And the bishop

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:48.160
 went on the march with her. So he kind of... And that was when he was in his 80s. So he was kind

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.960
 of like joining in with all of the kids stuff when he got a bit older. That's really fun.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.120
 He really embraces kids hobbies. What an amazing 80s he must have had just being a bishop your whole

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.160
 life. And then you get to go on a plane, you get to go on a march. That's really cool. That thing

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.840
 about how they only became successful when they got to Paris. So in Paris, Wilbur was the one who

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.240
 went to Paris and Orville stayed in the USA. And Wilbur was a bit more of a showman. He was

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.600
 better with the press than Orville really was quite reclusive and shy. Wilbur was put up in the

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.640
 Hotel Maurice. Have you heard of this place? No. Oh my God, it's amazing. I got in a complete

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.400
 distraction about this amazing hotel he was put up in. So it's very, very classy. He still exists

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:36.160
 today. The lift was a copy of Mary Antoinette's sedan chair. That's how sort of lush this hotel was.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.720
 Everyone has stayed there. Awesome Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Picasso's wedding meal was there.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:46.240
 Salvador Dali stayed for one month every year. And he once ordered a flock of sheep to be delivered

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:54.320
 to his room so he could fire his pistol at them. Blanks, it was blanks. Even so, if I were at the

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.200
 hotel reception and someone asked for that and told me why they wanted it, I think I wouldn't do it.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.120
 I'd at least call my manager and say I'm not comfortable doing this. He might have asked,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.960
 he might have given you the other task, which was he asked staff to go to the Toulierie Garden and

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:16.000
 catch flies for him for five francs per fly. When I used to work in a hotel, they used to say to you

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.120
 you have to say yes to everything, basically. Unless it's illegal or immoral or whatever,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.800
 if they ask you for something, you always immediately have to say, yes, I can do that,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.480
 but it might cost a lot of money. You know, you have to agree to everything.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.280
 Wow. And just hope Dali doesn't check in.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.320
 Oh, you see the handlebar mustache coming around the corner. Oh, here we go, okay.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.960
 Just quick, hide the clocks.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.280
 There's one other thing about this hotel, which is that it's where the decision was made not to

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:52.000
 blow up Paris. So in the war, Hitler really kind of went off the deep end towards the end, I would

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.920
 say. And he, as the retreat was being sounded, he ordered lots of key bits of Paris, you know,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.840
 the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the bridges over the Seine. He ordered them to be wired up with explosives,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:10.320
 which they were. And General von Choltitz or Koltitz was in the hotel. And it's there that

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.480
 he made the decision. He was either persuaded, we think there are various different versions of

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.440
 events, or he was trying to save his own skin. And that's the hotel where he said, actually,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.600
 maybe there's a lot. Let's not blow up the most beautiful city in Europe. Let's just leave.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.200
 That is interesting. But there is one other thing about the Hotel Maurice that you might be

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.640
 interested in, Andy, because we have mentioned it before quite recently. And that is because they

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:43.440
 had 148 pneumatic clocks in the hotel, one in each room that were attached to that air system in Paris.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.280
 Of course. Oh, I'd forgotten that. That's so cool. Of course they did.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.360
 I really hope that when Darlie did room service, he would save the crazy request

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.200
 right to the edge so that the person would think they were getting away with it.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.000
 What can I get you, Mr. Darlie? It's just eggs Benedict this morning.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.920
 An orange juice, please. And is that it? One more thing. 7000 sheep.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.080
 And a gun.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:20.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that on the French island of Ile-de-Raye, the donkeys wear trousers.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.920
 Sounds like the start of a kid's book, doesn't it?

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.200
 Do they wear V trousers? What do you mean? Like, do they wear the trousers?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:42.080
 Oh, I see. As in are they in charge? Well, I would say with a donkey, basically the donkey always

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.760
 wears the trousers, don't they? They don't do what you tell them to. Very wise. Not really.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:54.480
 These are originally working donkeys on this island. They used to work in the salt marshes,

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.840
 and in the salt marshes, there are lots of mosquitoes, maybe not enough to block out the sun,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.600
 but there's definitely a lot of them. And so to stop their legs from getting bitten,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.920
 these particular donkeys, their owners would put little kind of trousers on, and they look a bit

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:14.240
 like, you know, really old fashioned pajama bottoms, which they would tie around the bottom part of

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.880
 their legs, and their butt is still exposed. So it's like pajama bottoms with a flap allowing

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.760
 your buttocks to kind of hang out. And so these days, they still wear the trousers, even though

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.440
 they don't work in the salt marshes, but they just give rides to children around the local park,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.520
 which no matter what you think about donkeys giving children rides, whether that's fair play or not,

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.520
 definitely better than working in the salt marshes. Donkeys around the world, they do seem to have a

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.480
 very two track career path. Either it's horrible backbreaking work, and they get really mistreated

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.880
 all over the world, or it's working at the seaside, taking the children out for a bit.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:57.600
 They are quite, these ones are amazingly big, aren't they? Before you start feeling too sorry

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.280
 for them having children on their back, I didn't realise a donkey could even qualify as a donkey

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:08.320
 at this size. So the Baudet de Poitou is what they're called, I think. There can be 16 hands,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.600
 which is, that's like a big horse. That's a horse that you feel really high up when you're sitting

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.200
 on it. 16 hands is a big horse. I think I might have met some of these donkeys. Because they have

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.840
 them in the New Forest. Do they? Yeah, they do. They have a few of them in the New Forest. Was it

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.320
 really fluffy? Like they're quite fluffy. They've got long shaggy hair, like a shaggy. It was very

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.360
 shaggy. We met one right up close, although it wasn't 16 hands high, so maybe it was a younger one.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.680
 And presumably without the trousers on. It had no trousers on. Not by the time.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:47.600
 No, don't go there. That's really cool, because they're very rare. You've seen an endangered

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.240
 species there. I may have just seen a normal donkey. I already regret. You may have seen a sheep.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.600
 It's possible. But they're less rare than they used to be, aren't they?

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:05.120
 Yeah. They went really, really rare in the 70s and 80s, so much so that there were only a dozen

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.760
 or so of them left that could reproduce. But now, thanks to some kind of bits of conservation,

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.560
 there's a lot more of them in France, and they're starting to send them to other places like the

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:22.000
 New Forest, I assume. New Forest, yeah. I think there's about a thousand, isn't there? Maybe just

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.240
 under a thousand in the world. And you should look them up. They do look bizarre. They look a bit like,

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.800
 you know, if you have an old English sheepdog, the really shaggy dogs, but they've got quite

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.440
 a responsible owner who doesn't look after their coat, and it really dreadlocks. It's like that,

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.680
 isn't it? They've got long dreadlocks. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What would you replace a donkey with on a

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.880
 beach if you had to? I reckon like maybe seven ducks, and they have like a little carriage

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.960
 underneath them that the child can sit in and then fly around. You know, I'm thinking Wright

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:59.120
 brother's the kind of flight as a feature. I mean, that is nice. I'd go to that beach. That was

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.920
 dangerous. Health and safety is never going to pass. Sorry, Grant. In 2016, Tall Bay Council

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.880
 replaced their donkeys with three small trampolines, and there was outrage. Because it wasn't as much

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.640
 fun. They said this is just not as good for children. All for the donkeys. The donkey keepers were

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.600
 furious. Do the kids have to haul the trampolines along the beach then? And if you want a ride

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:22.160
 along the beach, the trampoline's not going to cut it. Yeah, you could jump from one to the other,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.600
 but I think there are only three small trampolines. It's quite a short ride.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.520
 It's a quick ride, yeah. It's not getting far. In Iceland, when I went to Iceland,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.200
 every small town has like a massive trampoline in the middle of it. It's so weird. Yeah. It's

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.240
 like, you know how in most, in like towns, you might have a park that kids play on with swings

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.920
 and slides and stuff. In Iceland, they just had these massive kind of plastic kind of

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.640
 tarpaulin things that appeared to be filled with air. I don't know what they were filled with,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.160
 because I never jumped on them much to my shame. But they were like, yeah,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.600
 just everywhere you went, it seemed like kids could play on these bouncy things like bouncy

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.320
 castles. So a bouncy castle, right? James, is it true? I think I've read that they were initially

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.400
 for defense as in you'd have to have someone guarding constantly jumping up and down,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:13.440
 landing out for an invading army. Yeah. I was, you know what? At the start of that sentence,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:20.000
 I genuinely thought that you were about to say something real. I saw you going along with it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:28.640
 So donkeys, eh? Donkeys. Donkeys are cool. The word donkey used to rhyme with monkey.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:35.120
 Monkey. Donkey. It used to be donkey. Yeah. Nice. And it didn't really exist until the start of the

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.960
 17th century. You would always say ass or ass instead of donkey. So in Shakespeare, there won't

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.440
 be any donkeys. There'll all be asses. And in the King James Bible. Was it because that was,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.520
 it was also rude and an insult that they kind of borderized it? There is one thought that that's

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:56.560
 it. The word probably comes from done meaning brown or gray. But I think that's why that the word

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.040
 donkey became more commonly known is because of the association with bums. Like rooster,

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.120
 because in America, they didn't want to say cock. So they said rooster instead or man chicken.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:15.280
 Man chicken sounds more rude, I think. Yeah. So the donkeys, donkeys in the UK,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.640
 they are big on the beaches, obviously. There are still lots of donkey rides.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:26.080
 So you know the donkey sanctuary, that's the one of the major donkey charities in the UK.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:33.440
 And they have, I'm going to say secret agents who travel around the UK checking up on donkey abuse

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.280
 and making sure that they're not being badly treated or that their backs aren't being strained

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.160
 at the beach. And they can turn up and they can, I think they have the power of,

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.560
 they don't have the power of arrest, but they don't have the powers to take your donkeys away.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.040
 So is that if you're doing donkey rides on the beach and someone who looks suspiciously

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.840
 like an adult but is dressing up as a child and claiming they want a donkey ride turns up,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.720
 but has sort of a notepad they're trying to hide, that's probably your guy. So they go undercover.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.160
 They're like, I think they do go undercover because if they phone ahead and say,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.960
 I'm bringing from the donkey police, then you'll just get out the nice donkey. Whereas if you,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.120
 if they turn up incognito, they see you've got your ratty old donkey and you're beating it,

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.520
 then they'll intervene. Yeah. Wow. Good. Doing great work. It might be quite fun to be a donkey

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.920
 in the US. If you're specifically, if you're pack borough racing in Colorado, which is a

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:31.200
 sort of ancient historic Colorado sport and it's, it's in honor of miners who used to go gold mining

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.880
 with donkeys. And the rule with pack borough racing is that a donkey can't carry a person,

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:42.720
 but a person can carry a donkey needs be in it. And you basically have to run along with your

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.720
 donkey. Right. Okay. Is it one man, one donkey in the one man on donkey. Okay. How often does

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.320
 anyone actually carry the donkey though? Cause they're pretty heavy. They're heavy. I did,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.720
 I was reading one person's account of his pack borough race where he should have carried the

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.280
 donkey and didn't. So I think they must be too heavy. This is a guy called Curtis Emory,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.640
 who's a veteran borough racer. And he was near, really near the end of a 15 mile race. And suddenly

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.920
 his donkey called Jackson had to cross a wooden bridge. And as donkeys I want to do, he'd cross

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.120
 the bridge countless times before suddenly stopped, like not doing that. Stubborn. And he,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.560
 and right at the end of the race, and he had to tie Jackson to the bridge, walk into town and return

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.920
 with a winch equipped Jeep to pull the donkey over the bridge at which point. I don't think he'd

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.960
 won the race anymore. That's amazing. But yeah, they do, they do freeze donkeys. That's the weird

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.440
 thing about them. I hadn't probably realized that's what they're doing. Like horses, if you scare them,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:46.400
 bolt, a donkey goes stock still, turns to stone. Yeah. Right. Well, this is why people think that

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:53.520
 they are stubborn. And this is some, some study done by the donkey sanctuary in the UK, which is

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.560
 about people's perception of the donkey, which incidentally found their Britain's second favourite

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:07.440
 farm animal. Pretty good. Can we guess the favourite? After cow. Got to be sheep. No one's, no one's said

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:14.480
 the right answer yet. Chicken. Man chicken. No, Anna's got it right. It's a horse. It's a horse.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.480
 Everyone loves a horse. Anyway, sorry, that's completely irrelevant. Cow doesn't come into the

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:27.360
 top two. Yeah. Everyone likes cows. Oh my god. Donkey is number two. Yeah. Because I think if you

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:32.960
 are a kid and you have like a set of all your farmyard animals, very rare is there a donkey in

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.360
 there, is it? Or it's certainly cows and sheep coming first. Are you guys suggesting that this

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:44.400
 study conducted on behalf of the donkey sanctuary is in any way improperly done? No. But basically,

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:51.280
 you know what? I just want to carry on talking about this. What they've done is they thought,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.760
 right, we need to make it seem like it's the best animal, but no one's going to believe us

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.760
 if we say that the donkey is the most popular farmyard animal. So we're going to have to

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.880
 put it in second place. That's what they thought, isn't it? It's like when, you know, Kim Jong-un

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.960
 gets 97.9% in the election. It's like, no one will believe 100%. So I have to go down a bit.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.080
 Yeah. But 55% of people do think they're stubborn. And the donkey sanctuary explained that they're

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.640
 not stubborn. They're just freezing. One in three people think they're affectionate,

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:28.320
 and only 18% of people think they are charismatic. Yet they've ranked number two. This doesn't add

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:41.440
 up. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is that in the late 1960s,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:49.040
 the CIA considered assassinating people using lightning. Wow. Is that you bringing back your

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.680
 old nickname and admitting that you were part of the CIA? I'm very glad that you've mentioned

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.960
 my old nickname being lightning because I'm determined that it's going to make a comeback.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:04.320
 So this is something, there's a great article on Forbes about this, a journalist called David

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:11.920
 Hambling, I found it, and it was a proposal in 1967 that was made seriously, but it wasn't carried out.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.160
 But the idea was developed. They thought, well, lightning, lightning is pretty powerful, isn't

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.240
 it? And if there was a way of directing lightning, then you could get it. They used a real euphemism.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.360
 They said it would produce effects favourable to our purposes. I don't think you don't have to

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.920
 read too much between the lines to realise that that's killing people with lightning, basically.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.640
 And yeah, the plan was basically to get a very, very thin wire, which would be only a

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.800
 fraction of a millimetre wide, but several miles long to effectively drop this from an aircraft or

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.960
 to use a kind of parachute to keep it up there for a long time. And then if there was a storm

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.760
 happening above the person you wanted to assassinate, it didn't rely on that. That was the floor in the

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.880
 plan. The person had to be in a lightning storm. But it wasn't also a flaw. They had to somehow get

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.040
 this wire next to them. So like you've run over to someone and say, just hold this wire, will you?

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:13.360
 Exactly. So it was those were the disadvantages. There were advantages, obviously, like cheap,

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.680
 because you're not being getting an electricity bill for this. And also it would leave no evidence.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.560
 Yeah, but you can always have incredible advantages to something impossible.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.400
 That's true. I think we should go ahead with the impossible thing, because the advantages are

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.880
 just so good. Yeah, that was, I mean, the disadvantages were big as well. Yeah.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.200
 I think there's contextual evidence. I think that if Fidel Castro had suddenly been struck by

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.320
 lightning around that period, it would have been very suspicious. Well, if all the CIA's enemies

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.920
 suddenly got hit by lightning, I think you can do it twice. I had a good luck to see if all that

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.760
 there's a list of Wikipedia people who were killed by lightning to see if any of them

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.880
 were possibly enemies of America at this time. I couldn't find any, I'm afraid.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.560
 Few sports, few sports people. One person from the American War who was the guy who invented the

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:11.840
 phrase, no taxation without, what's that one? No taxation, yeah. It was, he was killed by lightning.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.560
 You're not a true believer in democracy, really, are you? What's the thing that we need for them to

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:23.680
 tax us? I don't really give a shit. Yeah, so not unfortunately, yeah. That's a shame.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.000
 Was that, so those were the most notable people on the list? There wasn't really anyone,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.280
 there was a few people from the, you know, from ancient times who were killed by lightning. Not

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.840
 that many famous people are killed by lightning, it turns out. It feels like if the CIA had time

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.080
 travel and this thing, they probably still wouldn't use it. Just think of the advantages of time

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.560
 travel though. Like, I know it's impossible, but just think of all the advantages.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:54.640
 Let's just do it. Wow, we're doing it. I can see, you know, anti-universal suffrage,

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.680
 campaigner, politician, not liking the no taxation without representation. I think there's the

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.640
 kernel of a conspiracy theory there that he was assassinated. Yeah, I was aiming for a conspiracy

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:10.480
 theory and I was aiming a bit higher than this, to be honest. I was hoping that an actual, you know,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.800
 dictator from the Soviet times had died. Yeah, shame. They came up with some pretty wacky plans,

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.680
 didn't they? Yeah. There was sort of a massive dump on all of us, which you might remember

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:31.680
 in 2017. That's a strange weapon, isn't it? Yeah, a shit bomb. They just came onto me in

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.280
 the street and said, "Hold this wire." And then before I knew it, I was covered in shit.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.720
 In 2017, the CIA sort of dumped 13 million pages of documents on us by putting them online,

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:45.600
 and that was 800,000 declassified files, which useful journalists went combed through

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.440
 and found the insane plans they had. Like, I think it came out that they interviewed Yuri Geller.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.680
 That's one of my favourites in the 1970s. They took an interest in spoonbender Yuri Geller,

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.600
 and according to him when he was asked about it, he said they were afraid that there were people

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.720
 like him in Russia who, I guess, would pose a threat by bending cutlery in the Soviet Union

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.440
 somehow. And the way they tested Geller to test his skills was they shut him in a room,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.560
 and then the CIA taped to the wall outside his room a picture of something. And the way they

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.480
 chose the picture was they opened a dictionary, they got a word, so they chose the word, for

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.440
 instance, "bunch." And then they drew what first came to their mind, a bunch, and then they asked

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.160
 Yuri on the other side of the wall to draw what he sensed the picture was. Was that a bunch of grapes?

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.320
 Well, exactly. He drew 24 purple grapes. To be fair, there were 24,

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.280
 so that's kind of impressive. But basically, the CIA's conclusion was he has demonstrated

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.400
 his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner, which I would say he

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.440
 hadn't. You hear about it, you think grapes. But they didn't, did they tell him the word "bunch"?

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.360
 Yeah, they said "bunch." Oh my goodness. They said, "We've picked the word 'bunch' out of the

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.520
 dictionary. Draw the first thing that comes to mind." But he did draw 24 grapes, and they

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:07.280
 had 24 grapes in their picture. Yeah, but I have to specify, they did this on him dozens of times,

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.120
 and he only got a few of them right, and that was one of them. I would have drawn some flowers.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.600
 Yeah. A bunch of flowers. You know what? I deliberately went with grapes thinking it was

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.320
 the wrong answer as well, because I was thinking it would be flowers. James, you are the new Yuri

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:25.200
 Geller. What's more impressive is if you say that you've picked the word "Jiraffe" and it's

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.440
 actually a dump truck, and he draws a dump truck, that's, you know... Yeah, that's true.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.400
 That's when you know you've got someone dangerous on your hand.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.200
 The most impressive thing that Yuri Geller did, and the most controversial, actually, was in Euro

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:43.680
 '96. He was flying over Wembley Stadium in a helicopter, I think, and Gary McAllister was

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.640
 taking a penalty for Scotland, which would have put them level with England in the game.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.640
 And if you watch the video back, the ball moves about one inch just before he kicks the ball,

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.000
 and he misses the penalty, and then Gaza goes up the other end and scores,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.920
 and Yuri Geller claims that he made that ball move. No. But he doesn't claim it was the downdraft

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.400
 of the helicopter. He says it was his magic powers. But I thought you were going to say

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.280
 he dropped a bent spoon on his head, which is slightly concussive. Weirdly, I read a thing

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.600
 just this morning about Yuri Geller, which is that in 1974, he was a paternity suit, was filed

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.800
 against him by a young mum in Sweden. She didn't claim that he was the dad. What she claimed was,

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:30.080
 is that his magical bending powers had altered her contraception coil, and it became inoperable,

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.640
 and she got pregnant as a result. And as a result, he should pay for that, because he's the sort of

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.720
 pseudo father. Wow, that's a really difficult position to put him in, because on the one hand,

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.240
 he really wants to admit to having those powers. Well, it was the same with the football thing,

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.920
 because he wants to claim that he moved this football, but actually he had 11,000 hate letters

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:55.440
 from Scottish people after the game, saying, how could you scupper our chances in the European

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:02.240
 Championships? Wow. Hey, I read a really cool invention by the CIA, which was used. It's called

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:10.320
 the Skyhook. And the Skyhook was basically a way of extracting CIA operatives or anyone that was in

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.920
 need of help, who was involved in the military in some way, from a location without having to get

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:21.040
 on the ground to pick them up. So what it was, is that they would drop a package over to where they

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.320
 believed the operative was, and the opera, the package had a little description on it. And in

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.240
 it, they had a helium balloon that would lift the cable 500 foot into the air. And then the operative

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.480
 would strap themselves to a harness that was connected to the other end of that cable that

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:42.800
 went up with the balloon. And they would sit and wait until a very slow flying plane would fly to

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:49.280
 where the helium balloon was. And it would hook its nose of the plane around the hook that had been

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:55.280
 sent up. And it would carry the guy off into the air and back to safety. That is so cool. I mean,

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.680
 if you timed it right, you could say, just so you know, all this time, I've been working

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.640
 for the CIA and then bang, if you get that even slightly wrong, then you're just immediately

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:12.880
 arrested. Yeah. Or if a lightning storm comes over and it attaches itself to the 500 foot wire.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.440
 He told us he was working for the CIA and then he just exploded. It's really weird.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.960
 Yeah, I can see why they didn't go with that. All sorts of any of their mad plans.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.040
 I wish someone one day had turned around at the CIA in sort of 1950,

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.680
 just early on and said, you know, these crazy ideas we keep having that never come to fruition.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.400
 You know, the ones that always work, they're the ones where we just shoot someone in the head.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.640
 Do that from now on.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:43.120
 There was a guy called Edward Geary Lansdale and he was with the CIA and he was requested

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.120
 by the president of the Philippines to come over. There was a United States military assistance

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:53.520
 group to come up with ideas to fight the communist Hock Balahap, which was a regime that was threatening

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.400
 the Philippines at the time. And he came up with this idea of convincing them that there were

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.520
 vampires out in the woods. And the way that he actually tried to convince them that this was

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.800
 really happening is they captured an enemy soldier and they drained the blood from his body and left

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.440
 him making it look as if he was trying to flee and got caught by one of these vampires. So when

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.920
 they found him, they believed the myth was real. It's bizarre. These little tricks.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.920
 Who benefits from this? Well, I suppose if you've got an enemy believing that there's

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.960
 something paranormal going on, as well as an enemy who are physically real,

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.480
 that just keeps you on edge. It keeps you psychologically all over the shop.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.320
 Because do you remember that fact that you and I both found out about in Japan,

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.880
 they were going to capture some foxes and then paint them in luminous paints and then

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.600
 release them into the Japanese countryside so that people would see these glowing foxes and

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.360
 think that they were some mysterious kind of apparition. Yeah, that's right. They would

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.240
 believe. And there was a thing where one was connected to some balloons. The idea was there's

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:03.040
 a floating fox guard. You just see the balloons, wouldn't you? Not at night. And you would just

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:09.520
 see the illuminated figure of floating fox. And again, is the idea that you sort of make them

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.680
 all a bit edgy because there are these scary foxes around. Or that everyone thinks it's a

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:20.320
 Pokemon and Chase is after it. Again, there's just always, you know, Killjoy Barry in the

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.760
 corner of the meeting there going, "Guys, shall we just shoot them in the head again? I'm really

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:30.160
 sorry. It's a great idea." But one CIA agent, maybe the most surprising one I found out about

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:37.840
 was the Dalai Lama. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the 1960s, his group was being given over a million dollars

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:44.160
 a year by the CIA. And they did deny that the Dalai Lama was on a personal retainer of $180,000

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.440
 a year. His organization have denied that. But that's because the CIA were paying for

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:55.280
 Getty operations against China when China invaded Tibet. And so the Dalai Lama was an important

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.720
 part of that resistance. So we don't know what his kill total is. Yeah. That's a great series of

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:06.720
 novels to be written. The secret CIA adventures of the Dalai Lama. But that's another one where

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.800
 Barry never gets what he wants. Because if you do shoot the Dalai Lama in the head, he just comes

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:17.600
 back. That's so frustrating, isn't it? It's just a pointless assassination. He's on your side. You

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.360
 wouldn't shoot your own agent. Maybe if you're playing a double bluff, maybe it's the Jason Bourne.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.040
 But think of it, the Dalai Lama can get to anybody. There's no one going to refuse a

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:30.480
 meeting with the Dalai Lama on security grounds. No, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. True. True. A lot of

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.600
 the people in the CIA are just massive nerds, right? They're kind of our people. So like when

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.920
 WikiLeaks exposed a load of stuff that the CIA was doing in its hacking program, we managed to see

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.160
 a lot of what the tools were called and what the programs were called. And they're all named after

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:52.080
 memes or references to pop culture. There's one of them named after a World of Warcraft trading card.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.040
 There's another one that's named after some characters from Talladega Nights, which is the

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:02.880
 Will Ferrell movie. And there was another document where a guy just listed a load of awesome tool

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:09.040
 names he wanted to use at some stage, including awesome McTool name and starving weasel. And

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.400
 the second of those is a weird Aljankovic song. And they're just like, we've got to invent something

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.320
 so that we can give it this really nerdy name. Yeah. Yeah. Funny. Somewhere there's a dangerous

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:28.240
 sniper CIA agent who's just heard James call him a nerd. What's that red dot that's just appeared

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.720
 on my head? Actually, that's a myth, isn't it about the red dot because lasers go in a straight

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.200
 line, whereas bullets don't go in a straight line. So there's no point having a red dot aiming at

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:44.160
 someone's head because it's pointing straight from the gun. You need to be aiming slightly above the

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.560
 person's head if you're a sniper. So in the film, it should be there's a red dot slightly above you

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.920
 on the wall. Exactly. And that's when you know you're in danger. And if there's a red dot on

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.360
 your head, you think, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you don't. You think, oh, shit, they're going to shoot me in

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:04.640
 the balls. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.000
 would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of
