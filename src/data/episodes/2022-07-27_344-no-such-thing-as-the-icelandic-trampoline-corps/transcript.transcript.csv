00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered around"
00:00:30,00:00:35,"the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,"
00:00:35,00:00:42,"here we go, starting with fact number one and that's Anna. My fact this week is that in India"
00:00:42,00:00:48,you automatically get a government job if you qualify for the Olympics and if you win a medal
00:00:48,00:00:54,"you get a promotion. Wow, does the size of the promotion depend on the size of the medal,"
00:00:54,00:00:57,"not the size of the medal, the material from which the medal is made?"
00:00:57,00:01:03,"Yeah, you don't get sort of giant gold medals do you? It does, yeah, essentially. I think the"
00:01:03,00:01:08,"level of promotion depends on how well you do generally and it's not just at the Olympics,"
00:01:08,00:01:13,it's in various other sporting competitions. So this is a system which seems to exist state to
00:01:13,00:01:17,"state, they have various different policies from one state to the next and it seems to also exist"
00:01:17,00:01:24,at a federal level and the truth is that to train to qualify for the Olympics is basically a full-time
00:01:24,00:01:28,"job and a lot of people can't afford to take time out of work, like where do you find the money"
00:01:28,00:01:33,to support that? The athlete's diet can be very expensive and so the way the Indian government
00:01:33,00:01:39,"and state governments encourage their citizens to get sporty is to give them government jobs,"
00:01:39,00:01:45,"which is like monthly salary, you can't be fired, you get medical care, you get a pension,"
00:01:45,00:01:49,"but they do actually have to turn up to work. So there's... I have a question. Yeah, go on."
00:01:49,00:01:54,Are the government jobs you get related to the sport that you do? So if you're a really good
00:01:54,00:01:59,"high jumper, do they sometimes give you a job like turning on light switches on very big walls?"
00:01:59,00:02:03,"Oh, yeah, those really high light switches that are purposely beyond normal humidity."
00:02:03,00:02:07,I guess the reason they put them there in the first place is because they were installed by
00:02:07,00:02:12,"high jumpers. Exactly, yeah, it's a vicious circle, it's the whole thing. Is it like that?"
00:02:12,00:02:17,"It's not, though, is it? No, it is the answer. It's exactly like that, yeah, it's a very good"
00:02:17,00:02:21,"question. They almost all work for the railways, don't they? Are a lot of them. Yeah, police force"
00:02:21,00:02:27,"as well. The biggest employers are the railway, the police force, the army, but various government"
00:02:27,00:02:34,departments. So there's an air rifle world record holder called suma shiro and she got a job on
00:02:34,00:02:39,"the railway, for instance, and she had to turn up to work sort of. No, I don't think every day,"
00:02:39,00:02:43,but quite regularly and just did data entry and literally sitting at a computer doing data entry
00:02:43,00:02:48,"in order to claim her government salary. Well, did she do it from a computer which was 10 meters"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"away from her because she's so good at air rifle? Well, she was shooting it. Like she has to shoot"
00:02:52,00:02:57,"each key. There was an old game called duck hunts which came out before any of you guys were born,"
00:02:57,00:03:02,"which probably would be quite useful for that. Exactly. Yeah, that's how she trained. I think"
00:03:02,00:03:08,"I stretched this beyond the point. But it seems like in some cases that it's the other way round,"
00:03:08,00:03:13,they became athletes and tried to get into competitions just to secure a lifetime government
00:03:13,00:03:18,"job. Wow. So because you get, as Anna said, the pensions, you get medical, you get lifetime job"
00:03:18,00:03:23,"basically. But surely that would be easier to just get the job than becoming an elite athlete,"
00:03:23,00:03:27,"considering how difficult it is to become an, you know, you have to get to the Olympics. That's"
00:03:27,00:03:33,"pretty hard. It must be easier. Some people are very bad at data entry, James, but naturally quite"
00:03:33,00:03:39,fit. It's amazing how badly India does at the Olympics relative to the population size. So
00:03:39,00:03:45,"they've won 28 medals total at the Olympics, which is the same as Michael Phelps has won."
00:03:45,00:03:50,"Wow. Now, it's obviously Michael Phelps is very, very good at the Olympics, but India has roughly"
00:03:50,00:03:56,"a billion people. And in 2008, they won one medal per 383 million of their population."
00:03:56,00:04:03,"So that's a low hit rate, basically. That's what people say, isn't it? Like it's not really fair"
00:04:03,00:04:09,"the Olympics because, you know, you might say, well, it's not fair that, you know, some countries"
00:04:09,00:04:13,in the Eastern Bloc might have used drugs or whatever. But also it's not really fair that
00:04:13,00:04:18,"the rich countries just get to do way better because we have way better diets, we have better"
00:04:18,00:04:23,"facilities, we have better everything in the Western world. So yeah, it's pretty hard to be"
00:04:23,00:04:29,just a lowly born Indian person and get into the Olympics. And that's a huge amount of the population
00:04:29,00:04:34,"are basically excluded because of, for financial reasons, from even ever having this as an option"
00:04:34,00:04:38,"in their life. So it's not really a billion people who are, you know, in the pool to be selected."
00:04:38,00:04:42,"But they do, there's a stat that I read in an article talking about this, where they say that"
00:04:42,00:04:47,"there's more than 100 billionaires in India. That's a lot of billionaires, which mean there"
00:04:47,00:04:52,"must be a lot of millionaires, which must mean there must be a middle class that is good at"
00:04:52,00:04:57,sport and have the facilities and have the training. That's true. They just don't do it for some reason.
00:04:57,00:05:01,"Well, there's a saying, there's a popular Hindi saying, and this is the translation of it. It's"
00:05:01,00:05:05,"""If you study hard, you will live like a king. But if you play sports, you will ruin your life."""
00:05:05,00:05:07,So it might be a cultural thing as well.
00:05:07,00:05:14,I think there's a bit of a disadvantage as well to the people who have grown up wanting to work
00:05:14,00:05:20,"and get high up in the railway services. You know, imagine you're like, I want to kick ass and be"
00:05:20,00:05:24,"at the height of this job. And then you've suddenly got this Olympian who's won a silver medal,"
00:05:24,00:05:29,"getting promoted over you, because that's part of the... Like there's a guy called Sandeep Sejwal,"
00:05:29,00:05:36,who he competed in Breaststroke at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And he's never been to the office
00:05:36,00:05:41,"because he's always training, but he's got this full-time job. And he says, ""If you swim continuously"
00:05:41,00:05:45,"and win a medal at the Nationals, or just represent the Indian Railways at the National"
00:05:45,00:05:49,"level, you can get promoted. So I'm going to file for a promotion. Hopefully I get it,"
00:05:49,00:05:55,"and then I'll be the boss."" He might be the boss of some guy who's worked his whole life to get"
00:05:55,00:06:01,"up the railway. It's mad. The system's crazy. I think we'll know when the Indian, entire Indian"
00:06:01,00:06:07,railway infrastructure falls apart. It's because of this Breaststroke professional who's risen to
00:06:07,00:06:12,"the top and ruined it. But it's good for the state departments, because what they get in return is"
00:06:12,00:06:18,"PR, right? So it's sort of seen as them representing the police, or the army, or the railways when"
00:06:18,00:06:24,"they go and compete. That's what they get in return. Also, the Indian Railway competes in"
00:06:24,00:06:29,"national championships of things. So you might have American colleges competing, or at least"
00:06:29,00:06:35,on a semi-professional level they play. But the Indian Railway has teams that are in all of these
00:06:35,00:06:41,"different spots. So it does give them, like Anna says, a lot of good PR. Have you guys heard"
00:06:41,00:06:49,of Abhinav Bindra? No. He's great. He is an air rifle champ. India is actually really good at
00:06:49,00:06:53,the air rifle for some reason that countries just have to think that they're really good at.
00:06:53,00:07:00,"So when he won, his training was amazing for it. So he ordered 10,000 specially Chinese-made"
00:07:00,00:07:05,"air rifle pellets, right? And he weighed every single one of them on the super sensitive scale,"
00:07:05,00:07:10,"and he looked at each one under a magnifying glass. And if there was any irregularity in it,"
00:07:10,00:07:14,"it went in the bin. Wow. You see, that's where the admin skills come in, isn't it?"
00:07:14,00:07:18,"Right. That's data rendering. He's got a spreadsheet with 10,000 pellets in it."
00:07:18,00:07:25,"He, Abhinav Bindra, is India's only gold medallist, isn't he? He's the only individual to win a gold"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"medal. An individual, right. Yeah. So they won, basically, India's won a very large number of"
00:07:30,00:07:37,"gold medals in hockey. To be fair to them, they did really dominate. 1920 to 1980, they won 11"
00:07:37,00:07:44,"medals in 12 Olympics in hockey, and eight of them were gold. And the highlight was 1948,"
00:07:44,00:07:49,"and this really must have felt good, 1948. So immediately after independence for India,"
00:07:49,00:07:55,"when the final or the silver gold, you know, showdown over the Olympic works, was against"
00:07:55,00:08:00,"Britain, and they beat Britain 4-0. That must have been fun. Well, they had that golden period"
00:08:00,00:08:07,"where they were winning golds. It was 1928, 1932, 1936. They won the golds, and they had this one"
00:08:07,00:08:13,"amazing guy called Richard Allen, who was the goalkeeper for the team. And in that time,"
00:08:13,00:08:20,"in those three Olympics, he only conceded three goals. One of them was in 1932, when they were"
00:08:20,00:08:28,"playing in LA, they beat America, they beat the USA 24-1. And the only reason they scored the goal"
00:08:28,00:08:33,"was because Richard Allen was off field, signing autographs for Fads. No. He just sort of went"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"off to site. Yeah, and that's the only time that they got a goal. I would say that's bad goalkeeping."
00:08:38,00:08:44,"That's amazing. At the 1948 one, the hockey team, when they won, would have got their gold medals,"
00:08:44,00:08:50,"but no ribbons, because this was the austerity Olympics. So this was held in Britain and was,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,"you know, rationing was still happening. Everyone was bit poor. There was that whole war thing that"
00:08:53,00:08:58,"just happened. And so as the austerity Olympics, medals were given without ribbons. I can't believe"
00:08:58,00:09:01,that they made the saving on the ribbon. I can't believe they looked at the big gold medal and
00:09:01,00:09:12,"ribbon. But you can't just give people a ribbon. So this rule in India, they've changed it slightly"
00:09:12,00:09:18,"this year. So there's more sports that you can do, which will allow you to get your government job."
00:09:18,00:09:26,"So if you are in the tug of war, you can get it now. If you play roll ball, or if you play Malakamb,"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"so those are the three main new sports that have come in. Two of them are traditional,"
00:09:31,00:09:35,"well, two of them are Indian sports. Roll ball isn't traditional Indian. That was invented quite"
00:09:35,00:09:41,"recently. And that's kind of, it's like basketball on roller skates. And Malakamb is a traditional"
00:09:41,00:09:47,Indian sport. And there was a Malakamb team who have already got Olympic medals. So Malakamb is
00:09:47,00:09:53,"a sport where you get a big, huge pole and you have to balance on top of it while doing yoga moves."
00:09:54,00:10:02,"Okay. So this is a really awesome sport in India. And in 1936, there was a Malakamba group who went"
00:10:02,00:10:07,to Germany and they showed off their skills. And Adolf Hitler was so impressed that he gave them
00:10:07,00:10:15,all Olympic medals. Wow. I read a tiny bit about Malakamb. Is it true that the pole in Malakamb
00:10:15,00:10:20,"represents the phallus of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god? And did Hitler know that when he"
00:10:20,00:10:27,gave out these medals? I think probably. Yeah. I do know you have to lubricate it before you get on
00:10:27,00:10:36,it. So you don't get any wood burns. Wow. That's fair. But a lubricated pole would not be a very
00:10:36,00:10:43,"stable slip, wouldn't you? That's the sport, Dan. Yeah. Right. There's a different levels of"
00:10:43,00:10:49,"lubrications, I suppose. You can have like just covered in butter or you can have it just slightly"
00:10:49,00:10:53,smooth so you don't like get any splinters. And I think it's closer to the second one.
00:10:53,00:10:59,"Is it? Are they doing the yoga moves on top of the pole? Yeah, they're kind of balancing. So I"
00:10:59,00:11:04,imagine a yoga move where you're on one foot and then your other foot is kind of wrapped around your
00:11:04,00:11:08,"head or something. Well, you're doing that, but your foot on the ground isn't on the ground. It's"
00:11:08,00:11:12,"on top of a massive pole. And is there, on the top of the pole, is there a little platform you"
00:11:12,00:11:17,can squeeze your foot on? Or is it just the end of a pole? It's the end of a pole. But it's kind of...
00:11:17,00:11:20,"That's very difficult. Well, that's the least sport for you."
00:11:20,00:11:28,"Again, I think probably easier to just do the exam to get into the government job."
00:11:28,00:11:33,I'll stick to data entry. It feels like it's a time with the pole vault that they should be able
00:11:33,00:11:37,"to do. As in you start doing the pole vault, but of the way on when you get right to the top, you"
00:11:37,00:11:43,"just stay there. Oh, you're downward dogged. Yeah. That occasionally does happen with pole vault,"
00:11:43,00:11:48,where they kind of get to the top and they run out of momentum. And they almost... It looks like
00:11:48,00:11:52,they're just going to stay there. And then what happens is the weight of the person kind of bends
00:11:52,00:11:56,the pole down and they get sprung off like a cartoon. That does happen on occasions.
00:11:56,00:12:01,"They never get stuck at the top. That's funny. Eventually, the Olympics just goes home."
00:12:10,00:12:15,"Okay, it's time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the photo of"
00:12:15,00:12:20,the Wright Brothers first flight was taken by a man who had never used a camera before.
00:12:20,00:12:24,So we're lucky it's not just a picture of someone's feet.
00:12:24,00:12:28,Lucky he didn't have it on selfie mode or something.
00:12:28,00:12:32,It's his first ever photo.
00:12:32,00:12:37,His first ever photo? I read that he'd never seen a camera before.
00:12:37,00:12:43,"Yeah, exactly. Like every... Imagine the day for that guy, he's seeing a camera,"
00:12:43,00:12:49,"he's seeing a photo, a plane's flying. This is a big day. This is magic. Yeah. So this is a guy"
00:12:49,00:12:54,"called John T. Daniels. And he was working at the life-saving station at Kill Devil's Hill,"
00:12:54,00:13:00,"which is where the first flight took place on December 17th, 1903. And he was positioned with"
00:13:00,00:13:05,"the camera by the Wright Brothers, who were obsessed with cameras. They told him everything"
00:13:05,00:13:10,"he needed to do. And there's really a lot of risk when you think about it as well, because"
00:13:10,00:13:14,they needed to position the camera at a place where they believed the plane was going to take
00:13:14,00:13:19,"off, having never took off before on a plane. They needed to tell him the exact moment for him to"
00:13:19,00:13:24,press this button that would allow them to capture the perfect shot. And they were giving it to a
00:13:24,00:13:29,"man who, as we said, not only had not seen a camera before, but was about to witness flight,"
00:13:29,00:13:34,"man-powered flight. And so there was a genuine moment where he almost forgot to press it,"
00:13:34,00:13:38,because he was so in awe of the historical thing that he was seeing. And at the last second kind
00:13:38,00:13:46,"of shook himself and took the photo. And by some insane magic, we have the perfect shot. It"
00:13:46,00:13:50,developed perfectly. It caught it perfectly in flight. And it's an amazing photo.
00:13:50,00:13:55,"It's a cool thing to reflect. Actually, when you look at that picture, which I guess people have"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"probably seen before, to think how unlikely that was. So that was actually going to work. I mean,"
00:14:00,00:14:04,"how did they pick the exact spot? Because you can't swivel it around, can you?"
00:14:04,00:14:08,"Exactly. I don't think they had a turn. Even if they did, the guy wouldn't have known what to do."
00:14:08,00:14:15,"And from the account of it, he was also that day involved in the first-ever plane crash."
00:14:15,00:14:21,"Because after they landed it, after their flight, it blew away. Because it was a"
00:14:21,00:14:24,really light. It was basically a glider with a little bit of an engine. And he got tangled up in
00:14:24,00:14:29,"it. He tried to grab it as it blew away, just tried to stop it from blowing away. And he got"
00:14:29,00:14:32,sort of caught up in it and had to be helped out. And he was injured.
00:14:32,00:14:38,"Yeah. When he flipped over, he was holding onto a strut. And all the others let go, but he desperately"
00:14:38,00:14:44,"didn't want this thing to break. And so he flipped over with it. And he was a bit mangled, but he was"
00:14:44,00:14:49,"fine. But they let him keep the strut that he was holding onto, which he kept forever for the rest"
00:14:49,00:14:53,"of his life. And he would carry it round with him. And every time he told this story, this amazing"
00:14:53,00:14:58,"story of being the first person to be in a plane crash, he would take out a pen knife."
00:14:58,00:15:01,"And as he was telling it, he would shave off a little bit of the strut and he would give it to"
00:15:01,00:15:06,the person he was telling the story to. Yeah. You've got to limit the number of times you
00:15:06,00:15:10,tell that story. Towards the end of your life. I'm really sorry. I can't tell it today. I've
00:15:10,00:15:14,"just got a bit of sawdust left, to be honest. Oh, just find another piece of wood."
00:15:14,00:15:18,"Exactly. It must be like the crucifixion, you know, the true cross."
00:15:18,00:15:24,"Yeah, relics. There's a billion Wright brothers planes worth of strut shavings out there now."
00:15:25,00:15:29,"But you say so, he thought he was witnessing this incredible historic moment,"
00:15:29,00:15:33,which he did. And I think there were sort of four or five people there who did think that.
00:15:33,00:15:38,"But I hadn't quite realized that the rest of the world, A thought it was nothing,"
00:15:38,00:15:43,"what happened, and B didn't believe it. So they were completely ignored by the press for five years"
00:15:43,00:15:47,"after 1903, that first flight. Newspapers and journalists just didn't believe them. They told"
00:15:47,00:15:52,newspapers on the day that this is what they were trying to do. And they basically thought these
00:15:52,00:15:58,"guys were crazy crackpots. It's such a slam to say not only did nothing happen, we don't even"
00:15:58,00:16:06,"believe that nothing happened. I know. I know. Quite nicely, the only paper that did report on them"
00:16:06,00:16:12,in that on that first day was a paper called the Virginia pilot by chance. But the way they got the
00:16:12,00:16:17,"story was the Wright brothers once they'd achieved flight, they telegraphed their families to be like,"
00:16:17,00:16:22,"""Hey, mum, hey dad, we've flown."" And so the telegraph operator said, ""Oh, couldn't help but"
00:16:22,00:16:26,"notice that message you just let me give you a mum and dad. Do you mind if I tell the press?"""
00:16:26,00:16:30,"And they said, ""No, don't want you to tell the press because they wanted the press in Ohio where"
00:16:30,00:16:35,"they were from to get the story first."" And the telegraph operator ignored that, told the Virginia"
00:16:35,00:16:40,"pilot, but Virginia pilot knew nothing about it. So they completely made up what had happened."
00:16:40,00:16:44,"And so they had them flying for sort of three miles. You know, I think we've said before,"
00:16:44,00:16:48,"they only flew for about 100 feet, 120 feet. They were like, they flew for three miles. They"
00:16:48,00:16:52,were 60 foot in the air when actually they were 12 foot above the ground or something.
00:16:52,00:16:57,They said Wilbur was flying the plane when it was Orville. And so the first account of the
00:16:57,00:17:03,Wright brothers flight was total fiction from the Virginia pilot. I thought it was in a B magazine
00:17:03,00:17:09,that they were first reported in. It was Gleanings and B culture. So that I think those are the
00:17:09,00:17:13,"later, because they kept flying. I don't know if you guys know that, but they actually did more"
00:17:13,00:17:17,flights after their first ones. I'd say quit while you're ahead.
00:17:17,00:17:24,"But they were doing these flights. Oh, where exactly was it? I can't remember if it was"
00:17:24,00:17:30,"still a killed one. In Dayton, though. In Dayton. Okay, yeah. And this was in 1904 and 1905 when"
00:17:30,00:17:34,they were making flights up to 40 minutes long and nobody paid any attention. It was amazing.
00:17:34,00:17:41,"I mean, it doesn't. But this guy, Amos Ives Root, he had kind of heard about it and he saw them flying"
00:17:41,00:17:46,because they were out in the sticks. They weren't near a major population centre.
00:17:46,00:17:49,And he wrote to Scientific American and Scientific American didn't reply.
00:17:49,00:17:54,"So he wrote it in Gleanings and B culture along articles, which are things like"
00:17:54,00:18:00,beekeeping in the Southwest and midwinter flights of cellar bees. And it's just mixed in with that.
00:18:01,00:18:05,"Do you think they got complaint letters from bee fans saying, I couldn't really see what"
00:18:05,00:18:11,relevance your article about the first ever powered flight had? Amos Ives Root was so cool.
00:18:11,00:18:15,So he owned the first ever bicycle in Ohio. That makes him cool.
00:18:15,00:18:22,"Definitely. Yeah, he was friends with them, wasn't he? And he had, I think he just had his own kind"
00:18:22,00:18:28,"of comment page in Gleanings and B culture where he was allowed to write about whatever he wanted,"
00:18:28,00:18:34,"even if it wasn't about bees. That's so cool. The first lot, what was the hill called, Dan?"
00:18:34,00:18:39,"It was called Kill Devil Hill. So Kill Devil Hill. And that was in Kitty Hawk, wasn't it?"
00:18:39,00:18:45,"That's where they did it. And the reason that they went there is Wilbur. Well, when you're flying,"
00:18:45,00:18:50,you need like some wind coming straight towards you. It helps you to take off right.
00:18:50,00:18:55,And he wanted to find out where the best place in the US to go for that was. So he wrote to the
00:18:55,00:19:00,US Weather Bureau who sent him data on the wind velocity in more than 100 places around America.
00:19:00,00:19:05,"And he settled on this place where he knew there was a hill. He knew that they had really good,"
00:19:05,00:19:10,steady wind always coming in their favor. And then he went to Kitty Hawk because it was just
00:19:10,00:19:15,"like a bit of nothing kind of marsh, not marsh ground, but kind of wilderness ground. There"
00:19:15,00:19:21,was nothing there. There was like 50 households. They were all descended from sailors who'd been
00:19:21,00:19:25,shipwrecked there over the years. So they were all like it was like a sailing community.
00:19:25,00:19:30,And the richest person that lived in that town was a guy called Doc Cogswell. And he was the
00:19:30,00:19:40,"richest because his brother owed him $15,000. That's the worst kind of wealth. I'm broke,"
00:19:40,00:19:45,"but I'm owed it. It sounds miserable when their conditions, when they were living there, because"
00:19:45,00:19:50,they had to dig for water. They had to catch their own fish. One of them said that there
00:19:50,00:19:56,"were so many mosquitoes, they almost darkened the sun. I know, it just sounds like really"
00:19:56,00:19:59,"unpleasant living conditions, but they went out there for weeks and weeks on end."
00:19:59,00:20:04,"Yeah, only it's got such an ominous name. If I were trying to fly for the first time ever,"
00:20:04,00:20:08,I would ask not to fly on a place called Kill Devil. I don't want either of those words
00:20:08,00:20:10,in the place I'm attempting to fly.
00:20:10,00:20:18,"And it was a thing that people not only didn't believe it, but they didn't think it was possible"
00:20:18,00:20:23,"that we could fly. And there's a few, you got some famous quotes from that period before they"
00:20:23,00:20:29,went up of people saying this will never happen. There was one bishop who was asked if he thought
00:20:29,00:20:36,"that flying would ever happen. And he said, what a nonsensical idea, flight is reserved for the"
00:20:36,00:20:41,birds and the angels. And that bishop was called Bishop Wright. And that was the father of the
00:20:41,00:20:48,"brothers. Yeah, he absolutely thought there was no way. And once they did it, and after the years"
00:20:48,00:20:53,"of them doing it, he actually loved it. He used to go up with the brothers separately. He had a"
00:20:53,00:20:58,"rule they couldn't fly together. He didn't want to lose them both in a crash, but he would fly"
00:20:58,00:21:02,"with one of them and he'd go higher, higher, get me higher. I think he went up just once, didn't"
00:21:02,00:21:08,he? It was the one day he allowed the brothers to fly together in 1910. It was that day when he
00:21:08,00:21:12,"did that. They didn't all go up in the same plane though, because that would have been really"
00:21:12,00:21:22,all eggs in one basket. You just got mum left. Not the bishop. But it wouldn't have been just mum
00:21:22,00:21:27,"left because there were two other Wright brothers. And the Wright sister. Yes, they had more weird"
00:21:27,00:21:33,"names. The other brothers were called Ruchlin, Reuchlin and Lauren. And they just worked as"
00:21:33,00:21:38,bookkeepers and they appear to have had no interest in flight. Whereas the Wright sister
00:21:38,00:21:43,is the reason that we kind of accept the Wright brothers as the first flyers today because
00:21:43,00:21:48,"the Smithsonian, they thought that the first person to fly was a guy called Samuel Langley,"
00:21:48,00:21:54,"which he did in 1903, nine days before the Wright brothers. But what he actually did was fly his"
00:21:54,00:22:00,plane for about maybe about half a meter before it smashed straight into a lake or something.
00:22:00,00:22:06,But they said they didn't believe the Wright brothers at all. And so they decided that this
00:22:06,00:22:11,"guy Langley was the first person. But then for years and years, Catherine Wright, who was the"
00:22:11,00:22:15,"sister, it was her life's job to try and make sure that people believed that the Wright brothers"
00:22:15,00:22:20,were the first people to do it. And she was super famous in her day. Wasn't she Catherine Wright?
00:22:20,00:22:24,"Yeah, it was pretty much the three of them who were equally famous, it seemed, because the Wright"
00:22:24,00:22:30,brothers were bad with the press. I think they were not good media personalities. They were very
00:22:30,00:22:35,"shy, whereas Catherine Wright was very gregarious. And so she was like the front facing Wright."
00:22:35,00:22:40,And so she met the King of Spain and the Prince of Prussia and spoke with them at events.
00:22:40,00:22:45,"She got the French lesion donner, which they gave the Wright brothers and Catherine at the"
00:22:45,00:22:49,"same time, the highest order of merit you can get in France. And yeah, she was great."
00:22:49,00:22:54,"And she was the first woman ever to attend the Aero Club de France, because basically when they"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"went to France, which was when they became massive really, because in America, they were kind of"
00:22:58,00:23:02,"ignored, especially they tried to sell the plane to the military and the military just"
00:23:02,00:23:07,"weren't having it. So they said, fuck, it will go to France instead. But the French, they love kind"
00:23:07,00:23:11,"of aerospace. They loved the balloons. They loved their new gliders, things like that. And so when"
00:23:11,00:23:16,"they saw the Wright brothers, they absolutely loved it. And Catherine was the main face for that."
00:23:16,00:23:22,Very cool. She had kind of a sad end. So they were incredibly close. And they seemed to have had a
00:23:22,00:23:28,"pact, Wilbur, Orville and Catherine, that none of them would ever marry. I think we think that's"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"what happened. And they made this pact very, very early on. And she stuck to it. She was incredibly"
00:23:32,00:23:37,"close to Orville. So Wilbur died in 1912, I think, but Orville, a long time, very close to him. But"
00:23:37,00:23:43,"eventually, 1926, age 51, she decided she wanted to marry her childhood sweetheart. And Orville"
00:23:43,00:23:50,completely stopped speaking to her. That is mean. That is harsh. Very harsh. Childhood sweetheart.
00:23:50,00:23:56,If you've waited about 45 years to marry someone. It is harsh because they seem to have had that
00:23:56,00:24:00,"pact where none of them will marry. But for Orville and Wilbur, it seemed to be quite an easy thing"
00:24:00,00:24:05,"to keep. Because they were particularly good with the press, but they just weren't good in social"
00:24:05,00:24:09,"situations at all. Were they? Whereas like Catherine, she was just everywhere. She was..."
00:24:09,00:24:16,So were the two brothers just not sort of romantic people at all? And they've got this mega babe
00:24:16,00:24:21,"sister. But they keep saying, no, no, no, we made a pact when we were all nine. Nobody will ever"
00:24:21,00:24:25,"get married. The brothers, they lived together, worked together, ate together. And they even"
00:24:25,00:24:30,"shared a joint bank account, Orville and Wilbur. Really? So yeah, it was kind of easy. And then"
00:24:30,00:24:37,"Catherine went on to become a suffragist, didn't she? And also the vicar went on the march with her."
00:24:37,00:24:42,"Not the vicar. What was he called? The bishop. The bishop. Yeah, the bishop, sorry. And the bishop"
00:24:42,00:24:48,went on the march with her. So he kind of... And that was when he was in his 80s. So he was kind
00:24:48,00:24:52,of like joining in with all of the kids stuff when he got a bit older. That's really fun.
00:24:52,00:24:57,He really embraces kids hobbies. What an amazing 80s he must have had just being a bishop your whole
00:24:57,00:25:02,"life. And then you get to go on a plane, you get to go on a march. That's really cool. That thing"
00:25:02,00:25:07,"about how they only became successful when they got to Paris. So in Paris, Wilbur was the one who"
00:25:07,00:25:12,went to Paris and Orville stayed in the USA. And Wilbur was a bit more of a showman. He was
00:25:12,00:25:17,better with the press than Orville really was quite reclusive and shy. Wilbur was put up in the
00:25:17,00:25:22,"Hotel Maurice. Have you heard of this place? No. Oh my God, it's amazing. I got in a complete"
00:25:22,00:25:28,"distraction about this amazing hotel he was put up in. So it's very, very classy. He still exists"
00:25:28,00:25:36,today. The lift was a copy of Mary Antoinette's sedan chair. That's how sort of lush this hotel was.
00:25:36,00:25:40,"Everyone has stayed there. Awesome Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Picasso's wedding meal was there."
00:25:40,00:25:46,Salvador Dali stayed for one month every year. And he once ordered a flock of sheep to be delivered
00:25:46,00:25:54,"to his room so he could fire his pistol at them. Blanks, it was blanks. Even so, if I were at the"
00:25:54,00:25:59,"hotel reception and someone asked for that and told me why they wanted it, I think I wouldn't do it."
00:25:59,00:26:03,"I'd at least call my manager and say I'm not comfortable doing this. He might have asked,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,"he might have given you the other task, which was he asked staff to go to the Toulierie Garden and"
00:26:06,00:26:16,"catch flies for him for five francs per fly. When I used to work in a hotel, they used to say to you"
00:26:16,00:26:21,"you have to say yes to everything, basically. Unless it's illegal or immoral or whatever,"
00:26:21,00:26:24,"if they ask you for something, you always immediately have to say, yes, I can do that,"
00:26:24,00:26:28,"but it might cost a lot of money. You know, you have to agree to everything."
00:26:28,00:26:31,Wow. And just hope Dali doesn't check in.
00:26:31,00:26:36,"Oh, you see the handlebar mustache coming around the corner. Oh, here we go, okay."
00:26:36,00:26:38,"Just quick, hide the clocks."
00:26:38,00:26:45,"There's one other thing about this hotel, which is that it's where the decision was made not to"
00:26:45,00:26:52,"blow up Paris. So in the war, Hitler really kind of went off the deep end towards the end, I would"
00:26:52,00:26:57,"say. And he, as the retreat was being sounded, he ordered lots of key bits of Paris, you know,"
00:26:57,00:27:01,"the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the bridges over the Seine. He ordered them to be wired up with explosives,"
00:27:01,00:27:10,which they were. And General von Choltitz or Koltitz was in the hotel. And it's there that
00:27:10,00:27:14,"he made the decision. He was either persuaded, we think there are various different versions of"
00:27:14,00:27:19,"events, or he was trying to save his own skin. And that's the hotel where he said, actually,"
00:27:19,00:27:23,maybe there's a lot. Let's not blow up the most beautiful city in Europe. Let's just leave.
00:27:23,00:27:29,That is interesting. But there is one other thing about the Hotel Maurice that you might be
00:27:29,00:27:34,"interested in, Andy, because we have mentioned it before quite recently. And that is because they"
00:27:34,00:27:43,"had 148 pneumatic clocks in the hotel, one in each room that were attached to that air system in Paris."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"Of course. Oh, I'd forgotten that. That's so cool. Of course they did."
00:27:47,00:27:51,"I really hope that when Darlie did room service, he would save the crazy request"
00:27:51,00:27:55,right to the edge so that the person would think they were getting away with it.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"What can I get you, Mr. Darlie? It's just eggs Benedict this morning."
00:27:58,00:28:05,"An orange juice, please. And is that it? One more thing. 7000 sheep."
00:28:05,00:28:10,And a gun.
00:28:10,00:28:20,"Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:28:20,00:28:26,"Okay, my fact this week is that on the French island of Ile-de-Raye, the donkeys wear trousers."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"Sounds like the start of a kid's book, doesn't it?"
00:28:29,00:28:35,"Do they wear V trousers? What do you mean? Like, do they wear the trousers?"
00:28:35,00:28:42,"Oh, I see. As in are they in charge? Well, I would say with a donkey, basically the donkey always"
00:28:42,00:28:45,"wears the trousers, don't they? They don't do what you tell them to. Very wise. Not really."
00:28:45,00:28:54,"These are originally working donkeys on this island. They used to work in the salt marshes,"
00:28:54,00:28:59,"and in the salt marshes, there are lots of mosquitoes, maybe not enough to block out the sun,"
00:28:59,00:29:03,"but there's definitely a lot of them. And so to stop their legs from getting bitten,"
00:29:03,00:29:07,"these particular donkeys, their owners would put little kind of trousers on, and they look a bit"
00:29:07,00:29:14,"like, you know, really old fashioned pajama bottoms, which they would tie around the bottom part of"
00:29:14,00:29:20,"their legs, and their butt is still exposed. So it's like pajama bottoms with a flap allowing"
00:29:20,00:29:25,"your buttocks to kind of hang out. And so these days, they still wear the trousers, even though"
00:29:25,00:29:31,"they don't work in the salt marshes, but they just give rides to children around the local park,"
00:29:32,00:29:37,"which no matter what you think about donkeys giving children rides, whether that's fair play or not,"
00:29:37,00:29:41,"definitely better than working in the salt marshes. Donkeys around the world, they do seem to have a"
00:29:41,00:29:46,"very two track career path. Either it's horrible backbreaking work, and they get really mistreated"
00:29:46,00:29:50,"all over the world, or it's working at the seaside, taking the children out for a bit."
00:29:50,00:29:57,"They are quite, these ones are amazingly big, aren't they? Before you start feeling too sorry"
00:29:57,00:30:01,"for them having children on their back, I didn't realise a donkey could even qualify as a donkey"
00:30:01,00:30:08,"at this size. So the Baudet de Poitou is what they're called, I think. There can be 16 hands,"
00:30:08,00:30:13,"which is, that's like a big horse. That's a horse that you feel really high up when you're sitting"
00:30:13,00:30:19,on it. 16 hands is a big horse. I think I might have met some of these donkeys. Because they have
00:30:19,00:30:23,"them in the New Forest. Do they? Yeah, they do. They have a few of them in the New Forest. Was it"
00:30:23,00:30:28,"really fluffy? Like they're quite fluffy. They've got long shaggy hair, like a shaggy. It was very"
00:30:28,00:30:33,"shaggy. We met one right up close, although it wasn't 16 hands high, so maybe it was a younger one."
00:30:33,00:30:37,And presumably without the trousers on. It had no trousers on. Not by the time.
00:30:37,00:30:47,"No, don't go there. That's really cool, because they're very rare. You've seen an endangered"
00:30:47,00:30:52,species there. I may have just seen a normal donkey. I already regret. You may have seen a sheep.
00:30:52,00:30:57,"It's possible. But they're less rare than they used to be, aren't they?"
00:30:58,00:31:05,"Yeah. They went really, really rare in the 70s and 80s, so much so that there were only a dozen"
00:31:05,00:31:11,"or so of them left that could reproduce. But now, thanks to some kind of bits of conservation,"
00:31:11,00:31:16,"there's a lot more of them in France, and they're starting to send them to other places like the"
00:31:16,00:31:22,"New Forest, I assume. New Forest, yeah. I think there's about a thousand, isn't there? Maybe just"
00:31:22,00:31:26,"under a thousand in the world. And you should look them up. They do look bizarre. They look a bit like,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,"you know, if you have an old English sheepdog, the really shaggy dogs, but they've got quite"
00:31:30,00:31:35,"a responsible owner who doesn't look after their coat, and it really dreadlocks. It's like that,"
00:31:35,00:31:41,"isn't it? They've got long dreadlocks. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What would you replace a donkey with on a"
00:31:41,00:31:48,"beach if you had to? I reckon like maybe seven ducks, and they have like a little carriage"
00:31:48,00:31:52,"underneath them that the child can sit in and then fly around. You know, I'm thinking Wright"
00:31:52,00:31:59,"brother's the kind of flight as a feature. I mean, that is nice. I'd go to that beach. That was"
00:31:59,00:32:03,"dangerous. Health and safety is never going to pass. Sorry, Grant. In 2016, Tall Bay Council"
00:32:03,00:32:08,"replaced their donkeys with three small trampolines, and there was outrage. Because it wasn't as much"
00:32:08,00:32:12,fun. They said this is just not as good for children. All for the donkeys. The donkey keepers were
00:32:12,00:32:17,furious. Do the kids have to haul the trampolines along the beach then? And if you want a ride
00:32:17,00:32:22,"along the beach, the trampoline's not going to cut it. Yeah, you could jump from one to the other,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,but I think there are only three small trampolines. It's quite a short ride.
00:32:25,00:32:29,"It's a quick ride, yeah. It's not getting far. In Iceland, when I went to Iceland,"
00:32:29,00:32:35,every small town has like a massive trampoline in the middle of it. It's so weird. Yeah. It's
00:32:35,00:32:40,"like, you know how in most, in like towns, you might have a park that kids play on with swings"
00:32:40,00:32:45,"and slides and stuff. In Iceland, they just had these massive kind of plastic kind of"
00:32:45,00:32:50,"tarpaulin things that appeared to be filled with air. I don't know what they were filled with,"
00:32:50,00:32:54,"because I never jumped on them much to my shame. But they were like, yeah,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,"just everywhere you went, it seemed like kids could play on these bouncy things like bouncy"
00:32:57,00:33:02,"castles. So a bouncy castle, right? James, is it true? I think I've read that they were initially"
00:33:02,00:33:06,"for defense as in you'd have to have someone guarding constantly jumping up and down,"
00:33:06,00:33:13,"landing out for an invading army. Yeah. I was, you know what? At the start of that sentence,"
00:33:13,00:33:20,I genuinely thought that you were about to say something real. I saw you going along with it.
00:33:20,00:33:28,"So donkeys, eh? Donkeys. Donkeys are cool. The word donkey used to rhyme with monkey."
00:33:28,00:33:35,Monkey. Donkey. It used to be donkey. Yeah. Nice. And it didn't really exist until the start of the
00:33:35,00:33:40,"17th century. You would always say ass or ass instead of donkey. So in Shakespeare, there won't"
00:33:40,00:33:45,"be any donkeys. There'll all be asses. And in the King James Bible. Was it because that was,"
00:33:45,00:33:49,it was also rude and an insult that they kind of borderized it? There is one thought that that's
00:33:49,00:33:56,it. The word probably comes from done meaning brown or gray. But I think that's why that the word
00:33:56,00:34:03,"donkey became more commonly known is because of the association with bums. Like rooster,"
00:34:03,00:34:07,"because in America, they didn't want to say cock. So they said rooster instead or man chicken."
00:34:08,00:34:15,"Man chicken sounds more rude, I think. Yeah. So the donkeys, donkeys in the UK,"
00:34:15,00:34:20,"they are big on the beaches, obviously. There are still lots of donkey rides."
00:34:20,00:34:26,"So you know the donkey sanctuary, that's the one of the major donkey charities in the UK."
00:34:26,00:34:33,"And they have, I'm going to say secret agents who travel around the UK checking up on donkey abuse"
00:34:34,00:34:39,and making sure that they're not being badly treated or that their backs aren't being strained
00:34:39,00:34:42,"at the beach. And they can turn up and they can, I think they have the power of,"
00:34:42,00:34:46,"they don't have the power of arrest, but they don't have the powers to take your donkeys away."
00:34:46,00:34:51,So is that if you're doing donkey rides on the beach and someone who looks suspiciously
00:34:51,00:34:55,"like an adult but is dressing up as a child and claiming they want a donkey ride turns up,"
00:34:55,00:35:00,"but has sort of a notepad they're trying to hide, that's probably your guy. So they go undercover."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"They're like, I think they do go undercover because if they phone ahead and say,"
00:35:04,00:35:08,"I'm bringing from the donkey police, then you'll just get out the nice donkey. Whereas if you,"
00:35:08,00:35:13,"if they turn up incognito, they see you've got your ratty old donkey and you're beating it,"
00:35:13,00:35:19,then they'll intervene. Yeah. Wow. Good. Doing great work. It might be quite fun to be a donkey
00:35:19,00:35:25,"in the US. If you're specifically, if you're pack borough racing in Colorado, which is a"
00:35:25,00:35:31,"sort of ancient historic Colorado sport and it's, it's in honor of miners who used to go gold mining"
00:35:31,00:35:36,"with donkeys. And the rule with pack borough racing is that a donkey can't carry a person,"
00:35:36,00:35:42,but a person can carry a donkey needs be in it. And you basically have to run along with your
00:35:42,00:35:48,"donkey. Right. Okay. Is it one man, one donkey in the one man on donkey. Okay. How often does"
00:35:48,00:35:54,"anyone actually carry the donkey though? Cause they're pretty heavy. They're heavy. I did,"
00:35:55,00:35:58,I was reading one person's account of his pack borough race where he should have carried the
00:35:58,00:36:03,"donkey and didn't. So I think they must be too heavy. This is a guy called Curtis Emory,"
00:36:03,00:36:08,"who's a veteran borough racer. And he was near, really near the end of a 15 mile race. And suddenly"
00:36:08,00:36:13,"his donkey called Jackson had to cross a wooden bridge. And as donkeys I want to do, he'd cross"
00:36:13,00:36:19,"the bridge countless times before suddenly stopped, like not doing that. Stubborn. And he,"
00:36:19,00:36:24,"and right at the end of the race, and he had to tie Jackson to the bridge, walk into town and return"
00:36:24,00:36:29,with a winch equipped Jeep to pull the donkey over the bridge at which point. I don't think he'd
00:36:29,00:36:34,"won the race anymore. That's amazing. But yeah, they do, they do freeze donkeys. That's the weird"
00:36:34,00:36:39,"thing about them. I hadn't probably realized that's what they're doing. Like horses, if you scare them,"
00:36:39,00:36:46,"bolt, a donkey goes stock still, turns to stone. Yeah. Right. Well, this is why people think that"
00:36:46,00:36:53,"they are stubborn. And this is some, some study done by the donkey sanctuary in the UK, which is"
00:36:53,00:36:58,"about people's perception of the donkey, which incidentally found their Britain's second favourite"
00:36:58,00:37:07,"farm animal. Pretty good. Can we guess the favourite? After cow. Got to be sheep. No one's, no one's said"
00:37:07,00:37:14,"the right answer yet. Chicken. Man chicken. No, Anna's got it right. It's a horse. It's a horse."
00:37:14,00:37:18,"Everyone loves a horse. Anyway, sorry, that's completely irrelevant. Cow doesn't come into the"
00:37:18,00:37:27,top two. Yeah. Everyone likes cows. Oh my god. Donkey is number two. Yeah. Because I think if you
00:37:27,00:37:32,"are a kid and you have like a set of all your farmyard animals, very rare is there a donkey in"
00:37:32,00:37:37,"there, is it? Or it's certainly cows and sheep coming first. Are you guys suggesting that this"
00:37:37,00:37:44,"study conducted on behalf of the donkey sanctuary is in any way improperly done? No. But basically,"
00:37:44,00:37:51,"you know what? I just want to carry on talking about this. What they've done is they thought,"
00:37:51,00:37:55,"right, we need to make it seem like it's the best animal, but no one's going to believe us"
00:37:55,00:37:59,if we say that the donkey is the most popular farmyard animal. So we're going to have to
00:37:59,00:38:04,"put it in second place. That's what they thought, isn't it? It's like when, you know, Kim Jong-un"
00:38:04,00:38:10,"gets 97.9% in the election. It's like, no one will believe 100%. So I have to go down a bit."
00:38:13,00:38:18,Yeah. But 55% of people do think they're stubborn. And the donkey sanctuary explained that they're
00:38:18,00:38:22,"not stubborn. They're just freezing. One in three people think they're affectionate,"
00:38:22,00:38:28,and only 18% of people think they are charismatic. Yet they've ranked number two. This doesn't add
00:38:28,00:38:41,"up. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is that in the late 1960s,"
00:38:41,00:38:49,the CIA considered assassinating people using lightning. Wow. Is that you bringing back your
00:38:49,00:38:53,old nickname and admitting that you were part of the CIA? I'm very glad that you've mentioned
00:38:53,00:38:56,my old nickname being lightning because I'm determined that it's going to make a comeback.
00:38:56,00:39:04,"So this is something, there's a great article on Forbes about this, a journalist called David"
00:39:04,00:39:11,"Hambling, I found it, and it was a proposal in 1967 that was made seriously, but it wasn't carried out."
00:39:11,00:39:16,"But the idea was developed. They thought, well, lightning, lightning is pretty powerful, isn't"
00:39:16,00:39:22,"it? And if there was a way of directing lightning, then you could get it. They used a real euphemism."
00:39:22,00:39:27,They said it would produce effects favourable to our purposes. I don't think you don't have to
00:39:27,00:39:31,"read too much between the lines to realise that that's killing people with lightning, basically."
00:39:33,00:39:38,"And yeah, the plan was basically to get a very, very thin wire, which would be only a"
00:39:38,00:39:44,"fraction of a millimetre wide, but several miles long to effectively drop this from an aircraft or"
00:39:44,00:39:50,to use a kind of parachute to keep it up there for a long time. And then if there was a storm
00:39:50,00:39:55,"happening above the person you wanted to assassinate, it didn't rely on that. That was the floor in the"
00:39:55,00:40:00,plan. The person had to be in a lightning storm. But it wasn't also a flaw. They had to somehow get
00:40:00,00:40:05,"this wire next to them. So like you've run over to someone and say, just hold this wire, will you?"
00:40:05,00:40:13,"Exactly. So it was those were the disadvantages. There were advantages, obviously, like cheap,"
00:40:13,00:40:17,because you're not being getting an electricity bill for this. And also it would leave no evidence.
00:40:17,00:40:22,"Yeah, but you can always have incredible advantages to something impossible."
00:40:22,00:40:28,"That's true. I think we should go ahead with the impossible thing, because the advantages are"
00:40:28,00:40:34,"just so good. Yeah, that was, I mean, the disadvantages were big as well. Yeah."
00:40:34,00:40:39,I think there's contextual evidence. I think that if Fidel Castro had suddenly been struck by
00:40:39,00:40:44,"lightning around that period, it would have been very suspicious. Well, if all the CIA's enemies"
00:40:44,00:40:49,"suddenly got hit by lightning, I think you can do it twice. I had a good luck to see if all that"
00:40:49,00:40:53,there's a list of Wikipedia people who were killed by lightning to see if any of them
00:40:54,00:40:58,"were possibly enemies of America at this time. I couldn't find any, I'm afraid."
00:40:58,00:41:04,"Few sports, few sports people. One person from the American War who was the guy who invented the"
00:41:04,00:41:11,"phrase, no taxation without, what's that one? No taxation, yeah. It was, he was killed by lightning."
00:41:11,00:41:16,"You're not a true believer in democracy, really, are you? What's the thing that we need for them to"
00:41:16,00:41:23,"tax us? I don't really give a shit. Yeah, so not unfortunately, yeah. That's a shame."
00:41:23,00:41:28,"Was that, so those were the most notable people on the list? There wasn't really anyone,"
00:41:28,00:41:33,"there was a few people from the, you know, from ancient times who were killed by lightning. Not"
00:41:33,00:41:37,"that many famous people are killed by lightning, it turns out. It feels like if the CIA had time"
00:41:37,00:41:44,"travel and this thing, they probably still wouldn't use it. Just think of the advantages of time"
00:41:44,00:41:48,"travel though. Like, I know it's impossible, but just think of all the advantages."
00:41:48,00:41:54,"Let's just do it. Wow, we're doing it. I can see, you know, anti-universal suffrage,"
00:41:54,00:41:59,"campaigner, politician, not liking the no taxation without representation. I think there's the"
00:41:59,00:42:04,"kernel of a conspiracy theory there that he was assassinated. Yeah, I was aiming for a conspiracy"
00:42:04,00:42:10,"theory and I was aiming a bit higher than this, to be honest. I was hoping that an actual, you know,"
00:42:10,00:42:16,"dictator from the Soviet times had died. Yeah, shame. They came up with some pretty wacky plans,"
00:42:16,00:42:23,"didn't they? Yeah. There was sort of a massive dump on all of us, which you might remember"
00:42:23,00:42:31,"in 2017. That's a strange weapon, isn't it? Yeah, a shit bomb. They just came onto me in"
00:42:31,00:42:35,"the street and said, ""Hold this wire."" And then before I knew it, I was covered in shit."
00:42:35,00:42:40,"In 2017, the CIA sort of dumped 13 million pages of documents on us by putting them online,"
00:42:40,00:42:45,"and that was 800,000 declassified files, which useful journalists went combed through"
00:42:45,00:42:51,"and found the insane plans they had. Like, I think it came out that they interviewed Yuri Geller."
00:42:51,00:42:57,"That's one of my favourites in the 1970s. They took an interest in spoonbender Yuri Geller,"
00:42:57,00:43:01,"and according to him when he was asked about it, he said they were afraid that there were people"
00:43:01,00:43:06,"like him in Russia who, I guess, would pose a threat by bending cutlery in the Soviet Union"
00:43:06,00:43:11,"somehow. And the way they tested Geller to test his skills was they shut him in a room,"
00:43:11,00:43:16,and then the CIA taped to the wall outside his room a picture of something. And the way they
00:43:16,00:43:20,"chose the picture was they opened a dictionary, they got a word, so they chose the word, for"
00:43:20,00:43:25,"instance, ""bunch."" And then they drew what first came to their mind, a bunch, and then they asked"
00:43:25,00:43:30,Yuri on the other side of the wall to draw what he sensed the picture was. Was that a bunch of grapes?
00:43:30,00:43:36,"Well, exactly. He drew 24 purple grapes. To be fair, there were 24,"
00:43:36,00:43:41,"so that's kind of impressive. But basically, the CIA's conclusion was he has demonstrated"
00:43:41,00:43:46,"his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner, which I would say he"
00:43:46,00:43:51,"hadn't. You hear about it, you think grapes. But they didn't, did they tell him the word ""bunch""?"
00:43:51,00:43:55,"Yeah, they said ""bunch."" Oh my goodness. They said, ""We've picked the word 'bunch' out of the"
00:43:55,00:44:01,"dictionary. Draw the first thing that comes to mind."" But he did draw 24 grapes, and they"
00:44:01,00:44:07,"had 24 grapes in their picture. Yeah, but I have to specify, they did this on him dozens of times,"
00:44:07,00:44:11,"and he only got a few of them right, and that was one of them. I would have drawn some flowers."
00:44:11,00:44:15,Yeah. A bunch of flowers. You know what? I deliberately went with grapes thinking it was
00:44:15,00:44:20,"the wrong answer as well, because I was thinking it would be flowers. James, you are the new Yuri"
00:44:20,00:44:25,"Geller. What's more impressive is if you say that you've picked the word ""Jiraffe"" and it's"
00:44:25,00:44:29,"actually a dump truck, and he draws a dump truck, that's, you know... Yeah, that's true."
00:44:29,00:44:32,That's when you know you've got someone dangerous on your hand.
00:44:32,00:44:37,"The most impressive thing that Yuri Geller did, and the most controversial, actually, was in Euro"
00:44:37,00:44:43,"'96. He was flying over Wembley Stadium in a helicopter, I think, and Gary McAllister was"
00:44:43,00:44:48,"taking a penalty for Scotland, which would have put them level with England in the game."
00:44:49,00:44:54,"And if you watch the video back, the ball moves about one inch just before he kicks the ball,"
00:44:54,00:44:58,"and he misses the penalty, and then Gaza goes up the other end and scores,"
00:44:58,00:45:03,and Yuri Geller claims that he made that ball move. No. But he doesn't claim it was the downdraft
00:45:03,00:45:08,of the helicopter. He says it was his magic powers. But I thought you were going to say
00:45:08,00:45:13,"he dropped a bent spoon on his head, which is slightly concussive. Weirdly, I read a thing"
00:45:13,00:45:19,"just this morning about Yuri Geller, which is that in 1974, he was a paternity suit, was filed"
00:45:19,00:45:24,"against him by a young mum in Sweden. She didn't claim that he was the dad. What she claimed was,"
00:45:24,00:45:30,"is that his magical bending powers had altered her contraception coil, and it became inoperable,"
00:45:30,00:45:34,"and she got pregnant as a result. And as a result, he should pay for that, because he's the sort of"
00:45:34,00:45:38,"pseudo father. Wow, that's a really difficult position to put him in, because on the one hand,"
00:45:38,00:45:44,"he really wants to admit to having those powers. Well, it was the same with the football thing,"
00:45:44,00:45:49,"because he wants to claim that he moved this football, but actually he had 11,000 hate letters"
00:45:49,00:45:55,"from Scottish people after the game, saying, how could you scupper our chances in the European"
00:45:55,00:46:02,"Championships? Wow. Hey, I read a really cool invention by the CIA, which was used. It's called"
00:46:02,00:46:10,the Skyhook. And the Skyhook was basically a way of extracting CIA operatives or anyone that was in
00:46:10,00:46:15,"need of help, who was involved in the military in some way, from a location without having to get"
00:46:15,00:46:21,"on the ground to pick them up. So what it was, is that they would drop a package over to where they"
00:46:21,00:46:26,"believed the operative was, and the opera, the package had a little description on it. And in"
00:46:26,00:46:32,"it, they had a helium balloon that would lift the cable 500 foot into the air. And then the operative"
00:46:32,00:46:36,would strap themselves to a harness that was connected to the other end of that cable that
00:46:36,00:46:42,went up with the balloon. And they would sit and wait until a very slow flying plane would fly to
00:46:42,00:46:49,where the helium balloon was. And it would hook its nose of the plane around the hook that had been
00:46:49,00:46:55,"sent up. And it would carry the guy off into the air and back to safety. That is so cool. I mean,"
00:46:55,00:46:59,"if you timed it right, you could say, just so you know, all this time, I've been working"
00:46:59,00:47:06,"for the CIA and then bang, if you get that even slightly wrong, then you're just immediately"
00:47:06,00:47:12,arrested. Yeah. Or if a lightning storm comes over and it attaches itself to the 500 foot wire.
00:47:12,00:47:17,He told us he was working for the CIA and then he just exploded. It's really weird.
00:47:17,00:47:22,"Yeah, I can see why they didn't go with that. All sorts of any of their mad plans."
00:47:22,00:47:27,"I wish someone one day had turned around at the CIA in sort of 1950,"
00:47:27,00:47:31,"just early on and said, you know, these crazy ideas we keep having that never come to fruition."
00:47:31,00:47:34,"You know, the ones that always work, they're the ones where we just shoot someone in the head."
00:47:34,00:47:36,Do that from now on.
00:47:36,00:47:43,There was a guy called Edward Geary Lansdale and he was with the CIA and he was requested
00:47:43,00:47:47,by the president of the Philippines to come over. There was a United States military assistance
00:47:47,00:47:53,"group to come up with ideas to fight the communist Hock Balahap, which was a regime that was threatening"
00:47:53,00:47:58,the Philippines at the time. And he came up with this idea of convincing them that there were
00:47:58,00:48:03,vampires out in the woods. And the way that he actually tried to convince them that this was
00:48:03,00:48:08,really happening is they captured an enemy soldier and they drained the blood from his body and left
00:48:08,00:48:13,him making it look as if he was trying to flee and got caught by one of these vampires. So when
00:48:13,00:48:17,"they found him, they believed the myth was real. It's bizarre. These little tricks."
00:48:17,00:48:23,"Who benefits from this? Well, I suppose if you've got an enemy believing that there's"
00:48:23,00:48:28,"something paranormal going on, as well as an enemy who are physically real,"
00:48:28,00:48:32,that just keeps you on edge. It keeps you psychologically all over the shop.
00:48:32,00:48:36,"Because do you remember that fact that you and I both found out about in Japan,"
00:48:36,00:48:40,they were going to capture some foxes and then paint them in luminous paints and then
00:48:40,00:48:45,release them into the Japanese countryside so that people would see these glowing foxes and
00:48:45,00:48:51,"think that they were some mysterious kind of apparition. Yeah, that's right. They would"
00:48:51,00:48:56,believe. And there was a thing where one was connected to some balloons. The idea was there's
00:48:56,00:49:03,"a floating fox guard. You just see the balloons, wouldn't you? Not at night. And you would just"
00:49:03,00:49:09,"see the illuminated figure of floating fox. And again, is the idea that you sort of make them"
00:49:09,00:49:13,all a bit edgy because there are these scary foxes around. Or that everyone thinks it's a
00:49:13,00:49:20,"Pokemon and Chase is after it. Again, there's just always, you know, Killjoy Barry in the"
00:49:20,00:49:23,"corner of the meeting there going, ""Guys, shall we just shoot them in the head again? I'm really"
00:49:23,00:49:30,"sorry. It's a great idea."" But one CIA agent, maybe the most surprising one I found out about"
00:49:30,00:49:37,"was the Dalai Lama. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the 1960s, his group was being given over a million dollars"
00:49:37,00:49:44,"a year by the CIA. And they did deny that the Dalai Lama was on a personal retainer of $180,000"
00:49:44,00:49:49,a year. His organization have denied that. But that's because the CIA were paying for
00:49:49,00:49:55,Getty operations against China when China invaded Tibet. And so the Dalai Lama was an important
00:49:55,00:50:00,part of that resistance. So we don't know what his kill total is. Yeah. That's a great series of
00:50:00,00:50:06,novels to be written. The secret CIA adventures of the Dalai Lama. But that's another one where
00:50:06,00:50:10,"Barry never gets what he wants. Because if you do shoot the Dalai Lama in the head, he just comes"
00:50:10,00:50:17,"back. That's so frustrating, isn't it? It's just a pointless assassination. He's on your side. You"
00:50:17,00:50:21,"wouldn't shoot your own agent. Maybe if you're playing a double bluff, maybe it's the Jason Bourne."
00:50:21,00:50:25,"But think of it, the Dalai Lama can get to anybody. There's no one going to refuse a"
00:50:25,00:50:30,"meeting with the Dalai Lama on security grounds. No, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. True. True. A lot of"
00:50:30,00:50:35,"the people in the CIA are just massive nerds, right? They're kind of our people. So like when"
00:50:35,00:50:41,"WikiLeaks exposed a load of stuff that the CIA was doing in its hacking program, we managed to see"
00:50:41,00:50:46,a lot of what the tools were called and what the programs were called. And they're all named after
00:50:46,00:50:52,memes or references to pop culture. There's one of them named after a World of Warcraft trading card.
00:50:52,00:50:57,"There's another one that's named after some characters from Talladega Nights, which is the"
00:50:57,00:51:02,Will Ferrell movie. And there was another document where a guy just listed a load of awesome tool
00:51:02,00:51:09,"names he wanted to use at some stage, including awesome McTool name and starving weasel. And"
00:51:09,00:51:14,"the second of those is a weird Aljankovic song. And they're just like, we've got to invent something"
00:51:14,00:51:20,so that we can give it this really nerdy name. Yeah. Yeah. Funny. Somewhere there's a dangerous
00:51:20,00:51:28,sniper CIA agent who's just heard James call him a nerd. What's that red dot that's just appeared
00:51:28,00:51:34,"on my head? Actually, that's a myth, isn't it about the red dot because lasers go in a straight"
00:51:34,00:51:39,"line, whereas bullets don't go in a straight line. So there's no point having a red dot aiming at"
00:51:39,00:51:44,someone's head because it's pointing straight from the gun. You need to be aiming slightly above the
00:51:44,00:51:48,"person's head if you're a sniper. So in the film, it should be there's a red dot slightly above you"
00:51:48,00:51:51,on the wall. Exactly. And that's when you know you're in danger. And if there's a red dot on
00:51:51,00:51:55,"your head, you think, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you don't. You think, oh, shit, they're going to shoot me in"
00:51:55,00:52:04,"the balls. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you"
