00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,440
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,400
 Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered around

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,200
 the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,720
 here we go, starting with fact number one and that's Anna. My fact this week is that in India

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,160
 you automatically get a government job if you qualify for the Olympics and if you win a medal

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,080
 you get a promotion. Wow, does the size of the promotion depend on the size of the medal,

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,280
 not the size of the medal, the material from which the medal is made?

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,840
 Yeah, you don't get sort of giant gold medals do you? It does, yeah, essentially. I think the

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
 level of promotion depends on how well you do generally and it's not just at the Olympics,

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
 it's in various other sporting competitions. So this is a system which seems to exist state to

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
 state, they have various different policies from one state to the next and it seems to also exist

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,000
 at a federal level and the truth is that to train to qualify for the Olympics is basically a full-time

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,160
 job and a lot of people can't afford to take time out of work, like where do you find the money

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,520
 to support that? The athlete's diet can be very expensive and so the way the Indian government

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,920
 and state governments encourage their citizens to get sporty is to give them government jobs,

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
 which is like monthly salary, you can't be fired, you get medical care, you get a pension,

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
 but they do actually have to turn up to work. So there's... I have a question. Yeah, go on.

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,960
 Are the government jobs you get related to the sport that you do? So if you're a really good

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,680
 high jumper, do they sometimes give you a job like turning on light switches on very big walls?

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
 Oh, yeah, those really high light switches that are purposely beyond normal humidity.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,280
 I guess the reason they put them there in the first place is because they were installed by

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,880
 high jumpers. Exactly, yeah, it's a vicious circle, it's the whole thing. Is it like that?

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,440
 It's not, though, is it? No, it is the answer. It's exactly like that, yeah, it's a very good

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,600
 question. They almost all work for the railways, don't they? Are a lot of them. Yeah, police force

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,120
 as well. The biggest employers are the railway, the police force, the army, but various government

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,640
 departments. So there's an air rifle world record holder called suma shiro and she got a job on

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,120
 the railway, for instance, and she had to turn up to work sort of. No, I don't think every day,

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
 but quite regularly and just did data entry and literally sitting at a computer doing data entry

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
 in order to claim her government salary. Well, did she do it from a computer which was 10 meters

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
 away from her because she's so good at air rifle? Well, she was shooting it. Like she has to shoot

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,200
 each key. There was an old game called duck hunts which came out before any of you guys were born,

34
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,560
 which probably would be quite useful for that. Exactly. Yeah, that's how she trained. I think

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,400
 I stretched this beyond the point. But it seems like in some cases that it's the other way round,

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,040
 they became athletes and tried to get into competitions just to secure a lifetime government

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,960
 job. Wow. So because you get, as Anna said, the pensions, you get medical, you get lifetime job

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,840
 basically. But surely that would be easier to just get the job than becoming an elite athlete,

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
 considering how difficult it is to become an, you know, you have to get to the Olympics. That's

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,680
 pretty hard. It must be easier. Some people are very bad at data entry, James, but naturally quite

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,600
 fit. It's amazing how badly India does at the Olympics relative to the population size. So

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,520
 they've won 28 medals total at the Olympics, which is the same as Michael Phelps has won.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,000
 Wow. Now, it's obviously Michael Phelps is very, very good at the Olympics, but India has roughly

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,960
 a billion people. And in 2008, they won one medal per 383 million of their population.

45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,200
 So that's a low hit rate, basically. That's what people say, isn't it? Like it's not really fair

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,200
 the Olympics because, you know, you might say, well, it's not fair that, you know, some countries

47
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,200
 in the Eastern Bloc might have used drugs or whatever. But also it's not really fair that

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,000
 the rich countries just get to do way better because we have way better diets, we have better

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,520
 facilities, we have better everything in the Western world. So yeah, it's pretty hard to be

50
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,120
 just a lowly born Indian person and get into the Olympics. And that's a huge amount of the population

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,320
 are basically excluded because of, for financial reasons, from even ever having this as an option

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,880
 in their life. So it's not really a billion people who are, you know, in the pool to be selected.

53
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,960
 But they do, there's a stat that I read in an article talking about this, where they say that

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,920
 there's more than 100 billionaires in India. That's a lot of billionaires, which mean there

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,240
 must be a lot of millionaires, which must mean there must be a middle class that is good at

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,120
 sport and have the facilities and have the training. That's true. They just don't do it for some reason.

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,040
 Well, there's a saying, there's a popular Hindi saying, and this is the translation of it. It's

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,280
 "If you study hard, you will live like a king. But if you play sports, you will ruin your life."

59
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
 So it might be a cultural thing as well.

60
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,800
 I think there's a bit of a disadvantage as well to the people who have grown up wanting to work

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,000
 and get high up in the railway services. You know, imagine you're like, I want to kick ass and be

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,640
 at the height of this job. And then you've suddenly got this Olympian who's won a silver medal,

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,680
 getting promoted over you, because that's part of the... Like there's a guy called Sandeep Sejwal,

64
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,080
 who he competed in Breaststroke at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. And he's never been to the office

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,520
 because he's always training, but he's got this full-time job. And he says, "If you swim continuously

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
 and win a medal at the Nationals, or just represent the Indian Railways at the National

67
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,200
 level, you can get promoted. So I'm going to file for a promotion. Hopefully I get it,

68
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,680
 and then I'll be the boss." He might be the boss of some guy who's worked his whole life to get

69
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,360
 up the railway. It's mad. The system's crazy. I think we'll know when the Indian, entire Indian

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,120
 railway infrastructure falls apart. It's because of this Breaststroke professional who's risen to

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,400
 the top and ruined it. But it's good for the state departments, because what they get in return is

72
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,320
 PR, right? So it's sort of seen as them representing the police, or the army, or the railways when

73
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,000
 they go and compete. That's what they get in return. Also, the Indian Railway competes in

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,520
 national championships of things. So you might have American colleges competing, or at least

75
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,680
 on a semi-professional level they play. But the Indian Railway has teams that are in all of these

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,600
 different spots. So it does give them, like Anna says, a lot of good PR. Have you guys heard

77
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,440
 of Abhinav Bindra? No. He's great. He is an air rifle champ. India is actually really good at

78
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,040
 the air rifle for some reason that countries just have to think that they're really good at.

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,080
 So when he won, his training was amazing for it. So he ordered 10,000 specially Chinese-made

80
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,840
 air rifle pellets, right? And he weighed every single one of them on the super sensitive scale,

81
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,240
 and he looked at each one under a magnifying glass. And if there was any irregularity in it,

82
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,480
 it went in the bin. Wow. You see, that's where the admin skills come in, isn't it?

83
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,160
 Right. That's data rendering. He's got a spreadsheet with 10,000 pellets in it.

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,920
 He, Abhinav Bindra, is India's only gold medallist, isn't he? He's the only individual to win a gold

85
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,800
 medal. An individual, right. Yeah. So they won, basically, India's won a very large number of

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,760
 gold medals in hockey. To be fair to them, they did really dominate. 1920 to 1980, they won 11

87
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,000
 medals in 12 Olympics in hockey, and eight of them were gold. And the highlight was 1948,

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
 and this really must have felt good, 1948. So immediately after independence for India,

89
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,040
 when the final or the silver gold, you know, showdown over the Olympic works, was against

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,080
 Britain, and they beat Britain 4-0. That must have been fun. Well, they had that golden period

91
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,520
 where they were winning golds. It was 1928, 1932, 1936. They won the golds, and they had this one

92
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,680
 amazing guy called Richard Allen, who was the goalkeeper for the team. And in that time,

93
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,240
 in those three Olympics, he only conceded three goals. One of them was in 1932, when they were

94
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:28,240
 playing in LA, they beat America, they beat the USA 24-1. And the only reason they scored the goal

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,520
 was because Richard Allen was off field, signing autographs for Fads. No. He just sort of went

96
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,000
 off to site. Yeah, and that's the only time that they got a goal. I would say that's bad goalkeeping.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 That's amazing. At the 1948 one, the hockey team, when they won, would have got their gold medals,

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,480
 but no ribbons, because this was the austerity Olympics. So this was held in Britain and was,

99
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,920
 you know, rationing was still happening. Everyone was bit poor. There was that whole war thing that

100
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,560
 just happened. And so as the austerity Olympics, medals were given without ribbons. I can't believe

101
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
 that they made the saving on the ribbon. I can't believe they looked at the big gold medal and

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:12,320
 ribbon. But you can't just give people a ribbon. So this rule in India, they've changed it slightly

103
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,400
 this year. So there's more sports that you can do, which will allow you to get your government job.

104
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:26,480
 So if you are in the tug of war, you can get it now. If you play roll ball, or if you play Malakamb,

105
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,920
 so those are the three main new sports that have come in. Two of them are traditional,

106
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
 well, two of them are Indian sports. Roll ball isn't traditional Indian. That was invented quite

107
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,200
 recently. And that's kind of, it's like basketball on roller skates. And Malakamb is a traditional

108
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,600
 Indian sport. And there was a Malakamb team who have already got Olympic medals. So Malakamb is

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,920
 a sport where you get a big, huge pole and you have to balance on top of it while doing yoga moves.

110
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,000
 Okay. So this is a really awesome sport in India. And in 1936, there was a Malakamba group who went

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,600
 to Germany and they showed off their skills. And Adolf Hitler was so impressed that he gave them

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:15,760
 all Olympic medals. Wow. I read a tiny bit about Malakamb. Is it true that the pole in Malakamb

113
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,560
 represents the phallus of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god? And did Hitler know that when he

114
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,600
 gave out these medals? I think probably. Yeah. I do know you have to lubricate it before you get on

115
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,400
 it. So you don't get any wood burns. Wow. That's fair. But a lubricated pole would not be a very

116
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:43,440
 stable slip, wouldn't you? That's the sport, Dan. Yeah. Right. There's a different levels of

117
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,200
 lubrications, I suppose. You can have like just covered in butter or you can have it just slightly

118
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,520
 smooth so you don't like get any splinters. And I think it's closer to the second one.

119
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,440
 Is it? Are they doing the yoga moves on top of the pole? Yeah, they're kind of balancing. So I

120
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,240
 imagine a yoga move where you're on one foot and then your other foot is kind of wrapped around your

121
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
 head or something. Well, you're doing that, but your foot on the ground isn't on the ground. It's

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,640
 on top of a massive pole. And is there, on the top of the pole, is there a little platform you

123
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,680
 can squeeze your foot on? Or is it just the end of a pole? It's the end of a pole. But it's kind of...

124
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,800
 That's very difficult. Well, that's the least sport for you.

125
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:28,560
 Again, I think probably easier to just do the exam to get into the government job.

126
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,760
 I'll stick to data entry. It feels like it's a time with the pole vault that they should be able

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 to do. As in you start doing the pole vault, but of the way on when you get right to the top, you

128
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,680
 just stay there. Oh, you're downward dogged. Yeah. That occasionally does happen with pole vault,

129
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,480
 where they kind of get to the top and they run out of momentum. And they almost... It looks like

130
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
 they're just going to stay there. And then what happens is the weight of the person kind of bends

131
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
 the pole down and they get sprung off like a cartoon. That does happen on occasions.

132
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,600
 They never get stuck at the top. That's funny. Eventually, the Olympics just goes home.

133
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,760
 Okay, it's time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the photo of

134
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,400
 the Wright Brothers first flight was taken by a man who had never used a camera before.

135
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,800
 So we're lucky it's not just a picture of someone's feet.

136
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,400
 Lucky he didn't have it on selfie mode or something.

137
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,960
 It's his first ever photo.

138
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,680
 His first ever photo? I read that he'd never seen a camera before.

139
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,920
 Yeah, exactly. Like every... Imagine the day for that guy, he's seeing a camera,

140
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,200
 he's seeing a photo, a plane's flying. This is a big day. This is magic. Yeah. So this is a guy

141
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,320
 called John T. Daniels. And he was working at the life-saving station at Kill Devil's Hill,

142
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,720
 which is where the first flight took place on December 17th, 1903. And he was positioned with

143
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
 the camera by the Wright Brothers, who were obsessed with cameras. They told him everything

144
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,240
 he needed to do. And there's really a lot of risk when you think about it as well, because

145
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
 they needed to position the camera at a place where they believed the plane was going to take

146
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,760
 off, having never took off before on a plane. They needed to tell him the exact moment for him to

147
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,240
 press this button that would allow them to capture the perfect shot. And they were giving it to a

148
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,200
 man who, as we said, not only had not seen a camera before, but was about to witness flight,

149
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,400
 man-powered flight. And so there was a genuine moment where he almost forgot to press it,

150
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,720
 because he was so in awe of the historical thing that he was seeing. And at the last second kind

151
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,000
 of shook himself and took the photo. And by some insane magic, we have the perfect shot. It

152
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,880
 developed perfectly. It caught it perfectly in flight. And it's an amazing photo.

153
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,680
 It's a cool thing to reflect. Actually, when you look at that picture, which I guess people have

154
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,400
 probably seen before, to think how unlikely that was. So that was actually going to work. I mean,

155
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,000
 how did they pick the exact spot? Because you can't swivel it around, can you?

156
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
 Exactly. I don't think they had a turn. Even if they did, the guy wouldn't have known what to do.

157
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,840
 And from the account of it, he was also that day involved in the first-ever plane crash.

158
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,120
 Because after they landed it, after their flight, it blew away. Because it was a

159
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
 really light. It was basically a glider with a little bit of an engine. And he got tangled up in

160
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,200
 it. He tried to grab it as it blew away, just tried to stop it from blowing away. And he got

161
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,720
 sort of caught up in it and had to be helped out. And he was injured.

162
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,960
 Yeah. When he flipped over, he was holding onto a strut. And all the others let go, but he desperately

163
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,000
 didn't want this thing to break. And so he flipped over with it. And he was a bit mangled, but he was

164
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,200
 fine. But they let him keep the strut that he was holding onto, which he kept forever for the rest

165
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,680
 of his life. And he would carry it round with him. And every time he told this story, this amazing

166
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,160
 story of being the first person to be in a plane crash, he would take out a pen knife.

167
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,840
 And as he was telling it, he would shave off a little bit of the strut and he would give it to

168
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,080
 the person he was telling the story to. Yeah. You've got to limit the number of times you

169
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,240
 tell that story. Towards the end of your life. I'm really sorry. I can't tell it today. I've

170
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,400
 just got a bit of sawdust left, to be honest. Oh, just find another piece of wood.

171
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,640
 Exactly. It must be like the crucifixion, you know, the true cross.

172
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,320
 Yeah, relics. There's a billion Wright brothers planes worth of strut shavings out there now.

173
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,760
 But you say so, he thought he was witnessing this incredible historic moment,

174
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,680
 which he did. And I think there were sort of four or five people there who did think that.

175
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,160
 But I hadn't quite realized that the rest of the world, A thought it was nothing,

176
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,760
 what happened, and B didn't believe it. So they were completely ignored by the press for five years

177
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,920
 after 1903, that first flight. Newspapers and journalists just didn't believe them. They told

178
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,320
 newspapers on the day that this is what they were trying to do. And they basically thought these

179
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,080
 guys were crazy crackpots. It's such a slam to say not only did nothing happen, we don't even

180
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:06,160
 believe that nothing happened. I know. I know. Quite nicely, the only paper that did report on them

181
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,240
 in that on that first day was a paper called the Virginia pilot by chance. But the way they got the

182
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,600
 story was the Wright brothers once they'd achieved flight, they telegraphed their families to be like,

183
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,720
 "Hey, mum, hey dad, we've flown." And so the telegraph operator said, "Oh, couldn't help but

184
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,400
 notice that message you just let me give you a mum and dad. Do you mind if I tell the press?"

185
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,560
 And they said, "No, don't want you to tell the press because they wanted the press in Ohio where

186
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,520
 they were from to get the story first." And the telegraph operator ignored that, told the Virginia

187
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,480
 pilot, but Virginia pilot knew nothing about it. So they completely made up what had happened.

188
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,000
 And so they had them flying for sort of three miles. You know, I think we've said before,

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,240
 they only flew for about 100 feet, 120 feet. They were like, they flew for three miles. They

190
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,000
 were 60 foot in the air when actually they were 12 foot above the ground or something.

191
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,440
 They said Wilbur was flying the plane when it was Orville. And so the first account of the

192
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,600
 Wright brothers flight was total fiction from the Virginia pilot. I thought it was in a B magazine

193
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,760
 that they were first reported in. It was Gleanings and B culture. So that I think those are the

194
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,920
 later, because they kept flying. I don't know if you guys know that, but they actually did more

195
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 flights after their first ones. I'd say quit while you're ahead.

196
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,480
 But they were doing these flights. Oh, where exactly was it? I can't remember if it was

197
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,240
 still a killed one. In Dayton, though. In Dayton. Okay, yeah. And this was in 1904 and 1905 when

198
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,320
 they were making flights up to 40 minutes long and nobody paid any attention. It was amazing.

199
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,680
 I mean, it doesn't. But this guy, Amos Ives Root, he had kind of heard about it and he saw them flying

200
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,000
 because they were out in the sticks. They weren't near a major population centre.

201
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
 And he wrote to Scientific American and Scientific American didn't reply.

202
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,400
 So he wrote it in Gleanings and B culture along articles, which are things like

203
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,640
 beekeeping in the Southwest and midwinter flights of cellar bees. And it's just mixed in with that.

204
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,680
 Do you think they got complaint letters from bee fans saying, I couldn't really see what

205
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,440
 relevance your article about the first ever powered flight had? Amos Ives Root was so cool.

206
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,200
 So he owned the first ever bicycle in Ohio. That makes him cool.

207
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,720
 Definitely. Yeah, he was friends with them, wasn't he? And he had, I think he just had his own kind

208
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,400
 of comment page in Gleanings and B culture where he was allowed to write about whatever he wanted,

209
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,240
 even if it wasn't about bees. That's so cool. The first lot, what was the hill called, Dan?

210
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,760
 It was called Kill Devil Hill. So Kill Devil Hill. And that was in Kitty Hawk, wasn't it?

211
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,040
 That's where they did it. And the reason that they went there is Wilbur. Well, when you're flying,

212
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,000
 you need like some wind coming straight towards you. It helps you to take off right.

213
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,120
 And he wanted to find out where the best place in the US to go for that was. So he wrote to the

214
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,880
 US Weather Bureau who sent him data on the wind velocity in more than 100 places around America.

215
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
 And he settled on this place where he knew there was a hill. He knew that they had really good,

216
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,480
 steady wind always coming in their favor. And then he went to Kitty Hawk because it was just

217
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
 like a bit of nothing kind of marsh, not marsh ground, but kind of wilderness ground. There

218
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,120
 was nothing there. There was like 50 households. They were all descended from sailors who'd been

219
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,600
 shipwrecked there over the years. So they were all like it was like a sailing community.

220
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,080
 And the richest person that lived in that town was a guy called Doc Cogswell. And he was the

221
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:40,240
 richest because his brother owed him $15,000. That's the worst kind of wealth. I'm broke,

222
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,280
 but I'm owed it. It sounds miserable when their conditions, when they were living there, because

223
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,480
 they had to dig for water. They had to catch their own fish. One of them said that there

224
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,240
 were so many mosquitoes, they almost darkened the sun. I know, it just sounds like really

225
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
 unpleasant living conditions, but they went out there for weeks and weeks on end.

226
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,640
 Yeah, only it's got such an ominous name. If I were trying to fly for the first time ever,

227
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,800
 I would ask not to fly on a place called Kill Devil. I don't want either of those words

228
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,320
 in the place I'm attempting to fly.

229
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,480
 And it was a thing that people not only didn't believe it, but they didn't think it was possible

230
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,520
 that we could fly. And there's a few, you got some famous quotes from that period before they

231
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,760
 went up of people saying this will never happen. There was one bishop who was asked if he thought

232
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,320
 that flying would ever happen. And he said, what a nonsensical idea, flight is reserved for the

233
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,680
 birds and the angels. And that bishop was called Bishop Wright. And that was the father of the

234
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,800
 brothers. Yeah, he absolutely thought there was no way. And once they did it, and after the years

235
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,520
 of them doing it, he actually loved it. He used to go up with the brothers separately. He had a

236
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,000
 rule they couldn't fly together. He didn't want to lose them both in a crash, but he would fly

237
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,400
 with one of them and he'd go higher, higher, get me higher. I think he went up just once, didn't

238
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,160
 he? It was the one day he allowed the brothers to fly together in 1910. It was that day when he

239
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,720
 did that. They didn't all go up in the same plane though, because that would have been really

240
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:22,320
 all eggs in one basket. You just got mum left. Not the bishop. But it wouldn't have been just mum

241
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,920
 left because there were two other Wright brothers. And the Wright sister. Yes, they had more weird

242
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,920
 names. The other brothers were called Ruchlin, Reuchlin and Lauren. And they just worked as

243
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,000
 bookkeepers and they appear to have had no interest in flight. Whereas the Wright sister

244
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,120
 is the reason that we kind of accept the Wright brothers as the first flyers today because

245
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,480
 the Smithsonian, they thought that the first person to fly was a guy called Samuel Langley,

246
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,960
 which he did in 1903, nine days before the Wright brothers. But what he actually did was fly his

247
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,720
 plane for about maybe about half a meter before it smashed straight into a lake or something.

248
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,640
 But they said they didn't believe the Wright brothers at all. And so they decided that this

249
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,360
 guy Langley was the first person. But then for years and years, Catherine Wright, who was the

250
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,680
 sister, it was her life's job to try and make sure that people believed that the Wright brothers

251
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,880
 were the first people to do it. And she was super famous in her day. Wasn't she Catherine Wright?

252
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,640
 Yeah, it was pretty much the three of them who were equally famous, it seemed, because the Wright

253
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,400
 brothers were bad with the press. I think they were not good media personalities. They were very

254
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,920
 shy, whereas Catherine Wright was very gregarious. And so she was like the front facing Wright.

255
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,160
 And so she met the King of Spain and the Prince of Prussia and spoke with them at events.

256
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,520
 She got the French lesion donner, which they gave the Wright brothers and Catherine at the

257
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,760
 same time, the highest order of merit you can get in France. And yeah, she was great.

258
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,960
 And she was the first woman ever to attend the Aero Club de France, because basically when they

259
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
 went to France, which was when they became massive really, because in America, they were kind of

260
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,640
 ignored, especially they tried to sell the plane to the military and the military just

261
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,040
 weren't having it. So they said, fuck, it will go to France instead. But the French, they love kind

262
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,920
 of aerospace. They loved the balloons. They loved their new gliders, things like that. And so when

263
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,880
 they saw the Wright brothers, they absolutely loved it. And Catherine was the main face for that.

264
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,720
 Very cool. She had kind of a sad end. So they were incredibly close. And they seemed to have had a

265
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,640
 pact, Wilbur, Orville and Catherine, that none of them would ever marry. I think we think that's

266
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,720
 what happened. And they made this pact very, very early on. And she stuck to it. She was incredibly

267
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,600
 close to Orville. So Wilbur died in 1912, I think, but Orville, a long time, very close to him. But

268
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,760
 eventually, 1926, age 51, she decided she wanted to marry her childhood sweetheart. And Orville

269
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,960
 completely stopped speaking to her. That is mean. That is harsh. Very harsh. Childhood sweetheart.

270
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,400
 If you've waited about 45 years to marry someone. It is harsh because they seem to have had that

271
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
 pact where none of them will marry. But for Orville and Wilbur, it seemed to be quite an easy thing

272
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,440
 to keep. Because they were particularly good with the press, but they just weren't good in social

273
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,920
 situations at all. Were they? Whereas like Catherine, she was just everywhere. She was...

274
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,160
 So were the two brothers just not sort of romantic people at all? And they've got this mega babe

275
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,680
 sister. But they keep saying, no, no, no, we made a pact when we were all nine. Nobody will ever

276
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,280
 get married. The brothers, they lived together, worked together, ate together. And they even

277
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,640
 shared a joint bank account, Orville and Wilbur. Really? So yeah, it was kind of easy. And then

278
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,440
 Catherine went on to become a suffragist, didn't she? And also the vicar went on the march with her.

279
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,640
 Not the vicar. What was he called? The bishop. The bishop. Yeah, the bishop, sorry. And the bishop

280
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,160
 went on the march with her. So he kind of... And that was when he was in his 80s. So he was kind

281
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,960
 of like joining in with all of the kids stuff when he got a bit older. That's really fun.

282
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,120
 He really embraces kids hobbies. What an amazing 80s he must have had just being a bishop your whole

283
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,160
 life. And then you get to go on a plane, you get to go on a march. That's really cool. That thing

284
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,840
 about how they only became successful when they got to Paris. So in Paris, Wilbur was the one who

285
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,240
 went to Paris and Orville stayed in the USA. And Wilbur was a bit more of a showman. He was

286
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,600
 better with the press than Orville really was quite reclusive and shy. Wilbur was put up in the

287
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,640
 Hotel Maurice. Have you heard of this place? No. Oh my God, it's amazing. I got in a complete

288
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,400
 distraction about this amazing hotel he was put up in. So it's very, very classy. He still exists

289
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:36,160
 today. The lift was a copy of Mary Antoinette's sedan chair. That's how sort of lush this hotel was.

290
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,720
 Everyone has stayed there. Awesome Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Picasso's wedding meal was there.

291
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,240
 Salvador Dali stayed for one month every year. And he once ordered a flock of sheep to be delivered

292
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:54,320
 to his room so he could fire his pistol at them. Blanks, it was blanks. Even so, if I were at the

293
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,200
 hotel reception and someone asked for that and told me why they wanted it, I think I wouldn't do it.

294
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
 I'd at least call my manager and say I'm not comfortable doing this. He might have asked,

295
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,960
 he might have given you the other task, which was he asked staff to go to the Toulierie Garden and

296
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:16,000
 catch flies for him for five francs per fly. When I used to work in a hotel, they used to say to you

297
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,120
 you have to say yes to everything, basically. Unless it's illegal or immoral or whatever,

298
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,800
 if they ask you for something, you always immediately have to say, yes, I can do that,

299
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,480
 but it might cost a lot of money. You know, you have to agree to everything.

300
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,280
 Wow. And just hope Dali doesn't check in.

301
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,320
 Oh, you see the handlebar mustache coming around the corner. Oh, here we go, okay.

302
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
 Just quick, hide the clocks.

303
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,280
 There's one other thing about this hotel, which is that it's where the decision was made not to

304
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:52,000
 blow up Paris. So in the war, Hitler really kind of went off the deep end towards the end, I would

305
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,920
 say. And he, as the retreat was being sounded, he ordered lots of key bits of Paris, you know,

306
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,840
 the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the bridges over the Seine. He ordered them to be wired up with explosives,

307
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:10,320
 which they were. And General von Choltitz or Koltitz was in the hotel. And it's there that

308
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,480
 he made the decision. He was either persuaded, we think there are various different versions of

309
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,440
 events, or he was trying to save his own skin. And that's the hotel where he said, actually,

310
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,600
 maybe there's a lot. Let's not blow up the most beautiful city in Europe. Let's just leave.

311
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,200
 That is interesting. But there is one other thing about the Hotel Maurice that you might be

312
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,640
 interested in, Andy, because we have mentioned it before quite recently. And that is because they

313
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:43,440
 had 148 pneumatic clocks in the hotel, one in each room that were attached to that air system in Paris.

314
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,280
 Of course. Oh, I'd forgotten that. That's so cool. Of course they did.

315
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,360
 I really hope that when Darlie did room service, he would save the crazy request

316
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,200
 right to the edge so that the person would think they were getting away with it.

317
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000
 What can I get you, Mr. Darlie? It's just eggs Benedict this morning.

318
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,920
 An orange juice, please. And is that it? One more thing. 7000 sheep.

319
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,080
 And a gun.

320
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:20,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

321
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that on the French island of Ile-de-Raye, the donkeys wear trousers.

322
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,920
 Sounds like the start of a kid's book, doesn't it?

323
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,200
 Do they wear V trousers? What do you mean? Like, do they wear the trousers?

324
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,080
 Oh, I see. As in are they in charge? Well, I would say with a donkey, basically the donkey always

325
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,760
 wears the trousers, don't they? They don't do what you tell them to. Very wise. Not really.

326
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:54,480
 These are originally working donkeys on this island. They used to work in the salt marshes,

327
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,840
 and in the salt marshes, there are lots of mosquitoes, maybe not enough to block out the sun,

328
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,600
 but there's definitely a lot of them. And so to stop their legs from getting bitten,

329
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,920
 these particular donkeys, their owners would put little kind of trousers on, and they look a bit

330
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,240
 like, you know, really old fashioned pajama bottoms, which they would tie around the bottom part of

331
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,880
 their legs, and their butt is still exposed. So it's like pajama bottoms with a flap allowing

332
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,760
 your buttocks to kind of hang out. And so these days, they still wear the trousers, even though

333
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,440
 they don't work in the salt marshes, but they just give rides to children around the local park,

334
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,520
 which no matter what you think about donkeys giving children rides, whether that's fair play or not,

335
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
 definitely better than working in the salt marshes. Donkeys around the world, they do seem to have a

336
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,480
 very two track career path. Either it's horrible backbreaking work, and they get really mistreated

337
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,880
 all over the world, or it's working at the seaside, taking the children out for a bit.

338
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,600
 They are quite, these ones are amazingly big, aren't they? Before you start feeling too sorry

339
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,280
 for them having children on their back, I didn't realise a donkey could even qualify as a donkey

340
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:08,320
 at this size. So the Baudet de Poitou is what they're called, I think. There can be 16 hands,

341
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,600
 which is, that's like a big horse. That's a horse that you feel really high up when you're sitting

342
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,200
 on it. 16 hands is a big horse. I think I might have met some of these donkeys. Because they have

343
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
 them in the New Forest. Do they? Yeah, they do. They have a few of them in the New Forest. Was it

344
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,320
 really fluffy? Like they're quite fluffy. They've got long shaggy hair, like a shaggy. It was very

345
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,360
 shaggy. We met one right up close, although it wasn't 16 hands high, so maybe it was a younger one.

346
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,680
 And presumably without the trousers on. It had no trousers on. Not by the time.

347
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:47,600
 No, don't go there. That's really cool, because they're very rare. You've seen an endangered

348
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,240
 species there. I may have just seen a normal donkey. I already regret. You may have seen a sheep.

349
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,600
 It's possible. But they're less rare than they used to be, aren't they?

350
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,120
 Yeah. They went really, really rare in the 70s and 80s, so much so that there were only a dozen

351
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,760
 or so of them left that could reproduce. But now, thanks to some kind of bits of conservation,

352
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,560
 there's a lot more of them in France, and they're starting to send them to other places like the

353
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,000
 New Forest, I assume. New Forest, yeah. I think there's about a thousand, isn't there? Maybe just

354
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,240
 under a thousand in the world. And you should look them up. They do look bizarre. They look a bit like,

355
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,800
 you know, if you have an old English sheepdog, the really shaggy dogs, but they've got quite

356
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,440
 a responsible owner who doesn't look after their coat, and it really dreadlocks. It's like that,

357
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,680
 isn't it? They've got long dreadlocks. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What would you replace a donkey with on a

358
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:48,880
 beach if you had to? I reckon like maybe seven ducks, and they have like a little carriage

359
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,960
 underneath them that the child can sit in and then fly around. You know, I'm thinking Wright

360
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,120
 brother's the kind of flight as a feature. I mean, that is nice. I'd go to that beach. That was

361
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,920
 dangerous. Health and safety is never going to pass. Sorry, Grant. In 2016, Tall Bay Council

362
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,880
 replaced their donkeys with three small trampolines, and there was outrage. Because it wasn't as much

363
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,640
 fun. They said this is just not as good for children. All for the donkeys. The donkey keepers were

364
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,600
 furious. Do the kids have to haul the trampolines along the beach then? And if you want a ride

365
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,160
 along the beach, the trampoline's not going to cut it. Yeah, you could jump from one to the other,

366
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,600
 but I think there are only three small trampolines. It's quite a short ride.

367
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,520
 It's a quick ride, yeah. It's not getting far. In Iceland, when I went to Iceland,

368
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,200
 every small town has like a massive trampoline in the middle of it. It's so weird. Yeah. It's

369
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,240
 like, you know how in most, in like towns, you might have a park that kids play on with swings

370
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,920
 and slides and stuff. In Iceland, they just had these massive kind of plastic kind of

371
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,640
 tarpaulin things that appeared to be filled with air. I don't know what they were filled with,

372
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,160
 because I never jumped on them much to my shame. But they were like, yeah,

373
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,600
 just everywhere you went, it seemed like kids could play on these bouncy things like bouncy

374
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,320
 castles. So a bouncy castle, right? James, is it true? I think I've read that they were initially

375
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,400
 for defense as in you'd have to have someone guarding constantly jumping up and down,

376
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:13,440
 landing out for an invading army. Yeah. I was, you know what? At the start of that sentence,

377
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,000
 I genuinely thought that you were about to say something real. I saw you going along with it.

378
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:28,640
 So donkeys, eh? Donkeys. Donkeys are cool. The word donkey used to rhyme with monkey.

379
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,120
 Monkey. Donkey. It used to be donkey. Yeah. Nice. And it didn't really exist until the start of the

380
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,960
 17th century. You would always say ass or ass instead of donkey. So in Shakespeare, there won't

381
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,440
 be any donkeys. There'll all be asses. And in the King James Bible. Was it because that was,

382
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,520
 it was also rude and an insult that they kind of borderized it? There is one thought that that's

383
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:56,560
 it. The word probably comes from done meaning brown or gray. But I think that's why that the word

384
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,040
 donkey became more commonly known is because of the association with bums. Like rooster,

385
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,120
 because in America, they didn't want to say cock. So they said rooster instead or man chicken.

386
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,280
 Man chicken sounds more rude, I think. Yeah. So the donkeys, donkeys in the UK,

387
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,640
 they are big on the beaches, obviously. There are still lots of donkey rides.

388
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:26,080
 So you know the donkey sanctuary, that's the one of the major donkey charities in the UK.

389
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:33,440
 And they have, I'm going to say secret agents who travel around the UK checking up on donkey abuse

390
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,280
 and making sure that they're not being badly treated or that their backs aren't being strained

391
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,160
 at the beach. And they can turn up and they can, I think they have the power of,

392
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,560
 they don't have the power of arrest, but they don't have the powers to take your donkeys away.

393
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,040
 So is that if you're doing donkey rides on the beach and someone who looks suspiciously

394
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,840
 like an adult but is dressing up as a child and claiming they want a donkey ride turns up,

395
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,720
 but has sort of a notepad they're trying to hide, that's probably your guy. So they go undercover.

396
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,160
 They're like, I think they do go undercover because if they phone ahead and say,

397
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,960
 I'm bringing from the donkey police, then you'll just get out the nice donkey. Whereas if you,

398
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,120
 if they turn up incognito, they see you've got your ratty old donkey and you're beating it,

399
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,520
 then they'll intervene. Yeah. Wow. Good. Doing great work. It might be quite fun to be a donkey

400
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,920
 in the US. If you're specifically, if you're pack borough racing in Colorado, which is a

401
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,200
 sort of ancient historic Colorado sport and it's, it's in honor of miners who used to go gold mining

402
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,880
 with donkeys. And the rule with pack borough racing is that a donkey can't carry a person,

403
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,720
 but a person can carry a donkey needs be in it. And you basically have to run along with your

404
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,720
 donkey. Right. Okay. Is it one man, one donkey in the one man on donkey. Okay. How often does

405
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,320
 anyone actually carry the donkey though? Cause they're pretty heavy. They're heavy. I did,

406
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,720
 I was reading one person's account of his pack borough race where he should have carried the

407
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,280
 donkey and didn't. So I think they must be too heavy. This is a guy called Curtis Emory,

408
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,640
 who's a veteran borough racer. And he was near, really near the end of a 15 mile race. And suddenly

409
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,920
 his donkey called Jackson had to cross a wooden bridge. And as donkeys I want to do, he'd cross

410
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,120
 the bridge countless times before suddenly stopped, like not doing that. Stubborn. And he,

411
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,560
 and right at the end of the race, and he had to tie Jackson to the bridge, walk into town and return

412
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,920
 with a winch equipped Jeep to pull the donkey over the bridge at which point. I don't think he'd

413
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,960
 won the race anymore. That's amazing. But yeah, they do, they do freeze donkeys. That's the weird

414
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,440
 thing about them. I hadn't probably realized that's what they're doing. Like horses, if you scare them,

415
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,400
 bolt, a donkey goes stock still, turns to stone. Yeah. Right. Well, this is why people think that

416
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,520
 they are stubborn. And this is some, some study done by the donkey sanctuary in the UK, which is

417
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,560
 about people's perception of the donkey, which incidentally found their Britain's second favourite

418
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:07,440
 farm animal. Pretty good. Can we guess the favourite? After cow. Got to be sheep. No one's, no one's said

419
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,480
 the right answer yet. Chicken. Man chicken. No, Anna's got it right. It's a horse. It's a horse.

420
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
 Everyone loves a horse. Anyway, sorry, that's completely irrelevant. Cow doesn't come into the

421
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:27,360
 top two. Yeah. Everyone likes cows. Oh my god. Donkey is number two. Yeah. Because I think if you

422
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,960
 are a kid and you have like a set of all your farmyard animals, very rare is there a donkey in

423
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,360
 there, is it? Or it's certainly cows and sheep coming first. Are you guys suggesting that this

424
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:44,400
 study conducted on behalf of the donkey sanctuary is in any way improperly done? No. But basically,

425
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,280
 you know what? I just want to carry on talking about this. What they've done is they thought,

426
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,760
 right, we need to make it seem like it's the best animal, but no one's going to believe us

427
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,760
 if we say that the donkey is the most popular farmyard animal. So we're going to have to

428
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,880
 put it in second place. That's what they thought, isn't it? It's like when, you know, Kim Jong-un

429
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,960
 gets 97.9% in the election. It's like, no one will believe 100%. So I have to go down a bit.

430
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,080
 Yeah. But 55% of people do think they're stubborn. And the donkey sanctuary explained that they're

431
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,640
 not stubborn. They're just freezing. One in three people think they're affectionate,

432
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,320
 and only 18% of people think they are charismatic. Yet they've ranked number two. This doesn't add

433
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:41,440
 up. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is that in the late 1960s,

434
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:49,040
 the CIA considered assassinating people using lightning. Wow. Is that you bringing back your

435
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,680
 old nickname and admitting that you were part of the CIA? I'm very glad that you've mentioned

436
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,960
 my old nickname being lightning because I'm determined that it's going to make a comeback.

437
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,320
 So this is something, there's a great article on Forbes about this, a journalist called David

438
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:11,920
 Hambling, I found it, and it was a proposal in 1967 that was made seriously, but it wasn't carried out.

439
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,160
 But the idea was developed. They thought, well, lightning, lightning is pretty powerful, isn't

440
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,240
 it? And if there was a way of directing lightning, then you could get it. They used a real euphemism.

441
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,360
 They said it would produce effects favourable to our purposes. I don't think you don't have to

442
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,920
 read too much between the lines to realise that that's killing people with lightning, basically.

443
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,640
 And yeah, the plan was basically to get a very, very thin wire, which would be only a

444
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,800
 fraction of a millimetre wide, but several miles long to effectively drop this from an aircraft or

445
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,960
 to use a kind of parachute to keep it up there for a long time. And then if there was a storm

446
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,760
 happening above the person you wanted to assassinate, it didn't rely on that. That was the floor in the

447
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,880
 plan. The person had to be in a lightning storm. But it wasn't also a flaw. They had to somehow get

448
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,040
 this wire next to them. So like you've run over to someone and say, just hold this wire, will you?

449
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:13,360
 Exactly. So it was those were the disadvantages. There were advantages, obviously, like cheap,

450
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,680
 because you're not being getting an electricity bill for this. And also it would leave no evidence.

451
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,560
 Yeah, but you can always have incredible advantages to something impossible.

452
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,400
 That's true. I think we should go ahead with the impossible thing, because the advantages are

453
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,880
 just so good. Yeah, that was, I mean, the disadvantages were big as well. Yeah.

454
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,200
 I think there's contextual evidence. I think that if Fidel Castro had suddenly been struck by

455
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,320
 lightning around that period, it would have been very suspicious. Well, if all the CIA's enemies

456
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,920
 suddenly got hit by lightning, I think you can do it twice. I had a good luck to see if all that

457
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,760
 there's a list of Wikipedia people who were killed by lightning to see if any of them

458
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,880
 were possibly enemies of America at this time. I couldn't find any, I'm afraid.

459
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,560
 Few sports, few sports people. One person from the American War who was the guy who invented the

460
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,840
 phrase, no taxation without, what's that one? No taxation, yeah. It was, he was killed by lightning.

461
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,560
 You're not a true believer in democracy, really, are you? What's the thing that we need for them to

462
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,680
 tax us? I don't really give a shit. Yeah, so not unfortunately, yeah. That's a shame.

463
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,000
 Was that, so those were the most notable people on the list? There wasn't really anyone,

464
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,280
 there was a few people from the, you know, from ancient times who were killed by lightning. Not

465
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,840
 that many famous people are killed by lightning, it turns out. It feels like if the CIA had time

466
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,080
 travel and this thing, they probably still wouldn't use it. Just think of the advantages of time

467
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,560
 travel though. Like, I know it's impossible, but just think of all the advantages.

468
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,640
 Let's just do it. Wow, we're doing it. I can see, you know, anti-universal suffrage,

469
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,680
 campaigner, politician, not liking the no taxation without representation. I think there's the

470
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,640
 kernel of a conspiracy theory there that he was assassinated. Yeah, I was aiming for a conspiracy

471
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,480
 theory and I was aiming a bit higher than this, to be honest. I was hoping that an actual, you know,

472
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,800
 dictator from the Soviet times had died. Yeah, shame. They came up with some pretty wacky plans,

473
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,680
 didn't they? Yeah. There was sort of a massive dump on all of us, which you might remember

474
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:31,680
 in 2017. That's a strange weapon, isn't it? Yeah, a shit bomb. They just came onto me in

475
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,280
 the street and said, "Hold this wire." And then before I knew it, I was covered in shit.

476
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,720
 In 2017, the CIA sort of dumped 13 million pages of documents on us by putting them online,

477
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,600
 and that was 800,000 declassified files, which useful journalists went combed through

478
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,440
 and found the insane plans they had. Like, I think it came out that they interviewed Yuri Geller.

479
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,680
 That's one of my favourites in the 1970s. They took an interest in spoonbender Yuri Geller,

480
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,600
 and according to him when he was asked about it, he said they were afraid that there were people

481
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,720
 like him in Russia who, I guess, would pose a threat by bending cutlery in the Soviet Union

482
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,440
 somehow. And the way they tested Geller to test his skills was they shut him in a room,

483
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,560
 and then the CIA taped to the wall outside his room a picture of something. And the way they

484
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,480
 chose the picture was they opened a dictionary, they got a word, so they chose the word, for

485
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,440
 instance, "bunch." And then they drew what first came to their mind, a bunch, and then they asked

486
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,160
 Yuri on the other side of the wall to draw what he sensed the picture was. Was that a bunch of grapes?

487
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,320
 Well, exactly. He drew 24 purple grapes. To be fair, there were 24,

488
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,280
 so that's kind of impressive. But basically, the CIA's conclusion was he has demonstrated

489
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,400
 his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner, which I would say he

490
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,440
 hadn't. You hear about it, you think grapes. But they didn't, did they tell him the word "bunch"?

491
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,360
 Yeah, they said "bunch." Oh my goodness. They said, "We've picked the word 'bunch' out of the

492
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:01,520
 dictionary. Draw the first thing that comes to mind." But he did draw 24 grapes, and they

493
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,280
 had 24 grapes in their picture. Yeah, but I have to specify, they did this on him dozens of times,

494
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,120
 and he only got a few of them right, and that was one of them. I would have drawn some flowers.

495
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,600
 Yeah. A bunch of flowers. You know what? I deliberately went with grapes thinking it was

496
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,320
 the wrong answer as well, because I was thinking it would be flowers. James, you are the new Yuri

497
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,200
 Geller. What's more impressive is if you say that you've picked the word "Jiraffe" and it's

498
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,440
 actually a dump truck, and he draws a dump truck, that's, you know... Yeah, that's true.

499
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,400
 That's when you know you've got someone dangerous on your hand.

500
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,200
 The most impressive thing that Yuri Geller did, and the most controversial, actually, was in Euro

501
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,680
 '96. He was flying over Wembley Stadium in a helicopter, I think, and Gary McAllister was

502
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,640
 taking a penalty for Scotland, which would have put them level with England in the game.

503
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,640
 And if you watch the video back, the ball moves about one inch just before he kicks the ball,

504
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,000
 and he misses the penalty, and then Gaza goes up the other end and scores,

505
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,920
 and Yuri Geller claims that he made that ball move. No. But he doesn't claim it was the downdraft

506
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,400
 of the helicopter. He says it was his magic powers. But I thought you were going to say

507
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,280
 he dropped a bent spoon on his head, which is slightly concussive. Weirdly, I read a thing

508
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,600
 just this morning about Yuri Geller, which is that in 1974, he was a paternity suit, was filed

509
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,800
 against him by a young mum in Sweden. She didn't claim that he was the dad. What she claimed was,

510
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,080
 is that his magical bending powers had altered her contraception coil, and it became inoperable,

511
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,640
 and she got pregnant as a result. And as a result, he should pay for that, because he's the sort of

512
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,720
 pseudo father. Wow, that's a really difficult position to put him in, because on the one hand,

513
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,240
 he really wants to admit to having those powers. Well, it was the same with the football thing,

514
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,920
 because he wants to claim that he moved this football, but actually he had 11,000 hate letters

515
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,440
 from Scottish people after the game, saying, how could you scupper our chances in the European

516
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,240
 Championships? Wow. Hey, I read a really cool invention by the CIA, which was used. It's called

517
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:10,320
 the Skyhook. And the Skyhook was basically a way of extracting CIA operatives or anyone that was in

518
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,920
 need of help, who was involved in the military in some way, from a location without having to get

519
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,040
 on the ground to pick them up. So what it was, is that they would drop a package over to where they

520
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,320
 believed the operative was, and the opera, the package had a little description on it. And in

521
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,240
 it, they had a helium balloon that would lift the cable 500 foot into the air. And then the operative

522
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,480
 would strap themselves to a harness that was connected to the other end of that cable that

523
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,800
 went up with the balloon. And they would sit and wait until a very slow flying plane would fly to

524
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:49,280
 where the helium balloon was. And it would hook its nose of the plane around the hook that had been

525
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,280
 sent up. And it would carry the guy off into the air and back to safety. That is so cool. I mean,

526
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,680
 if you timed it right, you could say, just so you know, all this time, I've been working

527
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,640
 for the CIA and then bang, if you get that even slightly wrong, then you're just immediately

528
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,880
 arrested. Yeah. Or if a lightning storm comes over and it attaches itself to the 500 foot wire.

529
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,440
 He told us he was working for the CIA and then he just exploded. It's really weird.

530
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,960
 Yeah, I can see why they didn't go with that. All sorts of any of their mad plans.

531
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,040
 I wish someone one day had turned around at the CIA in sort of 1950,

532
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,680
 just early on and said, you know, these crazy ideas we keep having that never come to fruition.

533
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,400
 You know, the ones that always work, they're the ones where we just shoot someone in the head.

534
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,640
 Do that from now on.

535
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:43,120
 There was a guy called Edward Geary Lansdale and he was with the CIA and he was requested

536
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,120
 by the president of the Philippines to come over. There was a United States military assistance

537
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:53,520
 group to come up with ideas to fight the communist Hock Balahap, which was a regime that was threatening

538
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,400
 the Philippines at the time. And he came up with this idea of convincing them that there were

539
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,520
 vampires out in the woods. And the way that he actually tried to convince them that this was

540
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,800
 really happening is they captured an enemy soldier and they drained the blood from his body and left

541
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,440
 him making it look as if he was trying to flee and got caught by one of these vampires. So when

542
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,920
 they found him, they believed the myth was real. It's bizarre. These little tricks.

543
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,920
 Who benefits from this? Well, I suppose if you've got an enemy believing that there's

544
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,960
 something paranormal going on, as well as an enemy who are physically real,

545
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,480
 that just keeps you on edge. It keeps you psychologically all over the shop.

546
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,320
 Because do you remember that fact that you and I both found out about in Japan,

547
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,880
 they were going to capture some foxes and then paint them in luminous paints and then

548
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,600
 release them into the Japanese countryside so that people would see these glowing foxes and

549
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,360
 think that they were some mysterious kind of apparition. Yeah, that's right. They would

550
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,240
 believe. And there was a thing where one was connected to some balloons. The idea was there's

551
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,040
 a floating fox guard. You just see the balloons, wouldn't you? Not at night. And you would just

552
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,520
 see the illuminated figure of floating fox. And again, is the idea that you sort of make them

553
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,680
 all a bit edgy because there are these scary foxes around. Or that everyone thinks it's a

554
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,320
 Pokemon and Chase is after it. Again, there's just always, you know, Killjoy Barry in the

555
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,760
 corner of the meeting there going, "Guys, shall we just shoot them in the head again? I'm really

556
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,160
 sorry. It's a great idea." But one CIA agent, maybe the most surprising one I found out about

557
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,840
 was the Dalai Lama. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the 1960s, his group was being given over a million dollars

558
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:44,160
 a year by the CIA. And they did deny that the Dalai Lama was on a personal retainer of $180,000

559
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,440
 a year. His organization have denied that. But that's because the CIA were paying for

560
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,280
 Getty operations against China when China invaded Tibet. And so the Dalai Lama was an important

561
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,720
 part of that resistance. So we don't know what his kill total is. Yeah. That's a great series of

562
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,720
 novels to be written. The secret CIA adventures of the Dalai Lama. But that's another one where

563
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,800
 Barry never gets what he wants. Because if you do shoot the Dalai Lama in the head, he just comes

564
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,600
 back. That's so frustrating, isn't it? It's just a pointless assassination. He's on your side. You

565
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,360
 wouldn't shoot your own agent. Maybe if you're playing a double bluff, maybe it's the Jason Bourne.

566
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,040
 But think of it, the Dalai Lama can get to anybody. There's no one going to refuse a

567
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,480
 meeting with the Dalai Lama on security grounds. No, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. True. True. A lot of

568
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,600
 the people in the CIA are just massive nerds, right? They're kind of our people. So like when

569
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,920
 WikiLeaks exposed a load of stuff that the CIA was doing in its hacking program, we managed to see

570
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,160
 a lot of what the tools were called and what the programs were called. And they're all named after

571
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,080
 memes or references to pop culture. There's one of them named after a World of Warcraft trading card.

572
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,040
 There's another one that's named after some characters from Talladega Nights, which is the

573
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,880
 Will Ferrell movie. And there was another document where a guy just listed a load of awesome tool

574
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,040
 names he wanted to use at some stage, including awesome McTool name and starving weasel. And

575
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,400
 the second of those is a weird Aljankovic song. And they're just like, we've got to invent something

576
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,320
 so that we can give it this really nerdy name. Yeah. Yeah. Funny. Somewhere there's a dangerous

577
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:28,240
 sniper CIA agent who's just heard James call him a nerd. What's that red dot that's just appeared

578
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,720
 on my head? Actually, that's a myth, isn't it about the red dot because lasers go in a straight

579
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,200
 line, whereas bullets don't go in a straight line. So there's no point having a red dot aiming at

580
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,160
 someone's head because it's pointing straight from the gun. You need to be aiming slightly above the

581
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,560
 person's head if you're a sniper. So in the film, it should be there's a red dot slightly above you

582
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,920
 on the wall. Exactly. And that's when you know you're in danger. And if there's a red dot on

583
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,360
 your head, you think, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you don't. You think, oh, shit, they're going to shoot me in

584
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:04,640
 the balls. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you

585
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,000
 would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of

586
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,360
 this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts. I'm on at Shriverland Andy at Andrew
