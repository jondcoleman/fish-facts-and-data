00:00:12,00:00:17,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:17,00:00:23,"from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:23,00:00:27,"James Harkin and Anna Tyshensky. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:00:27,00:00:33,"four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting"
00:00:33,00:00:40,"with fact number one, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that sodium citrate, the chemical"
00:00:40,00:00:47,"you add to cheese to make it melty nacho cheese, contains sodium, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,"
00:00:47,00:00:53,"or according to the chemical symbols, N, A, C, H and O. Unbelievable. And this is proof of"
00:00:53,00:01:02,"living in a matrix, right? Yes, very unimaginative matrix. So I was watching a YouTube clip by a"
00:01:02,00:01:07,"person called Minut Food, and they showed an experiment of how to make American cheese from"
00:01:07,00:01:12,"any kind of cheese. So you could just take any kind of cheese and add sodium citrate,"
00:01:12,00:01:18,"and it will make it more melty. And in that, that's when they get satisfied. Although I've"
00:01:18,00:01:22,"looked since logs, and it is kind of all over the internet, but right. Okay, it's not like some"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"people. I think that we're doing the world a favor by hopefully putting more on the internet,"
00:01:27,00:01:31,"because it is amazing. Yeah, this podcast is about what I learned this week, and this is a thing"
00:01:31,00:01:36,"that I recently learned. It's a melting salt, isn't it sodium citrate? So when you melt a cheese,"
00:01:36,00:01:42,"the fats and the proteins separate out from each other, and they, but it can get very lumpy."
00:01:43,00:01:48,"It kind of forms like a mesh. Normally, it's like a big solid thing with proteins and fats and"
00:01:48,00:01:53,"moisture and stuff. It kind of all spreads out, and now you've got this mesh of stuff. And the more"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"meshier it is, the more melty it is, basically. Yes. And the sodium, as far as I understand it,"
00:01:58,00:02:02,it replaces calcium ions. And the calcium ions are the thing that made the cheese proteins all bond
00:02:02,00:02:08,"together. So the more sodium citrate there is, the smoother the meltiness gets. And it does exactly"
00:02:08,00:02:15,"the same thing in another thing that needs to get thinner often. Oh, it should be."
00:02:15,00:02:24,"A zen pick is actually made out of osmium. Blood thinners. Really? It's put in lots of blood thinners,"
00:02:24,00:02:28,"exactly the same thing. And it's usually in when you donate blood, they need to add something to"
00:02:28,00:02:32,keep it from clotting after you've donated it before it's given to someone. And they pop in
00:02:32,00:02:37,"basically nacho cheese. Sodium citrate also helps your body to create hydrogen and ions,"
00:02:37,00:02:42,which lowers acidity in your muscles and stops you from feeling the burn when you do lots of
00:02:42,00:02:47,"exercise. Oh, cool. I'm not exactly sure of the chemical process of how it works, but it does"
00:02:47,00:02:51,"work. And so some people take sodium citrate supplements. Well, they might use it if they've"
00:02:51,00:02:55,"got a urinary tract infection, because it can be used to relieve discomfort in those."
00:02:55,00:03:00,Really? I presume by just selectively melting bits of urinary tract. I've understood the
00:03:00,00:03:06,science. Does it work if you kind of like shove some melty cheese up there? I think that's that is
00:03:06,00:03:12,"some optimal, but it will in a pinch. That's what you've got. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nacho cheese is"
00:03:12,00:03:17,"not a cheese. Not a cheese. It's a cheese product made from cheese, because as James says, you can"
00:03:17,00:03:22,"put any old cheese you shove it in and put this stuff in, you melt it, that becomes the nacho"
00:03:22,00:03:28,cheesy sauce. So there's no sort of core cheese that produces nacho cheese. So nacho cheese is
00:03:28,00:03:35,"not a cheese. It's a cheese derivative. It's an idea. Very clear if you eat it. It's weird,"
00:03:35,00:03:38,"because it's taking your cheese and it is making it worse, isn't it? I mean, it's making it more"
00:03:38,00:03:44,useful because it can spread over stuff. I think the thing is about food is it's not completely
00:03:44,00:03:51,objective. What I disagree about. Do you think everyone who likes nacho cheese is just straight
00:03:51,00:03:56,"up wrong? Well, I have brain on my nachos. That's what I do. And it's a bit harder to melt, but it's"
00:03:56,00:04:00,fine. The other thing about American cheese is it was invented in Switzerland by a Canadian.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"I think we've mentioned it before. It's James Kraft, who came up with the idea of"
00:04:07,00:04:11,extending the shelf life of cheese by putting all these salts in it. Interesting.
00:04:11,00:04:17,"Have we mentioned the competition we did? On stage? On stage? On our last tour? Oh, no."
00:04:17,00:04:24,We tried to break a record for the most slices of American cheese eaten in a minute and dry.
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Yeah. So it was a Guinness World Record. I brought Craig Glenday, who's the editor-in-chief,"
00:04:29,00:04:36,on stage for us to attempt to break it. And we sucked. It was really hard. 10 slices in a minute
00:04:36,00:04:42,"without being able to lubricate your mouth is nuts. It was too much. James, you got the most,"
00:04:42,00:04:48,"I think. I think James did pretty well. I did, respectively. And you guys did a small corner?"
00:04:48,00:04:52,I won. I was just so pulled by the quality of the cheese. I found the hardest thing was taking
00:04:52,00:04:56,off the bits of plastic because you had to do that as well. And I think the pros have like a
00:04:56,00:05:02,special flip that they do with a wrist that kind of flips the cheese out and helps and tweets it.
00:05:02,00:05:06,"But I think I had four in a bit. Yeah, you did amazing. And I've had like one and he'd been"
00:05:06,00:05:11,"practising for a week before. Yeah, I've been practising for so long, but he only told me on"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"the night I couldn't drink. If you can drink in between, you can get a lot more done. Do you"
00:05:14,00:05:19,"know what you can do in fondue instead of add sodium citrate and what they do do, in fact?"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"White wine, you had sweat, didn't you? Yeah, I guess you know how to make fondue."
00:05:23,00:05:30,"And his reaction there was like, she'd asked they've done between one and a million and I guessed"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"it. I was thinking, how has James worked out the chemical processes and then figured out that"
00:05:34,00:05:39,"wine does that? Oh, no, he just knows fondue recipes. So that's what the wine does in fondue."
00:05:39,00:05:44,Dry white wine has the same kind of acidity and that helps the cheese not congeal in exactly the
00:05:44,00:05:49,same way. It stops the cacine proteins binding together. Does the alcohol burn away or does it?
00:05:49,00:05:54,"Most of it burns away, but it is why fondue smells as like you'll notice of alcohol,"
00:05:54,00:05:59,which I've always thought it's such a strong smell. I don't think I've ever eaten it sober. So like
00:05:59,00:06:06,"so much alcohol around anyway, I've never noticed the smell of the fondue. You're so right. It's just"
00:06:06,00:06:11,"in the air, isn't it? Who invented nachos? Have we said this before? I'm not sure we have. Mr."
00:06:11,00:06:18,"Mr. Nacho. Mr. Nacho. Actually, not Mr. Nacho, Mr. Anaya. But his first name was Nacho,"
00:06:18,00:06:24,"which is short for Ignacio. And he created them in 1943 at the Victory Club in Mexico,"
00:06:24,00:06:31,Coahuila. And it was a restaurant close to the border. And a lot of American service people
00:06:31,00:06:35,who were kind of training for World War II were there. And their families as well. And they all
00:06:35,00:06:40,"came in one day and said, we want some food. This guy was the maitre d' but the chef had disappeared."
00:06:40,00:06:45,"As he said, don't worry, I'll make you something. And he ran into the kitchen and all he could find"
00:06:45,00:06:51,was these cheese and bits of tostadas and a few jalapenos. And he put them all under the grill.
00:06:51,00:06:56,"And the new dish was born. So you're saying it was kind of discovered by accident, in a way?"
00:06:56,00:07:02,"Maybe. Did he only had, did he have sodium citrate? Then did he have to,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,did he have like a big jar of chemicals? And it's like one of these?
00:07:04,00:07:09,"Exactly. Nacho cheese, as we would know it today, like the real, the stuff you can kind of squirt"
00:07:09,00:07:14,"onto the top of it, didn't exist then that existed a bit later. I believe he did get a promotion to"
00:07:14,00:07:18,head chef or something off the back of it. Interesting. I didn't know if that was a promotion.
00:07:18,00:07:22,I thought they were just on different career streams. Like I would have thought maitre d
00:07:22,00:07:27,"then goes to hotel manager. Okay. Well, he just changed career basically on the back of the major"
00:07:27,00:07:31,"invention. Because he had this moment of, it just had this moment of glory. That's 100% agree."
00:07:31,00:07:37,"I just agree with you, Andy. I just, I hadn't put that together. And now I think about"
00:07:37,00:07:41,having worked in hotels for lots of my life. That absolutely isn't a promotion at all.
00:07:42,00:07:47,It's very much a sidestep. It's a pivot. Yeah. And then he eventually left. He opened up his own
00:07:47,00:07:52,"restaurant, which he called nachos restaurant. Though I feel like he missed a trick. I feel"
00:07:52,00:07:57,"like he should have called it, let them eat nachos. That's my title because his wife was called"
00:07:57,00:08:02,"Marie Antoinette. And that just, yeah, just would have been fitting. But you would have had to have"
00:08:02,00:08:07,big brackets. The owner's wife is called Marie Antoinette. It's a great story for when you're
00:08:07,00:08:12,"sitting down saying, why'd you call it that? Another thing from Mexico, another food from"
00:08:12,00:08:21,"Mexico rather, Caesar salad. Invented in Tijuana in the 1920s. In fact, in not only in the 1920s"
00:08:21,00:08:26,"and 1924, because they've just had the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad, a chef called Caesar"
00:08:26,00:08:31,"invented it, which is why it's called Caesar salad. It's actually got nothing to do with Julia Caesar."
00:08:31,00:08:34,I didn't know that. No. That feels like the kind of thing you're learning here on your first day.
00:08:34,00:08:38,I'm so embarrassed. This is actually a suspiciously similar origin story to the nacho thing.
00:08:38,00:08:43,"He had a big crowd in the kitchen at his restaurant, but he only had some lettuce and"
00:08:43,00:08:49,"crostini and a dressing. Yeah. But it makes it seem like, wait a minute, was it a Caesar salad dressing?"
00:08:49,00:08:53,"Because it feels like that's really part of the invention. Yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah, but who"
00:08:53,00:09:00,"invented God? You know. Here's another surprising one. Where was the burrito invented? Oh, like"
00:09:00,00:09:07,Nantwich or something. During the Pina Colada festival. There was a big rush at the Pina Colada
00:09:07,00:09:11,"festival. Someone said, we need something to mop up all this Pina Colada and the chef only had"
00:09:11,00:09:19,"some pulled pork. Got it in wine? Burrito. Okay. Well, for me, Mexico, because it means Little"
00:09:19,00:09:24,"Dog Key in Spanish, burrito. Absolutely. I've only got a very silly answer here. So yeah. North Korea."
00:09:25,00:09:32,"This surprisingly, it was invented in 2011. This is one of the weird ass claims that Kim Jong-il"
00:09:32,00:09:38,"invented the burrito that was released by the local news sources of North Korea,"
00:09:38,00:09:43,who said that its popularity has been booming ever since 2011 and his invention of it.
00:09:43,00:09:46,"It's one of those false memory things where you think you had the miniature childhood,"
00:09:46,00:09:51,"but actually, who saw a burrito before 2011? Exactly. I never did. No one. I think it's no one."
00:09:52,00:09:56,"They actually have in their real history, or sorry, the alternative Western history,"
00:09:56,00:10:02,they did tend to be eaten in Mexico. And then there was this massive program called the
00:10:02,00:10:07,"Braquellos program in the 40s and 50s, where the US was short on workers and there were loads of"
00:10:07,00:10:11,Mexicans who wanted to come to America. So they offered them loads of work permits. And Americans
00:10:11,00:10:16,"thought, well, a good way to feed these laborers who of course, they were paying lower wages and"
00:10:16,00:10:20,"they would pay Americans is to give them these burritos, which we know they're into. So they gave"
00:10:20,00:10:25,"them all burritos every day, two burritos a day. But all the immigrants came from Central Mexico,"
00:10:25,00:10:29,where actually no one ate burritos. And they hated them. And it was part of the reason for a huge
00:10:29,00:10:33,resentment was the fact that they were being force fed these. And I don't think they were the great
00:10:33,00:10:39,"burritos. They were like a bit of rap and some beans, no sauce. Before all of this, of course,"
00:10:39,00:10:48,"we had the Aztec and the Maya and the pre-Columbian Americans. And they all let Maze, a lot of their"
00:10:48,00:10:53,thing is to do with Maze and like tortillas are all made of Maze. So it's carried on. But the
00:10:53,00:10:58,"interesting thing about that is if you just eat Maze, it's not very good for you. I mean, it's"
00:10:58,00:11:03,"fine, but it's not going to give you much of what you need to stay alive. But they came up with a"
00:11:03,00:11:10,"thing called nixtamalization. Basically, you soak the grains of Maze, and then you cook them over"
00:11:10,00:11:16,wood ashes. And then there's like an invisible outer coating of the Maze and that gets removed.
00:11:16,00:11:20,"And then it's much easier to grind, much easier to cook, and it enhances the amount of protein in"
00:11:20,00:11:27,the Maze. And it's so much better that you can basically look at whatever this was invented by
00:11:27,00:11:31,looking at old fires and where the Maze has been cooked. You can look at it and you can see all these
00:11:31,00:11:36,Mesoamerican civilizations growing when each area kind of works out how to nixtamalize them.
00:11:36,00:11:41,"Really? Yeah, it's incredible. And when the Europeans went over and brought Maze back,"
00:11:41,00:11:46,there's lots of areas that kind of started eating Maze in the old world. But they still got
00:11:46,00:11:51,"quite malnourished because none of them knew how to nixtamalize things. Oh, really? Yeah."
00:11:51,00:11:56,It's crazy. I never even heard that word before this week. And they also have that thing where
00:11:56,00:12:02,"they eat the fungus that grows on Maze in Mexico, don't they? Which actually looks kind of delicious"
00:12:02,00:12:07,"and they have it corn smut. No, have you had it? What's corn? No, I hate funguses. Oh, sorry,"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"that's why you took it. Of all the funguses that I'm ever going to try, maybe a black truffle,"
00:12:11,00:12:16,but a piece of corn smut? Probably not. It's a disease and it looks like a sort of black
00:12:16,00:12:22,lump of mold. And there was quite a fun story in 2014 where there was a farmer called Nat Bradform
00:12:22,00:12:26,"and he was asked to grow some corn for a chef, quite a famous chef called Sean Brock,"
00:12:26,00:12:31,who's a big deal in America. And he wanted this corn to be grown for his handmade tortillas and
00:12:31,00:12:37,poor Nat woke up one day when I went to his fields and overnight the whole thing destroyed by fungus.
00:12:37,00:12:43,"Corn smut everywhere. So he called the chef, you know, in tears. I'm so sorry, I've destroyed"
00:12:43,00:12:47,"your restaurant. And obviously Sean, being a chef and knowing the ways of the Mexicans,"
00:12:47,00:12:53,"was absolutely delighted. It was like, you've got a delicacy there. You've just accidentally"
00:12:53,00:12:57,grown overnight this fantastic delicacy that I'll incorporate into my Mexican restaurant food.
00:12:57,00:13:00,"Corn smut pizzas, I'll add. Corn smut pizzas, there you go."
00:13:00,00:13:05,"Do you guys know Taco Bell? You must know Taco Bell, massive American chain."
00:13:05,00:13:09,"I don't think I've ever been to one. Do we have them over here? Oh yeah. Oh, do we?"
00:13:09,00:13:13,"Well, there's one within walking distance of my house. Yeah, they're here. They're not massive"
00:13:13,00:13:17,"here, but in America, they're very, very big. And globally, they have places all over the world."
00:13:17,00:13:23,"One place they don't have is Mexico. And they've tried twice. The first time they went in,"
00:13:23,00:13:27,"they sort of went all out just saying, this is a fast food version of what you guys have here."
00:13:27,00:13:32,"So have it. They said, no, it doesn't make sense. Second time they went in, which was years later,"
00:13:32,00:13:37,"they tried to push it as not Mexican food, but American food, while still having the"
00:13:37,00:13:42,"menu that they have. And they even advertised it by saying, it's not Mexican, it's just"
00:13:42,00:13:47,"something else. I think that's a much better strategy, because yeah, Mexicans would deny"
00:13:47,00:13:50,it was Mexican at all. Americans deny it's American. And tacos weren't hard.
00:13:50,00:13:54,It's insulting either way. It's insulting if you say this is your cuisine. It's insulting if you say
00:13:54,00:14:00,this is our cuisine. They don't have any Taco Bells in North Korea either. It's for the same reason.
00:14:00,00:14:07,Yeah. They invented it. Exactly. Did you hear of Diana Kennedy? No. She was very cool. She's
00:14:07,00:14:13,"one of the people who has contributed to saving or not saving, but preserving huge amounts of the"
00:14:13,00:14:16,diversity of Mexican food. Because obviously it's a huge country. It's got hundreds of different
00:14:16,00:14:22,"cuisines in it. And she spent 60 years driving around the country, doing apprenticeships in"
00:14:22,00:14:26,"bakeries, like going to individual villages and saying, what do you eat? Let me learn how to make"
00:14:26,00:14:31,it. I wanted to make it myself. And she was awarded not only. I think she might be the only
00:14:31,00:14:36,"person ever to have been awarded an MBE for services to Mexican-British relations, but also"
00:14:36,00:14:42,"the Order of the Aztec Eagle, which is Mexico's highest honour. This is very cool, isn't it?"
00:14:42,00:14:47,We need to rename our MBEs. It's so much cooler. Yeah. And she was called the Indiana Jones of Food.
00:14:47,00:14:52,"She sounds great. Yeah. Which bit of Indiana Jones' career is at his academic side, where he's"
00:14:52,00:14:58,"always as a professor or out fighting Nazis. No, it's like she's out in the... She's out,"
00:14:58,00:15:01,like she's gone into the temple. There's a rare kind of burrito on the stand.
00:15:01,00:15:06,She's swapped it over for some tamales. She's holding it in her other hand.
00:15:06,00:15:09,Chased by a giant ball of corn sluts.
00:15:09,00:15:20,"OK, it is time for fact number two. And that is Anna."
00:15:20,00:15:24,My fact this week is that white noise was named because the pattern of its waves
00:15:24,00:15:28,resembles white light. And pink noise was named because it resembles pink light.
00:15:28,00:15:32,Brown noise was named after someone called Robert Brown.
00:15:32,00:15:36,I've never heard of pink or brown noise. No.
00:15:36,00:15:40,And I was quite unclear what white noise is actually before looking us up.
00:15:40,00:15:42,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, there we go. Let's get into it."
00:15:42,00:15:45,"So white noise, first of all, is the most common one that people know because it's this."
00:15:48,00:15:52,And people often use it to make their children go to sleep.
00:15:52,00:15:53,They do. And pink noise is more like...
00:15:53,00:15:59,And is brown noise the one that makes you poo?
00:15:59,00:16:01,And brown noise is the one that makes you shit yourself.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"No, it isn't, is it?"
00:16:02,00:16:06,"It's not, no. So white noise is basically a noise that contains"
00:16:06,00:16:11,all the different frequencies within human hearing to the same extent.
00:16:11,00:16:14,"So we can hear between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz."
00:16:14,00:16:18,"And if you take all of those frequencies, 20, 21, 22, etc."
00:16:18,00:16:20,And then you play them all with exactly the same amount of energy.
00:16:20,00:16:21,That's white noise.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"Confusingly, white noise sounds horrible, I think."
00:16:25,00:16:30,I don't understand people who find it relaxing because higher pitches sound louder to us.
00:16:30,00:16:36,Pink noise is where there's more energy in the lower pitches.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"It's a bit basier. Now, listening to pink noise, I still think it sounds..."
00:16:39,00:16:42,"It's still quite jarring, isn't it? I would say."
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Pink noise? Well, you know, like a lot of people,"
00:16:44,00:16:45,"just to give the opposite side of the argument,"
00:16:45,00:16:48,think that it sounds like the waves washing over you.
00:16:48,00:16:50,I would say brown noise sounds like waves.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"I think pink noise, but you're right, a lot of people do write that."
00:16:53,00:16:56,"But brown noise is the hip new noise, right?"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"Brown noise is what everyone is now listening to on YouTube,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,hours at a time as they go to sleep.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"Headline in Glastonbury this year. Let's get with it, all right?"
00:17:03,00:17:05,And that's low brown noise.
00:17:05,00:17:09,So brown noise is where you're putting a lot more energy into those lower frequencies.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"So it sounds bassy and I think if you listen to that, it sounds like trees"
00:17:12,00:17:15,or sounded a bit like a nice ocean waves to me.
00:17:15,00:17:18,Can we explain why it's good for sleeping?
00:17:18,00:17:19,Because I think that's important too.
00:17:19,00:17:25,And I think the reasoning is it increases your what they call arousal threshold steady on.
00:17:25,00:17:30,It's that normally if you're asleep and it's completely silent around you
00:17:30,00:17:33,"and then a car alarm goes off, you wake up, right?"
00:17:33,00:17:38,Because there's a big difference between the background nothing and then the car alarm.
00:17:38,00:17:42,"But if there's a background playing constantly,"
00:17:42,00:17:46,"you're already kind of higher on the sonic mountain, like all boats have been lifted."
00:17:46,00:17:50,"And then so that spike of the car alarm, which is like the top of the mountain,"
00:17:50,00:17:54,it pokes up less high above the general background that you're listening to.
00:17:54,00:17:55,And therefore there's less of a chance.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"And it doesn't matter what frequency the car alarm is,"
00:17:57,00:18:00,because all the frequencies are being fired at you anyway.
00:18:00,00:18:00,Right.
00:18:00,00:18:02,So it's bound to be covered by one of them.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"Exactly. So then you wake up in the morning, your car's been stolen again."
00:18:04,00:18:08,At least you had a good night.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Exactly.
00:18:09,00:18:12,"But apparently it also, for a lot of people, stops the voices in their own head."
00:18:12,00:18:16,"So people going to sleep going, ""Oh, did I lock the car? Did I lock the car? I don't know."""
00:18:16,00:18:22,It stops all those questions from your head and just lets you fall asleep.
00:18:22,00:18:27,"It's and more so for ADHD people, as you'd expect, because we've got ADHD,"
00:18:27,00:18:31,then distractions in your mind and out of them are more distracting.
00:18:31,00:18:32,And it sort of helps drown them out.
00:18:32,00:18:35,I should probably say how these related to colors very quickly.
00:18:35,00:18:38,Won't go into it to a boring extent.
00:18:38,00:18:40,But just because white noise is named after white light.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"So that's white light is like all the frequencies of light,"
00:18:42,00:18:43,all mixed together equally.
00:18:43,00:18:46,"Pink light is what the brain interprets as a combination of red and blue light,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,but there's actually a bit less blue.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"So in the same way, it's a bit heavier on the lower frequencies,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,because red is like a bit lower.
00:18:52,00:18:57,"And then brown, Robert Brown was a Scottish botanist."
00:18:57,00:19:02,It's so random that his main legacy to the world is naming this kind of noise.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"Well, it's not his main legacy."
00:19:03,00:19:10,He was an amazing botanist and his name is put to many animals and geographical locations.
00:19:10,00:19:13,It's only become his main legacy since brownwise became the new trend.
00:19:13,00:19:16,I must stop like before we did any of this stuff.
00:19:16,00:19:18,I'd only heard of him because of brownie emotion.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:19,00:19:20,"No, that's fair enough."
00:19:20,00:19:21,But he's within the world of botany.
00:19:21,00:19:23,His name is there.
00:19:23,00:19:26,Lots of plants and grasses and things.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"Brownie emotion is the way particular molecules,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,"if you look at them under a microscope,"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"he observed they looked like they were dancing,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,these pollen grains that he was looking at.
00:19:34,00:19:35,And they're not alive.
00:19:35,00:19:36,How can they be dancing?
00:19:36,00:19:38,It basically has to do with the heat of individual molecules.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"Yeah, the molecules are bouncing off things,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,moving things around in a random way.
00:19:42,00:19:44,And this noise is more random than the others.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"Yes, the way it looks."
00:19:46,00:19:47,"And in fact, it was Einstein himself,"
00:19:47,00:19:51,"good old Einstein, his first influential paper who took brownie emotion,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"which basically Robert Brown, and he had the habit of doing this,"
00:19:53,00:19:56,"just looked at it, went, oh, that's happening."
00:19:56,00:19:57,And then went back to his plants.
00:19:57,00:19:59,"And Einstein went, let's explain that."
00:19:59,00:20:02,And it was essential to finding out that atoms and molecules
00:20:02,00:20:04,"are the smaller particles of matter,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,"because it was like, how else could these pollen bits be moving,"
00:20:06,00:20:09,except of tinier bits of moving inside them?
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Yeah, he was a busy man."
00:20:10,00:20:14,He collected 2000 new species in Australia alone.
00:20:14,00:20:17,"Yeah, but it was a piece of piss in those days."
00:20:17,00:20:18,Like no one else had done it.
00:20:18,00:20:19,So you just wander around.
00:20:19,00:20:21,You guys said he wasn't seeing that flower before.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Throw a brick.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:24,"Easy, here's a rare flower."
00:20:24,00:20:27,"Yeah, he was kind of there to help prove"
00:20:27,00:20:29,whether or not Australia was a group of islands.
00:20:29,00:20:31,So it was known as New Holland at the time.
00:20:31,00:20:34,And so the idea was that he was going to go through the interior
00:20:34,00:20:36,to try and work out if this suddenly broke up.
00:20:36,00:20:39,And that's a big task.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Well, you wouldn't know."
00:20:40,00:20:44,"Just to prove that this 4,000 mile wide thing is not an island, please."
00:20:44,00:20:44,Yeah.
00:20:44,00:20:45,"Because it gets quite warm in the middle, doesn't it?"
00:20:45,00:20:47,It does get a bit barren.
00:20:47,00:20:47,Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:48,You know what's named after?
00:20:48,00:20:50,"To prove it's an island, you only have to go around the outside."
00:20:50,00:20:52,You don't need to go in the middle.
00:20:52,00:20:55,"Andy, organizing a trek through the centre."
00:20:55,00:20:57,"Wait, what do you say?"
00:20:57,00:21:01,To prove something as an island all you have to do is go around the edge of it.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"No, because it could be like an atoll."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"You know, it could be an island within it."
00:21:04,00:21:05,"Yeah, exactly."
00:21:05,00:21:06,"You mean it could be fully encircled,"
00:21:06,00:21:08,"but even then it's a lake inside, isn't it?"
00:21:08,00:21:10,Still think it needs studying.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Sure.
00:21:11,00:21:16,"On this expedition, they took on two aboriginals,"
00:21:16,00:21:17,Bungary and Nambary.
00:21:17,00:21:21,They took them on board to help them communicate with the local tribes.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"And they were essential to the success of the trip,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,"basically, because every time they stopped on the coast,"
00:21:25,00:21:29,"they had to send, it was usually Bungary, I think, onshore,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"to say these guys are legit, they're normal,"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"and usually didn't speak the language of the different tribe,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,but at least knew the...
00:21:34,00:21:38,Is this bit still the same island or have we gone on to a different island?
00:21:38,00:21:44,"They knew the general habits,"
00:21:44,00:21:47,but usually the protocol was that you should remove your clothes.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"So every time they parked on the coast,"
00:21:50,00:21:53,"they'd be like, ""Right, Bunga, take your clothes off."
00:21:53,00:21:54,"Go ashore, please."""
00:21:54,00:21:57,So he had to strip down naked every time he went to negotiate with you.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Really? Having a Bunga Bunga party?
00:21:58,00:21:59,Having a Bunga party.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"Oh, my God."
00:22:01,00:22:04,"Yeah, actually, of course, Australia isn't one island."
00:22:04,00:22:08,So fine.
00:22:08,00:22:08,Thank you.
00:22:08,00:22:12,And Brown was the first person from Europe to explore Tasmania.
00:22:12,00:22:12,Right.
00:22:12,00:22:16,"And also for Andy, there is Tetradontium brownianum,"
00:22:16,00:22:20,"which is a species of moss called Brown's foretooth moss,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,and it's named after him.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"He found it in a place called Roslyn near Edinburgh in the 18th century,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"and the place where he found it,"
00:22:27,00:22:29,you can still see this moss growing today.
00:22:29,00:22:30,That's nice.
00:22:30,00:22:31,That is very cool.
00:22:31,00:22:32,That's very cool.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"The Brownian motion thing, by the way."
00:22:34,00:22:38,"So that was a discovery that he made at the time through a microscope that he had,"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"and that was called into question many, many years later,"
00:22:41,00:22:44,because they thought there's no way that the microscope would have been able to prove this.
00:22:44,00:22:48,"And so there was a big thing where they took out the original microscopes,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,and they had to re-observe what he said he had observed
00:22:51,00:22:52,in order to prove it.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Well, they used his old microscope."
00:22:53,00:22:55,They used his exact microscopes.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"I think it's a weird thing to doubt, isn't it?"
00:22:57,00:23:02,"The interesting thing is he thought that pollen was moving by themselves,"
00:23:02,00:23:05,"and this was, you know, how sperms move around to reproduce."
00:23:05,00:23:07,That's what the pollen was doing.
00:23:07,00:23:11,"Like this was the force of life that basically existed in all things,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"and it existed in the pollen,"
00:23:12,00:23:15,and that's why basically that was his thought.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Oh, so it's quite a big theory."
00:23:16,00:23:19,"Yeah, it was, this was in the 1820s,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,and it was such a big deal in the world
00:23:21,00:23:24,"that it was mentioned in Middlemarch, George Eliot."
00:23:24,00:23:24,Is it?
00:23:24,00:23:26,"In the podcast, George Eliot's Middlemarch."
00:23:26,00:23:27,Can I remember that bit?
00:23:27,00:23:29,I did read Middlemarch a few years ago.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"It's not like a major plot point, though."
00:23:31,00:23:31,"No, it is."
00:23:31,00:23:32,Dr. Lidgate.
00:23:32,00:23:33,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:23:33,00:23:34,We Lidgate.
00:23:34,00:23:35,He's a scientific one.
00:23:35,00:23:38,He's trying to buy a vase from a guy called Mr. Fairbrother.
00:23:38,00:23:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:39,00:23:40,"And Mr. Fairbrother says,"
00:23:40,00:23:41,"""You are eyeing that glass vase again."
00:23:41,00:23:42,Do you want to make an exchange?
00:23:42,00:23:45,"I have some sea mice, fine specimens and spirits,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"and I will throw in Robert Brown's new thing,"
00:23:48,00:23:51,microscopic observations in the pollen of plants
00:23:51,00:23:53,"if you don't happen to have it already."""
00:23:53,00:23:56,"I mean, that sounds like subtle advertising, doesn't it?"
00:23:56,00:23:57,That sounds...
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
00:23:58,00:23:59,Then it goes #spawn.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"In fact, there's an offer code we can..."
00:24:02,00:24:07,"So, this would be kind of a weird fact"
00:24:07,00:24:08,"for a lot of people to listen to,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,because I think a lot of people listening
00:24:10,00:24:12,are trying to get to sleep right now.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Wake up!
00:24:13,00:24:15,Have you checked the car?
00:24:16,00:24:20,There are dozens of sleep podcasts.
00:24:20,00:24:20,Uh-huh.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"I mean, specific sleep podcasts, you know,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,"not just ours, which is just boring, but I mean..."
00:24:25,00:24:27,Supposedly.
00:24:27,00:24:28,I don't know if this is like big podcast
00:24:28,00:24:30,"who sponsored this research,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,but 46% of people sometimes will listen
00:24:32,00:24:34,"to something as they go to sleep,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,and 28% do it regularly.
00:24:36,00:24:36,Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:39,"There's a thing they do on radio called Comfort Noise,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,which is...
00:24:40,00:24:42,"It's got a slightly different motive,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,but it's to also keep you at ease
00:24:44,00:24:46,when radio goes silent.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"So, for example, if there's like a minute silence,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"because if there's a minute silence,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"and the radio goes completely silent,"
00:24:52,00:24:56,"you start going, ""Wait, has the radio station just turned off?"""
00:24:56,00:24:59,"If it's complete silence, that's supposedly quite..."
00:24:59,00:25:00,But the only time there's ever a minute silent on the radio
00:25:00,00:25:03,"is when they say, ""We're going to have a minute silence now"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"to remember the dead."""
00:25:04,00:25:07,"So, you never then go, ""What the hell's up to my radio?"""
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Well, it's interesting."
00:25:08,00:25:09,They do it for a few reasons.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"So, one, they do think it gives a comfort to people"
00:25:12,00:25:13,who think it's suddenly turned off.
00:25:13,00:25:14,"So, they'll play bird noise,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,or they'll play London traffic in the background.
00:25:16,00:25:17,"So, it keeps it going."
00:25:17,00:25:18,There are actually things...
00:25:18,00:25:19,"Beep, beep, beep!"
00:25:19,00:25:20,I'm walking here!
00:25:20,00:25:25,"I'm trying to drive down wide,"
00:25:25,00:25:28,or where's this huge crowd of people standing around in silence?
00:25:28,00:25:29,"Beep, beep!"
00:25:29,00:25:32,"Wait, how come we've never heard?"
00:25:32,00:25:34,"So, when they play the minute silence on the radio, that's what..."
00:25:34,00:25:38,"I know I have heard a bit of bird song, actually."
00:25:38,00:25:40,I think that is familiar.
00:25:40,00:25:41,"The other reason for it is,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,is because there's protocols in place
00:25:43,00:25:45,"as part of a major system for all radio,"
00:25:45,00:25:47,"which is when absolute silence is there,"
00:25:47,00:25:48,a song will kick in.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"So, you don't want a minute silence for the Queen,"
00:25:51,00:25:54,"and suddenly YMCA comes on halfway through, right?"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"So, that's another part of it."
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Yeah, that's a good point."
00:25:58,00:26:00,"This is not to do with this, really,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,but the Master's Golf is probably happening
00:26:03,00:26:05,"when people are listening to this, or it's just happened."
00:26:05,00:26:08,And they play in bird noises.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"And actually, a lot of golf..."
00:26:10,00:26:12,"If you watch golf on TV, they play in bird noises."
00:26:12,00:26:13,"Oh, do they?"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"And I was listening to Tom Scott's podcast,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,and they said that there was a time when
00:26:16,00:26:19,they played in the wrong bird noise
00:26:19,00:26:20,for wherever it was in the world.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"They were playing this golf tournament,"
00:26:22,00:26:23,"and a load of people wrote in saying,"
00:26:23,00:26:27,"""You don't get the great crested greeb in South Korea."""
00:26:27,00:26:37,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:26:37,00:26:40,"My fact is, when you hover over a link on the computer,"
00:26:40,00:26:43,"and the mouse icon turns into a little hand,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,that icon dates back to the 11th century.
00:26:46,00:26:48,They waited so long before inventing
00:26:48,00:26:50,"the rest of the computer, didn't they?"
00:26:50,00:26:54,"You know, it looks like a white gloved hand,"
00:26:54,00:26:55,"certainly on my computer, anyway."
00:26:55,00:26:58,"Mostly on Macs, you get it, or you get it on all of them."
00:26:58,00:26:59,It's on quite a few.
00:26:59,00:27:00,"You can get it on all, then, you?"
00:27:00,00:27:01,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:27:01,00:27:02,"So, on my computer, it's a little..."
00:27:02,00:27:04,"It's like a pointing finger,"
00:27:04,00:27:05,"and it's got a white glove on,"
00:27:05,00:27:06,and it's got three lines on the glove.
00:27:06,00:27:07,It looks like a butler's glove.
00:27:07,00:27:09,Like a snooker referee.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"A snooker referee, exactly."
00:27:10,00:27:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:11,00:27:12,And those are our two reference points.
00:27:12,00:27:15,James got a watching a lot of snooker.
00:27:15,00:27:16,I grew up with staff.
00:27:16,00:27:16,I was thinking...
00:27:16,00:27:18,"If anyone wants to know the difference between me and Andy,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,"I say this quite often, and that's it."
00:27:20,00:27:22,"For me, it's Mickey Mouse's club."
00:27:22,00:27:22,And there's Dan.
00:27:22,00:27:24,Yeah.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"So, this is a thing."
00:27:25,00:27:28,"It's based on a thing called the manicule,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,which dates back to the Doomsday book.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"It's a way of medieval scholars, in particular,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,"to say, ""Hey, look at this bit of the text."""
00:27:35,00:27:37,"And it's just a pair of fingers that you draw,"
00:27:37,00:27:39,"or sometimes you draw a whole hand,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,but the common element was always like a pointing finger
00:27:42,00:27:43,"saying, ""Hey, look at this bit."""
00:27:43,00:27:44,It's like a highlighter.
00:27:44,00:27:46,It's exactly like a highlighter
00:27:46,00:27:47,"without having to draw along the whole,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,"because often the manuscripts are, you know,"
00:27:49,00:27:50,"because they didn't have highlighters, basically."
00:27:50,00:27:53,It's a way of marking passages.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:54,00:27:55,Or an arrow.
00:27:55,00:27:56,"I mean, it's so much effort to go to, isn't it?"
00:27:56,00:27:58,"It's because when you look at them, they're so beautiful."
00:27:58,00:28:00,And I guess it's just testament to that.
00:28:00,00:28:03,"Again, in the olden days, they didn't have Netflix and stuff."
00:28:03,00:28:06,"So, they clearly spent so long on these stunning drawings."
00:28:06,00:28:10,Sometimes they'd be like a beautiful octopus pointing
00:28:10,00:28:12,its various limbs at various bits of text.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"There was another dragon, which instead of a head,"
00:28:14,00:28:16,had a hand for a head pointing.
00:28:16,00:28:20,There was a whole big Greek god kind of gesturing at something.
00:28:20,00:28:23,And these are often just people who are reading the text as well.
00:28:23,00:28:24,"They're not, you know..."
00:28:24,00:28:25,They're usually monks.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Often monks, but just literate people."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"I think often anyone who had the text was a reader,"
00:28:29,00:28:30,like a rich person.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"It's such an interesting evolution,"
00:28:32,00:28:33,"because you have the Doomsday book,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,"where it's the monks who are reading it,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,"putting it in the margins, right?"
00:28:37,00:28:38,"So, they're going, ""Here's a bit."
00:28:38,00:28:42,"You as the next reader should look out for specifically."""
00:28:42,00:28:45,"Then, by the time we get to the 15th century,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,the printers themselves are putting the fingers in
00:28:48,00:28:52,"to say, ""We think you should look specifically at this bit."""
00:28:52,00:28:54,"And then it kind of, to where we are today,"
00:28:54,00:28:57,evolves into how authors will now put footnotes
00:28:57,00:29:00,"in their own pages now, because they're now saying,"
00:29:00,00:29:02,"""Actually, this is super interesting,"
00:29:02,00:29:03,and I want to tell you more about it.
00:29:03,00:29:04,I'm going to take up the page.
00:29:04,00:29:06,It's not even about the publisher
00:29:06,00:29:07,"or the reader putting in anymore."""
00:29:07,00:29:09,"But yeah, they look absolutely lovely."
00:29:09,00:29:10,They're stunning.
00:29:10,00:29:13,"And they're just a form of marginalia, really, aren't they?"
00:29:13,00:29:14,"Yeah, a marginalia is just anything"
00:29:14,00:29:15,that's not part of the book
00:29:15,00:29:18,"that was scribbled by someone else in the margins, right?"
00:29:18,00:29:19,Yeah.
00:29:19,00:29:22,"And then the modern one, certainly the one in the Mac,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,was invented by someone called Susan Pear.
00:29:24,00:29:29,And she has done lots of different icons
00:29:29,00:29:30,"for various computers,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,"not just Macs, also Windows stuff."
00:29:32,00:29:35,So she came up with the command key on Apple keyboards.
00:29:35,00:29:36,Wow.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Which is a biggie.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"It's like, what does it look like?"
00:29:38,00:29:41,"It's a square with circles on each corner, isn't it?"
00:29:41,00:29:43,It's like a little infinity knot.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Infinity knot, yeah."
00:29:44,00:29:47,She got it from some road signs in Scandinavia.
00:29:47,00:29:49,They used it for landmarks.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"And she just thought, ""That looks good, so I'll use that."""
00:29:51,00:29:55,And she also designed the card deck for Windows Solitaire game.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"That's a biggie, isn't it?"
00:29:57,00:29:59,She's had a huge influence on my childhood.
00:29:59,00:30:00,"Yeah, she's amazing."
00:30:00,00:30:02,"And the road sign thing is very interesting,"
00:30:02,00:30:03,because that's exactly what she said
00:30:03,00:30:05,each of the symbols needed to be.
00:30:05,00:30:07,They needed to be as clear as a road sign.
00:30:07,00:30:09,She had zero experience in this field.
00:30:09,00:30:10,"And so as part of the interview,"
00:30:10,00:30:13,she went to a library and she took out a bunch of books
00:30:13,00:30:15,that were all about graphic design
00:30:15,00:30:17,and just brought them and put them on the table with her.
00:30:17,00:30:20,So it looked like she was super keen.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"They were like, ""Oh, look at all those books."""
00:30:21,00:30:22,She must have read them.
00:30:22,00:30:23,She came into the interview room.
00:30:23,00:30:26,Did she just sort of close the last book in the pile
00:30:26,00:30:28,that she got to the end of the last page?
00:30:28,00:30:30,"Huh, okay."
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Yeah, sorry, what's the pay?"
00:30:32,00:30:35,"A lot of her designs, now you wouldn't see,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"because they're quite 80s,"
00:30:36,00:30:39,but one that stuck around is the thing
00:30:39,00:30:41,"that I never know what it is, that little watch."
00:30:41,00:30:43,"So you know sometimes, and I think again,"
00:30:43,00:30:45,"sorry, we're very spoiled office, so we all use Macs,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"but you've got the mouse, you've got the hand,"
00:30:47,00:30:50,you sometimes get the little timer thing.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"And you know, sometimes you get a little watch that comes up."
00:30:52,00:30:54,And it just basically means something's fucked up.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"Oh, I've never seen that."
00:30:55,00:30:57,"I always thought it was a computer saying,"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"""I'm working it out. Give me time,"" is what it's saying."
00:30:59,00:31:00,"Oh, maybe it is saying that."
00:31:00,00:31:01,"Yes, I think perhaps it's that."
00:31:01,00:31:02,"Well, I see you."
00:31:02,00:31:03,"Well, it's very annoying anyway,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,so I'm not a huge fan of her.
00:31:05,00:31:07,It still uses the floppy disk symbol
00:31:07,00:31:08,for when you're saving something.
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:09,00:31:12,And no one using a computer who was born in the 2000s
00:31:12,00:31:15,"will have any idea really what a floppy disk is,"
00:31:15,00:31:17,"in the same way that they don't, yeah."
00:31:17,00:31:19,"Except they're all reading all the lists that say,"
00:31:19,00:31:21,"""Oh, why are we still using this old watch on floppy disks?"""
00:31:21,00:31:23,"You can still buy floppy disks, by the way."
00:31:23,00:31:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:31:24,00:31:27,"And they're often used by like DIY media,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,arty kind of people.
00:31:28,00:31:30,If you create an amazing bit of media
00:31:30,00:31:33,"and you want it to be really sort of super awesome,"
00:31:33,00:31:34,you might just put it on floppy disk
00:31:34,00:31:36,and everyone will think it's even better.
00:31:36,00:31:38,But you can buy them.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"There's not that many around,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"but there's a few specialist places,"
00:31:41,00:31:45,and they cost about $1 per megabyte of data.
00:31:45,00:31:47,"Okay, that's a lot."
00:31:47,00:31:49,"It is, because the average cost of memory right now"
00:31:49,00:31:52,is one cent per gigabyte.
00:31:52,00:31:55,So if you buy a floppy disk
00:31:55,00:31:56,"for your to save something,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,it's the equivalent of buying a pint of milk
00:31:58,00:32:00,with a one kilogram bar of gold.
00:32:00,00:32:00,Cool.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"Which is what I do,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,but I'm not really in time for the common man.
00:32:05,00:32:08,"This pointy thing, just one last thing on the manicule."
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:09,00:32:11,I just like the names of it.
00:32:11,00:32:15,"So it was called the Indicationum, or the index,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,"which is from the Latin for ""to point""."
00:32:17,00:32:17,And that's where...
00:32:17,00:32:18,Index finger.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Index finger comes from, yeah."
00:32:20,00:32:23,But it was also known as a mutton fist or a bishop's fist.
00:32:23,00:32:24,And I don't know why.
00:32:25,00:32:26,Yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:26,That's interesting.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"I was actually reading, as far as my research for this,"
00:32:28,00:32:31,the descriptions of the perfect hand.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Because, you know, it's a drawing of a hand,"
00:32:32,00:32:34,and we get how people have drawn hands.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"And it included mutton hands,"
00:32:36,00:32:38,but as a non-desirable thing.
00:32:38,00:32:40,This was...
00:32:40,00:32:41,"This was in the 18th century,"
00:32:41,00:32:44,"a guy wrote a book called ""Authorpedia""."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"And it's a guy called Nicholas Andree,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"and it's where we get orthopedics from,"
00:32:47,00:32:48,"is him, he invented it."
00:32:48,00:32:51,"And it actually means a correct or straight child,"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"hence the pedia,"
00:32:52,00:32:55,because it was a book of how to correct deformities in children.
00:32:55,00:32:58,And I've read his whole chapter on what makes the perfect hand.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"And he indeed said,"
00:33:00,00:33:04,"""Your hand should not look like shoulders of mutton."""
00:33:04,00:33:05,That's fair enough.
00:33:05,00:33:07,"Well, his shoulder of mutton thing"
00:33:07,00:33:10,was just a hand that was a bit too square.
00:33:10,00:33:11,"And I am looking at your hand now, James."
00:33:11,00:33:12,"And he said,"
00:33:12,00:33:14,"""Although they're useful for catching things,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,"they're the worst type of shape."""
00:33:16,00:33:16,Are you joking?
00:33:16,00:33:18,I've got beautiful hands.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"Yeah, don't listen, James."
00:33:19,00:33:20,You've got lovely piano players' hands.
00:33:20,00:33:20,Can I ask you...
00:33:20,00:33:22,I am good at catching things.
00:33:22,00:33:24,"I had to say that, didn't you?"
00:33:24,00:33:25,That looked very clear.
00:33:25,00:33:26,"Sip of this, Connery."
00:33:26,00:33:31,Can I check if you guys have these proportions?
00:33:31,00:33:31,OK.
00:33:31,00:33:33,I was actually quite impressed with mine
00:33:33,00:33:34,when I went through his list.
00:33:34,00:33:37,So your finger should be a bit round above and flat below.
00:33:37,00:33:39,"Your index tip,"
00:33:39,00:33:40,"the tip of your index finger,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,should end at the root of the middle fingernail.
00:33:42,00:33:44,If you're holding your hand up straight in front of you
00:33:44,00:33:46,"with your fingers together,"
00:33:46,00:33:47,tip of your index fingernail
00:33:47,00:33:50,should line up with the root of your middle fingernail.
00:33:50,00:33:51,Everyone got that?
00:33:51,00:33:51,"Close enough, yeah."
00:33:51,00:33:52,"Oh, um..."
00:33:52,00:33:54,"No, I'm a bit low, I think."
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Yeah, that's classic,"
00:33:56,00:33:57,and he says a bit low is bad.
00:33:57,00:33:59,What respect?
00:33:59,00:34:01,Does it mean I'm a bad podcaster?
00:34:01,00:34:03,Or does it mean I'm an evil person?
00:34:03,00:34:04,I'm hearing mutter.
00:34:04,00:34:08,I'm afraid it means just you've got...
00:34:08,00:34:08,It means you've got three weeks.
00:34:08,00:34:09,Shit happens.
00:34:09,00:34:14,The ring finger needs to reach the middle nail
00:34:14,00:34:15,of your middle finger.
00:34:15,00:34:18,"Oh, my God, I'm nowhere near that."
00:34:18,00:34:20,"James, this guy would have really had a field day"
00:34:20,00:34:21,"with your hands, actually."
00:34:21,00:34:22,"They're all over the place, aren't they?"
00:34:22,00:34:28,We're making it so like James is a Simpsons character.
00:34:28,00:34:29,I've only got four fingers.
00:34:29,00:34:31,I've got five because I'm God.
00:34:31,00:34:36,Can I just very quickly speak about highlighters?
00:34:36,00:34:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:36,00:34:40,So these little hands are pointing to a thing
00:34:40,00:34:42,that today we would just get a yellow felt tip
00:34:42,00:34:44,and color it in and people will be able to see it.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"Those things, the fluorescent highlighters,"
00:34:46,00:34:50,they were invented by accident in 1963.
00:34:51,00:34:54,By a guy called Francis J. Hon who was trying to make
00:34:54,00:34:56,a new kind of marker for children.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"And while he was experimenting,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,he got this yellow ink and he put it on
00:35:00,00:35:02,and he realized that it basically could still see
00:35:02,00:35:04,"the text in between it and he thought, ""Oh, I'll do that."""
00:35:04,00:35:08,And you know Stabilo Boss highlighters.
00:35:08,00:35:09,I feel like they're the biggie.
00:35:09,00:35:10,They're the biggie.
00:35:10,00:35:13,"They're kind of like square in shape, aren't they?"
00:35:13,00:35:16,And they've got a very flat tip.
00:35:16,00:35:20,And that flat tip was actually invented by accident.
00:35:20,00:35:22,So annoying.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"One day, some people at Stabilo,"
00:35:24,00:35:27,"in fact, it was Schwann Stabilo who was in charge"
00:35:27,00:35:28,of Stabilo Boss.
00:35:28,00:35:31,"He and his group, they were doing some presentation"
00:35:31,00:35:33,of this thing and it wasn't really working properly
00:35:33,00:35:36,and they slammed it onto the desk and it made it flat
00:35:36,00:35:37,at the bottom.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"They went, ""Oh, look, this works amazingly."""
00:35:39,00:35:41,That's according to their official website.
00:35:41,00:35:42,I don't believe it.
00:35:42,00:35:46,"One more thing on that, please."
00:35:47,00:35:51,"In 1996, a prisoner in the UK decided"
00:35:51,00:35:54,that he would try to get taken out of prison
00:35:54,00:35:56,and put into hospital by saying that he had jaundice
00:35:56,00:36:00,by coloring his entire body in with a yellow Stabilo Boss
00:36:00,00:36:01,highlighter.
00:36:01,00:36:05,And the prison spokesman said he carefully painted
00:36:05,00:36:07,"all of his body, even his private bits,"
00:36:07,00:36:09,with a yellow highlighter pen.
00:36:09,00:36:12,The problem was that he had made such a good job of it
00:36:12,00:36:14,that he would probably have died if his skin
00:36:14,00:36:15,was really that color.
00:36:15,00:36:16,Wow.
00:36:16,00:36:18,Who did his back?
00:36:18,00:36:19,Someone else has evolved.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:20,00:36:22,"What a soulmate's for, Anna, if not helping you out."
00:36:22,00:36:23,You're right.
00:36:23,00:36:26,Can I tell you about a really silly drawing
00:36:26,00:36:27,things controversy?
00:36:27,00:36:28,Okay.
00:36:28,00:36:29,This is great.
00:36:29,00:36:31,Let's go back to 1927.
00:36:31,00:36:33,Switzerland.
00:36:33,00:36:36,"There's a geologist called Albert Heim,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,"who at this point is about 70 years old,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"a very eminent Swiss geologist,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,and he got in a huge row with the Swiss Federal
00:36:42,00:36:45,Office of Topography over the way maps were
00:36:45,00:36:46,drawn as Switzerland.
00:36:46,00:36:46,Right?
00:36:46,00:36:47,Okay.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"So, you know those relief maps which show altitude?"
00:36:49,00:36:52,"You know, they look like they've got the mountains on."
00:36:52,00:36:53,"They look like if you touch them,"
00:36:53,00:36:54,they'd be all lumpy and bumpy.
00:36:54,00:36:56,"Yeah, I like those ones."
00:36:56,00:36:57,"Yeah, beautifully drawn."
00:36:57,00:36:59,And they often look like there's light
00:36:59,00:37:00,"and shade on them, right?"
00:37:00,00:37:04,Albert Heim's problem was that in Switzerland's
00:37:04,00:37:06,"two official map series,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,they were shaded as if the sunlight comes
00:37:08,00:37:09,from the northwest.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"And he said, this cannot stand."
00:37:12,00:37:15,There's no way the sunlight's coming from the northwest
00:37:15,00:37:16,"and hitting Switzerland, right?"
00:37:16,00:37:20,He said this was a lie that flew in the face of nature.
00:37:20,00:37:21,What a hero.
00:37:21,00:37:23,"It's very huge, eh?"
00:37:23,00:37:26,I bet he had good fingers.
00:37:26,00:37:29,"And he, I read this whole article"
00:37:29,00:37:31,"about the Northwest Illumination Problem,"
00:37:31,00:37:34,which was an established thing from the Middle Ages onwards.
00:37:34,00:37:36,"It was just the way people drew,"
00:37:36,00:37:37,"and there are loads of theories as to why,"
00:37:37,00:37:40,maybe it's because cartographers drew from left to right.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"So, you want to shade so that you..."
00:37:42,00:37:43,"Because you're right-handed, for instance."
00:37:43,00:37:45,"Because you're right-handed, basically."
00:37:45,00:37:46,"So, even in medieval maps,"
00:37:46,00:37:48,the light is falling from left to right.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"Or cartographers draw with the right hand,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"so the drawing doesn't cast a shadow,"
00:37:52,00:37:53,so they can see what they're doing.
00:37:53,00:37:54,"Basically, it's the same as that."
00:37:54,00:37:55,And wait just to double check.
00:37:55,00:37:57,The truth is that it would only ever be coming from
00:37:57,00:37:59,"the south if we're in the northern hemisphere,"
00:37:59,00:38:00,because if it gets to...
00:38:00,00:38:02,Either it's going above you or...
00:38:02,00:38:03,"Well, the sun moves, but generally,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,you don't get as much light coming from the northwest.
00:38:06,00:38:06,Cool.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"So, what happened next?"
00:38:08,00:38:08,Any guesses?
00:38:08,00:38:11,He was murdered.
00:38:14,00:38:16,"They turned it into a map of Australia,"
00:38:16,00:38:17,where it would have made sense.
00:38:17,00:38:19,They turned all of the maps upside down
00:38:19,00:38:21,"and traced them from the back,"
00:38:21,00:38:23,so that now they were on the right way.
00:38:23,00:38:23,Lovely.
00:38:23,00:38:24,Lovely.
00:38:24,00:38:25,"No, he didn't win."
00:38:25,00:38:26,This is still coming from the northwest.
00:38:26,00:38:27,He had nothing.
00:38:27,00:38:28,That's all.
00:38:28,00:38:31,Is that how we could tell from history
00:38:31,00:38:33,who was a left-hander versus right-hander?
00:38:33,00:38:35,If we looked at maps and the way the shadow falls.
00:38:35,00:38:36,"Nice idea, I don't know."
00:38:36,00:38:38,I think everyone was a right-hander in fairness.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Really?
00:38:39,00:38:40,"Oh, yeah, maybe."
00:38:40,00:38:42,They weren't as tolerant.
00:38:42,00:38:43,Drawn by the right-handers.
00:38:44,00:38:45,That's so interesting.
00:38:45,00:38:48,"Hey, what is the most famous drawing of hands in the world?"
00:38:48,00:38:49,And now think of that.
00:38:49,00:38:52,"Escher, where he draws his own hand."
00:38:52,00:38:53,I'm thinking Mike Landler.
00:38:53,00:38:54,Sistine Chapel.
00:38:54,00:38:57,"So, let's say that's number one."
00:38:57,00:38:58,What's number two?
00:38:58,00:39:01,What about the Mona Lisa?
00:39:01,00:39:03,"She has her hands one over the other, doesn't she?"
00:39:03,00:39:04,"Yeah, that's true."
00:39:04,00:39:05,That is a good one.
00:39:05,00:39:09,"It's not the main bit of the Mona Lisa, though, is it?"
00:39:09,00:39:10,What's number three?
00:39:10,00:39:11,I've got Jura's hands.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"The artist's Jura, the Praying Hands, which are..."
00:39:14,00:39:15,Albrecht Jura.
00:39:15,00:39:16,Yeah.
00:39:16,00:39:16,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:16,00:39:18,"Yeah, that is famous."
00:39:18,00:39:19,Those are very famous hands.
00:39:19,00:39:20,The Clefton Prater.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"Yeah, and people have them on their walls globally,"
00:39:22,00:39:23,if you're religious.
00:39:23,00:39:25,They're a very important piece of art.
00:39:25,00:39:27,They're from the 1500s.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"And for many, many years, it was thought that it was a sketch drawing"
00:39:30,00:39:34,that was then transferred onto a big altered piece that Jura did
00:39:34,00:39:35,as part of a commission.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"So, everyone thought that this is just a quick sketch,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,but it's become this massive famous thing.
00:39:39,00:39:43,"There's a new theory, which is being put forward by one of the curators"
00:39:43,00:39:48,"of a major museum, that he used it effectively as a business card."
00:39:48,00:39:49,"So, whenever people came and he said,"
00:39:49,00:39:50,"""You should get me as an artist,"""
00:39:50,00:39:52,"he would pull it out of his desk and say,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"""This is the kind of stuff that I'm capable of doing."""
00:39:54,00:39:55,I can draw hands.
00:39:55,00:39:56,"Yeah, I can draw hands."
00:39:56,00:39:57,"Hands are hard, yeah."
00:39:57,00:39:58,"That was famous, wasn't it?"
00:39:58,00:40:00,"And the Renaissance, it was like no one could draw."
00:40:00,00:40:01,It's like AI as well.
00:40:01,00:40:03,Which I know a question.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Now that we've seen all these bloody doodles
00:40:04,00:40:06,"going back to medieval times of people drawing,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"as far as I'm concerned, brilliant hands all over manuscripts."
00:40:09,00:40:11,These Renaissance artists who couldn't hack it.
00:40:11,00:40:13,"Those are cartoos of hands, though."
00:40:13,00:40:16,"You know, you want to really good hands are really hard to do."
00:40:16,00:40:18,And it's a nightmare for portrait artists
00:40:18,00:40:19,who have to get their subjects to do everything.
00:40:19,00:40:20,Can you just stick them in your pockets?
00:40:20,00:40:23,"You think it's possible that they could do hands perfectly,"
00:40:23,00:40:26,but everyone in the Renaissance had manky fingers like I do.
00:40:26,00:40:27,That would be it.
00:40:27,00:40:28,A lot of mutton theory.
00:40:28,00:40:37,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:40:37,00:40:39,and that is my fact.
00:40:39,00:40:42,My fact this week is that there was a football match
00:40:42,00:40:46,in Germany last year where one team was made up entirely
00:40:46,00:40:48,of players called Krotanovic.
00:40:48,00:40:49,Brilliant.
00:40:49,00:40:52,So confusing for anyone playing them.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"In fact, apparently a lot of teams often think"
00:40:54,00:40:58,Krotanovic is the sponsor of the team on the jersey.
00:40:58,00:41:00,"I read that, but then they are actually sponsored"
00:41:00,00:41:02,"by Krotanovic, some of the players as well."
00:41:02,00:41:04,What's Krotanovic?
00:41:04,00:41:06,Krotanovic is a surname.
00:41:06,00:41:08,"Yeah, and a lot of these guys who play for the team"
00:41:08,00:41:11,"have their own company, so they put that on this dress."
00:41:11,00:41:16,So this is a bottom of the league German football team
00:41:16,00:41:19,"who play in the town of Florsheim,"
00:41:19,00:41:22,"and this is a tiny town, 20,000 population."
00:41:22,00:41:24,They have a team that was put together by a guy
00:41:24,00:41:29,"who's called Harris Krotanovic, and he thought,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,"who can I get to be reliable to come up to practice,"
00:41:31,00:41:32,to show up?
00:41:32,00:41:33,Why not my family?
00:41:33,00:41:34,Why not my uncles?
00:41:34,00:41:35,Why not my second cousins?
00:41:36,00:41:37,A few buddies came along.
00:41:37,00:41:41,"But for one match at least, when you walked onto the pitch,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,"you were playing one name, Krotanovic."
00:41:44,00:41:46,It's like the opposite of nepotism.
00:41:46,00:41:47,There should be a word for when you just get
00:41:47,00:41:50,roped into a career that you didn't really want.
00:41:50,00:41:52,You're guilted.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"They all speak Bosnian on the pitch as well,"
00:41:54,00:41:56,because they're all from this area of the border
00:41:56,00:41:59,between Montenegro and Serbia and Bosnia.
00:41:59,00:42:02,"So yeah, that's where they're from originally."
00:42:02,00:42:05,"And this team, they're actually really successful as well,"
00:42:05,00:42:07,"because, well, I mean, relatively,"
00:42:07,00:42:10,"they're in the 11th division in Germany,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,"but they were in the 13th division,"
00:42:12,00:42:14,"and they got moved up two divisions,"
00:42:14,00:42:16,"because they were the second team,"
00:42:16,00:42:18,"and their first team were doing really badly,"
00:42:18,00:42:19,so they swapped them around.
00:42:19,00:42:20,Right.
00:42:20,00:42:23,"Because they also have a few players who aren't Krotanovic's,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,"but who are Serbian and Montenegro,"
00:42:26,00:42:27,"and who have played in higher leagues,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,so they're kind of better than they should be.
00:42:29,00:42:32,How do those guys feel about being shackled
00:42:32,00:42:35,to the floor of the leagues by the millions of Krotanovic's
00:42:35,00:42:37,who they have to turn up with every week?
00:42:37,00:42:40,"I think the truth is that on a normal week,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,they probably have about four or five Krotanovic's
00:42:42,00:42:43,"playing for them,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,"but occasionally, they bring out a full multiple."
00:42:45,00:42:46,I hope this is being filmed.
00:42:46,00:42:48,It sounds like welcome to Wrexham.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"If they're making their way up the leagues, imagine."
00:42:50,00:42:53,"That's a really good point, as even more wholesome, isn't it?"
00:42:53,00:42:55,Should we buy them?
00:42:55,00:42:56,Like Ryan Reynolds?
00:42:56,00:42:57,Should we be the Ryan Reynolds
00:42:57,00:42:59,of 11th division German football?
00:42:59,00:43:01,I think we definitely could get on their jersey.
00:43:01,00:43:02,We could be the sponsors.
00:43:02,00:43:04,We'd have to change our name to Krotanovic as well.
00:43:04,00:43:05,I think it's worth it.
00:43:05,00:43:09,Do you know what the German football team is?
00:43:09,00:43:11,"Well, no, I don't actually."
00:43:11,00:43:12,Manshaft.
00:43:12,00:43:14,Great stuff.
00:43:14,00:43:15,"Just every time I see it,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,"whenever there's a World Cup on, it makes me laugh."
00:43:17,00:43:19,But you get this every now and then
00:43:19,00:43:22,with families playing football.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"The Gojonsons, famously."
00:43:24,00:43:26,"So Ida Gojonson, who used to play for Bolton,"
00:43:26,00:43:27,"he's Icelandic,"
00:43:27,00:43:30,"and his son Arnor was also playing for Iceland,"
00:43:30,00:43:34,"and there was one game where Ida was playing,"
00:43:34,00:43:35,"and he got taken off,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,and his son came on instead of him.
00:43:37,00:43:38,It was like a substitution.
00:43:38,00:43:39,"They were in the same squad,"
00:43:39,00:43:42,"but they were on the same pitch for like a micro millisecond,"
00:43:42,00:43:45,"just before they passed over, and then, yeah."
00:43:45,00:43:46,That's very good.
00:43:46,00:43:47,James is a goal fan.
00:43:47,00:43:50,Do you know the work and recent playing
00:43:50,00:43:52,of Jung Un Lee 6th?
00:43:52,00:43:55,"This is going to be a Kim Jong Un thing, isn't it?"
00:43:55,00:43:56,"No, no, no."
00:43:56,00:43:59,She was a US women's open champion.
00:43:59,00:44:00,"She was ranked,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,"I think, at her highest at seventh in the world."
00:44:03,00:44:04,Is she Korean?
00:44:04,00:44:10,"Yeah, she is, and she's called Jung Un Lee 6th"
00:44:10,00:44:13,"because there have been five other Jung Un Lee's,"
00:44:13,00:44:15,"and in order for them all to differentiate themselves,"
00:44:15,00:44:18,they've attached a number to the end of their name.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"Oh, really?"
00:44:19,00:44:20,"So that would happen in a normal family,"
00:44:20,00:44:23,like if Andy's father and grandfather
00:44:23,00:44:24,"were all called Andy Murray,"
00:44:24,00:44:26,"you would be Andy Murray the third, right?"
00:44:26,00:44:28,"Yes, but these are not family members."
00:44:28,00:44:31,These all happen to just be players with the same name.
00:44:31,00:44:35,"So yeah, so she officially goes by Lee 6th."
00:44:35,00:44:38,"So Lee, and then the number six right after her surname,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,"and then you've got one, two, three, four, and five,"
00:44:40,00:44:41,who are all golfers.
00:44:41,00:44:43,So it's quite funny when you see anything written about her.
00:44:43,00:44:44,That's sort of...
00:44:44,00:44:46,It looks like you're reading something about royalty.
00:44:46,00:44:46,Great.
00:44:46,00:44:48,"Brady Fiegel, have you heard of him?"
00:44:48,00:44:48,No.
00:44:48,00:44:51,"Brady Fiegel's a minor league baseball pitcher,"
00:44:51,00:44:53,and he's six foot four.
00:44:53,00:44:58,He's got glasses where he's got a sort of the rim
00:44:58,00:44:59,"of the glasses sit over the top,"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"but allow for the lens itself not to be covered in a rim,"
00:45:02,00:45:03,if you know what I mean.
00:45:03,00:45:04,So...
00:45:04,00:45:04,Yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:05,So frameless at the bottom.
00:45:05,00:45:08,Frameless at the bottom is a quicker way of saying that.
00:45:08,00:45:09,Underboob glasses.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"Yeah, that's actually the way I'm saying it."
00:45:11,00:45:12,Underboob glasses.
00:45:12,00:45:16,He's got red hair and...
00:45:16,00:45:17,I'm giving you all the...
00:45:17,00:45:20,"I'm giving you some for underboob glasses, red hair."
00:45:20,00:45:21,Is this a police line?
00:45:21,00:45:21,Now draw them.
00:45:21,00:45:22,Did he take your car?
00:45:22,00:45:25,I was listening to a white noise in bed.
00:45:26,00:45:31,You had a smash and there's a baseball bat going through your car with dope.
00:45:31,00:45:35,"All you saw as he went away was the shock of orange hair,"
00:45:35,00:45:38,"and him holding up his underboob glasses going,"
00:45:38,00:45:40,"""See you later, sucker!"""
00:45:40,00:45:44,"So he had an elbow problem that needed surgery,"
00:45:44,00:45:45,so he had that done.
00:45:45,00:45:47,"And then six months later,"
00:45:47,00:45:49,"the doctor who performed the elbow surgery is told,"
00:45:49,00:45:52,"""Your patient, Bradley Fiegel, is ready for his surgery."""
00:45:52,00:45:54,"And he thought, ""I did this six months ago."""
00:45:54,00:45:58,"And so it turns out there are two Bradley Fiegel's,"
00:45:58,00:46:00,"both who wear underboob glasses,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,"who are six foot four with red hair,"
00:46:02,00:46:03,who look exactly the same.
00:46:03,00:46:04,Both car thieves.
00:46:04,00:46:08,"Both have the same name,"
00:46:08,00:46:10,and both had to have the exact same surgery
00:46:10,00:46:13,from the exact same doctor for the bit of the elbow.
00:46:13,00:46:15,And now they are aware of each other.
00:46:15,00:46:17,That's how they became aware of each other.
00:46:17,00:46:20,"And they did a DNA test, didn't they, recently,"
00:46:20,00:46:22,to see if they were actually related.
00:46:22,00:46:22,And?
00:46:22,00:46:22,No.
00:46:22,00:46:24,I think to get the media to shut the hell up
00:46:24,00:46:26,about these two Bradley Fiegel's.
00:46:26,00:46:26,Wow.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"It turned out they're not related at all,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,but they do both have ancestors from Germany.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"According to one of these fake, you know, 23 and me things."
00:46:34,00:46:37,"Thought what you would have known from their stername Fiegel,"
00:46:37,00:46:37,wouldn't you?
00:46:37,00:46:37,Yes.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"Right, right, right, right."
00:46:39,00:46:42,"There was a charity football game in Bungie in 2012,"
00:46:42,00:46:44,where 70 people played football.
00:46:44,00:46:46,"It was Bungie, not the naked guy from two facts ago."
00:46:46,00:46:47,From the Aboriginal.
00:46:47,00:46:48,From Brown's mission.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"We shortened, we nicknamed him Bungie,"
00:46:50,00:46:51,because we're mates.
00:46:51,00:46:51,Right.
00:46:51,00:46:52,But he was called Bungery.
00:46:52,00:46:53,"Oh, right, okay."
00:46:53,00:46:54,Like Dungery.
00:46:54,00:46:56,"And this is Bungie, which I think is..."
00:46:56,00:46:59,It's unusual to have that word twice in one episode.
00:46:59,00:47:01,"It's like Bartomein-Hoff syndrome, isn't it?"
00:47:01,00:47:01,Yeah.
00:47:01,00:47:03,You'll see Bungies everywhere now.
00:47:03,00:47:06,"There was a charity game in Bungie in Suffolk in 2012,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,where 70 people with the same name played.
00:47:08,00:47:11,And they were all called Bungie.
00:47:11,00:47:13,They should have raised money by going Bungie jumping.
00:47:13,00:47:14,What were they thinking?
00:47:14,00:47:14,Nice.
00:47:14,00:47:16,That's a big game.
00:47:16,00:47:17,How did you manage to get 70 people there?
00:47:17,00:47:19,"Because it was all the officials as well,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,"all the mascots, the match doctor,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,and also quite a lot of people who went to see the match
00:47:23,00:47:23,were called Bungie.
00:47:23,00:47:25,They were all called Bungie?
00:47:25,00:47:26,"Yeah, and it was all complete coincidence."
00:47:26,00:47:30,I didn't know there were that many Bungies knocking about.
00:47:30,00:47:30,I'm very surprised.
00:47:30,00:47:31,I know.
00:47:31,00:47:35,"There's 455, according to the census at the time."
00:47:35,00:47:39,"And with 70 of them, that's close to 15% of all the UK Bungies"
00:47:39,00:47:41,that showed up to this one spot.
00:47:41,00:47:42,Although it wasn't all UK.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"There was one who came from Australia,"
00:47:44,00:47:46,who was then sent off a swearing.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Brilliant.
00:47:47,00:47:48,Brilliant.
00:47:48,00:47:50,That way for a charity game.
00:47:50,00:47:53,"And they'd advertised for Bungies, which is why,"
00:47:53,00:47:56,in case you hadn't figured that out when you were listening to this.
00:47:56,00:48:00,It used to be really common to give kids the same names in the UK.
00:48:00,00:48:03,"And in Scotland, it was the case until the 19th century"
00:48:03,00:48:07,"that it was relatively common, especially on the island of Skye"
00:48:07,00:48:09,and in other Western Isles.
00:48:09,00:48:13,"There was a survey done of people who lived in the 19th century there,"
00:48:13,00:48:17,and there were 462 households that had two sons that shared a name.
00:48:17,00:48:18,Really?
00:48:18,00:48:21,And 232 were two daughters shared a name.
00:48:21,00:48:22,So there's quite a lot of it.
00:48:22,00:48:24,And it was mostly in this area.
00:48:24,00:48:25,"And they think what happened was,"
00:48:25,00:48:29,basically they had real rules for naming your kids.
00:48:29,00:48:31,The first son will be named after his father's father.
00:48:31,00:48:33,Second son named after his mother's father.
00:48:33,00:48:35,Third son named after the father.
00:48:35,00:48:38,First daughter named after the mother's mother.
00:48:38,00:48:40,"And what happens with that is,"
00:48:40,00:48:44,eventually the number of names just gets lower and lower and lower.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"Because like from one generation, that's fine."
00:48:46,00:48:48,"But then the next generation, suddenly everyone's called Mary."
00:48:48,00:48:51,"And then four generations, everyone's called John."
00:48:51,00:48:52,And that's what happens.
00:48:52,00:48:54,And so that really happened until quite a long time.
00:48:54,00:48:58,What self-inflicted confusion that must have wrought over the island of Skye?
00:48:58,00:48:59,"Well, yeah, it's funny, isn't it?"
00:48:59,00:49:01,"Because there's another thing where people name,"
00:49:01,00:49:04,people call each other by the wrong names within families.
00:49:04,00:49:07,"So there's a thing, if you've got lots of siblings,"
00:49:07,00:49:10,you might have found that one of your parents will say Blar.
00:49:10,00:49:11,"No, Blar."
00:49:11,00:49:12,"No, Anna or whatever."
00:49:12,00:49:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:12,00:49:13,Have you had that?
00:49:13,00:49:14,"That happens a lot, yeah."
00:49:14,00:49:15,"Christ, yes."
00:49:15,00:49:15,Right.
00:49:15,00:49:17,They run through the full gammo of names.
00:49:17,00:49:18,"Do they ever throw in the dog's name as well, Anna?"
00:49:18,00:49:19,"Absolutely, yeah."
00:49:19,00:49:19,OK.
00:49:19,00:49:21,So there's a reason behind that.
00:49:21,00:49:22,Which is Toffo.
00:49:22,00:49:25,It's just unbelievable that you think your child will be called that.
00:49:25,00:49:28,"I've looked at you before, Anna, and thought Toffo."
00:49:28,00:49:33,"But there's a reason behind this which is really interesting,"
00:49:33,00:49:36,which is that it's to do with how your brain stores names.
00:49:36,00:49:38,"And basically, in your brain,"
00:49:38,00:49:40,you have two envelopes in which you keep all the names.
00:49:40,00:49:42,"In one envelope, you keep..."
00:49:42,00:49:43,Stop saying envelope.
00:49:43,00:49:45,"These are metaphorical envelopes, aren't they?"
00:49:45,00:49:46,"No, no, no."
00:49:46,00:49:47,"No, they're like the computer icons."
00:49:47,00:49:48,They're not metaphorical.
00:49:48,00:49:49,They're just small.
00:49:49,00:49:54,"So one of them, one envelope, is for really close acquaintances."
00:49:54,00:49:56,So immediate family.
00:49:56,00:49:58,People who really matter to you.
00:49:58,00:50:00,"The other, for everyone else."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"So when you're trying to name someone,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,"one of your children, obviously,"
00:50:04,00:50:06,"someone who's from envelope number one,"
00:50:06,00:50:10,people are almost always taking the wrong name out of the right folder.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"And that is why a parent, like your mum,"
00:50:12,00:50:14,will cycle through all of your siblings' names
00:50:14,00:50:17,"and the dog's name before they get to your name,"
00:50:17,00:50:18,because those names are all from the right folder.
00:50:18,00:50:19,"Yeah, it doesn't make sense."
00:50:19,00:50:20,It's just that they're the wrong names.
00:50:20,00:50:20,Yeah.
00:50:20,00:50:23,"You know what, I put the dog's name in just the drawer below."
00:50:23,00:50:25,"I wouldn't have the dog in the same folder,"
00:50:25,00:50:26,but maybe I'm a better parent.
00:50:26,00:50:31,"Hey, just on Scottish names,"
00:50:31,00:50:34,"we were talking about a Scottish person before, Robert Brown."
00:50:34,00:50:37,He was a Scottish botanist who lived in the 1800s.
00:50:37,00:50:39,"So just for anyone who's listening,"
00:50:39,00:50:40,"who's thinking, ""Wait, Robert Brown,"
00:50:40,00:50:44,"the botanist and bootmaker born in the 1800s?"""
00:50:44,00:50:45,"No, not that one."
00:50:45,00:50:48,"For anyone who's thinking, ""Oh, Robert Brown,"
00:50:48,00:50:51,the Scottish botanist who also was the first person
00:50:51,00:50:52,"to use the word gadget in a book?"""
00:50:52,00:50:54,"No, not that botanist."
00:50:54,00:50:56,"For anyone who's thinking, ""Robert Brown,"
00:50:56,00:50:59,the Scottish botanist who was also the polar explorer
00:50:59,00:51:00,"from the 1800s?"""
00:51:00,00:51:01,"No, not that one either."
00:51:01,00:51:05,"Apparently, there were multiple amazing botanists"
00:51:05,00:51:07,"called Robert Brown who all existed in the 1800s,"
00:51:07,00:51:09,who went and made major discoveries.
00:51:10,00:51:12,And that was a problem to the point.
00:51:12,00:51:15,I'll tell you where it's at.
00:51:15,00:51:16,"Because Robert Brown,"
00:51:16,00:51:18,"the one who wrote gadget for the first time ever,"
00:51:18,00:51:21,had to call himself Robert Brown of Campster
00:51:21,00:51:24,to differentiate himself when people confused him
00:51:24,00:51:25,with the Robert Brown of Brown noise.
00:51:25,00:51:27,What did you say called himself?
00:51:27,00:51:29,He called himself Campster.
00:51:29,00:51:30,He was from...
00:51:30,00:51:32,"So he said ""Hampster"" for some reason."
00:51:32,00:51:34,"Whenever he collected a new sample,"
00:51:34,00:51:35,he'd stuff it into his cheeks.
00:51:35,00:51:37,There's a group of people in Papua New Guinea
00:51:37,00:51:39,called the Orocaeva people.
00:51:39,00:51:41,"And they have a brilliant system, right?"
00:51:41,00:51:43,"So if you have the same name as someone else,"
00:51:43,00:51:45,"as long as you're on good terms with them,"
00:51:45,00:51:47,"you count each other as what's called a sasso,"
00:51:47,00:51:51,"a namesake, and you are basically the same person"
00:51:51,00:51:52,in the eyes of that society.
00:51:52,00:51:54,Like you can shag their wives and...
00:51:54,00:51:56,"No, that's true."
00:51:56,00:51:57,So it's really interesting.
00:51:57,00:51:59,"If you're the younger sasso,"
00:51:59,00:52:04,you will consult the elder at every stage of your ritual life.
00:52:04,00:52:05,"You don't have to ask them,"
00:52:05,00:52:06,"""What should I have for supper tonight?"""
00:52:06,00:52:07,But when you do your confirmation and stuff.
00:52:07,00:52:08,Exactly like that.
00:52:08,00:52:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:52:09,00:52:12,"And as the older one ages,"
00:52:12,00:52:13,the younger one has a responsibility
00:52:13,00:52:16,to provide him with firewood and other provisions.
00:52:16,00:52:18,"And if the older one dies without a will,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,then you have to sort out his affairs for him.
00:52:20,00:52:22,"And your family groups, your kin groups,"
00:52:22,00:52:23,"are kind of knitted together,"
00:52:23,00:52:25,because it's understood that you
00:52:25,00:52:27,and this other person are the same person.
00:52:27,00:52:28,What a burden.
00:52:28,00:52:30,And is that just if I bumped into someone at the party
00:52:30,00:52:32,"called Anatojinsky, who is a tedious don?"
00:52:32,00:52:34,I'd then be stuck intertwined with this person.
00:52:34,00:52:36,"Yes, but she'd be stuck in to find"
00:52:36,00:52:37,with someone who's very rude
00:52:37,00:52:39,about a lot of other people all the time for no good reason.
00:52:39,00:52:40,"So, you know, we all have across the bear, aren't we?"
00:52:40,00:52:45,"All right, that's all the system."
00:52:45,00:52:52,"Okay, that is it."
00:52:52,00:52:54,That is all of our facts.

00:53:10,00:53:13,"Um, but I had to be Harkin James,"
00:53:13,00:53:14,because someone else already had James Harkin.

00:53:25,00:53:27,I literally only went in
00:53:27,00:53:28,because I wanted to read someone's Blue Sky.
00:53:28,00:53:30,"Wow, he doesn't even have a profile picture."
00:53:30,00:53:30,This is big.
00:53:30,00:53:31,I'm following.
00:53:31,00:53:33,Follow one follower.
00:53:34,00:53:35,Okay.
00:53:35,00:53:36,"Everyone follow James,"
00:53:36,00:53:39,and he'll feel sort of pressure to generate content.
