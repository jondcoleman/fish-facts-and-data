00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.920
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.200
 from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.840
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshensky. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.760
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.240
 with fact number one, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that sodium citrate, the chemical

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.040
 you add to cheese to make it melty nacho cheese, contains sodium, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.440
 or according to the chemical symbols, N, A, C, H and O. Unbelievable. And this is proof of

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.720
 living in a matrix, right? Yes, very unimaginative matrix. So I was watching a YouTube clip by a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.520
 person called Minut Food, and they showed an experiment of how to make American cheese from

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.720
 any kind of cheese. So you could just take any kind of cheese and add sodium citrate,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.160
 and it will make it more melty. And in that, that's when they get satisfied. Although I've

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.320
 looked since logs, and it is kind of all over the internet, but right. Okay, it's not like some

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.280
 people. I think that we're doing the world a favor by hopefully putting more on the internet,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.440
 because it is amazing. Yeah, this podcast is about what I learned this week, and this is a thing

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 that I recently learned. It's a melting salt, isn't it sodium citrate? So when you melt a cheese,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.720
 the fats and the proteins separate out from each other, and they, but it can get very lumpy.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.800
 It kind of forms like a mesh. Normally, it's like a big solid thing with proteins and fats and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.040
 moisture and stuff. It kind of all spreads out, and now you've got this mesh of stuff. And the more

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.000
 meshier it is, the more melty it is, basically. Yes. And the sodium, as far as I understand it,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.480
 it replaces calcium ions. And the calcium ions are the thing that made the cheese proteins all bond

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 together. So the more sodium citrate there is, the smoother the meltiness gets. And it does exactly

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.120
 the same thing in another thing that needs to get thinner often. Oh, it should be.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:24.480
 A zen pick is actually made out of osmium. Blood thinners. Really? It's put in lots of blood thinners,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.640
 exactly the same thing. And it's usually in when you donate blood, they need to add something to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.800
 keep it from clotting after you've donated it before it's given to someone. And they pop in

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.760
 basically nacho cheese. Sodium citrate also helps your body to create hydrogen and ions,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 which lowers acidity in your muscles and stops you from feeling the burn when you do lots of

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.040
 exercise. Oh, cool. I'm not exactly sure of the chemical process of how it works, but it does

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.360
 work. And so some people take sodium citrate supplements. Well, they might use it if they've

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.040
 got a urinary tract infection, because it can be used to relieve discomfort in those.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.640
 Really? I presume by just selectively melting bits of urinary tract. I've understood the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.400
 science. Does it work if you kind of like shove some melty cheese up there? I think that's that is

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.240
 some optimal, but it will in a pinch. That's what you've got. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nacho cheese is

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.760
 not a cheese. Not a cheese. It's a cheese product made from cheese, because as James says, you can

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.160
 put any old cheese you shove it in and put this stuff in, you melt it, that becomes the nacho

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.640
 cheesy sauce. So there's no sort of core cheese that produces nacho cheese. So nacho cheese is

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.280
 not a cheese. It's a cheese derivative. It's an idea. Very clear if you eat it. It's weird,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.240
 because it's taking your cheese and it is making it worse, isn't it? I mean, it's making it more

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.320
 useful because it can spread over stuff. I think the thing is about food is it's not completely

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.200
 objective. What I disagree about. Do you think everyone who likes nacho cheese is just straight

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.240
 up wrong? Well, I have brain on my nachos. That's what I do. And it's a bit harder to melt, but it's

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.880
 fine. The other thing about American cheese is it was invented in Switzerland by a Canadian.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.520
 I think we've mentioned it before. It's James Kraft, who came up with the idea of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.440
 extending the shelf life of cheese by putting all these salts in it. Interesting.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.840
 Have we mentioned the competition we did? On stage? On stage? On our last tour? Oh, no.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.400
 We tried to break a record for the most slices of American cheese eaten in a minute and dry.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.600
 Yeah. So it was a Guinness World Record. I brought Craig Glenday, who's the editor-in-chief,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.800
 on stage for us to attempt to break it. And we sucked. It was really hard. 10 slices in a minute

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.880
 without being able to lubricate your mouth is nuts. It was too much. James, you got the most,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.000
 I think. I think James did pretty well. I did, respectively. And you guys did a small corner?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.320
 I won. I was just so pulled by the quality of the cheese. I found the hardest thing was taking

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.800
 off the bits of plastic because you had to do that as well. And I think the pros have like a

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.560
 special flip that they do with a wrist that kind of flips the cheese out and helps and tweets it.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.960
 But I think I had four in a bit. Yeah, you did amazing. And I've had like one and he'd been

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.200
 practising for a week before. Yeah, I've been practising for so long, but he only told me on

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.480
 the night I couldn't drink. If you can drink in between, you can get a lot more done. Do you

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.840
 know what you can do in fondue instead of add sodium citrate and what they do do, in fact?

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.600
 White wine, you had sweat, didn't you? Yeah, I guess you know how to make fondue.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.160
 And his reaction there was like, she'd asked they've done between one and a million and I guessed

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.880
 it. I was thinking, how has James worked out the chemical processes and then figured out that

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.760
 wine does that? Oh, no, he just knows fondue recipes. So that's what the wine does in fondue.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.800
 Dry white wine has the same kind of acidity and that helps the cheese not congeal in exactly the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.360
 same way. It stops the cacine proteins binding together. Does the alcohol burn away or does it?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.320
 Most of it burns away, but it is why fondue smells as like you'll notice of alcohol,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.760
 which I've always thought it's such a strong smell. I don't think I've ever eaten it sober. So like

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.160
 so much alcohol around anyway, I've never noticed the smell of the fondue. You're so right. It's just

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.360
 in the air, isn't it? Who invented nachos? Have we said this before? I'm not sure we have. Mr.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.240
 Mr. Nacho. Mr. Nacho. Actually, not Mr. Nacho, Mr. Anaya. But his first name was Nacho,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.880
 which is short for Ignacio. And he created them in 1943 at the Victory Club in Mexico,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.040
 Coahuila. And it was a restaurant close to the border. And a lot of American service people

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.600
 who were kind of training for World War II were there. And their families as well. And they all

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.880
 came in one day and said, we want some food. This guy was the maitre d' but the chef had disappeared.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.040
 As he said, don't worry, I'll make you something. And he ran into the kitchen and all he could find

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.760
 was these cheese and bits of tostadas and a few jalapenos. And he put them all under the grill.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.160
 And the new dish was born. So you're saying it was kind of discovered by accident, in a way?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.240
 Maybe. Did he only had, did he have sodium citrate? Then did he have to,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.640
 did he have like a big jar of chemicals? And it's like one of these?

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.680
 Exactly. Nacho cheese, as we would know it today, like the real, the stuff you can kind of squirt

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.640
 onto the top of it, didn't exist then that existed a bit later. I believe he did get a promotion to

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.320
 head chef or something off the back of it. Interesting. I didn't know if that was a promotion.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.400
 I thought they were just on different career streams. Like I would have thought maitre d

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.600
 then goes to hotel manager. Okay. Well, he just changed career basically on the back of the major

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.280
 invention. Because he had this moment of, it just had this moment of glory. That's 100% agree.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.840
 I just agree with you, Andy. I just, I hadn't put that together. And now I think about

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.760
 having worked in hotels for lots of my life. That absolutely isn't a promotion at all.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.680
 It's very much a sidestep. It's a pivot. Yeah. And then he eventually left. He opened up his own

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.080
 restaurant, which he called nachos restaurant. Though I feel like he missed a trick. I feel

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.440
 like he should have called it, let them eat nachos. That's my title because his wife was called

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.400
 Marie Antoinette. And that just, yeah, just would have been fitting. But you would have had to have

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.920
 big brackets. The owner's wife is called Marie Antoinette. It's a great story for when you're

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.640
 sitting down saying, why'd you call it that? Another thing from Mexico, another food from

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:21.920
 Mexico rather, Caesar salad. Invented in Tijuana in the 1920s. In fact, in not only in the 1920s

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.400
 and 1924, because they've just had the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad, a chef called Caesar

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.760
 invented it, which is why it's called Caesar salad. It's actually got nothing to do with Julia Caesar.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.960
 I didn't know that. No. That feels like the kind of thing you're learning here on your first day.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.800
 I'm so embarrassed. This is actually a suspiciously similar origin story to the nacho thing.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.840
 He had a big crowd in the kitchen at his restaurant, but he only had some lettuce and

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.760
 crostini and a dressing. Yeah. But it makes it seem like, wait a minute, was it a Caesar salad dressing?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.920
 Because it feels like that's really part of the invention. Yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah, but who

00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.320
 invented God? You know. Here's another surprising one. Where was the burrito invented? Oh, like

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.200
 Nantwich or something. During the Pina Colada festival. There was a big rush at the Pina Colada

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.760
 festival. Someone said, we need something to mop up all this Pina Colada and the chef only had

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:19.280
 some pulled pork. Got it in wine? Burrito. Okay. Well, for me, Mexico, because it means Little

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.800
 Dog Key in Spanish, burrito. Absolutely. I've only got a very silly answer here. So yeah. North Korea.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:32.800
 This surprisingly, it was invented in 2011. This is one of the weird ass claims that Kim Jong-il

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.960
 invented the burrito that was released by the local news sources of North Korea,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.360
 who said that its popularity has been booming ever since 2011 and his invention of it.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.800
 It's one of those false memory things where you think you had the miniature childhood,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.920
 but actually, who saw a burrito before 2011? Exactly. I never did. No one. I think it's no one.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.960
 They actually have in their real history, or sorry, the alternative Western history,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.400
 they did tend to be eaten in Mexico. And then there was this massive program called the

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.440
 Braquellos program in the 40s and 50s, where the US was short on workers and there were loads of

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.760
 Mexicans who wanted to come to America. So they offered them loads of work permits. And Americans

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.400
 thought, well, a good way to feed these laborers who of course, they were paying lower wages and

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.080
 they would pay Americans is to give them these burritos, which we know they're into. So they gave

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.360
 them all burritos every day, two burritos a day. But all the immigrants came from Central Mexico,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.680
 where actually no one ate burritos. And they hated them. And it was part of the reason for a huge

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.840
 resentment was the fact that they were being force fed these. And I don't think they were the great

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.840
 burritos. They were like a bit of rap and some beans, no sauce. Before all of this, of course,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:48.240
 we had the Aztec and the Maya and the pre-Columbian Americans. And they all let Maze, a lot of their

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.120
 thing is to do with Maze and like tortillas are all made of Maze. So it's carried on. But the

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.720
 interesting thing about that is if you just eat Maze, it's not very good for you. I mean, it's

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.760
 fine, but it's not going to give you much of what you need to stay alive. But they came up with a

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.960
 thing called nixtamalization. Basically, you soak the grains of Maze, and then you cook them over

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.640
 wood ashes. And then there's like an invisible outer coating of the Maze and that gets removed.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.960
 And then it's much easier to grind, much easier to cook, and it enhances the amount of protein in

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.520
 the Maze. And it's so much better that you can basically look at whatever this was invented by

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.920
 looking at old fires and where the Maze has been cooked. You can look at it and you can see all these

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.960
 Mesoamerican civilizations growing when each area kind of works out how to nixtamalize them.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.680
 Really? Yeah, it's incredible. And when the Europeans went over and brought Maze back,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.560
 there's lots of areas that kind of started eating Maze in the old world. But they still got

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.120
 quite malnourished because none of them knew how to nixtamalize things. Oh, really? Yeah.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.880
 It's crazy. I never even heard that word before this week. And they also have that thing where

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.640
 they eat the fungus that grows on Maze in Mexico, don't they? Which actually looks kind of delicious

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.680
 and they have it corn smut. No, have you had it? What's corn? No, I hate funguses. Oh, sorry,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.840
 that's why you took it. Of all the funguses that I'm ever going to try, maybe a black truffle,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.880
 but a piece of corn smut? Probably not. It's a disease and it looks like a sort of black

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.880
 lump of mold. And there was quite a fun story in 2014 where there was a farmer called Nat Bradform

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.720
 and he was asked to grow some corn for a chef, quite a famous chef called Sean Brock,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.840
 who's a big deal in America. And he wanted this corn to be grown for his handmade tortillas and

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.440
 poor Nat woke up one day when I went to his fields and overnight the whole thing destroyed by fungus.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.680
 Corn smut everywhere. So he called the chef, you know, in tears. I'm so sorry, I've destroyed

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.760
 your restaurant. And obviously Sean, being a chef and knowing the ways of the Mexicans,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.040
 was absolutely delighted. It was like, you've got a delicacy there. You've just accidentally

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.120
 grown overnight this fantastic delicacy that I'll incorporate into my Mexican restaurant food.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.240
 Corn smut pizzas, I'll add. Corn smut pizzas, there you go.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.600
 Do you guys know Taco Bell? You must know Taco Bell, massive American chain.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.280
 I don't think I've ever been to one. Do we have them over here? Oh yeah. Oh, do we?

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.200
 Well, there's one within walking distance of my house. Yeah, they're here. They're not massive

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.680
 here, but in America, they're very, very big. And globally, they have places all over the world.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.120
 One place they don't have is Mexico. And they've tried twice. The first time they went in,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.760
 they sort of went all out just saying, this is a fast food version of what you guys have here.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.480
 So have it. They said, no, it doesn't make sense. Second time they went in, which was years later,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.440
 they tried to push it as not Mexican food, but American food, while still having the

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.400
 menu that they have. And they even advertised it by saying, it's not Mexican, it's just

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.280
 something else. I think that's a much better strategy, because yeah, Mexicans would deny

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.880
 it was Mexican at all. Americans deny it's American. And tacos weren't hard.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.640
 It's insulting either way. It's insulting if you say this is your cuisine. It's insulting if you say

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.000
 this is our cuisine. They don't have any Taco Bells in North Korea either. It's for the same reason.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.520
 Yeah. They invented it. Exactly. Did you hear of Diana Kennedy? No. She was very cool. She's

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.040
 one of the people who has contributed to saving or not saving, but preserving huge amounts of the

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.800
 diversity of Mexican food. Because obviously it's a huge country. It's got hundreds of different

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.240
 cuisines in it. And she spent 60 years driving around the country, doing apprenticeships in

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.640
 bakeries, like going to individual villages and saying, what do you eat? Let me learn how to make

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.440
 it. I wanted to make it myself. And she was awarded not only. I think she might be the only

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.400
 person ever to have been awarded an MBE for services to Mexican-British relations, but also

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.560
 the Order of the Aztec Eagle, which is Mexico's highest honour. This is very cool, isn't it?

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.840
 We need to rename our MBEs. It's so much cooler. Yeah. And she was called the Indiana Jones of Food.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.720
 She sounds great. Yeah. Which bit of Indiana Jones' career is at his academic side, where he's

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.240
 always as a professor or out fighting Nazis. No, it's like she's out in the... She's out,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.760
 like she's gone into the temple. There's a rare kind of burrito on the stand.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.720
 She's swapped it over for some tamales. She's holding it in her other hand.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.120
 Chased by a giant ball of corn sluts.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:20.800
 OK, it is time for fact number two. And that is Anna.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.720
 My fact this week is that white noise was named because the pattern of its waves

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.800
 resembles white light. And pink noise was named because it resembles pink light.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.720
 Brown noise was named after someone called Robert Brown.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.960
 I've never heard of pink or brown noise. No.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.080
 And I was quite unclear what white noise is actually before looking us up.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.240
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, there we go. Let's get into it.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.600
 So white noise, first of all, is the most common one that people know because it's this.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.080
 And people often use it to make their children go to sleep.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.840
 They do. And pink noise is more like...

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.360
 And is brown noise the one that makes you poo?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.680
 And brown noise is the one that makes you shit yourself.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.800
 No, it isn't, is it?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.880
 It's not, no. So white noise is basically a noise that contains

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.600
 all the different frequencies within human hearing to the same extent.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.400
 So we can hear between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.240
 And if you take all of those frequencies, 20, 21, 22, etc.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.800
 And then you play them all with exactly the same amount of energy.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.920
 That's white noise.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.280
 Confusingly, white noise sounds horrible, I think.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.480
 I don't understand people who find it relaxing because higher pitches sound louder to us.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.640
 Pink noise is where there's more energy in the lower pitches.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.760
 It's a bit basier. Now, listening to pink noise, I still think it sounds...

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.000
 It's still quite jarring, isn't it? I would say.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.080
 Pink noise? Well, you know, like a lot of people,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.920
 just to give the opposite side of the argument,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.720
 think that it sounds like the waves washing over you.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.880
 I would say brown noise sounds like waves.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.680
 I think pink noise, but you're right, a lot of people do write that.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.000
 But brown noise is the hip new noise, right?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.600
 Brown noise is what everyone is now listening to on YouTube,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.360
 hours at a time as they go to sleep.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.680
 Headline in Glastonbury this year. Let's get with it, all right?

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.680
 And that's low brown noise.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.040
 So brown noise is where you're putting a lot more energy into those lower frequencies.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.720
 So it sounds bassy and I think if you listen to that, it sounds like trees

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.280
 or sounded a bit like a nice ocean waves to me.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.080
 Can we explain why it's good for sleeping?

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.440
 Because I think that's important too.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.520
 And I think the reasoning is it increases your what they call arousal threshold steady on.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.800
 It's that normally if you're asleep and it's completely silent around you

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.840
 and then a car alarm goes off, you wake up, right?

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.080
 Because there's a big difference between the background nothing and then the car alarm.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.320
 But if there's a background playing constantly,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.880
 you're already kind of higher on the sonic mountain, like all boats have been lifted.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.480
 And then so that spike of the car alarm, which is like the top of the mountain,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.480
 it pokes up less high above the general background that you're listening to.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.600
 And therefore there's less of a chance.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.600
 And it doesn't matter what frequency the car alarm is,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.000
 because all the frequencies are being fired at you anyway.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.080
 Right.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.000
 So it's bound to be covered by one of them.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.880
 Exactly. So then you wake up in the morning, your car's been stolen again.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.240
 At least you had a good night.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.280
 Exactly.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.960
 But apparently it also, for a lot of people, stops the voices in their own head.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.800
 So people going to sleep going, "Oh, did I lock the car? Did I lock the car? I don't know."

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.400
 It stops all those questions from your head and just lets you fall asleep.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.040
 It's and more so for ADHD people, as you'd expect, because we've got ADHD,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.040
 then distractions in your mind and out of them are more distracting.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.880
 And it sort of helps drown them out.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.920
 I should probably say how these related to colors very quickly.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.080
 Won't go into it to a boring extent.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.000
 But just because white noise is named after white light.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.240
 So that's white light is like all the frequencies of light,

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.440
 all mixed together equally.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.640
 Pink light is what the brain interprets as a combination of red and blue light,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.240
 but there's actually a bit less blue.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.720
 So in the same way, it's a bit heavier on the lower frequencies,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720
 because red is like a bit lower.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.680
 And then brown, Robert Brown was a Scottish botanist.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.240
 It's so random that his main legacy to the world is naming this kind of noise.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.600
 Well, it's not his main legacy.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.880
 He was an amazing botanist and his name is put to many animals and geographical locations.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.280
 It's only become his main legacy since brownwise became the new trend.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.560
 I must stop like before we did any of this stuff.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.800
 I'd only heard of him because of brownie emotion.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.160
 No, that's fair enough.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.920
 But he's within the world of botany.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.920
 His name is there.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.320
 Lots of plants and grasses and things.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.760
 Brownie emotion is the way particular molecules,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.960
 if you look at them under a microscope,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.640
 he observed they looked like they were dancing,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.160
 these pollen grains that he was looking at.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.200
 And they're not alive.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.640
 How can they be dancing?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.880
 It basically has to do with the heat of individual molecules.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.640
 Yeah, the molecules are bouncing off things,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.320
 moving things around in a random way.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.880
 And this noise is more random than the others.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.000
 Yes, the way it looks.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.680
 And in fact, it was Einstein himself,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.280
 good old Einstein, his first influential paper who took brownie emotion,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.920
 which basically Robert Brown, and he had the habit of doing this,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.160
 just looked at it, went, oh, that's happening.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.600
 And then went back to his plants.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.520
 And Einstein went, let's explain that.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.800
 And it was essential to finding out that atoms and molecules

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.720
 are the smaller particles of matter,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.960
 because it was like, how else could these pollen bits be moving,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.280
 except of tinier bits of moving inside them?

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.720
 Yeah, he was a busy man.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.800
 He collected 2000 new species in Australia alone.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.520
 Yeah, but it was a piece of piss in those days.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.720
 Like no one else had done it.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.760
 So you just wander around.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.920
 You guys said he wasn't seeing that flower before.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.800
 Throw a brick.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.200
 Yeah.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.560
 Easy, here's a rare flower.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.280
 Yeah, he was kind of there to help prove

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.280
 whether or not Australia was a group of islands.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.840
 So it was known as New Holland at the time.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.160
 And so the idea was that he was going to go through the interior

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.880
 to try and work out if this suddenly broke up.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.760
 And that's a big task.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.480
 Well, you wouldn't know.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.400
 Just to prove that this 4,000 mile wide thing is not an island, please.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.560
 Yeah.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.920
 Because it gets quite warm in the middle, doesn't it?

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.360
 It does get a bit barren.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.680
 Yeah.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.320
 You know what's named after?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.640
 To prove it's an island, you only have to go around the outside.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.880
 You don't need to go in the middle.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.920
 Andy, organizing a trek through the centre.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.600
 Wait, what do you say?

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.040
 To prove something as an island all you have to do is go around the edge of it.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.880
 No, because it could be like an atoll.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.960
 You know, it could be an island within it.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.880
 You mean it could be fully encircled,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.560
 but even then it's a lake inside, isn't it?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.720
 Still think it needs studying.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.520
 Sure.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.000
 On this expedition, they took on two aboriginals,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.440
 Bungary and Nambary.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.040
 They took them on board to help them communicate with the local tribes.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.600
 And they were essential to the success of the trip,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.920
 basically, because every time they stopped on the coast,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.120
 they had to send, it was usually Bungary, I think, onshore,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.200
 to say these guys are legit, they're normal,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.440
 and usually didn't speak the language of the different tribe,

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.400
 but at least knew the...

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.400
 Is this bit still the same island or have we gone on to a different island?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.480
 They knew the general habits,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.680
 but usually the protocol was that you should remove your clothes.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.240
 So every time they parked on the coast,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.120
 they'd be like, "Right, Bunga, take your clothes off.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.000
 Go ashore, please."

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.280
 So he had to strip down naked every time he went to negotiate with you.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.240
 Really? Having a Bunga Bunga party?

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.120
 Having a Bunga party.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.600
 Oh, my God.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.800
 Yeah, actually, of course, Australia isn't one island.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.080
 So fine.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.880
 Thank you.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.480
 And Brown was the first person from Europe to explore Tasmania.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:12.880
 Right.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.480
 And also for Andy, there is Tetradontium brownianum,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.480
 which is a species of moss called Brown's foretooth moss,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.000
 and it's named after him.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.920
 He found it in a place called Roslyn near Edinburgh in the 18th century,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.360
 and the place where he found it,

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.920
 you can still see this moss growing today.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.960
 That's nice.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.920
 That is very cool.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.640
 That's very cool.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.880
 The Brownian motion thing, by the way.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.640
 So that was a discovery that he made at the time through a microscope that he had,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.280
 and that was called into question many, many years later,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.880
 because they thought there's no way that the microscope would have been able to prove this.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.400
 And so there was a big thing where they took out the original microscopes,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.600
 and they had to re-observe what he said he had observed

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.480
 in order to prove it.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.920
 Well, they used his old microscope.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.920
 They used his exact microscopes.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.520
 I think it's a weird thing to doubt, isn't it?

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.480
 The interesting thing is he thought that pollen was moving by themselves,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.520
 and this was, you know, how sperms move around to reproduce.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.120
 That's what the pollen was doing.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.840
 Like this was the force of life that basically existed in all things,

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.960
 and it existed in the pollen,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.120
 and that's why basically that was his thought.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.640
 Oh, so it's quite a big theory.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.200
 Yeah, it was, this was in the 1820s,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.200
 and it was such a big deal in the world

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.000
 that it was mentioned in Middlemarch, George Eliot.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.160
 Is it?

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.160
 In the podcast, George Eliot's Middlemarch.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.440
 Can I remember that bit?

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.760
 I did read Middlemarch a few years ago.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.120
 It's not like a major plot point, though.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.760
 No, it is.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.640
 Dr. Lidgate.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.320
 We Lidgate.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.520
 He's a scientific one.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.720
 He's trying to buy a vase from a guy called Mr. Fairbrother.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.080
 And Mr. Fairbrother says,

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.520
 "You are eyeing that glass vase again.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.960
 Do you want to make an exchange?

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.760
 I have some sea mice, fine specimens and spirits,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.240
 and I will throw in Robert Brown's new thing,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.200
 microscopic observations in the pollen of plants

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.280
 if you don't happen to have it already."

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.480
 I mean, that sounds like subtle advertising, doesn't it?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.680
 That sounds...

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.240
 Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.600
 Then it goes #spawn.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.960
 In fact, there's an offer code we can...

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.760
 So, this would be kind of a weird fact

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.960
 for a lot of people to listen to,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.560
 because I think a lot of people listening

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.080
 are trying to get to sleep right now.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.120
 Wake up!

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.760
 Have you checked the car?

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.160
 There are dozens of sleep podcasts.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.640
 Uh-huh.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.640
 I mean, specific sleep podcasts, you know,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.280
 not just ours, which is just boring, but I mean...

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.120
 Supposedly.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.720
 I don't know if this is like big podcast

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.320
 who sponsored this research,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.880
 but 46% of people sometimes will listen

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.240
 to something as they go to sleep,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.240
 and 28% do it regularly.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.720
 Yeah.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.360
 There's a thing they do on radio called Comfort Noise,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.720
 which is...

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.560
 It's got a slightly different motive,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.880
 but it's to also keep you at ease

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.560
 when radio goes silent.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.880
 So, for example, if there's like a minute silence,

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.560
 because if there's a minute silence,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.560
 and the radio goes completely silent,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.400
 you start going, "Wait, has the radio station just turned off?"

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.040
 If it's complete silence, that's supposedly quite...

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.880
 But the only time there's ever a minute silent on the radio

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.280
 is when they say, "We're going to have a minute silence now

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.160
 to remember the dead."

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.040
 So, you never then go, "What the hell's up to my radio?"

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.320
 Well, it's interesting.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.680
 They do it for a few reasons.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.000
 So, one, they do think it gives a comfort to people

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.360
 who think it's suddenly turned off.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.720
 So, they'll play bird noise,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.800
 or they'll play London traffic in the background.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.680
 So, it keeps it going.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.400
 There are actually things...

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.520
 Beep, beep, beep!

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.640
 I'm walking here!

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.040
 I'm trying to drive down wide,

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.000
 or where's this huge crowd of people standing around in silence?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.200
 Beep, beep!

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.320
 Wait, how come we've never heard?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.720
 So, when they play the minute silence on the radio, that's what...

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.320
 I know I have heard a bit of bird song, actually.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.080
 I think that is familiar.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.360
 The other reason for it is,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.200
 is because there's protocols in place

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.520
 as part of a major system for all radio,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.760
 which is when absolute silence is there,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.560
 a song will kick in.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.360
 So, you don't want a minute silence for the Queen,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.480
 and suddenly YMCA comes on halfway through, right?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.560
 So, that's another part of it.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.240
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.320
 This is not to do with this, really,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.520
 but the Master's Golf is probably happening

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.840
 when people are listening to this, or it's just happened.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.080
 And they play in bird noises.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.080
 And actually, a lot of golf...

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.480
 If you watch golf on TV, they play in bird noises.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.200
 Oh, do they?

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.200
 And I was listening to Tom Scott's podcast,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.720
 and they said that there was a time when

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.040
 they played in the wrong bird noise

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.640
 for wherever it was in the world.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.000
 They were playing this golf tournament,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.760
 and a load of people wrote in saying,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.280
 "You don't get the great crested greeb in South Korea."

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:37.920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.720
 My fact is, when you hover over a link on the computer,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.360
 and the mouse icon turns into a little hand,

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.960
 that icon dates back to the 11th century.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.960
 They waited so long before inventing

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.560
 the rest of the computer, didn't they?

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.720
 You know, it looks like a white gloved hand,

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.760
 certainly on my computer, anyway.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.240
 Mostly on Macs, you get it, or you get it on all of them.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.200
 It's on quite a few.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.320
 You can get it on all, then, you?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.200
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.560
 So, on my computer, it's a little...

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.000
 It's like a pointing finger,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.360
 and it's got a white glove on,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.800
 and it's got three lines on the glove.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.840
 It looks like a butler's glove.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.040
 Like a snooker referee.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.400
 A snooker referee, exactly.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.960
 And those are our two reference points.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.520
 James got a watching a lot of snooker.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.320
 I grew up with staff.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:16.800
 I was thinking...

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.400
 If anyone wants to know the difference between me and Andy,

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.400
 I say this quite often, and that's it.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.000
 For me, it's Mickey Mouse's club.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.640
 And there's Dan.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.480
 Yeah.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.280
 So, this is a thing.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.400
 It's based on a thing called the manicule,

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.440
 which dates back to the Doomsday book.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.840
 It's a way of medieval scholars, in particular,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.680
 to say, "Hey, look at this bit of the text."

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.760
 And it's just a pair of fingers that you draw,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.440
 or sometimes you draw a whole hand,

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.320
 but the common element was always like a pointing finger

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.600
 saying, "Hey, look at this bit."

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.720
 It's like a highlighter.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.080
 It's exactly like a highlighter

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.440
 without having to draw along the whole,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.280
 because often the manuscripts are, you know,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.640
 because they didn't have highlighters, basically.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.440
 It's a way of marking passages.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.040
 Or an arrow.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.960
 I mean, it's so much effort to go to, isn't it?

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.720
 It's because when you look at them, they're so beautiful.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.480
 And I guess it's just testament to that.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.040
 Again, in the olden days, they didn't have Netflix and stuff.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.880
 So, they clearly spent so long on these stunning drawings.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.080
 Sometimes they'd be like a beautiful octopus pointing

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.320
 its various limbs at various bits of text.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.960
 There was another dragon, which instead of a head,

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.960
 had a hand for a head pointing.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.800
 There was a whole big Greek god kind of gesturing at something.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.360
 And these are often just people who are reading the text as well.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.240
 They're not, you know...

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.600
 They're usually monks.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.360
 Often monks, but just literate people.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.520
 I think often anyone who had the text was a reader,

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.720
 like a rich person.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.080
 It's such an interesting evolution,

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.440
 because you have the Doomsday book,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.840
 where it's the monks who are reading it,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.120
 putting it in the margins, right?

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.880
 So, they're going, "Here's a bit.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.320
 You as the next reader should look out for specifically."

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.120
 Then, by the time we get to the 15th century,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.640
 the printers themselves are putting the fingers in

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.240
 to say, "We think you should look specifically at this bit."

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.560
 And then it kind of, to where we are today,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.600
 evolves into how authors will now put footnotes

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.720
 in their own pages now, because they're now saying,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.000
 "Actually, this is super interesting,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.360
 and I want to tell you more about it.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.480
 I'm going to take up the page.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.080
 It's not even about the publisher

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.760
 or the reader putting in anymore."

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.840
 But yeah, they look absolutely lovely.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.240
 They're stunning.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.040
 And they're just a form of marginalia, really, aren't they?

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.960
 Yeah, a marginalia is just anything

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.920
 that's not part of the book

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.800
 that was scribbled by someone else in the margins, right?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.440
 Yeah.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.080
 And then the modern one, certainly the one in the Mac,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.240
 was invented by someone called Susan Pear.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.120
 And she has done lots of different icons

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.560
 for various computers,

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.720
 not just Macs, also Windows stuff.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.760
 So she came up with the command key on Apple keyboards.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.480
 Wow.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.200
 Which is a biggie.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.480
 It's like, what does it look like?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.040
 It's a square with circles on each corner, isn't it?

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.360
 It's like a little infinity knot.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.160
 Infinity knot, yeah.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.600
 She got it from some road signs in Scandinavia.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.440
 They used it for landmarks.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.680
 And she just thought, "That looks good, so I'll use that."

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.200
 And she also designed the card deck for Windows Solitaire game.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.360
 That's a biggie, isn't it?

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.360
 She's had a huge influence on my childhood.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.160
 Yeah, she's amazing.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.160
 And the road sign thing is very interesting,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.680
 because that's exactly what she said

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.040
 each of the symbols needed to be.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.120
 They needed to be as clear as a road sign.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.360
 She had zero experience in this field.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.720
 And so as part of the interview,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.360
 she went to a library and she took out a bunch of books

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.280
 that were all about graphic design

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.280
 and just brought them and put them on the table with her.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.000
 So it looked like she was super keen.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.440
 They were like, "Oh, look at all those books."

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.720
 She must have read them.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.760
 She came into the interview room.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.880
 Did she just sort of close the last book in the pile

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.480
 that she got to the end of the last page?

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.160
 Huh, okay.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.400
 Yeah, sorry, what's the pay?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.280
 A lot of her designs, now you wouldn't see,

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.960
 because they're quite 80s,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.200
 but one that stuck around is the thing

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.680
 that I never know what it is, that little watch.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.120
 So you know sometimes, and I think again,

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.200
 sorry, we're very spoiled office, so we all use Macs,

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.920
 but you've got the mouse, you've got the hand,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.080
 you sometimes get the little timer thing.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.160
 And you know, sometimes you get a little watch that comes up.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.640
 And it just basically means something's fucked up.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.600
 Oh, I've never seen that.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.040
 I always thought it was a computer saying,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.680
 "I'm working it out. Give me time," is what it's saying.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.800
 Oh, maybe it is saying that.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.920
 Yes, I think perhaps it's that.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.800
 Well, I see you.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.760
 Well, it's very annoying anyway,

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.120
 so I'm not a huge fan of her.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.360
 It still uses the floppy disk symbol

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.560
 for when you're saving something.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.960
 And no one using a computer who was born in the 2000s

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.520
 will have any idea really what a floppy disk is,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.120
 in the same way that they don't, yeah.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.040
 Except they're all reading all the lists that say,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.600
 "Oh, why are we still using this old watch on floppy disks?"

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.680
 You can still buy floppy disks, by the way.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.360
 And they're often used by like DIY media,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.400
 arty kind of people.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.880
 If you create an amazing bit of media

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.440
 and you want it to be really sort of super awesome,

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.800
 you might just put it on floppy disk

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.080
 and everyone will think it's even better.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.400
 But you can buy them.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.760
 There's not that many around,

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.360
 but there's a few specialist places,

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.840
 and they cost about $1 per megabyte of data.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.200
 Okay, that's a lot.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.600
 It is, because the average cost of memory right now

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.160
 is one cent per gigabyte.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.040
 So if you buy a floppy disk

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.560
 for your to save something,

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.320
 it's the equivalent of buying a pint of milk

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.400
 with a one kilogram bar of gold.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:00.720
 Cool.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.240
 Which is what I do,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.840
 but I'm not really in time for the common man.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.960
 This pointy thing, just one last thing on the manicule.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.440
 I just like the names of it.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.120
 So it was called the Indicationum, or the index,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.360
 which is from the Latin for "to point".

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:17.920
 And that's where...

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.720
 Index finger.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.480
 Index finger comes from, yeah.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.520
 But it was also known as a mutton fist or a bishop's fist.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.400
 And I don't know why.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.000
 Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.640
 That's interesting.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.800
 I was actually reading, as far as my research for this,

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.040
 the descriptions of the perfect hand.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.560
 Because, you know, it's a drawing of a hand,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.320
 and we get how people have drawn hands.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.960
 And it included mutton hands,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.400
 but as a non-desirable thing.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.240
 This was...

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.680
 This was in the 18th century,

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.320
 a guy wrote a book called "Authorpedia".

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.760
 And it's a guy called Nicholas Andree,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.520
 and it's where we get orthopedics from,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.960
 is him, he invented it.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.680
 And it actually means a correct or straight child,

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.640
 hence the pedia,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.360
 because it was a book of how to correct deformities in children.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.480
 And I've read his whole chapter on what makes the perfect hand.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.880
 And he indeed said,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.560
 "Your hand should not look like shoulders of mutton."

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.520
 That's fair enough.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.760
 Well, his shoulder of mutton thing

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.160
 was just a hand that was a bit too square.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.920
 And I am looking at your hand now, James.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.480
 And he said,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.720
 "Although they're useful for catching things,

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.240
 they're the worst type of shape."

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.880
 Are you joking?

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.240
 I've got beautiful hands.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.040
 Yeah, don't listen, James.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.480
 You've got lovely piano players' hands.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:20.960
 Can I ask you...

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.240
 I am good at catching things.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.640
 I had to say that, didn't you?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.520
 That looked very clear.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.640
 Sip of this, Connery.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.520
 Can I check if you guys have these proportions?

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:31.920
 OK.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.120
 I was actually quite impressed with mine

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.240
 when I went through his list.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.600
 So your finger should be a bit round above and flat below.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.520
 Your index tip,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.720
 the tip of your index finger,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.960
 should end at the root of the middle fingernail.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.800
 If you're holding your hand up straight in front of you

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.160
 with your fingers together,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.680
 tip of your index fingernail

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.640
 should line up with the root of your middle fingernail.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.280
 Everyone got that?

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:51.840
 Close enough, yeah.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.720
 Oh, um...

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.560
 No, I'm a bit low, I think.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.000
 Yeah, that's classic,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.200
 and he says a bit low is bad.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.840
 What respect?

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.840
 Does it mean I'm a bad podcaster?

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.680
 Or does it mean I'm an evil person?

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.800
 I'm hearing mutter.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.160
 I'm afraid it means just you've got...

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:08.960
 It means you've got three weeks.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.520
 Shit happens.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:14.960
 The ring finger needs to reach the middle nail

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.920
 of your middle finger.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.560
 Oh, my God, I'm nowhere near that.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.960
 James, this guy would have really had a field day

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.680
 with your hands, actually.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.880
 They're all over the place, aren't they?

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:28.320
 We're making it so like James is a Simpsons character.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.840
 I've only got four fingers.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.040
 I've got five because I'm God.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.000
 Can I just very quickly speak about highlighters?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.000
 So these little hands are pointing to a thing

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.320
 that today we would just get a yellow felt tip

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.400
 and color it in and people will be able to see it.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.960
 Those things, the fluorescent highlighters,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.320
 they were invented by accident in 1963.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.720
 By a guy called Francis J. Hon who was trying to make

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.640
 a new kind of marker for children.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.160
 And while he was experimenting,

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.080
 he got this yellow ink and he put it on

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.160
 and he realized that it basically could still see

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.240
 the text in between it and he thought, "Oh, I'll do that."

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.400
 And you know Stabilo Boss highlighters.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.920
 I feel like they're the biggie.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.560
 They're the biggie.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.040
 They're kind of like square in shape, aren't they?

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.240
 And they've got a very flat tip.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.000
 And that flat tip was actually invented by accident.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.160
 So annoying.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.560
 One day, some people at Stabilo,

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.360
 in fact, it was Schwann Stabilo who was in charge

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.480
 of Stabilo Boss.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.120
 He and his group, they were doing some presentation

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.200
 of this thing and it wasn't really working properly

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.960
 and they slammed it onto the desk and it made it flat

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.360
 at the bottom.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.200
 They went, "Oh, look, this works amazingly."

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.840
 That's according to their official website.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.560
 I don't believe it.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.720
 One more thing on that, please.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.040
 In 1996, a prisoner in the UK decided

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.080
 that he would try to get taken out of prison

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.800
 and put into hospital by saying that he had jaundice

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.880
 by coloring his entire body in with a yellow Stabilo Boss

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.520
 highlighter.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.280
 And the prison spokesman said he carefully painted

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.920
 all of his body, even his private bits,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.520
 with a yellow highlighter pen.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.560
 The problem was that he had made such a good job of it

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.320
 that he would probably have died if his skin

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.280
 was really that color.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.960
 Wow.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.000
 Who did his back?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.360
 Someone else has evolved.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.960
 What a soulmate's for, Anna, if not helping you out.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.520
 You're right.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.720
 Can I tell you about a really silly drawing

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.920
 things controversy?

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.400
 Okay.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.520
 This is great.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.120
 Let's go back to 1927.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.280
 Switzerland.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.240
 There's a geologist called Albert Heim,

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.720
 who at this point is about 70 years old,

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.400
 a very eminent Swiss geologist,

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.880
 and he got in a huge row with the Swiss Federal

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.120
 Office of Topography over the way maps were

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.160
 drawn as Switzerland.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.560
 Right?

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.040
 Okay.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.600
 So, you know those relief maps which show altitude?

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.480
 You know, they look like they've got the mountains on.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.680
 They look like if you touch them,

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.640
 they'd be all lumpy and bumpy.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.000
 Yeah, I like those ones.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.440
 Yeah, beautifully drawn.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.360
 And they often look like there's light

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.320
 and shade on them, right?

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.880
 Albert Heim's problem was that in Switzerland's

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.320
 two official map series,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.000
 they were shaded as if the sunlight comes

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.680
 from the northwest.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.320
 And he said, this cannot stand.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.600
 There's no way the sunlight's coming from the northwest

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.800
 and hitting Switzerland, right?

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.560
 He said this was a lie that flew in the face of nature.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.280
 What a hero.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.440
 It's very huge, eh?

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.080
 I bet he had good fingers.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.120
 And he, I read this whole article

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.280
 about the Northwest Illumination Problem,

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.080
 which was an established thing from the Middle Ages onwards.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.000
 It was just the way people drew,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.280
 and there are loads of theories as to why,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.400
 maybe it's because cartographers drew from left to right.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.800
 So, you want to shade so that you...

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.840
 Because you're right-handed, for instance.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.120
 Because you're right-handed, basically.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.320
 So, even in medieval maps,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.480
 the light is falling from left to right.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.960
 Or cartographers draw with the right hand,

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.560
 so the drawing doesn't cast a shadow,

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.760
 so they can see what they're doing.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.240
 Basically, it's the same as that.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.680
 And wait just to double check.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.920
 The truth is that it would only ever be coming from

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.840
 the south if we're in the northern hemisphere,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.800
 because if it gets to...

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.000
 Either it's going above you or...

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.920
 Well, the sun moves, but generally,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.400
 you don't get as much light coming from the northwest.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.960
 Cool.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.240
 So, what happened next?

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.880
 Any guesses?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.600
 He was murdered.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 They turned it into a map of Australia,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.120
 where it would have made sense.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.440
 They turned all of the maps upside down

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.840
 and traced them from the back,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.360
 so that now they were on the right way.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:23.920
 Lovely.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.720
 Lovely.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.360
 No, he didn't win.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.880
 This is still coming from the northwest.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.840
 He had nothing.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.240
 That's all.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.920
 Is that how we could tell from history

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.920
 who was a left-hander versus right-hander?

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.760
 If we looked at maps and the way the shadow falls.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.800
 Nice idea, I don't know.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.960
 I think everyone was a right-hander in fairness.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.440
 Really?

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.880
 Oh, yeah, maybe.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.160
 They weren't as tolerant.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.200
 Drawn by the right-handers.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.200
 That's so interesting.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.800
 Hey, what is the most famous drawing of hands in the world?

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.840
 And now think of that.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.400
 Escher, where he draws his own hand.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.760
 I'm thinking Mike Landler.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.640
 Sistine Chapel.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.760
 So, let's say that's number one.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.480
 What's number two?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.680
 What about the Mona Lisa?

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.680
 She has her hands one over the other, doesn't she?

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.480
 Yeah, that's true.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.360
 That is a good one.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.120
 It's not the main bit of the Mona Lisa, though, is it?

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.320
 What's number three?

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.600
 I've got Jura's hands.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.720
 The artist's Jura, the Praying Hands, which are...

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.600
 Albrecht Jura.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.000
 Yeah.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.960
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.000
 Yeah, that is famous.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.280
 Those are very famous hands.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.240
 The Clefton Prater.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.960
 Yeah, and people have them on their walls globally,

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.760
 if you're religious.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.360
 They're a very important piece of art.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.200
 They're from the 1500s.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.000
 And for many, many years, it was thought that it was a sketch drawing

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.400
 that was then transferred onto a big altered piece that Jura did

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.520
 as part of a commission.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.760
 So, everyone thought that this is just a quick sketch,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.280
 but it's become this massive famous thing.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.600
 There's a new theory, which is being put forward by one of the curators

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.320
 of a major museum, that he used it effectively as a business card.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.680
 So, whenever people came and he said,

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.720
 "You should get me as an artist,"

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.160
 he would pull it out of his desk and say,

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.800
 "This is the kind of stuff that I'm capable of doing."

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.520
 I can draw hands.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.160
 Yeah, I can draw hands.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.280
 Hands are hard, yeah.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.320
 That was famous, wasn't it?

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.160
 And the Renaissance, it was like no one could draw.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.360
 It's like AI as well.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.200
 Which I know a question.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.560
 Now that we've seen all these bloody doodles

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.240
 going back to medieval times of people drawing,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.520
 as far as I'm concerned, brilliant hands all over manuscripts.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.600
 These Renaissance artists who couldn't hack it.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.280
 Those are cartoos of hands, though.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.800
 You know, you want to really good hands are really hard to do.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.240
 And it's a nightmare for portrait artists

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.920
 who have to get their subjects to do everything.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.960
 Can you just stick them in your pockets?

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.440
 You think it's possible that they could do hands perfectly,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.320
 but everyone in the Renaissance had manky fingers like I do.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.760
 That would be it.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.960
 A lot of mutton theory.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:37.920
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.600
 and that is my fact.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.480
 My fact this week is that there was a football match

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.240
 in Germany last year where one team was made up entirely

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.240
 of players called Krotanovic.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.120
 Brilliant.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.720
 So confusing for anyone playing them.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.640
 In fact, apparently a lot of teams often think

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.160
 Krotanovic is the sponsor of the team on the jersey.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.640
 I read that, but then they are actually sponsored

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.560
 by Krotanovic, some of the players as well.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.320
 What's Krotanovic?

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.320
 Krotanovic is a surname.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.720
 Yeah, and a lot of these guys who play for the team

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.920
 have their own company, so they put that on this dress.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.160
 So this is a bottom of the league German football team

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.600
 who play in the town of Florsheim,

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.560
 and this is a tiny town, 20,000 population.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.880
 They have a team that was put together by a guy

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.040
 who's called Harris Krotanovic, and he thought,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.760
 who can I get to be reliable to come up to practice,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.640
 to show up?

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.840
 Why not my family?

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.640
 Why not my uncles?

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.840
 Why not my second cousins?

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.840
 A few buddies came along.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.280
 But for one match at least, when you walked onto the pitch,

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.080
 you were playing one name, Krotanovic.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.240
 It's like the opposite of nepotism.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.920
 There should be a word for when you just get

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.160
 roped into a career that you didn't really want.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.560
 You're guilted.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.480
 They all speak Bosnian on the pitch as well,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.960
 because they're all from this area of the border

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.360
 between Montenegro and Serbia and Bosnia.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.560
 So yeah, that's where they're from originally.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.280
 And this team, they're actually really successful as well,

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.680
 because, well, I mean, relatively,

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.480
 they're in the 11th division in Germany,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.480
 but they were in the 13th division,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.240
 and they got moved up two divisions,

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.640
 because they were the second team,

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.320
 and their first team were doing really badly,

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.680
 so they swapped them around.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.000
 Right.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.680
 Because they also have a few players who aren't Krotanovic's,

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.480
 but who are Serbian and Montenegro,

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.920
 and who have played in higher leagues,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.840
 so they're kind of better than they should be.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.240
 How do those guys feel about being shackled

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.760
 to the floor of the leagues by the millions of Krotanovic's

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.440
 who they have to turn up with every week?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.000
 I think the truth is that on a normal week,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.240
 they probably have about four or five Krotanovic's

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.280
 playing for them,

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.600
 but occasionally, they bring out a full multiple.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.480
 I hope this is being filmed.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.080
 It sounds like welcome to Wrexham.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.880
 If they're making their way up the leagues, imagine.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.920
 That's a really good point, as even more wholesome, isn't it?

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.600
 Should we buy them?

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.480
 Like Ryan Reynolds?

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.760
 Should we be the Ryan Reynolds

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.600
 of 11th division German football?

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.440
 I think we definitely could get on their jersey.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.480
 We could be the sponsors.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.880
 We'd have to change our name to Krotanovic as well.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.920
 I think it's worth it.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.520
 Do you know what the German football team is?

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.360
 Well, no, I don't actually.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.000
 Manshaft.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.240
 Great stuff.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.520
 Just every time I see it,

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.280
 whenever there's a World Cup on, it makes me laugh.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.680
 But you get this every now and then

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.160
 with families playing football.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.000
 The Gojonsons, famously.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.080
 So Ida Gojonson, who used to play for Bolton,

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.280
 he's Icelandic,

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.800
 and his son Arnor was also playing for Iceland,

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.000
 and there was one game where Ida was playing,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.120
 and he got taken off,

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.040
 and his son came on instead of him.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.480
 It was like a substitution.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.760
 They were in the same squad,

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.880
 but they were on the same pitch for like a micro millisecond,

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.600
 just before they passed over, and then, yeah.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.480
 That's very good.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.840
 James is a goal fan.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.400
 Do you know the work and recent playing

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.800
 of Jung Un Lee 6th?

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.200
 This is going to be a Kim Jong Un thing, isn't it?

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.000
 No, no, no.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.600
 She was a US women's open champion.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.400
 She was ranked,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.760
 I think, at her highest at seventh in the world.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.560
 Is she Korean?

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:10.080
 Yeah, she is, and she's called Jung Un Lee 6th

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.200
 because there have been five other Jung Un Lee's,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.360
 and in order for them all to differentiate themselves,

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.320
 they've attached a number to the end of their name.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.120
 Oh, really?

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.960
 So that would happen in a normal family,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.040
 like if Andy's father and grandfather

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.320
 were all called Andy Murray,

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.480
 you would be Andy Murray the third, right?

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.320
 Yes, but these are not family members.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.280
 These all happen to just be players with the same name.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.760
 So yeah, so she officially goes by Lee 6th.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.480
 So Lee, and then the number six right after her surname,

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.080
 and then you've got one, two, three, four, and five,

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.120
 who are all golfers.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.520
 So it's quite funny when you see anything written about her.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.480
 That's sort of...

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.080
 It looks like you're reading something about royalty.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.880
 Great.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.560
 Brady Fiegel, have you heard of him?

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:48.960
 No.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.440
 Brady Fiegel's a minor league baseball pitcher,

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.360
 and he's six foot four.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.160
 He's got glasses where he's got a sort of the rim

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.680
 of the glasses sit over the top,

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.960
 but allow for the lens itself not to be covered in a rim,

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.760
 if you know what I mean.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.160
 So...

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:04.720
 Yeah.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.840
 So frameless at the bottom.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.400
 Frameless at the bottom is a quicker way of saying that.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.680
 Underboob glasses.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.280
 Yeah, that's actually the way I'm saying it.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.400
 Underboob glasses.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.000
 He's got red hair and...

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.840
 I'm giving you all the...

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.240
 I'm giving you some for underboob glasses, red hair.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.200
 Is this a police line?

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.840
 Now draw them.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.800
 Did he take your car?

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.760
 I was listening to a white noise in bed.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.040
 You had a smash and there's a baseball bat going through your car with dope.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.040
 All you saw as he went away was the shock of orange hair,

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.800
 and him holding up his underboob glasses going,

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.000
 "See you later, sucker!"

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.080
 So he had an elbow problem that needed surgery,

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.120
 so he had that done.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.040
 And then six months later,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.520
 the doctor who performed the elbow surgery is told,

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.400
 "Your patient, Bradley Fiegel, is ready for his surgery."

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.880
 And he thought, "I did this six months ago."

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.320
 And so it turns out there are two Bradley Fiegel's,

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.080
 both who wear underboob glasses,

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.160
 who are six foot four with red hair,

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.920
 who look exactly the same.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.880
 Both car thieves.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.240
 Both have the same name,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.480
 and both had to have the exact same surgery

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.680
 from the exact same doctor for the bit of the elbow.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.920
 And now they are aware of each other.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.520
 That's how they became aware of each other.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.480
 And they did a DNA test, didn't they, recently,

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.080
 to see if they were actually related.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:22.480
 And?

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:22.880
 No.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.640
 I think to get the media to shut the hell up

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.000
 about these two Bradley Fiegel's.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.480
 Wow.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.240
 It turned out they're not related at all,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.280
 but they do both have ancestors from Germany.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.880
 According to one of these fake, you know, 23 and me things.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.120
 Thought what you would have known from their stername Fiegel,

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:37.280
 wouldn't you?

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:37.600
 Yes.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.520
 Right, right, right, right.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.720
 There was a charity football game in Bungie in 2012,

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.240
 where 70 people played football.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.880
 It was Bungie, not the naked guy from two facts ago.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.680
 From the Aboriginal.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.560
 From Brown's mission.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.400
 We shortened, we nicknamed him Bungie,

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.120
 because we're mates.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:51.360
 Right.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.560
 But he was called Bungery.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.200
 Oh, right, okay.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.000
 Like Dungery.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.160
 And this is Bungie, which I think is...

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.440
 It's unusual to have that word twice in one episode.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.520
 It's like Bartomein-Hoff syndrome, isn't it?

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:01.760
 Yeah.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.360
 You'll see Bungies everywhere now.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.720
 There was a charity game in Bungie in Suffolk in 2012,

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.640
 where 70 people with the same name played.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.120
 And they were all called Bungie.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.040
 They should have raised money by going Bungie jumping.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.000
 What were they thinking?

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.320
 Nice.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.240
 That's a big game.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.760
 How did you manage to get 70 people there?

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.520
 Because it was all the officials as well,

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.040
 all the mascots, the match doctor,

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.040
 and also quite a lot of people who went to see the match

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:23.760
 were called Bungie.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.280
 They were all called Bungie?

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.480
 Yeah, and it was all complete coincidence.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.320
 I didn't know there were that many Bungies knocking about.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:30.960
 I'm very surprised.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.360
 I know.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.120
 There's 455, according to the census at the time.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.440
 And with 70 of them, that's close to 15% of all the UK Bungies

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.040
 that showed up to this one spot.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.720
 Although it wasn't all UK.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.560
 There was one who came from Australia,

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.080
 who was then sent off a swearing.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.760
 Brilliant.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.160
 Brilliant.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.160
 That way for a charity game.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.680
 And they'd advertised for Bungies, which is why,

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.000
 in case you hadn't figured that out when you were listening to this.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.080
 It used to be really common to give kids the same names in the UK.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.840
 And in Scotland, it was the case until the 19th century

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.600
 that it was relatively common, especially on the island of Skye

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.680
 and in other Western Isles.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.440
 There was a survey done of people who lived in the 19th century there,

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.600
 and there were 462 households that had two sons that shared a name.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.000
 Really?

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.840
 And 232 were two daughters shared a name.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.800
 So there's quite a lot of it.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.240
 And it was mostly in this area.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.440
 And they think what happened was,

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.360
 basically they had real rules for naming your kids.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.680
 The first son will be named after his father's father.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.680
 Second son named after his mother's father.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.200
 Third son named after the father.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.480
 First daughter named after the mother's mother.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.000
 And what happens with that is,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.160
 eventually the number of names just gets lower and lower and lower.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.320
 Because like from one generation, that's fine.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.880
 But then the next generation, suddenly everyone's called Mary.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.200
 And then four generations, everyone's called John.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.080
 And that's what happens.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.720
 And so that really happened until quite a long time.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.720
 What self-inflicted confusion that must have wrought over the island of Skye?

00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.840
 Well, yeah, it's funny, isn't it?

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.760
 Because there's another thing where people name,

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.640
 people call each other by the wrong names within families.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.040
 So there's a thing, if you've got lots of siblings,

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.960
 you might have found that one of your parents will say Blar.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.520
 No, Blar.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.480
 No, Anna or whatever.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:12.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.440
 Have you had that?

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.400
 That happens a lot, yeah.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.040
 Christ, yes.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:15.280
 Right.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.040
 They run through the full gammo of names.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.720
 Do they ever throw in the dog's name as well, Anna?

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.360
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:19.920
 OK.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.280
 So there's a reason behind that.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.160
 Which is Toffo.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.440
 It's just unbelievable that you think your child will be called that.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.560
 I've looked at you before, Anna, and thought Toffo.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.520
 But there's a reason behind this which is really interesting,

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.560
 which is that it's to do with how your brain stores names.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.000
 And basically, in your brain,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.880
 you have two envelopes in which you keep all the names.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.560
 In one envelope, you keep...

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.760
 Stop saying envelope.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.440
 These are metaphorical envelopes, aren't they?

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.000
 No, no, no.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.360
 No, they're like the computer icons.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.720
 They're not metaphorical.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.360
 They're just small.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.640
 So one of them, one envelope, is for really close acquaintances.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.320
 So immediate family.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.640
 People who really matter to you.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.400
 The other, for everyone else.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.520
 So when you're trying to name someone,

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.720
 one of your children, obviously,

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.080
 someone who's from envelope number one,

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.000
 people are almost always taking the wrong name out of the right folder.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.560
 And that is why a parent, like your mum,

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.880
 will cycle through all of your siblings' names

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.040
 and the dog's name before they get to your name,

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.400
 because those names are all from the right folder.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.120
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.080
 It's just that they're the wrong names.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.800
 Yeah.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.600
 You know what, I put the dog's name in just the drawer below.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.600
 I wouldn't have the dog in the same folder,

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.800
 but maybe I'm a better parent.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.120
 Hey, just on Scottish names,

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.720
 we were talking about a Scottish person before, Robert Brown.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.840
 He was a Scottish botanist who lived in the 1800s.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.120
 So just for anyone who's listening,

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.800
 who's thinking, "Wait, Robert Brown,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.480
 the botanist and bootmaker born in the 1800s?"

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.760
 No, not that one.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.160
 For anyone who's thinking, "Oh, Robert Brown,

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.120
 the Scottish botanist who also was the first person

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.720
 to use the word gadget in a book?"

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.640
 No, not that botanist.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.160
 For anyone who's thinking, "Robert Brown,

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.520
 the Scottish botanist who was also the polar explorer

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.320
 from the 1800s?"

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.760
 No, not that one either.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.040
 Apparently, there were multiple amazing botanists

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.840
 called Robert Brown who all existed in the 1800s,

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.600
 who went and made major discoveries.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.720
 And that was a problem to the point.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.200
 I'll tell you where it's at.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.640
 Because Robert Brown,

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.720
 the one who wrote gadget for the first time ever,

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.200
 had to call himself Robert Brown of Campster

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.160
 to differentiate himself when people confused him

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.920
 with the Robert Brown of Brown noise.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.040
 What did you say called himself?

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.520
 He called himself Campster.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.320
 He was from...

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.080
 So he said "Hampster" for some reason.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.400
 Whenever he collected a new sample,

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.600
 he'd stuff it into his cheeks.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.920
 There's a group of people in Papua New Guinea

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.680
 called the Orocaeva people.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.120
 And they have a brilliant system, right?

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.440
 So if you have the same name as someone else,

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.600
 as long as you're on good terms with them,

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.840
 you count each other as what's called a sasso,

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.040
 a namesake, and you are basically the same person

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.400
 in the eyes of that society.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.480
 Like you can shag their wives and...

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.000
 No, that's true.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.440
 So it's really interesting.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.360
 If you're the younger sasso,

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:04.320
 you will consult the elder at every stage of your ritual life.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.120
 You don't have to ask them,

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.000
 "What should I have for supper tonight?"

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.760
 But when you do your confirmation and stuff.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.560
 Exactly like that.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.000
 And as the older one ages,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.600
 the younger one has a responsibility

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.880
 to provide him with firewood and other provisions.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.720
 And if the older one dies without a will,

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.960
 then you have to sort out his affairs for him.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.640
 And your family groups, your kin groups,

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.520
 are kind of knitted together,

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.120
 because it's understood that you

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.520
 and this other person are the same person.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.160
 What a burden.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.080
 And is that just if I bumped into someone at the party

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.320
 called Anatojinsky, who is a tedious don?

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.880
 I'd then be stuck intertwined with this person.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.160
 Yes, but she'd be stuck in to find

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.200
 with someone who's very rude

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.120
 about a lot of other people all the time for no good reason.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.800
 So, you know, we all have across the bear, aren't we?

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.440
 All right, that's all the system.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:52.800
 Okay, that is it.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.080
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.920
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.520
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.080
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.720
 we can all be found on our various social media accounts.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.280
 I'm on Instagram, I'm on @tribeland.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:05.760
 Andy.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.520
 I'm on Blue Sky at @andrewhunderem.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:07.920
 James.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.640
 My Instagram.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.160
 Oh, I'm also on Blue Sky.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.880
 Hey.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.200
 Um, but I had to be Harkin James,

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.960
 because someone else already had James Harkin.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.600
 You're kidding.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.080
 That's me.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.720
 I've got yours.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.880
 But if you want to get to us as a group, Anna, where'd they go?

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.720
 You can email podcast@qioi.com.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.720
 I don't have these trying to follow me on Blue Sky.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.920
 I have no followers.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.040
 I literally only went in

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.720
 because I wanted to read someone's Blue Sky.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.320
 Wow, he doesn't even have a profile picture.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:30.960
 This is big.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.680
 I'm following.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.680
 Follow one follower.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.440
 Okay.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.480
 Everyone follow James,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.040
 and he'll feel sort of pressure to generate content.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:39.760
 What was I saying?

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.960

 at the Crossed Wires Festival in Sheffield

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.840

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.480
 in my case, and other things.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.200

 $2.99.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:27.920
 I think it's a rip-off.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.960
 Don't do it.

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.040
