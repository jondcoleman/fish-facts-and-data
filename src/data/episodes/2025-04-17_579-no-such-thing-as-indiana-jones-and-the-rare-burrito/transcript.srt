00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,200
 from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,840
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshensky. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,760
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,240
 with fact number one, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that sodium citrate, the chemical

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,040
 you add to cheese to make it melty nacho cheese, contains sodium, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,440
 or according to the chemical symbols, N, A, C, H and O. Unbelievable. And this is proof of

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:02,720
 living in a matrix, right? Yes, very unimaginative matrix. So I was watching a YouTube clip by a

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,520
 person called Minut Food, and they showed an experiment of how to make American cheese from

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
 any kind of cheese. So you could just take any kind of cheese and add sodium citrate,

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,160
 and it will make it more melty. And in that, that's when they get satisfied. Although I've

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,320
 looked since logs, and it is kind of all over the internet, but right. Okay, it's not like some

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,280
 people. I think that we're doing the world a favor by hopefully putting more on the internet,

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,440
 because it is amazing. Yeah, this podcast is about what I learned this week, and this is a thing

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,880
 that I recently learned. It's a melting salt, isn't it sodium citrate? So when you melt a cheese,

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,720
 the fats and the proteins separate out from each other, and they, but it can get very lumpy.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,800
 It kind of forms like a mesh. Normally, it's like a big solid thing with proteins and fats and

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,040
 moisture and stuff. It kind of all spreads out, and now you've got this mesh of stuff. And the more

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
 meshier it is, the more melty it is, basically. Yes. And the sodium, as far as I understand it,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,480
 it replaces calcium ions. And the calcium ions are the thing that made the cheese proteins all bond

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 together. So the more sodium citrate there is, the smoother the meltiness gets. And it does exactly

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:15,120
 the same thing in another thing that needs to get thinner often. Oh, it should be.

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:24,480
 A zen pick is actually made out of osmium. Blood thinners. Really? It's put in lots of blood thinners,

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
 exactly the same thing. And it's usually in when you donate blood, they need to add something to

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,800
 keep it from clotting after you've donated it before it's given to someone. And they pop in

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
 basically nacho cheese. Sodium citrate also helps your body to create hydrogen and ions,

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,080
 which lowers acidity in your muscles and stops you from feeling the burn when you do lots of

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,040
 exercise. Oh, cool. I'm not exactly sure of the chemical process of how it works, but it does

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,360
 work. And so some people take sodium citrate supplements. Well, they might use it if they've

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
 got a urinary tract infection, because it can be used to relieve discomfort in those.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,640
 Really? I presume by just selectively melting bits of urinary tract. I've understood the

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,400
 science. Does it work if you kind of like shove some melty cheese up there? I think that's that is

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,240
 some optimal, but it will in a pinch. That's what you've got. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nacho cheese is

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,760
 not a cheese. Not a cheese. It's a cheese product made from cheese, because as James says, you can

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,160
 put any old cheese you shove it in and put this stuff in, you melt it, that becomes the nacho

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,640
 cheesy sauce. So there's no sort of core cheese that produces nacho cheese. So nacho cheese is

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,280
 not a cheese. It's a cheese derivative. It's an idea. Very clear if you eat it. It's weird,

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,240
 because it's taking your cheese and it is making it worse, isn't it? I mean, it's making it more

40
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,320
 useful because it can spread over stuff. I think the thing is about food is it's not completely

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,200
 objective. What I disagree about. Do you think everyone who likes nacho cheese is just straight

42
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,240
 up wrong? Well, I have brain on my nachos. That's what I do. And it's a bit harder to melt, but it's

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,880
 fine. The other thing about American cheese is it was invented in Switzerland by a Canadian.

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,520
 I think we've mentioned it before. It's James Kraft, who came up with the idea of

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,440
 extending the shelf life of cheese by putting all these salts in it. Interesting.

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,840
 Have we mentioned the competition we did? On stage? On stage? On our last tour? Oh, no.

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,400
 We tried to break a record for the most slices of American cheese eaten in a minute and dry.

48
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,600
 Yeah. So it was a Guinness World Record. I brought Craig Glenday, who's the editor-in-chief,

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,800
 on stage for us to attempt to break it. And we sucked. It was really hard. 10 slices in a minute

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,880
 without being able to lubricate your mouth is nuts. It was too much. James, you got the most,

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
 I think. I think James did pretty well. I did, respectively. And you guys did a small corner?

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,320
 I won. I was just so pulled by the quality of the cheese. I found the hardest thing was taking

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,800
 off the bits of plastic because you had to do that as well. And I think the pros have like a

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
 special flip that they do with a wrist that kind of flips the cheese out and helps and tweets it.

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,960
 But I think I had four in a bit. Yeah, you did amazing. And I've had like one and he'd been

56
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,200
 practising for a week before. Yeah, I've been practising for so long, but he only told me on

57
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,480
 the night I couldn't drink. If you can drink in between, you can get a lot more done. Do you

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,840
 know what you can do in fondue instead of add sodium citrate and what they do do, in fact?

59
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,600
 White wine, you had sweat, didn't you? Yeah, I guess you know how to make fondue.

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,160
 And his reaction there was like, she'd asked they've done between one and a million and I guessed

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,880
 it. I was thinking, how has James worked out the chemical processes and then figured out that

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,760
 wine does that? Oh, no, he just knows fondue recipes. So that's what the wine does in fondue.

63
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,800
 Dry white wine has the same kind of acidity and that helps the cheese not congeal in exactly the

64
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
 same way. It stops the cacine proteins binding together. Does the alcohol burn away or does it?

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,320
 Most of it burns away, but it is why fondue smells as like you'll notice of alcohol,

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,760
 which I've always thought it's such a strong smell. I don't think I've ever eaten it sober. So like

67
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,160
 so much alcohol around anyway, I've never noticed the smell of the fondue. You're so right. It's just

68
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,360
 in the air, isn't it? Who invented nachos? Have we said this before? I'm not sure we have. Mr.

69
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,240
 Mr. Nacho. Mr. Nacho. Actually, not Mr. Nacho, Mr. Anaya. But his first name was Nacho,

70
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,880
 which is short for Ignacio. And he created them in 1943 at the Victory Club in Mexico,

71
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,040
 Coahuila. And it was a restaurant close to the border. And a lot of American service people

72
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,600
 who were kind of training for World War II were there. And their families as well. And they all

73
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,880
 came in one day and said, we want some food. This guy was the maitre d' but the chef had disappeared.

74
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,040
 As he said, don't worry, I'll make you something. And he ran into the kitchen and all he could find

75
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,760
 was these cheese and bits of tostadas and a few jalapenos. And he put them all under the grill.

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,160
 And the new dish was born. So you're saying it was kind of discovered by accident, in a way?

77
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,240
 Maybe. Did he only had, did he have sodium citrate? Then did he have to,

78
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,640
 did he have like a big jar of chemicals? And it's like one of these?

79
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,680
 Exactly. Nacho cheese, as we would know it today, like the real, the stuff you can kind of squirt

80
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,640
 onto the top of it, didn't exist then that existed a bit later. I believe he did get a promotion to

81
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,320
 head chef or something off the back of it. Interesting. I didn't know if that was a promotion.

82
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,400
 I thought they were just on different career streams. Like I would have thought maitre d

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,600
 then goes to hotel manager. Okay. Well, he just changed career basically on the back of the major

84
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,280
 invention. Because he had this moment of, it just had this moment of glory. That's 100% agree.

85
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,840
 I just agree with you, Andy. I just, I hadn't put that together. And now I think about

86
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,760
 having worked in hotels for lots of my life. That absolutely isn't a promotion at all.

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,680
 It's very much a sidestep. It's a pivot. Yeah. And then he eventually left. He opened up his own

88
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,080
 restaurant, which he called nachos restaurant. Though I feel like he missed a trick. I feel

89
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,440
 like he should have called it, let them eat nachos. That's my title because his wife was called

90
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,400
 Marie Antoinette. And that just, yeah, just would have been fitting. But you would have had to have

91
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,920
 big brackets. The owner's wife is called Marie Antoinette. It's a great story for when you're

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,640
 sitting down saying, why'd you call it that? Another thing from Mexico, another food from

93
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:21,920
 Mexico rather, Caesar salad. Invented in Tijuana in the 1920s. In fact, in not only in the 1920s

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,400
 and 1924, because they've just had the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad, a chef called Caesar

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,760
 invented it, which is why it's called Caesar salad. It's actually got nothing to do with Julia Caesar.

96
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,960
 I didn't know that. No. That feels like the kind of thing you're learning here on your first day.

97
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,800
 I'm so embarrassed. This is actually a suspiciously similar origin story to the nacho thing.

98
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,840
 He had a big crowd in the kitchen at his restaurant, but he only had some lettuce and

99
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,760
 crostini and a dressing. Yeah. But it makes it seem like, wait a minute, was it a Caesar salad dressing?

100
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,920
 Because it feels like that's really part of the invention. Yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah, but who

101
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,320
 invented God? You know. Here's another surprising one. Where was the burrito invented? Oh, like

102
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,200
 Nantwich or something. During the Pina Colada festival. There was a big rush at the Pina Colada

103
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,760
 festival. Someone said, we need something to mop up all this Pina Colada and the chef only had

104
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,280
 some pulled pork. Got it in wine? Burrito. Okay. Well, for me, Mexico, because it means Little

105
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,800
 Dog Key in Spanish, burrito. Absolutely. I've only got a very silly answer here. So yeah. North Korea.

106
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,800
 This surprisingly, it was invented in 2011. This is one of the weird ass claims that Kim Jong-il

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,960
 invented the burrito that was released by the local news sources of North Korea,

108
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,360
 who said that its popularity has been booming ever since 2011 and his invention of it.

109
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
 It's one of those false memory things where you think you had the miniature childhood,

110
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,920
 but actually, who saw a burrito before 2011? Exactly. I never did. No one. I think it's no one.

111
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,960
 They actually have in their real history, or sorry, the alternative Western history,

112
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,400
 they did tend to be eaten in Mexico. And then there was this massive program called the

113
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,440
 Braquellos program in the 40s and 50s, where the US was short on workers and there were loads of

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
 Mexicans who wanted to come to America. So they offered them loads of work permits. And Americans

115
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,400
 thought, well, a good way to feed these laborers who of course, they were paying lower wages and

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,080
 they would pay Americans is to give them these burritos, which we know they're into. So they gave

117
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,360
 them all burritos every day, two burritos a day. But all the immigrants came from Central Mexico,

118
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
 where actually no one ate burritos. And they hated them. And it was part of the reason for a huge

119
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,840
 resentment was the fact that they were being force fed these. And I don't think they were the great

120
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,840
 burritos. They were like a bit of rap and some beans, no sauce. Before all of this, of course,

121
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:48,240
 we had the Aztec and the Maya and the pre-Columbian Americans. And they all let Maze, a lot of their

122
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
 thing is to do with Maze and like tortillas are all made of Maze. So it's carried on. But the

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,720
 interesting thing about that is if you just eat Maze, it's not very good for you. I mean, it's

124
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,760
 fine, but it's not going to give you much of what you need to stay alive. But they came up with a

125
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,960
 thing called nixtamalization. Basically, you soak the grains of Maze, and then you cook them over

126
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,640
 wood ashes. And then there's like an invisible outer coating of the Maze and that gets removed.

127
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,960
 And then it's much easier to grind, much easier to cook, and it enhances the amount of protein in

128
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,520
 the Maze. And it's so much better that you can basically look at whatever this was invented by

129
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,920
 looking at old fires and where the Maze has been cooked. You can look at it and you can see all these

130
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,960
 Mesoamerican civilizations growing when each area kind of works out how to nixtamalize them.

131
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,680
 Really? Yeah, it's incredible. And when the Europeans went over and brought Maze back,

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,560
 there's lots of areas that kind of started eating Maze in the old world. But they still got

133
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,120
 quite malnourished because none of them knew how to nixtamalize things. Oh, really? Yeah.

134
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,880
 It's crazy. I never even heard that word before this week. And they also have that thing where

135
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,640
 they eat the fungus that grows on Maze in Mexico, don't they? Which actually looks kind of delicious

136
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,680
 and they have it corn smut. No, have you had it? What's corn? No, I hate funguses. Oh, sorry,

137
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,840
 that's why you took it. Of all the funguses that I'm ever going to try, maybe a black truffle,

138
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,880
 but a piece of corn smut? Probably not. It's a disease and it looks like a sort of black

139
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,880
 lump of mold. And there was quite a fun story in 2014 where there was a farmer called Nat Bradform

140
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,720
 and he was asked to grow some corn for a chef, quite a famous chef called Sean Brock,

141
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,840
 who's a big deal in America. And he wanted this corn to be grown for his handmade tortillas and

142
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,440
 poor Nat woke up one day when I went to his fields and overnight the whole thing destroyed by fungus.

143
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,680
 Corn smut everywhere. So he called the chef, you know, in tears. I'm so sorry, I've destroyed

144
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,760
 your restaurant. And obviously Sean, being a chef and knowing the ways of the Mexicans,

145
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,040
 was absolutely delighted. It was like, you've got a delicacy there. You've just accidentally

146
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,120
 grown overnight this fantastic delicacy that I'll incorporate into my Mexican restaurant food.

147
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
 Corn smut pizzas, I'll add. Corn smut pizzas, there you go.

148
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,600
 Do you guys know Taco Bell? You must know Taco Bell, massive American chain.

149
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,280
 I don't think I've ever been to one. Do we have them over here? Oh yeah. Oh, do we?

150
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,200
 Well, there's one within walking distance of my house. Yeah, they're here. They're not massive

151
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
 here, but in America, they're very, very big. And globally, they have places all over the world.

152
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,120
 One place they don't have is Mexico. And they've tried twice. The first time they went in,

153
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,760
 they sort of went all out just saying, this is a fast food version of what you guys have here.

154
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,480
 So have it. They said, no, it doesn't make sense. Second time they went in, which was years later,

155
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,440
 they tried to push it as not Mexican food, but American food, while still having the

156
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,400
 menu that they have. And they even advertised it by saying, it's not Mexican, it's just

157
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,280
 something else. I think that's a much better strategy, because yeah, Mexicans would deny

158
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,880
 it was Mexican at all. Americans deny it's American. And tacos weren't hard.

159
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,640
 It's insulting either way. It's insulting if you say this is your cuisine. It's insulting if you say

160
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,000
 this is our cuisine. They don't have any Taco Bells in North Korea either. It's for the same reason.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,520
 Yeah. They invented it. Exactly. Did you hear of Diana Kennedy? No. She was very cool. She's

162
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,040
 one of the people who has contributed to saving or not saving, but preserving huge amounts of the

163
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,800
 diversity of Mexican food. Because obviously it's a huge country. It's got hundreds of different

164
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,240
 cuisines in it. And she spent 60 years driving around the country, doing apprenticeships in

165
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,640
 bakeries, like going to individual villages and saying, what do you eat? Let me learn how to make

166
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,440
 it. I wanted to make it myself. And she was awarded not only. I think she might be the only

167
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,400
 person ever to have been awarded an MBE for services to Mexican-British relations, but also

168
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,560
 the Order of the Aztec Eagle, which is Mexico's highest honour. This is very cool, isn't it?

169
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,840
 We need to rename our MBEs. It's so much cooler. Yeah. And she was called the Indiana Jones of Food.

170
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,720
 She sounds great. Yeah. Which bit of Indiana Jones' career is at his academic side, where he's

171
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,240
 always as a professor or out fighting Nazis. No, it's like she's out in the... She's out,

172
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,760
 like she's gone into the temple. There's a rare kind of burrito on the stand.

173
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,720
 She's swapped it over for some tamales. She's holding it in her other hand.

174
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,120
 Chased by a giant ball of corn sluts.

175
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:20,800
 OK, it is time for fact number two. And that is Anna.

176
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,720
 My fact this week is that white noise was named because the pattern of its waves

177
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,800
 resembles white light. And pink noise was named because it resembles pink light.

178
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,720
 Brown noise was named after someone called Robert Brown.

179
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,960
 I've never heard of pink or brown noise. No.

180
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,080
 And I was quite unclear what white noise is actually before looking us up.

181
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,240
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, there we go. Let's get into it.

182
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
 So white noise, first of all, is the most common one that people know because it's this.

183
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,080
 And people often use it to make their children go to sleep.

184
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,840
 They do. And pink noise is more like...

185
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,360
 And is brown noise the one that makes you poo?

186
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,680
 And brown noise is the one that makes you shit yourself.

187
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
 No, it isn't, is it?

188
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,880
 It's not, no. So white noise is basically a noise that contains

189
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,600
 all the different frequencies within human hearing to the same extent.

190
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,400
 So we can hear between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz.

191
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,240
 And if you take all of those frequencies, 20, 21, 22, etc.

192
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,800
 And then you play them all with exactly the same amount of energy.

193
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,920
 That's white noise.

194
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,280
 Confusingly, white noise sounds horrible, I think.

195
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,480
 I don't understand people who find it relaxing because higher pitches sound louder to us.

196
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,640
 Pink noise is where there's more energy in the lower pitches.

197
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,760
 It's a bit basier. Now, listening to pink noise, I still think it sounds...

198
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,000
 It's still quite jarring, isn't it? I would say.

199
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
 Pink noise? Well, you know, like a lot of people,

200
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,920
 just to give the opposite side of the argument,

201
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
 think that it sounds like the waves washing over you.

202
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
 I would say brown noise sounds like waves.

203
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
 I think pink noise, but you're right, a lot of people do write that.

204
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
 But brown noise is the hip new noise, right?

205
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
 Brown noise is what everyone is now listening to on YouTube,

206
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
 hours at a time as they go to sleep.

207
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
 Headline in Glastonbury this year. Let's get with it, all right?

208
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
 And that's low brown noise.

209
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,040
 So brown noise is where you're putting a lot more energy into those lower frequencies.

210
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,720
 So it sounds bassy and I think if you listen to that, it sounds like trees

211
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,280
 or sounded a bit like a nice ocean waves to me.

212
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,080
 Can we explain why it's good for sleeping?

213
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
 Because I think that's important too.

214
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,520
 And I think the reasoning is it increases your what they call arousal threshold steady on.

215
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,800
 It's that normally if you're asleep and it's completely silent around you

216
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,840
 and then a car alarm goes off, you wake up, right?

217
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,080
 Because there's a big difference between the background nothing and then the car alarm.

218
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,320
 But if there's a background playing constantly,

219
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,880
 you're already kind of higher on the sonic mountain, like all boats have been lifted.

220
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,480
 And then so that spike of the car alarm, which is like the top of the mountain,

221
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
 it pokes up less high above the general background that you're listening to.

222
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,600
 And therefore there's less of a chance.

223
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 And it doesn't matter what frequency the car alarm is,

224
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 because all the frequencies are being fired at you anyway.

225
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,080
 Right.

226
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
 So it's bound to be covered by one of them.

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,880
 Exactly. So then you wake up in the morning, your car's been stolen again.

228
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,240
 At least you had a good night.

229
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,280
 Exactly.

230
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,960
 But apparently it also, for a lot of people, stops the voices in their own head.

231
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,800
 So people going to sleep going, "Oh, did I lock the car? Did I lock the car? I don't know."

232
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,400
 It stops all those questions from your head and just lets you fall asleep.

233
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,040
 It's and more so for ADHD people, as you'd expect, because we've got ADHD,

234
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,040
 then distractions in your mind and out of them are more distracting.

235
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,880
 And it sort of helps drown them out.

236
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,920
 I should probably say how these related to colors very quickly.

237
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,080
 Won't go into it to a boring extent.

238
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
 But just because white noise is named after white light.

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
 So that's white light is like all the frequencies of light,

240
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
 all mixed together equally.

241
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
 Pink light is what the brain interprets as a combination of red and blue light,

242
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
 but there's actually a bit less blue.

243
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
 So in the same way, it's a bit heavier on the lower frequencies,

244
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 because red is like a bit lower.

245
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,680
 And then brown, Robert Brown was a Scottish botanist.

246
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,240
 It's so random that his main legacy to the world is naming this kind of noise.

247
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,600
 Well, it's not his main legacy.

248
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,880
 He was an amazing botanist and his name is put to many animals and geographical locations.

249
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,280
 It's only become his main legacy since brownwise became the new trend.

250
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,560
 I must stop like before we did any of this stuff.

251
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,800
 I'd only heard of him because of brownie emotion.

252
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,160
 No, that's fair enough.

254
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,920
 But he's within the world of botany.

255
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
 His name is there.

256
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,320
 Lots of plants and grasses and things.

257
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,760
 Brownie emotion is the way particular molecules,

258
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
 if you look at them under a microscope,

259
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
 he observed they looked like they were dancing,

260
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
 these pollen grains that he was looking at.

261
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,200
 And they're not alive.

262
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
 How can they be dancing?

263
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
 It basically has to do with the heat of individual molecules.

264
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
 Yeah, the molecules are bouncing off things,

265
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
 moving things around in a random way.

266
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,880
 And this noise is more random than the others.

267
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,000
 Yes, the way it looks.

268
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,680
 And in fact, it was Einstein himself,

269
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,280
 good old Einstein, his first influential paper who took brownie emotion,

270
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,920
 which basically Robert Brown, and he had the habit of doing this,

271
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,160
 just looked at it, went, oh, that's happening.

272
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,600
 And then went back to his plants.

273
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
 And Einstein went, let's explain that.

274
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,800
 And it was essential to finding out that atoms and molecules

275
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,720
 are the smaller particles of matter,

276
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
 because it was like, how else could these pollen bits be moving,

277
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
 except of tinier bits of moving inside them?

278
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
 Yeah, he was a busy man.

279
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,800
 He collected 2000 new species in Australia alone.

280
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,520
 Yeah, but it was a piece of piss in those days.

281
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
 Like no one else had done it.

282
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,760
 So you just wander around.

283
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,920
 You guys said he wasn't seeing that flower before.

284
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,800
 Throw a brick.

285
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,200
 Yeah.

286
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,560
 Easy, here's a rare flower.

287
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,280
 Yeah, he was kind of there to help prove

288
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
 whether or not Australia was a group of islands.

289
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,840
 So it was known as New Holland at the time.

290
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,160
 And so the idea was that he was going to go through the interior

291
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,880
 to try and work out if this suddenly broke up.

292
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
 And that's a big task.

293
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,480
 Well, you wouldn't know.

294
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,400
 Just to prove that this 4,000 mile wide thing is not an island, please.

295
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,560
 Yeah.

296
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,920
 Because it gets quite warm in the middle, doesn't it?

297
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,360
 It does get a bit barren.

298
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,680
 Yeah.

299
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,320
 You know what's named after?

300
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
 To prove it's an island, you only have to go around the outside.

301
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
 You don't need to go in the middle.

302
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,920
 Andy, organizing a trek through the centre.

303
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,600
 Wait, what do you say?

304
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,040
 To prove something as an island all you have to do is go around the edge of it.

305
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,880
 No, because it could be like an atoll.

306
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
 You know, it could be an island within it.

307
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,520
 Yeah, exactly.

308
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
 You mean it could be fully encircled,

309
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,560
 but even then it's a lake inside, isn't it?

310
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,720
 Still think it needs studying.

311
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,520
 Sure.

312
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
 On this expedition, they took on two aboriginals,

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,440
 Bungary and Nambary.

314
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,040
 They took them on board to help them communicate with the local tribes.

315
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,600
 And they were essential to the success of the trip,

316
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,920
 basically, because every time they stopped on the coast,

317
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,120
 they had to send, it was usually Bungary, I think, onshore,

318
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
 to say these guys are legit, they're normal,

319
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
 and usually didn't speak the language of the different tribe,

320
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,400
 but at least knew the...

321
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 Is this bit still the same island or have we gone on to a different island?

322
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,480
 They knew the general habits,

323
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,680
 but usually the protocol was that you should remove your clothes.

324
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,240
 So every time they parked on the coast,

325
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,120
 they'd be like, "Right, Bunga, take your clothes off.

326
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
 Go ashore, please."

327
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,280
 So he had to strip down naked every time he went to negotiate with you.

328
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,240
 Really? Having a Bunga Bunga party?

329
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
 Having a Bunga party.

330
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
 Oh, my God.

331
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,800
 Yeah, actually, of course, Australia isn't one island.

332
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,080
 So fine.

333
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
 Thank you.

334
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,480
 And Brown was the first person from Europe to explore Tasmania.

335
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,880
 Right.

336
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,480
 And also for Andy, there is Tetradontium brownianum,

337
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
 which is a species of moss called Brown's foretooth moss,

338
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
 and it's named after him.

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,920
 He found it in a place called Roslyn near Edinburgh in the 18th century,

340
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,360
 and the place where he found it,

341
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,920
 you can still see this moss growing today.

342
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
 That's nice.

343
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,920
 That is very cool.

344
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,640
 That's very cool.

345
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
 The Brownian motion thing, by the way.

346
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,640
 So that was a discovery that he made at the time through a microscope that he had,

347
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,280
 and that was called into question many, many years later,

348
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,880
 because they thought there's no way that the microscope would have been able to prove this.

349
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
 And so there was a big thing where they took out the original microscopes,

350
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
 and they had to re-observe what he said he had observed

351
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
 in order to prove it.

352
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,920
 Well, they used his old microscope.

353
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 They used his exact microscopes.

354
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,520
 I think it's a weird thing to doubt, isn't it?

355
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,480
 The interesting thing is he thought that pollen was moving by themselves,

356
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,520
 and this was, you know, how sperms move around to reproduce.

357
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
 That's what the pollen was doing.

358
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,840
 Like this was the force of life that basically existed in all things,

359
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
 and it existed in the pollen,

360
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
 and that's why basically that was his thought.

361
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
 Oh, so it's quite a big theory.

362
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
 Yeah, it was, this was in the 1820s,

363
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 and it was such a big deal in the world

364
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
 that it was mentioned in Middlemarch, George Eliot.

365
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,160
 Is it?

366
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
 In the podcast, George Eliot's Middlemarch.

367
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,440
 Can I remember that bit?

368
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,760
 I did read Middlemarch a few years ago.

369
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,120
 It's not like a major plot point, though.

370
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,760
 No, it is.

371
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
 Dr. Lidgate.

372
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

373
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,320
 We Lidgate.

374
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
 He's a scientific one.

375
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,720
 He's trying to buy a vase from a guy called Mr. Fairbrother.

376
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,120
 Oh, yeah.

377
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,080
 And Mr. Fairbrother says,

378
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
 "You are eyeing that glass vase again.

379
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
 Do you want to make an exchange?

380
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
 I have some sea mice, fine specimens and spirits,

381
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,240
 and I will throw in Robert Brown's new thing,

382
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,200
 microscopic observations in the pollen of plants

383
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,280
 if you don't happen to have it already."

384
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,480
 I mean, that sounds like subtle advertising, doesn't it?

385
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,680
 That sounds...

386
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,240
 Oh, yeah, sorry.

387
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
 Then it goes #spawn.

388
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,960
 In fact, there's an offer code we can...

389
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,760
 So, this would be kind of a weird fact

390
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
 for a lot of people to listen to,

391
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
 because I think a lot of people listening

392
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,080
 are trying to get to sleep right now.

393
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
 Wake up!

394
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,760
 Have you checked the car?

395
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,160
 There are dozens of sleep podcasts.

396
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,640
 Uh-huh.

397
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
 I mean, specific sleep podcasts, you know,

398
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,280
 not just ours, which is just boring, but I mean...

399
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,120
 Supposedly.

400
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
 I don't know if this is like big podcast

401
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
 who sponsored this research,

402
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,880
 but 46% of people sometimes will listen

403
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,240
 to something as they go to sleep,

404
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
 and 28% do it regularly.

405
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,720
 Yeah.

406
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,360
 There's a thing they do on radio called Comfort Noise,

407
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,720
 which is...

408
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,560
 It's got a slightly different motive,

409
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,880
 but it's to also keep you at ease

410
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
 when radio goes silent.

411
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,880
 So, for example, if there's like a minute silence,

412
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,560
 because if there's a minute silence,

413
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
 and the radio goes completely silent,

414
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,400
 you start going, "Wait, has the radio station just turned off?"

415
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,040
 If it's complete silence, that's supposedly quite...

416
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,880
 But the only time there's ever a minute silent on the radio

417
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,280
 is when they say, "We're going to have a minute silence now

418
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,160
 to remember the dead."

419
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,040
 So, you never then go, "What the hell's up to my radio?"

420
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,320
 Well, it's interesting.

421
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,680
 They do it for a few reasons.

422
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,000
 So, one, they do think it gives a comfort to people

423
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,360
 who think it's suddenly turned off.

424
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
 So, they'll play bird noise,

425
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,800
 or they'll play London traffic in the background.

426
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,680
 So, it keeps it going.

427
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,400
 There are actually things...

428
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
 Beep, beep, beep!

429
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
 I'm walking here!

430
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,040
 I'm trying to drive down wide,

431
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,000
 or where's this huge crowd of people standing around in silence?

432
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
 Beep, beep!

433
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,320
 Wait, how come we've never heard?

434
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
 So, when they play the minute silence on the radio, that's what...

435
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,320
 I know I have heard a bit of bird song, actually.

436
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,080
 I think that is familiar.

437
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
 The other reason for it is,

438
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,200
 is because there's protocols in place

439
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
 as part of a major system for all radio,

440
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
 which is when absolute silence is there,

441
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
 a song will kick in.

442
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,360
 So, you don't want a minute silence for the Queen,

443
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,480
 and suddenly YMCA comes on halfway through, right?

444
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,560
 So, that's another part of it.

445
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,240
 Yeah, that's a good point.

446
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
 This is not to do with this, really,

447
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
 but the Master's Golf is probably happening

448
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
 when people are listening to this, or it's just happened.

449
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
 And they play in bird noises.

450
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
 And actually, a lot of golf...

451
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
 If you watch golf on TV, they play in bird noises.

452
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,200
 Oh, do they?

453
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
 And I was listening to Tom Scott's podcast,

454
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
 and they said that there was a time when

455
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,040
 they played in the wrong bird noise

456
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,640
 for wherever it was in the world.

457
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
 They were playing this golf tournament,

458
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,760
 and a load of people wrote in saying,

459
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,280
 "You don't get the great crested greeb in South Korea."

460
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:37,920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

461
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,720
 My fact is, when you hover over a link on the computer,

462
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,360
 and the mouse icon turns into a little hand,

463
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,960
 that icon dates back to the 11th century.

464
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
 They waited so long before inventing

465
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,560
 the rest of the computer, didn't they?

466
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,720
 You know, it looks like a white gloved hand,

467
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
 certainly on my computer, anyway.

468
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
 Mostly on Macs, you get it, or you get it on all of them.

469
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,200
 It's on quite a few.

470
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
 You can get it on all, then, you?

471
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,200
 Yeah, I don't know.

472
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,560
 So, on my computer, it's a little...

473
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,000
 It's like a pointing finger,

474
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,360
 and it's got a white glove on,

475
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,800
 and it's got three lines on the glove.

476
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,840
 It looks like a butler's glove.

477
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,040
 Like a snooker referee.

478
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,400
 A snooker referee, exactly.

479
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,960
 And those are our two reference points.

481
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,520
 James got a watching a lot of snooker.

482
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,320
 I grew up with staff.

483
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,800
 I was thinking...

484
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,400
 If anyone wants to know the difference between me and Andy,

485
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 I say this quite often, and that's it.

486
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
 For me, it's Mickey Mouse's club.

487
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,640
 And there's Dan.

488
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
 Yeah.

489
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,280
 So, this is a thing.

490
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,400
 It's based on a thing called the manicule,

491
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,440
 which dates back to the Doomsday book.

492
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
 It's a way of medieval scholars, in particular,

493
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,680
 to say, "Hey, look at this bit of the text."

494
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,760
 And it's just a pair of fingers that you draw,

495
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
 or sometimes you draw a whole hand,

496
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,320
 but the common element was always like a pointing finger

497
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
 saying, "Hey, look at this bit."

498
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
 It's like a highlighter.

499
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,080
 It's exactly like a highlighter

500
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
 without having to draw along the whole,

501
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,280
 because often the manuscripts are, you know,

502
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,640
 because they didn't have highlighters, basically.

503
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,440
 It's a way of marking passages.

504
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,040
 Or an arrow.

506
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,960
 I mean, it's so much effort to go to, isn't it?

507
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
 It's because when you look at them, they're so beautiful.

508
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
 And I guess it's just testament to that.

509
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,040
 Again, in the olden days, they didn't have Netflix and stuff.

510
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,880
 So, they clearly spent so long on these stunning drawings.

511
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,080
 Sometimes they'd be like a beautiful octopus pointing

512
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
 its various limbs at various bits of text.

513
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,960
 There was another dragon, which instead of a head,

514
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
 had a hand for a head pointing.

515
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,800
 There was a whole big Greek god kind of gesturing at something.

516
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,360
 And these are often just people who are reading the text as well.

517
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,240
 They're not, you know...

518
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,600
 They're usually monks.

519
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
 Often monks, but just literate people.

520
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,520
 I think often anyone who had the text was a reader,

521
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
 like a rich person.

522
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
 It's such an interesting evolution,

523
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
 because you have the Doomsday book,

524
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,840
 where it's the monks who are reading it,

525
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,120
 putting it in the margins, right?

526
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
 So, they're going, "Here's a bit.

527
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
 You as the next reader should look out for specifically."

528
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,120
 Then, by the time we get to the 15th century,

529
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
 the printers themselves are putting the fingers in

530
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,240
 to say, "We think you should look specifically at this bit."

531
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,560
 And then it kind of, to where we are today,

532
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,600
 evolves into how authors will now put footnotes

533
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
 in their own pages now, because they're now saying,

534
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
 "Actually, this is super interesting,

535
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
 and I want to tell you more about it.

536
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,480
 I'm going to take up the page.

537
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,080
 It's not even about the publisher

538
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,760
 or the reader putting in anymore."

539
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,840
 But yeah, they look absolutely lovely.

540
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,240
 They're stunning.

541
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,040
 And they're just a form of marginalia, really, aren't they?

542
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,960
 Yeah, a marginalia is just anything

543
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,920
 that's not part of the book

544
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,800
 that was scribbled by someone else in the margins, right?

545
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,440
 Yeah.

546
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,080
 And then the modern one, certainly the one in the Mac,

547
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
 was invented by someone called Susan Pear.

548
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,120
 And she has done lots of different icons

549
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,560
 for various computers,

550
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,720
 not just Macs, also Windows stuff.

551
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,760
 So she came up with the command key on Apple keyboards.

552
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,480
 Wow.

553
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,200
 Which is a biggie.

554
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
 It's like, what does it look like?

555
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,040
 It's a square with circles on each corner, isn't it?

556
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,360
 It's like a little infinity knot.

557
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,160
 Infinity knot, yeah.

558
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,600
 She got it from some road signs in Scandinavia.

559
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
 They used it for landmarks.

560
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,680
 And she just thought, "That looks good, so I'll use that."

561
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,200
 And she also designed the card deck for Windows Solitaire game.

562
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
 That's a biggie, isn't it?

563
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
 She's had a huge influence on my childhood.

564
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,160
 Yeah, she's amazing.

565
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
 And the road sign thing is very interesting,

566
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,680
 because that's exactly what she said

567
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,040
 each of the symbols needed to be.

568
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,120
 They needed to be as clear as a road sign.

569
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
 She had zero experience in this field.

570
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,720
 And so as part of the interview,

571
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,360
 she went to a library and she took out a bunch of books

572
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,280
 that were all about graphic design

573
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
 and just brought them and put them on the table with her.

574
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,000
 So it looked like she was super keen.

575
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,440
 They were like, "Oh, look at all those books."

576
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
 She must have read them.

577
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,760
 She came into the interview room.

578
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
 Did she just sort of close the last book in the pile

579
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
 that she got to the end of the last page?

580
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,160
 Huh, okay.

581
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,400
 Yeah, sorry, what's the pay?

582
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,280
 A lot of her designs, now you wouldn't see,

583
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,960
 because they're quite 80s,

584
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
 but one that stuck around is the thing

585
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,680
 that I never know what it is, that little watch.

586
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,120
 So you know sometimes, and I think again,

587
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,200
 sorry, we're very spoiled office, so we all use Macs,

588
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,920
 but you've got the mouse, you've got the hand,

589
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,080
 you sometimes get the little timer thing.

590
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,160
 And you know, sometimes you get a little watch that comes up.

591
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,640
 And it just basically means something's fucked up.

592
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,600
 Oh, I've never seen that.

593
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,040
 I always thought it was a computer saying,

594
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,680
 "I'm working it out. Give me time," is what it's saying.

595
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,800
 Oh, maybe it is saying that.

596
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,920
 Yes, I think perhaps it's that.

597
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,800
 Well, I see you.

598
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,760
 Well, it's very annoying anyway,

599
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,120
 so I'm not a huge fan of her.

600
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,360
 It still uses the floppy disk symbol

601
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,560
 for when you're saving something.

602
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,280
 Oh, yeah.

603
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,960
 And no one using a computer who was born in the 2000s

604
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,520
 will have any idea really what a floppy disk is,

605
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
 in the same way that they don't, yeah.

606
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,040
 Except they're all reading all the lists that say,

607
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,600
 "Oh, why are we still using this old watch on floppy disks?"

608
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,680
 You can still buy floppy disks, by the way.

609
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,560
 Yeah, yeah.

610
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,360
 And they're often used by like DIY media,

611
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,400
 arty kind of people.

612
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,880
 If you create an amazing bit of media

613
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,440
 and you want it to be really sort of super awesome,

614
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,800
 you might just put it on floppy disk

615
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,080
 and everyone will think it's even better.

616
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,400
 But you can buy them.

617
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,760
 There's not that many around,

618
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,360
 but there's a few specialist places,

619
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,840
 and they cost about $1 per megabyte of data.

620
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,200
 Okay, that's a lot.

621
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
 It is, because the average cost of memory right now

622
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,160
 is one cent per gigabyte.

623
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,040
 So if you buy a floppy disk

624
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,560
 for your to save something,

625
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,320
 it's the equivalent of buying a pint of milk

626
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,400
 with a one kilogram bar of gold.

627
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,720
 Cool.

628
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,240
 Which is what I do,

629
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
 but I'm not really in time for the common man.

630
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,960
 This pointy thing, just one last thing on the manicule.

631
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,280
 Oh, yeah.

632
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,440
 I just like the names of it.

633
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,120
 So it was called the Indicationum, or the index,

634
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,360
 which is from the Latin for "to point".

635
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,920
 And that's where...

636
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,720
 Index finger.

637
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
 Index finger comes from, yeah.

638
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,520
 But it was also known as a mutton fist or a bishop's fist.

639
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,400
 And I don't know why.

640
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,000
 Yeah.

641
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,640
 That's interesting.

642
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,800
 I was actually reading, as far as my research for this,

643
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,040
 the descriptions of the perfect hand.

644
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,560
 Because, you know, it's a drawing of a hand,

645
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,320
 and we get how people have drawn hands.

646
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
 And it included mutton hands,

647
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,400
 but as a non-desirable thing.

648
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,240
 This was...

649
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,680
 This was in the 18th century,

650
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,320
 a guy wrote a book called "Authorpedia".

651
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
 And it's a guy called Nicholas Andree,

652
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,520
 and it's where we get orthopedics from,

653
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,960
 is him, he invented it.

654
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,680
 And it actually means a correct or straight child,

655
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
 hence the pedia,

656
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
 because it was a book of how to correct deformities in children.

657
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,480
 And I've read his whole chapter on what makes the perfect hand.

658
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
 And he indeed said,

659
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,560
 "Your hand should not look like shoulders of mutton."

660
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,520
 That's fair enough.

661
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,760
 Well, his shoulder of mutton thing

662
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,160
 was just a hand that was a bit too square.

663
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,920
 And I am looking at your hand now, James.

664
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,480
 And he said,

665
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
 "Although they're useful for catching things,

666
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
 they're the worst type of shape."

667
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,880
 Are you joking?

668
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,240
 I've got beautiful hands.

669
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,040
 Yeah, don't listen, James.

670
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,480
 You've got lovely piano players' hands.

671
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,960
 Can I ask you...

672
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
 I am good at catching things.

673
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
 I had to say that, didn't you?

674
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,520
 That looked very clear.

675
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,640
 Sip of this, Connery.

676
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,520
 Can I check if you guys have these proportions?

677
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:31,920
 OK.

678
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,120
 I was actually quite impressed with mine

679
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
 when I went through his list.

680
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,600
 So your finger should be a bit round above and flat below.

681
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,520
 Your index tip,

682
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,720
 the tip of your index finger,

683
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,960
 should end at the root of the middle fingernail.

684
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,800
 If you're holding your hand up straight in front of you

685
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
 with your fingers together,

686
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,680
 tip of your index fingernail

687
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,640
 should line up with the root of your middle fingernail.

688
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,280
 Everyone got that?

689
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,840
 Close enough, yeah.

690
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,720
 Oh, um...

691
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,560
 No, I'm a bit low, I think.

692
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,000
 Yeah, that's classic,

693
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
 and he says a bit low is bad.

694
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,840
 What respect?

695
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
 Does it mean I'm a bad podcaster?

696
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,680
 Or does it mean I'm an evil person?

697
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
 I'm hearing mutter.

698
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,160
 I'm afraid it means just you've got...

699
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,960
 It means you've got three weeks.

700
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,520
 Shit happens.

701
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,960
 The ring finger needs to reach the middle nail

702
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,920
 of your middle finger.

703
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,560
 Oh, my God, I'm nowhere near that.

704
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,960
 James, this guy would have really had a field day

705
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,680
 with your hands, actually.

706
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,880
 They're all over the place, aren't they?

707
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,320
 We're making it so like James is a Simpsons character.

708
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,840
 I've only got four fingers.

709
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,040
 I've got five because I'm God.

710
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,000
 Can I just very quickly speak about highlighters?

711
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,640
 Oh, yeah.

712
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,000
 So these little hands are pointing to a thing

713
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,320
 that today we would just get a yellow felt tip

714
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,400
 and color it in and people will be able to see it.

715
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,960
 Those things, the fluorescent highlighters,

716
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,320
 they were invented by accident in 1963.

717
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
 By a guy called Francis J. Hon who was trying to make

718
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,640
 a new kind of marker for children.

719
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,160
 And while he was experimenting,

720
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,080
 he got this yellow ink and he put it on

721
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,160
 and he realized that it basically could still see

722
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,240
 the text in between it and he thought, "Oh, I'll do that."

723
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,400
 And you know Stabilo Boss highlighters.

724
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
 I feel like they're the biggie.

725
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,560
 They're the biggie.

726
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,040
 They're kind of like square in shape, aren't they?

727
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,240
 And they've got a very flat tip.

728
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,000
 And that flat tip was actually invented by accident.

729
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,160
 So annoying.

730
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,560
 One day, some people at Stabilo,

731
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,360
 in fact, it was Schwann Stabilo who was in charge

732
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,480
 of Stabilo Boss.

733
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,120
 He and his group, they were doing some presentation

734
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,200
 of this thing and it wasn't really working properly

735
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,960
 and they slammed it onto the desk and it made it flat

736
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,360
 at the bottom.

737
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,200
 They went, "Oh, look, this works amazingly."

738
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,840
 That's according to their official website.

739
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,560
 I don't believe it.

740
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,720
 One more thing on that, please.

741
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,040
 In 1996, a prisoner in the UK decided

742
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,080
 that he would try to get taken out of prison

743
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,800
 and put into hospital by saying that he had jaundice

744
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,880
 by coloring his entire body in with a yellow Stabilo Boss

745
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,520
 highlighter.

746
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,280
 And the prison spokesman said he carefully painted

747
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,920
 all of his body, even his private bits,

748
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,520
 with a yellow highlighter pen.

749
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,560
 The problem was that he had made such a good job of it

750
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
 that he would probably have died if his skin

751
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
 was really that color.

752
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,960
 Wow.

753
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,000
 Who did his back?

754
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,360
 Someone else has evolved.

755
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,080
 Oh, yeah.

756
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,960
 What a soulmate's for, Anna, if not helping you out.

757
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,520
 You're right.

758
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,720
 Can I tell you about a really silly drawing

759
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,920
 things controversy?

760
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,400
 Okay.

761
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,520
 This is great.

762
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,120
 Let's go back to 1927.

763
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,280
 Switzerland.

764
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,240
 There's a geologist called Albert Heim,

765
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,720
 who at this point is about 70 years old,

766
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,400
 a very eminent Swiss geologist,

767
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,880
 and he got in a huge row with the Swiss Federal

768
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,120
 Office of Topography over the way maps were

769
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,160
 drawn as Switzerland.

770
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,560
 Right?

771
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,040
 Okay.

772
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,600
 So, you know those relief maps which show altitude?

773
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,480
 You know, they look like they've got the mountains on.

774
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,680
 They look like if you touch them,

775
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,640
 they'd be all lumpy and bumpy.

776
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,000
 Yeah, I like those ones.

777
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
 Yeah, beautifully drawn.

778
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,360
 And they often look like there's light

779
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,320
 and shade on them, right?

780
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,880
 Albert Heim's problem was that in Switzerland's

781
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
 two official map series,

782
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
 they were shaded as if the sunlight comes

783
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,680
 from the northwest.

784
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,320
 And he said, this cannot stand.

785
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,600
 There's no way the sunlight's coming from the northwest

786
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
 and hitting Switzerland, right?

787
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,560
 He said this was a lie that flew in the face of nature.

788
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,280
 What a hero.

789
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,440
 It's very huge, eh?

790
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,080
 I bet he had good fingers.

791
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,120
 And he, I read this whole article

792
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,280
 about the Northwest Illumination Problem,

793
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,080
 which was an established thing from the Middle Ages onwards.

794
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,000
 It was just the way people drew,

795
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,280
 and there are loads of theories as to why,

796
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
 maybe it's because cartographers drew from left to right.

797
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
 So, you want to shade so that you...

798
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,840
 Because you're right-handed, for instance.

799
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,120
 Because you're right-handed, basically.

800
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,320
 So, even in medieval maps,

801
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,480
 the light is falling from left to right.

802
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,960
 Or cartographers draw with the right hand,

803
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
 so the drawing doesn't cast a shadow,

804
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
 so they can see what they're doing.

805
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,240
 Basically, it's the same as that.

806
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
 And wait just to double check.

807
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,920
 The truth is that it would only ever be coming from

808
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,840
 the south if we're in the northern hemisphere,

809
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,800
 because if it gets to...

810
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,000
 Either it's going above you or...

811
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,920
 Well, the sun moves, but generally,

812
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,400
 you don't get as much light coming from the northwest.

813
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,960
 Cool.

814
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,240
 So, what happened next?

815
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,880
 Any guesses?

816
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,600
 He was murdered.

817
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 They turned it into a map of Australia,

818
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,120
 where it would have made sense.

819
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,440
 They turned all of the maps upside down

820
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,840
 and traced them from the back,

821
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,360
 so that now they were on the right way.

822
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,920
 Lovely.

823
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,720
 Lovely.

824
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,360
 No, he didn't win.

825
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,880
 This is still coming from the northwest.

826
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,840
 He had nothing.

827
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,240
 That's all.

828
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,920
 Is that how we could tell from history

829
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
 who was a left-hander versus right-hander?

830
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
 If we looked at maps and the way the shadow falls.

831
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
 Nice idea, I don't know.

832
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
 I think everyone was a right-hander in fairness.

833
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,440
 Really?

834
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,880
 Oh, yeah, maybe.

835
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,160
 They weren't as tolerant.

836
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
 Drawn by the right-handers.

837
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,200
 That's so interesting.

838
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,800
 Hey, what is the most famous drawing of hands in the world?

839
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
 And now think of that.

840
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,400
 Escher, where he draws his own hand.

841
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
 I'm thinking Mike Landler.

842
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,640
 Sistine Chapel.

843
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,760
 So, let's say that's number one.

844
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,480
 What's number two?

845
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,680
 What about the Mona Lisa?

846
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
 She has her hands one over the other, doesn't she?

847
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
 Yeah, that's true.

848
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,360
 That is a good one.

849
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,120
 It's not the main bit of the Mona Lisa, though, is it?

850
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,320
 What's number three?

851
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
 I've got Jura's hands.

852
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
 The artist's Jura, the Praying Hands, which are...

853
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,600
 Albrecht Jura.

854
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,000
 Yeah.

855
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,960
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

856
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
 Yeah, that is famous.

857
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
 Those are very famous hands.

858
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,240
 The Clefton Prater.

859
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,960
 Yeah, and people have them on their walls globally,

860
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,760
 if you're religious.

861
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,360
 They're a very important piece of art.

862
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,200
 They're from the 1500s.

863
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
 And for many, many years, it was thought that it was a sketch drawing

864
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,400
 that was then transferred onto a big altered piece that Jura did

865
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,520
 as part of a commission.

866
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,760
 So, everyone thought that this is just a quick sketch,

867
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
 but it's become this massive famous thing.

868
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,600
 There's a new theory, which is being put forward by one of the curators

869
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,320
 of a major museum, that he used it effectively as a business card.

870
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,680
 So, whenever people came and he said,

871
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,720
 "You should get me as an artist,"

872
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,160
 he would pull it out of his desk and say,

873
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,800
 "This is the kind of stuff that I'm capable of doing."

874
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,520
 I can draw hands.

875
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,160
 Yeah, I can draw hands.

876
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
 Hands are hard, yeah.

877
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,320
 That was famous, wasn't it?

878
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
 And the Renaissance, it was like no one could draw.

879
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,360
 It's like AI as well.

880
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,200
 Which I know a question.

881
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,560
 Now that we've seen all these bloody doodles

882
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
 going back to medieval times of people drawing,

883
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,520
 as far as I'm concerned, brilliant hands all over manuscripts.

884
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,600
 These Renaissance artists who couldn't hack it.

885
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,280
 Those are cartoos of hands, though.

886
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,800
 You know, you want to really good hands are really hard to do.

887
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,240
 And it's a nightmare for portrait artists

888
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
 who have to get their subjects to do everything.

889
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,960
 Can you just stick them in your pockets?

890
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,440
 You think it's possible that they could do hands perfectly,

891
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,320
 but everyone in the Renaissance had manky fingers like I do.

892
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,760
 That would be it.

893
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,960
 A lot of mutton theory.

894
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:37,920
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

895
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,600
 and that is my fact.

896
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,480
 My fact this week is that there was a football match

897
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,240
 in Germany last year where one team was made up entirely

898
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 of players called Krotanovic.

899
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,120
 Brilliant.

900
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,720
 So confusing for anyone playing them.

901
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
 In fact, apparently a lot of teams often think

902
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,160
 Krotanovic is the sponsor of the team on the jersey.

903
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,640
 I read that, but then they are actually sponsored

904
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
 by Krotanovic, some of the players as well.

905
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,320
 What's Krotanovic?

906
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
 Krotanovic is a surname.

907
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,720
 Yeah, and a lot of these guys who play for the team

908
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,920
 have their own company, so they put that on this dress.

909
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,160
 So this is a bottom of the league German football team

910
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,600
 who play in the town of Florsheim,

911
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,560
 and this is a tiny town, 20,000 population.

912
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,880
 They have a team that was put together by a guy

913
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,040
 who's called Harris Krotanovic, and he thought,

914
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,760
 who can I get to be reliable to come up to practice,

915
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,640
 to show up?

916
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,840
 Why not my family?

917
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,640
 Why not my uncles?

918
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,840
 Why not my second cousins?

919
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,840
 A few buddies came along.

920
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,280
 But for one match at least, when you walked onto the pitch,

921
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,080
 you were playing one name, Krotanovic.

922
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,240
 It's like the opposite of nepotism.

923
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,920
 There should be a word for when you just get

924
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,160
 roped into a career that you didn't really want.

925
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,560
 You're guilted.

926
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,480
 They all speak Bosnian on the pitch as well,

927
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,960
 because they're all from this area of the border

928
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,360
 between Montenegro and Serbia and Bosnia.

929
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,560
 So yeah, that's where they're from originally.

930
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,280
 And this team, they're actually really successful as well,

931
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,680
 because, well, I mean, relatively,

932
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,480
 they're in the 11th division in Germany,

933
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
 but they were in the 13th division,

934
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,240
 and they got moved up two divisions,

935
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,640
 because they were the second team,

936
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,320
 and their first team were doing really badly,

937
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,680
 so they swapped them around.

938
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,000
 Right.

939
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,680
 Because they also have a few players who aren't Krotanovic's,

940
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,480
 but who are Serbian and Montenegro,

941
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,920
 and who have played in higher leagues,

942
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,840
 so they're kind of better than they should be.

943
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,240
 How do those guys feel about being shackled

944
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,760
 to the floor of the leagues by the millions of Krotanovic's

945
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,440
 who they have to turn up with every week?

946
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,000
 I think the truth is that on a normal week,

947
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
 they probably have about four or five Krotanovic's

948
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,280
 playing for them,

949
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,600
 but occasionally, they bring out a full multiple.

950
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,480
 I hope this is being filmed.

951
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,080
 It sounds like welcome to Wrexham.

952
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,880
 If they're making their way up the leagues, imagine.

953
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,920
 That's a really good point, as even more wholesome, isn't it?

954
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,600
 Should we buy them?

955
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,480
 Like Ryan Reynolds?

956
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,760
 Should we be the Ryan Reynolds

957
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
 of 11th division German football?

958
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,440
 I think we definitely could get on their jersey.

959
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,480
 We could be the sponsors.

960
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,880
 We'd have to change our name to Krotanovic as well.

961
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,920
 I think it's worth it.

962
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,520
 Do you know what the German football team is?

963
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,360
 Well, no, I don't actually.

964
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,000
 Manshaft.

965
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,240
 Great stuff.

966
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,520
 Just every time I see it,

967
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,280
 whenever there's a World Cup on, it makes me laugh.

968
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
 But you get this every now and then

969
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,160
 with families playing football.

970
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
 The Gojonsons, famously.

971
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,080
 So Ida Gojonson, who used to play for Bolton,

972
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,280
 he's Icelandic,

973
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,800
 and his son Arnor was also playing for Iceland,

974
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,000
 and there was one game where Ida was playing,

975
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,120
 and he got taken off,

976
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,040
 and his son came on instead of him.

977
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,480
 It was like a substitution.

978
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
 They were in the same squad,

979
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,880
 but they were on the same pitch for like a micro millisecond,

980
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,600
 just before they passed over, and then, yeah.

981
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,480
 That's very good.

982
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,840
 James is a goal fan.

983
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,400
 Do you know the work and recent playing

984
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,800
 of Jung Un Lee 6th?

985
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,200
 This is going to be a Kim Jong Un thing, isn't it?

986
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,000
 No, no, no.

987
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,600
 She was a US women's open champion.

988
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,400
 She was ranked,

989
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,760
 I think, at her highest at seventh in the world.

990
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,560
 Is she Korean?

991
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,080
 Yeah, she is, and she's called Jung Un Lee 6th

992
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,200
 because there have been five other Jung Un Lee's,

993
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,360
 and in order for them all to differentiate themselves,

994
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,320
 they've attached a number to the end of their name.

995
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,120
 Oh, really?

996
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,960
 So that would happen in a normal family,

997
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
 like if Andy's father and grandfather

998
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,320
 were all called Andy Murray,

999
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,480
 you would be Andy Murray the third, right?

1000
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,320
 Yes, but these are not family members.

1001
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,280
 These all happen to just be players with the same name.

1002
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,760
 So yeah, so she officially goes by Lee 6th.

1003
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,480
 So Lee, and then the number six right after her surname,

1004
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,080
 and then you've got one, two, three, four, and five,

1005
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,120
 who are all golfers.

1006
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,520
 So it's quite funny when you see anything written about her.

1007
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,480
 That's sort of...

1008
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,080
 It looks like you're reading something about royalty.

1009
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,880
 Great.

1010
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,560
 Brady Fiegel, have you heard of him?

1011
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:48,960
 No.

1012
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
 Brady Fiegel's a minor league baseball pitcher,

1013
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,360
 and he's six foot four.

1014
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,160
 He's got glasses where he's got a sort of the rim

1015
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
 of the glasses sit over the top,

1016
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,960
 but allow for the lens itself not to be covered in a rim,

1017
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,760
 if you know what I mean.

1018
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,160
 So...

1019
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,720
 Yeah.

1020
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,840
 So frameless at the bottom.

1021
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,400
 Frameless at the bottom is a quicker way of saying that.

1022
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,680
 Underboob glasses.

1023
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,280
 Yeah, that's actually the way I'm saying it.

1024
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,400
 Underboob glasses.

1025
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,000
 He's got red hair and...

1026
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,840
 I'm giving you all the...

1027
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,240
 I'm giving you some for underboob glasses, red hair.

1028
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,200
 Is this a police line?

1029
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,840
 Now draw them.

1030
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,800
 Did he take your car?

1031
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,760
 I was listening to a white noise in bed.

1032
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,040
 You had a smash and there's a baseball bat going through your car with dope.

1033
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,040
 All you saw as he went away was the shock of orange hair,

1034
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,800
 and him holding up his underboob glasses going,

1035
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,000
 "See you later, sucker!"

1036
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,080
 So he had an elbow problem that needed surgery,

1037
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,120
 so he had that done.

1038
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,040
 And then six months later,

1039
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,520
 the doctor who performed the elbow surgery is told,

1040
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,400
 "Your patient, Bradley Fiegel, is ready for his surgery."

1041
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,880
 And he thought, "I did this six months ago."

1042
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,320
 And so it turns out there are two Bradley Fiegel's,

1043
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,080
 both who wear underboob glasses,

1044
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,160
 who are six foot four with red hair,

1045
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,920
 who look exactly the same.

1046
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,880
 Both car thieves.

1047
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,240
 Both have the same name,

1048
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,480
 and both had to have the exact same surgery

1049
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,680
 from the exact same doctor for the bit of the elbow.

1050
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,920
 And now they are aware of each other.

1051
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,520
 That's how they became aware of each other.

1052
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,480
 And they did a DNA test, didn't they, recently,

1053
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,080
 to see if they were actually related.

1054
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,480
 And?

1055
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:22,880
 No.

1056
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,640
 I think to get the media to shut the hell up

1057
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,000
 about these two Bradley Fiegel's.

1058
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,480
 Wow.

1059
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,240
 It turned out they're not related at all,

1060
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,280
 but they do both have ancestors from Germany.

1061
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,880
 According to one of these fake, you know, 23 and me things.

1062
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,120
 Thought what you would have known from their stername Fiegel,

1063
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,280
 wouldn't you?

1064
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,600
 Yes.

1065
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,520
 Right, right, right, right.

1066
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,720
 There was a charity football game in Bungie in 2012,

1067
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,240
 where 70 people played football.

1068
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,880
 It was Bungie, not the naked guy from two facts ago.

1069
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,680
 From the Aboriginal.

1070
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,560
 From Brown's mission.

1071
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,400
 We shortened, we nicknamed him Bungie,

1072
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,120
 because we're mates.

1073
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,360
 Right.

1074
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,560
 But he was called Bungery.

1075
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,200
 Oh, right, okay.

1076
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,000
 Like Dungery.

1077
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,160
 And this is Bungie, which I think is...

1078
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,440
 It's unusual to have that word twice in one episode.

1079
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,520
 It's like Bartomein-Hoff syndrome, isn't it?

1080
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:01,760
 Yeah.

1081
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,360
 You'll see Bungies everywhere now.

1082
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,720
 There was a charity game in Bungie in Suffolk in 2012,

1083
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,640
 where 70 people with the same name played.

1084
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,120
 And they were all called Bungie.

1085
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,040
 They should have raised money by going Bungie jumping.

1086
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,000
 What were they thinking?

1087
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,320
 Nice.

1088
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,240
 That's a big game.

1089
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,760
 How did you manage to get 70 people there?

1090
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
 Because it was all the officials as well,

1091
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,040
 all the mascots, the match doctor,

1092
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,040
 and also quite a lot of people who went to see the match

1093
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,760
 were called Bungie.

1094
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,280
 They were all called Bungie?

1095
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,480
 Yeah, and it was all complete coincidence.

1096
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,320
 I didn't know there were that many Bungies knocking about.

1097
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,960
 I'm very surprised.

1098
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,360
 I know.

1099
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,120
 There's 455, according to the census at the time.

1100
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,440
 And with 70 of them, that's close to 15% of all the UK Bungies

1101
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,040
 that showed up to this one spot.

1102
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,720
 Although it wasn't all UK.

1103
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,560
 There was one who came from Australia,

1104
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,080
 who was then sent off a swearing.

1105
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,760
 Brilliant.

1106
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,160
 Brilliant.

1107
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
 That way for a charity game.

1108
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,680
 And they'd advertised for Bungies, which is why,

1109
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,000
 in case you hadn't figured that out when you were listening to this.

1110
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,080
 It used to be really common to give kids the same names in the UK.

1111
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,840
 And in Scotland, it was the case until the 19th century

1112
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,600
 that it was relatively common, especially on the island of Skye

1113
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,680
 and in other Western Isles.

1114
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,440
 There was a survey done of people who lived in the 19th century there,

1115
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,600
 and there were 462 households that had two sons that shared a name.

1116
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,000
 Really?

1117
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,840
 And 232 were two daughters shared a name.

1118
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,800
 So there's quite a lot of it.

1119
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,240
 And it was mostly in this area.

1120
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,440
 And they think what happened was,

1121
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,360
 basically they had real rules for naming your kids.

1122
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,680
 The first son will be named after his father's father.

1123
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,680
 Second son named after his mother's father.

1124
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,200
 Third son named after the father.

1125
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,480
 First daughter named after the mother's mother.

1126
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,000
 And what happens with that is,

1127
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,160
 eventually the number of names just gets lower and lower and lower.

1128
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,320
 Because like from one generation, that's fine.

1129
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,880
 But then the next generation, suddenly everyone's called Mary.

1130
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,200
 And then four generations, everyone's called John.

1131
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,080
 And that's what happens.

1132
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,720
 And so that really happened until quite a long time.

1133
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,720
 What self-inflicted confusion that must have wrought over the island of Skye?

1134
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,840
 Well, yeah, it's funny, isn't it?

1135
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,760
 Because there's another thing where people name,

1136
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,640
 people call each other by the wrong names within families.

1137
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,040
 So there's a thing, if you've got lots of siblings,

1138
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,960
 you might have found that one of your parents will say Blar.

1139
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,520
 No, Blar.

1140
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,480
 No, Anna or whatever.

1141
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:12,960
 Oh, yeah.

1142
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,440
 Have you had that?

1143
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,400
 That happens a lot, yeah.

1144
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,040
 Christ, yes.

1145
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,280
 Right.

1146
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,040
 They run through the full gammo of names.

1147
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,720
 Do they ever throw in the dog's name as well, Anna?

1148
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,360
 Absolutely, yeah.

1149
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,920
 OK.

1150
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,280
 So there's a reason behind that.

1151
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,160
 Which is Toffo.

1152
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,440
 It's just unbelievable that you think your child will be called that.

1153
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,560
 I've looked at you before, Anna, and thought Toffo.

1154
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,520
 But there's a reason behind this which is really interesting,

1155
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,560
 which is that it's to do with how your brain stores names.

1156
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,000
 And basically, in your brain,

1157
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,880
 you have two envelopes in which you keep all the names.

1158
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,560
 In one envelope, you keep...

1159
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,760
 Stop saying envelope.

1160
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,440
 These are metaphorical envelopes, aren't they?

1161
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,000
 No, no, no.

1162
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,360
 No, they're like the computer icons.

1163
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,720
 They're not metaphorical.

1164
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,360
 They're just small.

1165
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,640
 So one of them, one envelope, is for really close acquaintances.

1166
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,320
 So immediate family.

1167
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,640
 People who really matter to you.

1168
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,400
 The other, for everyone else.

1169
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,520
 So when you're trying to name someone,

1170
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,720
 one of your children, obviously,

1171
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,080
 someone who's from envelope number one,

1172
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,000
 people are almost always taking the wrong name out of the right folder.

1173
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,560
 And that is why a parent, like your mum,

1174
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,880
 will cycle through all of your siblings' names

1175
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,040
 and the dog's name before they get to your name,

1176
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,400
 because those names are all from the right folder.

1177
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,120
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

1178
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,080
 It's just that they're the wrong names.

1179
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,800
 Yeah.

1180
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,600
 You know what, I put the dog's name in just the drawer below.

1181
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
 I wouldn't have the dog in the same folder,

1182
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,800
 but maybe I'm a better parent.

1183
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,120
 Hey, just on Scottish names,

1184
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,720
 we were talking about a Scottish person before, Robert Brown.

1185
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,840
 He was a Scottish botanist who lived in the 1800s.

1186
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,120
 So just for anyone who's listening,

1187
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,800
 who's thinking, "Wait, Robert Brown,

1188
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,480
 the botanist and bootmaker born in the 1800s?"

1189
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,760
 No, not that one.

1190
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,160
 For anyone who's thinking, "Oh, Robert Brown,

1191
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,120
 the Scottish botanist who also was the first person

1192
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,720
 to use the word gadget in a book?"

1193
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,640
 No, not that botanist.

1194
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,160
 For anyone who's thinking, "Robert Brown,

1195
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,520
 the Scottish botanist who was also the polar explorer

1196
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,320
 from the 1800s?"

1197
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,760
 No, not that one either.

1198
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,040
 Apparently, there were multiple amazing botanists

1199
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,840
 called Robert Brown who all existed in the 1800s,

1200
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,600
 who went and made major discoveries.

1201
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,720
 And that was a problem to the point.

1202
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,200
 I'll tell you where it's at.

1203
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,640
 Because Robert Brown,

1204
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,720
 the one who wrote gadget for the first time ever,

1205
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,200
 had to call himself Robert Brown of Campster

1206
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,160
 to differentiate himself when people confused him

1207
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,920
 with the Robert Brown of Brown noise.

1208
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,040
 What did you say called himself?

1209
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,520
 He called himself Campster.

1210
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,320
 He was from...

1211
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,080
 So he said "Hampster" for some reason.

1212
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,400
 Whenever he collected a new sample,

1213
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,600
 he'd stuff it into his cheeks.

1214
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,920
 There's a group of people in Papua New Guinea

1215
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,680
 called the Orocaeva people.

1216
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,120
 And they have a brilliant system, right?

1217
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,440
 So if you have the same name as someone else,

1218
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,600
 as long as you're on good terms with them,

1219
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,840
 you count each other as what's called a sasso,

1220
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,040
 a namesake, and you are basically the same person

1221
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,400
 in the eyes of that society.

1222
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,480
 Like you can shag their wives and...

1223
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,000
 No, that's true.

1224
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,440
 So it's really interesting.

1225
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,360
 If you're the younger sasso,

1226
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,320
 you will consult the elder at every stage of your ritual life.

1227
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,120
 You don't have to ask them,

1228
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,000
 "What should I have for supper tonight?"

1229
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,760
 But when you do your confirmation and stuff.

1230
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,560
 Exactly like that.

1231
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,360
 Yeah, yeah.

1232
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,000
 And as the older one ages,

1233
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,600
 the younger one has a responsibility

1234
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,880
 to provide him with firewood and other provisions.

1235
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,720
 And if the older one dies without a will,

1236
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,960
 then you have to sort out his affairs for him.

1237
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,640
 And your family groups, your kin groups,

1238
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,520
 are kind of knitted together,

1239
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,120
 because it's understood that you

1240
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,520
 and this other person are the same person.

1241
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,160
 What a burden.

1242
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,080
 And is that just if I bumped into someone at the party

1243
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,320
 called Anatojinsky, who is a tedious don?

1244
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,880
 I'd then be stuck intertwined with this person.

1245
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,160
 Yes, but she'd be stuck in to find

1246
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,200
 with someone who's very rude

1247
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,120
 about a lot of other people all the time for no good reason.

1248
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,800
 So, you know, we all have across the bear, aren't we?

1249
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,440
 All right, that's all the system.

1250
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:52,800
 Okay, that is it.

1251
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,080
 That is all of our facts.

1252
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,920
 Thank you so much for listening.

1253
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,520

 we can all be found on our various social media accounts.

 Oh, I'm also on Blue Sky.

1262

 Hey.

1263
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,200
 Um, but I had to be Harkin James,

1264
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
 because someone else already had James Harkin.

1265
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,600
 You're kidding.

1266
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,080
 That's me.

1267
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,720
 I've got yours.

1268
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,880
 But if you want to get to us as a group, Anna, where'd they go?

1269
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,720
 You can email podcast@qioi.com.

1270
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
 I don't have these trying to follow me on Blue Sky.

1271
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,920
 I have no followers.

1272
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,040
 I literally only went in

1273
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,720
 because I wanted to read someone's Blue Sky.

1274
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,320
 Wow, he doesn't even have a profile picture.

1275
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:30,960
 This is big.

1276
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,680
 I'm following.

1277
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,680
 Follow one follower.

1278
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,440
 Okay.

1279
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,480
 Everyone follow James,

1280
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,040
 and he'll feel sort of pressure to generate content.

1281
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,760
 What was I saying?

1282
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,080
 Oh, yeah.

1301
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,480
 in my case, and other things.

1307
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,920
 I think it's a rip-off.

1308
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,960
 Don't do it.

1309
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,040
 Get in quick, before we realise.
