00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 (mechanical beeping)

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,840
 (electronic music)

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,000
 Hi, Andy.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,840
 - Hello, Andy.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,920
 - Hey, guys.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,600
 Welcome to Drop us a Line.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,880
 Welcome to you at home.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
 Welcome to the viewers.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
 Welcome to the listeners.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,840
 Welcome to those who are experiencing this

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,640
 solely through touch or smell.

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,800
 The astral plane.

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,240
 Welcome to those shooting it from the astral plane.

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,400
 Yeah, right.

16
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,240
 Let's have some emails.

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,080
 We've had some great ones.

18
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,920
 Thank you for sending them in.

19
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,960
 Podcast at qi.com if you do want to send one in.

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,800
 Let's start off.

21
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,600
 Jonas Beederman from Basel, Switzerland.

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,440
 - Basel.

23
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 - Basel.

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,120
 Is it Basel?

25
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,600
 - Or Barl, if you from the French speaking part.

26
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,440
 - Sorry.

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,280
 - But yeah, not Basel.

28
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,280
 Which is how Americans pronounce Basel.

29
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,920
 - I'm absolutely gutted because I was really,

30
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,840
 I checked about Beederman and how you pronounce that.

31
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
 - And I tripped over.

32
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,200
 - I mean, I met people in Switzerland

33
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,560
 might ride to me, but I have been that.

34
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
 - Basel, yeah, yeah.

35
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
 - Basel.

36
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,760
 - There's a famous football team from there as well.

37
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,240
 - I stepped over the rake and then I tripped

38
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
 over the safety pin.

39
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
 They're so annoying.

40
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,800
 - Jonas, sorry Jonas.

41
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,640
 Right.

42
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
 I am a long time club fischer and fervent admirer

43
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,960
 of Andy's sections from the evergreens

44
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
 like spicy meat and thanks, but no thanks,

45
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
 to the more short-lived cult classics.

46
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,160
 (laughing)

47
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,880
 Like the sausage parlor, Russian droppers of line,

48
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
 and of course, the incest zone.

49
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
 (laughing)

50
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
 Which I think we have, we've done all of it.

51
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

52
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,600
 - Yes.

53
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,120
 A while back you mentioned getting stings slash jingles made

54
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,240
 for the various sections.

55
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,840
 I'm sure you have already been inundated

56
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,880
 with fan creations that you quite sensibly refuse

57
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,720
 to play on the show.

58
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,240
 We haven't really, Jonas.

59
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,800
 It was a call out.

60
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,960
 We got a couple of them.

61
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
 - I remember it.

62
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,640
 - Yeah.

63
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,720
 - But here is some more.

64
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,560
 - Great.

65
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,160
 - No AI was harmed in the making of these,

66
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 though I did use virtual sampler instruments

67
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
 for some of them.

68
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
 - That's allowed.

69
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
 - That's allowed.

70
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,160
 I'm proud to say that I was able to play

71
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,160
 the bassoon sections entirely without sheet music.

72
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,560
 (laughing)

73
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,080
 So I thought let's lead in.

74
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
 Let's have a cup.

75
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,560
 Let's sprinkle these through the show.

76
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
 - Okay.

77
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
 - Okay.

78
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,080
 - So can you guys earphone up?

79
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
 I've said them too on WhatsApp.

80
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
 You haven't heard them yet.

81
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,520
 So just have a little, set yourselves up now.

82
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,360
 Okay.

83
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,000
 I'd like you to play now the one that's labeled

84
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,640
 extreme fish.

85
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
 - Okay.

86
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
 - We'll play it at home.

87
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
 Okay.

88
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
 Ready?

89
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
 One, two, three.

90
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
 (upbeat music)

91
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
 - Time for minutes.

92
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's extremely fish.

93
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,480
 (laughing)

94
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,320
 - That's very good.

95
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
 - It's very good.

96
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
 - Isn't it?

97
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
 - Is that me doing the raw?

98
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
 - It is.

99
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
 - It sounds like me.

100
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
 - Yeah.

101
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,480
 So yeah, very metal.

102
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,320
 - Yeah.

103
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
 - And by leather sampling.

104
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
 - Yeah, really good.

105
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
 - Why have I not been sampled?

106
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
 Am I not metal enough?

107
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,960
 - You might come up in a...

108
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
 - Oh yeah.

109
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
 - It was soft fish or something.

110
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
 Stinky old fish.

111
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,640
 (laughing)

112
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
 'Cause I'm probably the one who's been

113
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,440
 to a Metal gig most recently out of the three of us.

114
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
 - What did you go for?

115
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,600
 - I went to watch ice-nine kills.

116
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,760
 - Oh.

117
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
 - Yeah.

118
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,680
 - So they're a metal band who they take horror films.

119
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
 - Yeah.

120
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
 - They're great songs based on the horror films.

121
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
 - They're very cool.

122
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
 - They're very cool.

123
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,760
 But way too loud and shouty for my ears.

124
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,160
 - Well, so anyway, thank you Janice.

125
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,760
 That was the, well, you're the metal aficionado.

126
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
 That's the...

127
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,280
 - Yeah, I thought it was as far as metal music goes.

128
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
 Nine out of tab.

129
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
 - Right.

130
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
 Well, Christie from the Gold Coast in Queensland

131
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,080
 has some extreme fish for us.

132
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
 - Okay.

133
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
 - Great.

134
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,640
 - So in Reason Drops of the Line,

135
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,480
 you heard from Caleb in Montana

136
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,240
 who plays fish out loud while hiking

137
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,320
 to scare away bears.

138
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,160
 - Yes.

139
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,000
 - You remember this.

140
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,960
 He also mentioned Bear Bells,

141
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
 which are these jangli little alarms.

142
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
 I don't think there's an actual cloche.

143
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,480
 The jangli little alarms,

144
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,120
 I guess you use to let bears know humans are nearby.

145
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,880
 So this just struck a chord with Christie

146
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,120
 because my partner and teenage kids

147
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
 recently went skiing in Japan.

148
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,600
 I suggested they invest in Bear Bells,

149
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
 but their Japanese friends confirmed bears

150
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
 have been a big problem this past year,

151
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
 especially in northern Japan.

152
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
 - Wow.

153
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
 - Kind of there's been a bad acorn harvest

154
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,600
 and they've been sort of looking in towns

155
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
 for food basically.

156
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,280
 - Right.

157
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,480
 - So it does in deaths, lots of injuries.

158
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
 - Oh dear.

159
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,720
 - On hearing my suggestion,

160
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,760
 their friends Mum put me in my place.

161
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,600
 She warned us that curious bears

162
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,240
 are now being attracted to Bear Bells.

163
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
 - Oh really?

164
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
 - Instead of human nearby,

165
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,680
 they now hear room service.

166
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,080
 So hikers are basically being told

167
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,720
 that to be loud and boisterous instead.

168
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,560
 - Yeah.

169
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,240
 But then eventually the bears will get used to that, right?

170
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,560
 Because presumably what happens is they hear the bell

171
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
 and then one bear goes up and finds,

172
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,440
 actually I got a kick-cat from that person.

173
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,280
 - Yes.

174
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,160
 - So then the future they go again,

175
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,600
 but then they change it to podcasts.

176
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
 But then eventually they'll start getting attracted

177
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,560
 to podcasts and they'll have to find something else.

178
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
 - Yeah, you're right.

179
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,240
 - Maybe that's a music.

180
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right.

181
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
 Well, Christy Finishes,

182
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,360
 the Japanese member of your team,

183
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,280
 hand-to-moo-ray,

184
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
 might be able to tell you more.

185
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,880
 (laughing)

186
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,120
 - We got it out.

187
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
 - Yeah, that's Christy.

188
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
 - It was wonderful.

189
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
 - Yeah, so Bear Acorns,

190
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
 that's the surprising bit of the diet

191
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,480
 for a bear that I didn't know about.

192
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
 - No.

193
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,800
 - Yeah, what did you think they at Picnic baskets?

194
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
 (laughing)

195
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,240
 - I'd like jars of honey

196
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
 that they can have. - Chas of honey?

197
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
 - Chas of honey?

198
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,440
 - Have they been lying to us in these great cartoons?

199
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
 - No, that's very cool,

200
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
 'cause you would think you would solve that immediately

201
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
 by importing a bunch of acorns

202
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,480
 and helicopter-dropping them over the areas

203
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
 that Bear has live in.

204
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
 - I guess so, I guess, for whatever reason,

205
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
 that's been rejected as an idea.

206
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
 - Oh, no one's thought of it yet.

207
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
 - 'Cause there's been a bad acorn harvest.

208
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,880
 Where are you getting these acorns from?

209
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
 - The countries.

210
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,920
 - Bring 'em in. - Bring 'em in.

211
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
 - Bring 'em in.

212
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
 - We have them coming out of our ears

213
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,080
 in London, the acorns.

214
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
 - Who's the leading Avelace about trees?

215
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,240
 - There we go.

216
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,520
 - So what we need to do is helicopter some,

217
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,840
 I guess you'd use long distance,

218
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,080
 you'd use a plane for the first leg

219
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,800
 of the journey, wouldn't you, from bringing to Japan?

220
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,720
 - Yeah, I don't think I'm saying it just to get anything wild.

221
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
 - No.

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,840
 This was about a month you biting you in the brain.

228
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,160
 - Absolutely.

229
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,080
 - And so my understanding is that

230
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,680
 if someone touches your brain, you can't feel it.

231
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
 Now, I was going off memories, so maybe I'm wrong.

232
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,160
 - Well, I think there's a middle path here.

240

 - It's a technicality.

241
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,320
 (laughing)

242
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,640
 You see, I don't want to be the person on this show

243
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,720
 that just fights back against the audience

244
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,920
 to see what a bullshit email too often.

245
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
 - No.

246
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,880
 - And so when I occasionally think that in my head,

247
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,800
 I kind of hold it back, but actually in this case,

248
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
 I didn't, did I?

249
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,080
 - No, but it's nice that you occasionally,

250
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,440
 I think you can't just be, you can't just roll over every time.

251
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
 - No.

252
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,800
 - You've got a reputation to maintain.

253
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
 So I think it's fine.

254
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,280
 I think it's fine for you to do that.

255
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,720
 - Okay, now fair enough.

256
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
 I guess.

257
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
 - Yeah.

258
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,240
 - Don't fight.

259
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,400
 - Really good fight.

260
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,640
 - I think it is pretty amazing that a monkey could

261
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
 bite your brain and you wouldn't feel that.

262
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,360
 - That is pretty astonishing.

263
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
 - You know, it was happening.

264
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,520
 - You'd probably, there would be other signs.

265
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
 - It's very rare that a monkey bites someone's brain

266
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
 in a controlled environment where they're screened

267
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,360
 from the monkey and the top of their skull's been taken off

268
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
 by a surgical tube and then a monkey's got into the brain.

269
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,360
 - Somehow made it into the ring.

270
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,120
 - So I was, where was this in the pole

271
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,200
 and I was sat by some river and I'm just sort of sitting there

272
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,800
 with my bag by my side and reading my book

273
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,080
 and the monkey's kind of got really close

274
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
 and tried to get into my bag

275
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,640
 without me even noticing they were there.

276
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,480
 - That's pretty good.

277
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,960
 - So if the back of my skull was open

278
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,720
 and there was something, you know, they were hungry for brain,

279
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,320
 then I can actually imagine them getting relatively close

280
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 without me noticing.

281
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,160
 - Wow.

282
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
 - There you go.

283
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,760
 - It's a good point.

284
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,720
 - It's an if, if the back of your brain was open

285
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,640
 but you've been allowed to go on holiday.

286
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,840
 Anyway, yeah, we'll finish the operation

287
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,000
 and the bet is to harking but it's five o'clock.

288
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,920
 So it flights to Kathmandu leaves.

289
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,720
 It's just half an hour, you better get out there.

290
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
 - It was it was irresponsible of you

291
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,160
 to book the holidays so close to your major brain surgery.

292
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
 - It's actually good to air it out

293
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,640
 before we close it up.

294
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
 - Don't pick it.

295
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,960
 All right, just let it get a nice air ring.

296
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
 - Yeah.

297
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
 Are you going to any monkey infested areas

298
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
 just to carry us any?

299
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,080
 - Right, I've had one.

300
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
 You've had one.

301
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,360
 Rachel Bobo writes in for Dan.

302
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,840
 - How do you spell Bobo?

303
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
 - As it sounds.

304
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,520
 - B-O-B-O, great.

305
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
 - Wow.

306
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,200
 - Of clown fame.

307
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,040
 - Yeah.

308
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,440
 (laughing)

309
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,520
 - It just makes so much sense

310
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,480
 that my one's from someone called Bobo.

311
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
 (laughing)

312
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,440
 - She writes, sniff my flower.

313
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
 - She doesn't.

314
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,400
 - I imagine you've already received quite a few emails.

315
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,960
 Hopefully not rodeo clown numbers

316
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,120
 about Elvis Presley's birthplace.

317
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,840
 As my cat phrase on this show, Rachel,

318
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,880
 I'm afraid not you are the first.

319
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,640
 But as a local, I felt my duty to correct Dan.

320
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,240
 Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi,

321
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,520
 not Memphis, Tennessee.

322
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,200
 Not sure about Alan Titchmars, though.

323
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 - I don't recall this.

324
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,640
 - I'm afraid I don't remember saying that at all.

325
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,720
 I must have, obviously.

326
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 - I know.

327
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
 - Yeah, apologies.

328
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
 But there you go.

329
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,400
 He moved to Memphis to pursue music

330
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,040
 when he was in his late teens.

331
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
 - Interesting.

332
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,040
 It must have been in the Tom Allen show.

333
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
 - Yeah.

334
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,440
 - Because that's when we met mention that.

335
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
 - Yes.

336
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,360
 - And we were talking about, yeah, the dancing.

337
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,880
 - Oh, I see.

338
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,200
 That was what happened.

339
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,640
 I said he had something in common with Alan Titchmars.

340
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,960
 And Dan, I think, said,

341
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,240
 "Oh, they were both in prison or something."

342
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,400
 Or maybe you also said they were both born in Memphis.

343
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,240
 - Yeah, maybe.

344
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
 - Yeah.

345
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
 - So it was a joke.

346
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,640
 - Sounds like it.

347
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,960
 - It doesn't, I mean, it doesn't sound like it, but yeah.

348
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,120
 (laughing)

349
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,200
 - Sounds like a really good one.

350
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,760
 (laughing)

351
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,600
 - That's fair enough.

352
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 Right, we've all three had one.

353
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,040
 - But there's a bonus hook.

354
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
 - Oh, it's a whole hook lurking in the water.

355
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,880
 Dan Latham writes, "Long time listener, first time nitpicker.

356
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
 "I was listening to no such thing as an Eton Oyster."

357
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,840
 Oh, the release at the end of December.

358
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,720
 And in it, I believe it was Andy who said

359
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,600
 that the Chartres recipe is known by only two monks.

360
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
 - Oh, yeah.

361
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,680
 - I felt it was my duty to correct you,

362
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,360
 especially as I've now been living in this part of France

363
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,640
 for five years, and I've been on the tour

364
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,520
 of the Cav de la Chartres twice,

365
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,040
 which are the not caves in the English,

366
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,400
 they're sort of sellers for making it

367
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
 where they aged the alcohol.

368
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
 My correction is there are in fact three monks

369
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,760
 who know the recipe.

370
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,320
 (laughing)

371
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,080
 - And what's happened is the third monk come in

372
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,400
 and...

373
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
 - He's walked it out.

374
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,840
 - He's walked it, he's burst in

375
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,480
 while they're having their secret weekly meeting

376
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,400
 where they go over the ingredients.

377
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,480
 (laughing)

378
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,960
 - He says to avoid stalemates in arguments.

379
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
 - Oh, yeah.

380
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,640
 - Oh, maybe.

381
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,480
 - They just need a third.

382
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
 - I don't think they're allowed to change the recipe.

383
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,320
 I don't think if you know the secret recipe,

384
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,480
 you could just put any old shed in it, no.

385
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
 But apparently on the tour,

386
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,480
 a downland that in order to protect the recipe, what?

387
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
 - They can't fly on the same flight together.

388
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
 - They're not allowed to travel together.

389
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,480
 - Is it?

390
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,320
 - Yeah.

391
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,280
 - But now when there's three of them,

392
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,400
 presumably two of them can go on a nice

393
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
 caravan holiday or something like that

394
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,440
 because the third one's still there.

395
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
 - Yeah, absolutely.

396
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,400
 - So that's maybe the reason why they got a third person.

397
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
 - They can go monkey spotting in the pool.

398
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,160
 (laughing)

399
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,880
 - Yeah, so thank you, Dan.

400
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 - Can I do a thing where it was an error that I said,

401
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,480
 and I want to send you a WhatsApp?

402
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,640
 - Oh, great.

403
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,520
 - So this is Dan mentioned on the podcast.

404
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,600
 Why has a football team never had a sponsor

405
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,360
 on the inside of the kit?

406
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,680
 So that when you score and you put your share over your head,

407
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,960
 you can see the advert.

408
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,800
 - Yeah.

409
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,640
 - It's really good.

410
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
 (laughing)

411
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,520
 - And the person called Andrew Vazano

412
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,760
 wrote to us with this catafi kit.

413
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,600
 - Incredible.

414
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
 - Where they're sponsored by Burger King.

415
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,440
 And when you pull the shirt over your head,

416
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,760
 you can see the Burger King face

417
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,440
 where your face would normally be.

418
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
 - So good.

419
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,200
 - I wasn't aware there was a Burger King face.

420
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
 - Well, you know.

421
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
 - No, I didn't know that that was one part of the.

422
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,160
 - I didn't know that was the King.

423
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
 - Yeah.

424
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
 - So it's the actual Burger King.

425
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,240
 So Macdonald has Ronald Macdonald.

426
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,720
 This is the King of the Vegas.

427
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
 - Wow.

428
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,400
 - Well, yeah.

429
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,240
 - Brilliant.

430
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
 - Brilliant.

431
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
 - I think it was from the '90s.

432
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
 - Wow.

433
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,760
 - Bring it back.

434
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
 - Oh, cool.

435
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
 - Bring it back.

436
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,280
 - Brilliant.

437
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
 We now come to our regular section.

438
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,880
 Apologies to the armed forces.

439
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,240
 (laughing)

440
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,320
 Merlin Lewis.

441
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,720
 Merlin Lewis.

442
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,280
 - We've had another Merlin race name.

443
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
 Maybe it was the same one.

444
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
 - Yeah.

445
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
 Merlin's coming back as a name.

446
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,600
 - Or it did 30 or 40 years ago.

447
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,960
 However, this Merlin shell Drake

448
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
 is a big selling answer at the moment.

449
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,720
 - Yeah.

450
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
 - Yeah.

451
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,400
 - No, it's huge.

452
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,240
 - Yeah.

453
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,680
 - You shout Merlin on in any crowded night club.

454
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
 And it's a nightmare.

455
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 - You go to the one's I go to.

456
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,840
 - Yeah.

457
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,720
 - The Druid Society in Morgan.

458
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,720
 - Merlin writes, "I'm listening to you talk with Tom Allen

459
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,080
 "and would urge you to reconsider your position

460
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,280
 "on the artist's rifles."

461
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,120
 - Do you remember this?

462
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
 - Oh, yeah.

463
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
 - Okay.

464
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,640
 - So Noel Coward.

465
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
 Noel Coward briefly served in this regiment

466
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
 in the First World War.

467
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
 And then he quickly sort of got a bit ill.

468
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,840
 - And Tom said that actually it was a place

469
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,240
 where you put the less useful people

470
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
 because they were in the arts and they went straight in there.

471
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,520
 And actually I'd read that as well.

472
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,680
 And I thought it was true.

473
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,320
 - Quite the reverse it turns out.

474
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,000
 'Cause they're better known these days as 21 SAS.

475
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,760
 - Okay.

476
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,080
 - The artist's rifles was Merlin writes

477
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
 an extraordinary regiment in which imaginative

478
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,480
 outside the box and sometimes flamboyant individuals

479
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 were embraced by the army to allow genuine innovation.

480
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,560
 And it started in 1860 and all sorts of people.

481
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,160
 Ed Woodburn Jones, William Morris, Frederick Layton,

482
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,200
 Holman Hunt, all sorts of really famous artists were in there.

483
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,560
 And then they were sort of disbanded

484
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,880
 and then became the SAS in one of those weird ways

485
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,640
 that regiments kept us banded and then reformed

486
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
 and murdered all that.

487
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,080
 But basically the artist's rifles

488
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,400
 is now a historical way of referring to the SAS.

489
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,760
 So they're quite tough.

490
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 - Okay, well, come at us.

491
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,480
 - Merlin or the SAS?

492
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,880
 (laughing)

493
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
 - Yeah, but anyway, so they sound very cool.

494
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,800
 I'm gonna read up more about that.

495
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,640
 - Yeah, really good.

496
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,280
 I hadn't heard that.

497
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,440
 - Time for some real life.

498
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
 - Really?

499
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,200
 - Real life.

500
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,720
 Matthew Price writes a quick clarification

501
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,240
 inspired by James Harkin, not a telling off.

502
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,920
 In episode 577, he joked about the idea of getting a barge

503
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
 with his wife in Venice.

504
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,760
 Do you remember that?

505
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,600
 It was very funny.

506
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,640
 - Yeah, we were talking about getting a gondola

507
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,600
 and he was like, oh, we got a barge, you know.

508
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,440
 It was funny.

509
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,600
 It was really good.

510
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
 - I'm a funny guy.

511
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
 - Yeah.

512
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,960
 - Sounds like a joke.

513
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,760
 - It was a good joke.

514
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
 (laughing)

515
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,680
 - We were talking about barges

516
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,320
 and then James joked about getting a barge.

517
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,560
 It was great.

518
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,400
 - Yeah, to be there.

519
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
 - I can't believe you guys have forgotten that.

520
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,240
 It was so good.

521
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
 I'm delighted to report, writes Matthew,

522
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
 that a hotel barge does operate in Venice.

523
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
 - Is that so?

524
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 - So he never say never.

525
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
 - It's fully licensed.

526
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,280
 And Matthew is a certified deckhand.

527
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,200
 And you wondered, I think,

528
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,120
 a hundred episodes before that James,

529
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,480
 whether it was a good thing

530
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,440
 that people had stopped learning how to barge.

531
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
 And Matthew says, I feel duty-bound report.

532
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,800
 The barging is still very much taught across Europe.

533
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,640
 - Is that true?

534
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,680
 - Yeah, complete with exams, salty instructors

535
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,960
 and the traditional shouting at lock gates.

536
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
 (laughing)

537
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
 - So good.

538
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
 And he works as a tour guide in France

539
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,720
 on a British First World War munitions carrier

540
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,520
 that has been converted into a floating hotel.

541
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,360
 - Wow.

542
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,760
 - Yeah, I love barges, really.

543
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,840
 I don't know why I've been so down on them over the years.

544
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
 - Apparently you have.

545
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,680
 - Yeah.

546
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
 - And Matthew's kept the receipts.

547
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
 (laughing)

548
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,080
 - And he invited us to do an episode of float on this barge.

549
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
 - Where is it again?

550
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,800
 - France.

551
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,640
 - Sounds good.

552
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,480
 - It does sound good, doesn't it?

553
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,280
 - What about the one in Venice?

554
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,560
 - He doesn't work on that one,

555
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
 but it does also sound good, doesn't it?

556
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,560
 - Yeah.

557
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,520
 - We could just do a barge tour.

558
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
 - That'd be great.

559
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,200
 - Oh my god.

560
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,040
 - How many people do you think you can feel on a barge?

561
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,880
 How many?

562
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,680
 - I think I looked at the one,

563
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,560
 and it's about 20 people on the one that we've been saying.

564
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,120
 - Okay, well, to be honest, when we played Paris,

565
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
 it wasn't that many more than that.

566
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
 (laughing)

567
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,120
 - They won't be swarming the gangplanks trying to get on board.

568
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,960
 (laughing)

569
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,280
 We might hit 15 to 20 tops.

570
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,800
 - Oh, that was because in our European tour,

571
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,000
 we had a tour booking company who booked it all,

572
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,720
 and we know we're all of our listeners up.

573
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
 We know where you are.

574
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
 - We know.

575
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
 - Because we can see our stats, right?

576
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
 - Yeah.

577
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,360
 - And they said we don't have many listeners in Paris,

578
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,200
 and we were like, oh, we really want to go to Paris.

579
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,400
 There's a great expat community there,

580
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,200
 and it turned out they were absolutely right.

581
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,040
 - Yeah.

582
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,600
 - Paris and Berlin, and we were like,

583
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,640
 how is that even possible?

584
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,640
 - There are two flamboyant cathedrals, you know.

585
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,480
 - Yeah.

586
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
 - Well, there's hands out.

587
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 People don't have better things to do.

588
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,160
 - Yeah.

589
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,480
 - Kevin Edge writes,

590
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,600
 (laughing)

591
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,280
 - I've been in YouTube for many years,

592
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,240
 and no one has ever asked my first name.

593
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,480
 (laughing)

594
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,120
 - Me either, it says Darrell Bono.

595
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,400
 (laughing)

596
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,800
 - On your latest podcast,

597
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,520
 you seemed to know whether spoons quite well.

598
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,400
 Good and bad, I think this is pointing at you mostly, Dan.

599
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
 Did you know there is a whether spoons top trumps?

600
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,040
 They were on sale before Christmas at my local

601
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,360
 Colwyn Bay picture house spoons.

602
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,760
 The sort of properties of the things include

603
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,520
 year-opened pub size, and of course,

604
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,360
 number of steps to the toilet.

605
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,760
 (laughing)

606
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,560
 - It's famous whether spoons for,

607
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,160
 usually the toilets are an absolute trek away

608
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,000
 from the bar.

609
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,840
 - Oh, really?

610
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
 - Yeah, and lots of them.

611
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,680
 - I've not heard that.

612
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,520
 - I don't know that.

613
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,360
 - I don't know that.

614
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
 - Maybe it's ones in a North that are like that.

615
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,200
 - No, no, no.

616
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,680
 It is, think about it now.

617
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,520
 - Yeah.

618
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
 - But, I mean, surely number of steps to the toilet

619
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,600
 is a movable property.

620
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,440
 - Yes.

621
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,200
 - If you get there nice and early,

622
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
 you can get the table right back right by the toilet.

623
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
 - There are no toilets by the,

624
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,320
 there are no tables by the toilets, right?

625
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,640
 You can get a table by the bottom of the stairs,

626
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,560
 but they have to walk all the way up the stairs

627
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,360
 through a load of corridors to find the toilet.

628
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,280
 - Oh, just a pristine table for Valentine's Day love.

629
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,120
 (laughing)

630
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,280
 - That sounds great.

631
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,120
 So it's for two, yes.

632
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,480
 Do you have anything a bit closer to the toilets?

633
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,560
 (laughing)

634
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,840
 - I'd be willing to make it worth your while.

635
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 We're gonna be drinking a lot of ruddles.

636
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,640
 (laughing)

637
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,040
 - And yeah, okay, so thank you Kevin.

638
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,080
 - Well, I don't know if weather spoons

639
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,560
 are a friend of the podcast or an enemy

640
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,880
 of the podcast on this show.

641
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,720
 - Yes.

642
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
 - I think we've got no official position on weather spoons.

643
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,920
 - Well, I think Dan has a very positive position.

644
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

645
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,120
 - And the absolute sanders and other members of the team

646
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,480
 have a more negative position.

647
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,680
 - I feel I have a position on the owner,

648
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,200
 who I'm not a fan of.

649
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,800
 Anytime I go into one, everyone's very nice in there.

650
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,240
 So I feel rude saying anything against them.

651
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,760
 And Ramsgate happens to have an extraordinary one

652
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,720
 on the beach, and so it's worth it for the location.

653
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

654
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,000
 We have talked about it a lot over the years, haven't we?

655
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
 The carpets, remember, they've all got

656
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,680
 at the spot of the interesting carp design.

657
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
 Is that on the top trump card?

658
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,520
 - It must be.

659
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,680
 - Yeah.

660
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
 - Maybe it would be on the back of the card.

661
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
 Oh, that's nice.

662
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 - 'Cause then everyone would know what cards you had.

663
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,760
 - Doesn't matter in top jumps.

664
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,400
 - Does it matter if everyone knows what you've got?

665
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,240
 - Oh, yeah.

666
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
 - The only thing is that you keep on winning

667
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,320
 and getting more, yeah.

668
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
 Anyway, thank you, Kevin.

669
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,360
 - Much like capitalism in that way.

670
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,560
 And so probably why the guy who wants weather spoons

671
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,840
 likes it so much.

672
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,040
 - Come at us Tim Martin.

673
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,480
 Michaela Comperi writes,

674
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,560
 you mentioned recently in the last drop of the line

675
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,520
 that Tim Hortons doesn't have an apostrophe.

676
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,680
 - Yes.

677
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,800
 - 'Cause of Quebec language laws.

678
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,640
 - That's right.

679
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,120
 It might have been in little fish actually.

680
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,560
 - Oh, you might be right.

681
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,120
 And it reminded me of my favorite

682
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,160
 French language law story.

683
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,480
 A comedian took out billboards in Quebec

684
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
 that said, quotes,

685
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,800
 "For Christmas, I'd like a complaint

686
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,840
 "from the office de la langue from says

687
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,000
 "within 48 hours he received the complaint

688
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,040
 "and had to change the science

689
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
 "because you're not allowed to put up big signs

690
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,680
 "in English, I suppose."

691
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
 - Oh, okay.

692
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,160
 - "I had to change the signs to Pornowel,

693
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,000
 "get a complaint de la langue from says."

694
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,800
 - Do we know who the comic was?

695
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,120
 - No.

696
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,800
 - Michaela Michela has sent a link, which I haven't followed.

697
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,520
 - And is that to get publicity

698
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
 basically for the show in the long run?

699
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,960
 - I guess so.

700
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,800
 - Yeah, I guess so.

701
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
 - Is that what I've been in the newspapers?

702
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 - It's an interesting practice.

703
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,720
 I used to work somewhere and I won't say where,

704
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,800
 but they tried to constantly get MPs

705
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,280
 to sort of ask for the banning of a specific comedy thing

706
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,560
 in the House of Lords so that it would make the papers.

707
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,720
 They would actively pursue them to talk them into doing it.

708
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,040
 - Oh, we think, James.

709
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 Truth or lie?

710
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,680
 - How interesting.

711
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
 I'm just trying to think of all the people

712
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,840
 I know where you've worked over the years.

713
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,920
 - I know, I can't.

714
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,760
 - I can't.

715
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
 - Yeah.

716
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,440
 - It's been two places, QI in here.

717
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
 - Yeah.

718
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,840
 - Right.

719
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,680
 But basically, and Evan from Vancouver,

720
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,880
 we've had a lot of correspondence from Canada

721
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,720
 about the Quebec language police,

722
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,880
 the Okwuf, office quibikwa, Dilla Longfran says,

723
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,360
 'cause they've done a lot of stuff over the years

724
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,000
 that's been a bit too outsiders, bananas.

725
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,840
 - Bananas.

726
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,680
 - Bananas.

727
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,760
 - Very good, great point.

728
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,480
 They find a restaurant called the pub Burgundy Lion

729
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,680
 because it was not French enough,

730
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,560
 despite pub Burgundy and Lion all being French words.

731
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,160
 They told an Italian restaurant they needed

732
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,240
 to translate pasta into French.

733
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,440
 - I know a French people call like a bar la pub.

734
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
 I've seen that in places,

735
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,320
 but I would still say that was an English word, really.

736
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,160
 - I think so.

737
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,120
 I think you can't have the word part of France.

738
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,160
 But basically, one last anecdote that comes from a friend

739
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,280
 of mine is wife used to earn a shop in Montreal

740
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,800
 and she does not speak French.

741
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,480
 She received a violation notice from the Okwuf.

742
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
 However, she did not know what she violated

743
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,960
 since they will not correspond in English.

744
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,960
 (all laughing)

745
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,920
 - It sounds very entertaining.

746
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

747
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,120
 So thank you, thank you everyone who wrote in about that.

748
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,760
 That sounds great. - Very good, very good.

749
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,640
 - We've got, we've got ham fish now.

750
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
 New section.

751
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
 - Ham fish. - Oh, new section, okay.

752
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,640
 - Ham fish did.

753
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
 - Oh. - Like as in,

754
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,320
 you do something that's really good.

755
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,160
 - Is that what it's about?

756
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,480
 - Is this in relation to McKellen

757
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,600
 or the oldest ham?

758
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,960
 - It's in relation to the oldest ham.

759
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
 - Oh, I see.

760
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,920
 - So we mentioned the oldest ham.

761
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,360
 Charlie Tuff has updated us on the oldest ham in Oxford

762
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,080
 that we talked about, which is not the other oldest ham

763
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,920
 we talked about, but we did talk about the one

764
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
 in the covered market in Oxford.

765
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,640
 - And we were wondering whether it was still there.

766
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,480
 - Yeah.

767
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,960
 - Well, the butchers who displayed it,

768
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,520
 emfeller and daughter,

769
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,560
 closed their shop in the covered market back in early 2023.

770
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,080
 I can't find any online presence for the butchers after that.

771
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,240
 The fate of the ham is currently unknown.

772
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,600
 - Wow.

773
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,640
 - So let's start a ham hunt.

774
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,480
 - Yeah.

775
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 - Yeah.

776
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,360
 If you know where that ham might be, drop us a line.

777
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,200
 - Yeah.

778
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
 - Yeah.

779
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,320
 - 'Cause we need to get us out some press, guys,

780
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,040
 and I'm thinking if we find the oldest ham,

781
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,440
 surely that's good for something.

782
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 - I think we put it up in Quebec

783
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,760
 with a sign saying oldest ham in English.

784
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,440
 (laughing)

785
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,720
 - And get down to mention campaign against it

786
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 in the House of Lords.

787
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,560
 - Yeah.

788
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,400
 Interesting.

789
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,240
 Yeah.

790
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,080
 - Yeah.

791
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,920
 - I imagine they just threw it out.

792
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,760
 - Do you?

793
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,600
 - I do.

794
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 - I don't know.

795
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,440
 - No.

796
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
 - You're crazy.

797
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,000
 It's not gonna be an historical ham.

798
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,680
 Submitted to a museum, surely.

799
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,000
 - Oh, damn.

800
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,320
 I can't believe you've not been in the inbox, still.

801
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,160
 - What?

802
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,000
 - No.

803
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
 - Okay, 'cause this is so exciting.

804
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
 And in fact, this is the big Marmalade dropper

805
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,240
 of this show, I would say.

806
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
 - Okay.

807
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,920
 - Ben Murray.

808
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
 - What is that?

809
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,600
 - Marmalade dropper.

810
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,440
 - Yeah.

811
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,680
 - Is it like an exciting news story?

812
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,520
 Have you not heard of that?

813
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,360
 - No.

814
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,080
 - 'Cause you're eating your breakfast and you've got what?

815
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,920
 - Yeah.

816
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,640
 - It's a newspaper term for a great story.

817
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,480
 - That's great.

818
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,840
 - You would probably call it a cocoa pop splasher.

819
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,680
 (laughing)

820
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,520
 - Yeah.

821
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,040
 (laughing)

822
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,880
 - Whoa!

823
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,320
 (laughing)

824
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,800
 - Well, Ben Murray writes, long time listen

825
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,000
 at first time emailer, I've just heard today's episode

826
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
 of Little Fish and was extremely surprised to hear the fact

827
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,320
 about the world's oldest ham only being dated 1902.

828
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,160
 - Oh yeah.

829
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,800
 - This is because I look after museum collections

830
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 in Hampshire, Hampshire, and have both seen and smelt

831
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,880
 what I believe is a much older ham currently sat

832
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,280
 in one of our stores.

833
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,120
 - Wow.

834
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,280
 - Please see the picture attached.

835
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,360
 Our record for this ham states that it was one

836
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,440
 of a pair of ham's cured in 1875,

837
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,880
 one of which got eaten to celebrate Queen Victoria's

838
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,520
 golden Jubilee in 1877.

839
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
 - Yeah.

840
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,520
 - No, 1830 golden Jubilee, 1887 would have been, yeah.

841
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,200
 The other made its way to the Hampshire museum service

842
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,640
 in 1971, and here it is.

843
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,440
 - I mean, it's a very old ham.

844
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,840
 - That's an old ham.

845
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,760
 - Ben writes, I thought it was worth correcting this fact

846
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,880
 from years ago because I believe the world deserves to know

847
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,280
 about factually correct old ham's.

848
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,760
 - I think you should go there and do a video

849
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,160
 like an Instagram video.

850
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
 - I'd love to.

851
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
 I'd really love to.

852
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,920
 I hope it, I hope it's still there, of course it's still there.

853
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,560
 (laughing)

854
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,280
 - I'm so sorry, we just, we just had it.

855
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,640
 (laughing)

856
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
 - Honestly, it was a bit stale.

857
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,560
 - Glad to be with Broken D.

858
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,800
 (laughing)

859
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,960
 - Who ate the oldest ham?

860
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,080
 (laughing)

861
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,920
 - Oh dear, anyway, thank you very much, lovely.

862
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,680
 So that's the ham fist section.

863
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,480
 Right, now, get those headphones back in.

864
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,240
 We're going back to Jonas.

865
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,320
 Who has produced a rodeo clown jingle.

866
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,480
 One, two, three, go.

867
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,320
 - Okay.

868
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,640
 - It's rodeo clown time.

869
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,220
 (upbeat music)

870
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,800
 - Right, it's good, we're rodeo clown.

871
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,200
 rodeo clown of the week.

872
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,520
 - Yeah, I mean.

873
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,560
 - No, no. - No, it's Yihar.

874
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
 - Is that me?

875
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,240
 - I think it's you.

876
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,800
 - Am I just making sounds?

877
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,640
 - All the way through.

878
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,960
 - All the way through, I podcast, I'm not aware of it.

879
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,800
 - I mean, James does the edit.

880
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,480
 I'll defer to him on this.

881
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,240
 - Again, interesting that I'm not at all.

882
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,200
 (laughing)

883
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,160
 I do want the Yoda Siff.

884
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,480
 You've had some forgotten about a member of the team.

885
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,840
 A crucial member of the team.

886
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,440
 (laughing)

887
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,280
 - That's true.

888
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,680
 (laughing)

889
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,240
 - He doesn't say in his email.

890
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,920
 I've tried to cover everybody.

891
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,960
 (laughing)

892
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,360
 - I don't think you not being in it

893
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,480
 is worse than me being the guy who just goes,

894
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 "Are you hot?"

895
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
 (laughing)

896
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
 (screaming)

897
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,600
 - Showing our episodes.

898
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,160
 (laughing)

899
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,360
 - You've got to give Yoda something to work with, James.

900
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,600
 You need to make some silly noises.

901
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
 'Cause it's easy for me,

902
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,160
 'cause I'm the guy who says rodeo clown.

903
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,440
 So he's got a sample me.

904
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
 - Yeah.

905
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,120
 - Okay.

906
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,960
 - Ham.

907
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
 That's for a future one.

908
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,800
 - Right.

909
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,720
 - He's really good.

910
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,880
 (laughing)

911
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,120
 I'll be honest, guys.

912
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,400
 I'm not sure how frequently Ham fished it.

913
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,160
 It's going to be part of the regular lineup.

914
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,240
 I think it's going to be more like the incessant zone,

915
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
 which is an occasional friend.

916
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,800
 Does anyone in your family listen to this show?

917
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,720
 - They do, and it's why I've stopped telling those stories.

918
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,240
 (laughing)

919
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,960
 - I mean, they're not stories, sorry.

920
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,880
 (laughing)

921
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,760
 It's why I stopped making up fake.

922
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
 (laughing)

923
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,880
 I think that's going on further with this.

924
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,080
 - It is, in fact, yet again, true.

925
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,600
 (laughing)

926
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,360
 - Right.

927
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,840
 The rodeo clown of the week is about

928
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,120
 something we said in the Newdy Code, was he called?

929
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,280
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

930
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,080
 So again, this was the Tom Allen episode.

931
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,480
 And Newdy is the guy who made suits.

932
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,320
 - Yeah.

933
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,040
 - Rhyne stones, he put rhyne stones on clothes.

934
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,520
 - Rhyme, also.

935
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,360
 - The song Rhyne Stone Cowboy is off the back.

936
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,120
 It's a tribute to Newdy Cohen and the clothes he designed.

937
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,360
 - Can you guys remember what he said?

938
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,520
 He started his career doing.

939
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
 - Lost right?

940
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,880
 - Oh, I know what it is.

941
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,160
 I said, because I'm from the north, that he made pasties.

942
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,520
 - Selling pasties to strippers?

943
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,360
 - Yeah.

944
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,960
 - Well, Mabel Syrup writes.

945
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,200
 - Maybe not a real name, I guess.

946
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,720
 - Thrilled to hear you talk a bit about rhyne stones

947
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,440
 and pasties, both topics close to my heart,

948
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,360
 but I need to clarify, is definitely pronounced pasties

949
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,440
 when you're referring to the nipple covering.

950
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,880
 Although you wouldn't be the first to notice

951
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,080
 the glorious possibilities of pasty themed pasties.

952
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,000
 - Micredentials, seven years of wearing pasties

953
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,120
 as a burlesque performer.

954
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,440
 Do let me know if you'd like some fish-themed ones.

955
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,280
 - Yes, please.

956
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
 - Obviously.

957
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,960
 - Or any tips on twirling.

958
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,200
 I'm sure I could make that happen.

959
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,880
 - I think we could get a lot more people to our French shows

960
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,520
 if we all came up wearing burlesque.

961
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,360
 - Yes.

962
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,200
 - Absolutely.

963
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,800
 - Yeah, my friend Chris Buddle, he wrote to me saying,

964
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,480
 he'd made a lot of pasties in his time

965
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,560
 and that we pronounced that wrong, yeah.

966
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,080
 Well anyway, this has been the Radio Canal of the Week.

967
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,960
 Thanks also to Indiana Split, another burlesque artist

968
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,320
 who said it is pronounced pasties

969
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,800
 and is a big faux pas among the burlesque community

970
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 to mispronounce it.

971
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,640
 - Oh really?

972
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
 - Fair enough.

973
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,080
 Big shimmies, Indiana Split.

974
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,480
 So thanks to Lizzie B. Elaine, Mary, and Colorado

975
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
 and John Petra, who have all had the moment in the inbox.

976
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,840
 - I do like, we get to discover

977
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,440
 not only you love locations of people.

978
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,280
 - I love locations.

979
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
 - I love a location.

980
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,080
 I love a territory of work that we suddenly have

981
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,920
 a huge fan base in that we might not know about.

982
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,600
 So burlesque dancers as a merge now is,

983
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,440
 that's really cool.

984
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,160
 We should say more wrong things about people's industries,

985
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,440
 just so we can discover who's listening

986
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,480
 to us through the complaints.

987
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,320
 - Good to hear that.

988
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,160
 - Great idea.

989
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,680
 - If you are from an industry that we mentioned,

990
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,640
 but you just want to write in and say,

991
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,160
 we got everything right,

992
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,640
 then that will be equally fine.

993
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,400
 - That happens, but it's more rare

994
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,680
 than people writing in saying,

995
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,040
 I'm a sailfish farmer and you said it all wrong.

996
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,280
 Yeah.

997
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
 Right, I'm gonna ask you one last time to put your,

998
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,480
 put your cans on because we've got another section coming up.

999
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,360
 And I'm excited for you guys to hear this one.

1000
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,760
 Okay, I'll count you in.

1001
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,840
 Ready?

1002
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,760
 Three, two, one.

1003
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,720
 - Spicy.

1004
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
 - Spicy.

1005
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,760
 - Here's how we get to the spicy meat.

1006
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,280
 - That's just meat.

1007
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,640
 - This is spicy, spicy meat.

1008
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,480
 - Yeah.

1009
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
 - If you're spicy meat, Ali.

1010
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,080
 - All right.

1011
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

1012
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,280
 - This is a spicy one, spicy meat.

1013
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 (laughs)

1014
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,440
 - Spicy meat.

1015
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,040
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

1016
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,480
 - I'm still not sure what spicy meat is.

1017
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,360
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

1018
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,040
 - It's like, I don't need to explain this.

1019
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,360
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

1020
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
 - Maybe there's some spicy meat.

1021
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,320
 - Looking at it.

1022
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,520
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

1023
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,720
 - I mean, see how spicy you think there's meat is.

1024
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,960
 - So someone that's using that to their sex sound track.

1025
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,040
 - That's quite spicy.

1026
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,440
 - Oh, that's all we've got time for on today's job.

1027
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,280
 - Brilliant.

1028
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,120
 - It's great.

1029
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,040
 Works for incess corner as well if we need it to.

1030
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,360
 (laughs)

1031
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,160
 - That's the only one I'm not on board with, I'm sorry.

1032
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,440
 - But you're in it.

1033
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
 (laughs)

1034
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
 - If you want to buy it, you can't be pleased.

1035
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,040
 (laughs)

1036
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,240
 - I love it, didn't you hear that the sizzling bacon?

1037
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,520
 - Yeah, no, I didn't like that.

1038
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,720
 (laughs)

1039
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,320
 - I thought it was brilliant.

1040
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,640
 I thought it was sonically brilliant.

1041
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
 - I like it, yeah.

1042
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,480
 - I thought it was powerfully sexual.

1043
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,280
 - I think that was my main problem with it.

1044
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,560
 - And that's my main, that's the thing I like about it.

1045
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1046
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,800
 - I just thought that was stunning.

1047
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,440
 Stunning work, thank you.

1048
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,760
 There's also an email.

1049
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,120
 And this is to do with fish love.

1050
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,040
 - Meat cute.

1051
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
 - Meat cute.

1052
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,480
 Liz writes, "I was merrily laughing along

1053
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480

1054

 "Fish empty love in or dead meat."

1060
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
 - I like that meat.

1061
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,760
 (laughs)

1062
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,120
 - Dead meat, that's good, that's good.

1063
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,240
 - Right, there's some details have been changed,

1064
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,440
 but not many.

1065
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,560
 My ex and I attended a live performance of fish in 2024.

1066
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,720
 The show itself was wonderful, thank you.

1067
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,560
 - Thank you.

1068
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
 (laughs)

1069
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
 - A few months before, I had ordered a book,

1070
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
 which was one of those books you order from sites

1071
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,080
 where you generate an avatar of each family member

1072
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,840
 and it creates a personalized book.

1073
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,680
 - Yeah, okay.

1074
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,520
 - You can also encounter each of you.

1075
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,280
 - Yeah, nice.

1076
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 - I chose features relevant to my ex-husband

1077
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,040
 who looks very different to Dan.

1078
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,200
 However, the book inexplicably arrived

1079
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,240
 with a likeness of Dan on the cover instead of my husband.

1080
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,200
 - That's the picture.

1081
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,520
 (laughs)

1082
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,320
 - That is you, Dan.

1083
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,160
 - Wow.

1084
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
 - As you can see from the image, it just generated Dan.

1085
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,480
 My ex didn't even wear glasses.

1086
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,640
 I thought it would have been brilliant

1087
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,160
 for Dan to sign the book.

1088
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,840
 My ex didn't think this was funny, he was wrong,

1089
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,720
 and didn't endorse the signing, so I didn't attempt it.

1090
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,600
 This incident was far from the singular calls

1091
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
 of our seven year relationship breaking down,

1092
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,320
 but it really didn't help.

1093
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,600
 The story has a very happy ending

1094
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,840
 in that I've been gleefully single for more than a year now

1095
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,200
 and co-parenting is going as well as can be expected.

1096
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
 - Okay. - Wow.

1097
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,640
 - So that's our first fish divorce.

1098
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,920
 - I don't think we can be blamed wholly for this.

1099
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,760
 - Not wholly.

1100
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
 She says it's only part of the,

1101
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,320
 she says it was probably the straw that broke the cows.

1102
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,480
 - Honestly.

1103
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,480
 - No, no, no, no, I'm paraphrasing, but like.

1104
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
 - But we didn't create this.

1105
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,120
 The only input we have at all is that Dan has

1106
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,520
 quite a generic male face with glasses.

1107
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,960
 Like that's all we can be held responsible for.

1108
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
 I know it looks like that.

1109
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,200
 - Dan's hacked his way into this company

1110
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,560
 that makes personalized books,

1111
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,360
 and it's on hundreds of thousands of books

1112
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,440
 all over the world now.

1113
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,520
 - He's like, you know when they find like a sperm doughnut?

1114
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,800
 - He's been (laughing)

1115
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,720
 giving the sperm to like thousands of different people.

1116
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,680
 It's like that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,800
 - Well, I'm glad she's thriving in her new life.

1118
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
 - Sounds like it. - Yeah.

1119
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,480
 - Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry.

1120
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,920
 - Yeah, and I'm happy to sign the book, you know,

1121
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,360
 if she wants to send it in.

1122
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,000
 - So there you go.

1123
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,120
 Congratulations Liz.

1124
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,520
 And thank you for listening to the podcast.

1125
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,560
 - All right, now it's time for a few quick fire,

1126
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,000
 nominative determinism corners.

1127
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,320
 - Oh great.

1128
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,720
 - Finley Chope writes in,

1129
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,400
 re German chocolate cake.

1130
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,360
 - Yes, made by someone called German.

1131
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,720
 - Yeah, from Germany.

1132
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,440
 - Finley writes,

1133
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,680
 I have another thing that sounds like it's named after something else,

1134
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,280
 but it's actually named after a person.

1135
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,760
 Don't remember whether you come up with the name for that.

1136
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
 I don't think we did actually have a specific name for that.

1137
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,800
 Anyway, there's a snake native to my,

1138
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,480
 and Dan's homeland of Australia.

1139
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,520
 It's the children's python.

1140
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,560
 (laughing)

1141
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,040
 Well known for its dose of nature

1142
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,400
 and a great choice for any child wanting a snake for a pet.

1143
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,800
 It's actually named after John George children.

1144
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,640
 - Brilliant.

1145
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,920
 (laughing)

1146
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,760
 - It's not good.

1147
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,600
 - I really like it.

1148
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
 - And I looked it up and I think you can keep them as pets.

1149
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,640
 - Really, yeah.

1150
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,800
 - You can, yeah.

1151
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,280
 - Anyway, so that's a great, that's a great, yeah.

1152
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,600
 - That's very good.

1153
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
 - Very nice.

1154
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,280
 - Okay.

1155
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
 - It's a lovely show.

1156
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,200
 - Yeah.

1157
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
 - Nice show.

1158
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,200
 - Nice show.

1159
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,920
 - Let's see how the ending goes.

1160
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,640
 (upbeat music)

1161
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,080
 - Well, thank you everyone for your emails

1162
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,520
 to the podcast@QI.com address.

1163
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,360
 And we'll be back in the format with another one of these.

1164
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,040
 And I think that's all there is to say on the matter.

1165
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,000
 (laughing)

1166
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,840
 - It's good.

1167
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,920
 - Thanks, thanks everybody.

1168
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,760
 Thank you, bye.

1169
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,600
 - Thank you, bye.

1170
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,760
 - Thank you.

1171
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,880
 (laughing)

1172
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,480
 - It's so unclear when something's going to end, isn't it?

1173
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,560
 - Actually, that's what the word buy is really helpful for.

1174
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
 (laughing)

1175
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,520
 But I tried that and then you people forced me into another.

1176
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,800
 - We're not doing nothing and nothing.

1177
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,320
 We're just sitting here watching you hang yourself

1178
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,580
 (laughing)

1179
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,160
 - See you in two weeks, podcast@QI.com.

1180
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,000
 Bye.

1181
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,600
 (upbeat music)

1182
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,180
 (upbeat music)

1183
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,760
 (upbeat music)

1184
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,340
 (upbeat music)
