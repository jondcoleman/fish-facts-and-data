00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
 (mechanical beeping)

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.920
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.840
 (electronic music)

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hi, Andy.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 - Hello, Andy.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.920
 - Hey, guys.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.600
 Welcome to Drop us a Line.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.880
 Welcome to you at home.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 Welcome to the viewers.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.880
 Welcome to the listeners.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.840
 Welcome to those who are experiencing this

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.640
 solely through touch or smell.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 The astral plane.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.240
 Welcome to those shooting it from the astral plane.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.400
 Yeah, right.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.240
 Let's have some emails.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.080
 We've had some great ones.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.920
 Thank you for sending them in.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.960
 Podcast at qi.com if you do want to send one in.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.800
 Let's start off.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.600
 Jonas Beederman from Basel, Switzerland.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.440
 - Basel.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 - Basel.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.120
 Is it Basel?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 - Or Barl, if you from the French speaking part.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 - Sorry.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 - But yeah, not Basel.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 Which is how Americans pronounce Basel.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.920
 - I'm absolutely gutted because I was really,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.840
 I checked about Beederman and how you pronounce that.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 - And I tripped over.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.200
 - I mean, I met people in Switzerland

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 might ride to me, but I have been that.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560
 - Basel, yeah, yeah.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.400
 - Basel.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.760
 - There's a famous football team from there as well.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.240
 - I stepped over the rake and then I tripped

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 over the safety pin.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.840
 They're so annoying.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.800
 - Jonas, sorry Jonas.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.640
 Right.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.720
 I am a long time club fischer and fervent admirer

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960
 of Andy's sections from the evergreens

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.880
 like spicy meat and thanks, but no thanks,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.960
 to the more short-lived cult classics.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.160
 (laughing)

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.880
 Like the sausage parlor, Russian droppers of line,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.960
 and of course, the incest zone.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.560
 (laughing)

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.920
 Which I think we have, we've done all of it.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.600
 - Yes.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.120
 A while back you mentioned getting stings slash jingles made

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.240
 for the various sections.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.840
 I'm sure you have already been inundated

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 with fan creations that you quite sensibly refuse

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 to play on the show.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240
 We haven't really, Jonas.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.800
 It was a call out.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.960
 We got a couple of them.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.800
 - I remember it.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.640
 - Yeah.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 - But here is some more.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.560
 - Great.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.160
 - No AI was harmed in the making of these,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 though I did use virtual sampler instruments

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.000
 for some of them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.840
 - That's allowed.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.680
 - That's allowed.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.160
 I'm proud to say that I was able to play

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 the bassoon sections entirely without sheet music.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.560
 (laughing)

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.080
 So I thought let's lead in.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.920
 Let's have a cup.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.560
 Let's sprinkle these through the show.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.400
 - Okay.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.240
 - Okay.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.080
 - So can you guys earphone up?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.920
 I've said them too on WhatsApp.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 You haven't heard them yet.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.520
 So just have a little, set yourselves up now.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.360
 Okay.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.000
 I'd like you to play now the one that's labeled

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.640
 extreme fish.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.480
 - Okay.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.320
 - We'll play it at home.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.160
 Okay.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.000
 Ready?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 One, two, three.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 (upbeat music)

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.680
 - Time for minutes.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.000
 It's extremely fish.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.480
 (laughing)

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.320
 - That's very good.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.160
 - It's very good.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000
 - Isn't it?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.840
 - Is that me doing the raw?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 - It is.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.520
 - It sounds like me.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.360
 - Yeah.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.480
 So yeah, very metal.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.320
 - Yeah.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.640
 - And by leather sampling.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 - Yeah, really good.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640
 - Why have I not been sampled?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 Am I not metal enough?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.960
 - You might come up in a...

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.600
 - It was soft fish or something.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 Stinky old fish.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.640
 (laughing)

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.040
 'Cause I'm probably the one who's been

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.440
 to a Metal gig most recently out of the three of us.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.280
 - What did you go for?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.600
 - I went to watch ice-nine kills.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.760
 - Oh.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.600
 - Yeah.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.680
 - So they're a metal band who they take horror films.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
 - Yeah.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.360
 - They're great songs based on the horror films.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.200
 - They're very cool.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.040
 - They're very cool.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.760
 But way too loud and shouty for my ears.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.160
 - Well, so anyway, thank you Janice.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.760
 That was the, well, you're the metal aficionado.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.600
 That's the...

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.280
 - Yeah, I thought it was as far as metal music goes.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.120
 Nine out of tab.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.960
 - Right.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.480
 Well, Christie from the Gold Coast in Queensland

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.080
 has some extreme fish for us.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 - Okay.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.760
 - Great.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.640
 - So in Reason Drops of the Line,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 you heard from Caleb in Montana

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.240
 who plays fish out loud while hiking

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.320
 to scare away bears.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.160
 - Yes.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.000
 - You remember this.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.960
 He also mentioned Bear Bells,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.520
 which are these jangli little alarms.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
 I don't think there's an actual cloche.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.480
 The jangli little alarms,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.120
 I guess you use to let bears know humans are nearby.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.880
 So this just struck a chord with Christie

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120
 because my partner and teenage kids

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120
 recently went skiing in Japan.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.600
 I suggested they invest in Bear Bells,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.280
 but their Japanese friends confirmed bears

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.840
 have been a big problem this past year,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000
 especially in northern Japan.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.840
 - Wow.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.800
 - Kind of there's been a bad acorn harvest

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.600
 and they've been sort of looking in towns

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.440
 for food basically.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.280
 - Right.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.480
 - So it does in deaths, lots of injuries.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.320
 - Oh dear.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.720
 - On hearing my suggestion,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.760
 their friends Mum put me in my place.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.600
 She warned us that curious bears

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.240
 are now being attracted to Bear Bells.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.400
 - Oh really?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.440
 - Instead of human nearby,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.680
 they now hear room service.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.080
 So hikers are basically being told

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.720
 that to be loud and boisterous instead.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.560
 - Yeah.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.240
 But then eventually the bears will get used to that, right?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.560
 Because presumably what happens is they hear the bell

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.640
 and then one bear goes up and finds,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.440
 actually I got a kick-cat from that person.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.280
 - Yes.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.160
 - So then the future they go again,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.600
 but then they change it to podcasts.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.520
 But then eventually they'll start getting attracted

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.560
 to podcasts and they'll have to find something else.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.400
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.240
 - Maybe that's a music.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.120
 - Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.040
 Well, Christy Finishes,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.360
 the Japanese member of your team,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.280
 hand-to-moo-ray,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.600
 might be able to tell you more.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.880
 (laughing)

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.120
 - We got it out.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.960
 - Yeah, that's Christy.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.800
 - It was wonderful.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.000
 - Yeah, so Bear Acorns,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.040
 that's the surprising bit of the diet

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.480
 for a bear that I didn't know about.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.320
 - No.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.800
 - Yeah, what did you think they at Picnic baskets?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.440
 (laughing)

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.240
 - I'd like jars of honey

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.720
 that they can have. - Chas of honey?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.560
 - Chas of honey?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.440
 - Have they been lying to us in these great cartoons?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.280
 - No, that's very cool,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.840
 'cause you would think you would solve that immediately

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.400
 by importing a bunch of acorns

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.480
 and helicopter-dropping them over the areas

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.320
 that Bear has live in.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.400
 - I guess so, I guess, for whatever reason,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.160
 that's been rejected as an idea.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.720
 - Oh, no one's thought of it yet.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.200
 - 'Cause there's been a bad acorn harvest.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.880
 Where are you getting these acorns from?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880
 - The countries.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.920
 - Bring 'em in. - Bring 'em in.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920
 - Bring 'em in.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.520
 - We have them coming out of our ears

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.080
 in London, the acorns.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 - Who's the leading Avelace about trees?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.240
 - There we go.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.520
 - So what we need to do is helicopter some,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.840
 I guess you'd use long distance,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.080
 you'd use a plane for the first leg

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.800
 of the journey, wouldn't you, from bringing to Japan?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.720
 - Yeah, I don't think I'm saying it just to get anything wild.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.560
 - No.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.440

 "so you wouldn't even feel it."

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.840
 This was about a month you biting you in the brain.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.160
 - Absolutely.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.080
 - And so my understanding is that

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.680
 if someone touches your brain, you can't feel it.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.720
 Now, I was going off memories, so maybe I'm wrong.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.160
 - Well, I think there's a middle path here.

 - "I'm presuming he meant sensory or pain receptors."

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.160
 - Yep.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.600
 - It's a technicality.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.320
 (laughing)

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.640
 You see, I don't want to be the person on this show

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.720
 that just fights back against the audience

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.920
 to see what a bullshit email too often.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.760
 - No.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.880
 - And so when I occasionally think that in my head,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.800
 I kind of hold it back, but actually in this case,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.600
 I didn't, did I?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.080
 - No, but it's nice that you occasionally,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.440
 I think you can't just be, you can't just roll over every time.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.280
 - No.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.800
 - You've got a reputation to maintain.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.760
 So I think it's fine.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.280
 I think it's fine for you to do that.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.720
 - Okay, now fair enough.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.560
 I guess.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.400
 - Yeah.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.240
 - Don't fight.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.400
 - Really good fight.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.640
 - I think it is pretty amazing that a monkey could

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.960
 bite your brain and you wouldn't feel that.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.360
 - That is pretty astonishing.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.920
 - You know, it was happening.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.520
 - You'd probably, there would be other signs.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.280
 - It's very rare that a monkey bites someone's brain

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.920
 in a controlled environment where they're screened

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.360
 from the monkey and the top of their skull's been taken off

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.560
 by a surgical tube and then a monkey's got into the brain.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.360
 - Somehow made it into the ring.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.120
 - So I was, where was this in the pole

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.200
 and I was sat by some river and I'm just sort of sitting there

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.800
 with my bag by my side and reading my book

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.080
 and the monkey's kind of got really close

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.240
 and tried to get into my bag

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.640
 without me even noticing they were there.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.480
 - That's pretty good.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.960
 - So if the back of my skull was open

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.720
 and there was something, you know, they were hungry for brain,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.320
 then I can actually imagine them getting relatively close

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.320
 without me noticing.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.160
 - Wow.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.520
 - There you go.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.760
 - It's a good point.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.720
 - It's an if, if the back of your brain was open

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.640
 but you've been allowed to go on holiday.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.840
 Anyway, yeah, we'll finish the operation

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.000
 and the bet is to harking but it's five o'clock.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.920
 So it flights to Kathmandu leaves.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.720
 It's just half an hour, you better get out there.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.040
 - It was it was irresponsible of you

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.160
 to book the holidays so close to your major brain surgery.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.360
 - It's actually good to air it out

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.640
 before we close it up.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.440
 - Don't pick it.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.960
 All right, just let it get a nice air ring.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.400
 - Yeah.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.200
 Are you going to any monkey infested areas

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.600
 just to carry us any?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.080
 - Right, I've had one.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.200
 You've had one.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.360
 Rachel Bobo writes in for Dan.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.840
 - How do you spell Bobo?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.960
 - As it sounds.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.520
 - B-O-B-O, great.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.360
 - Wow.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.200
 - Of clown fame.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.040
 - Yeah.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.440
 (laughing)

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.520
 - It just makes so much sense

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.480
 that my one's from someone called Bobo.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.080
 (laughing)

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.440
 - She writes, sniff my flower.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.280
 - She doesn't.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.400
 - I imagine you've already received quite a few emails.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.960
 Hopefully not rodeo clown numbers

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.120
 about Elvis Presley's birthplace.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.840
 As my cat phrase on this show, Rachel,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.880
 I'm afraid not you are the first.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.640
 But as a local, I felt my duty to correct Dan.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.240
 Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.520
 not Memphis, Tennessee.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.200
 Not sure about Alan Titchmars, though.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 - I don't recall this.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.640
 - I'm afraid I don't remember saying that at all.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.720
 I must have, obviously.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720
 - I know.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.000
 - Yeah, apologies.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.840
 But there you go.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.400
 He moved to Memphis to pursue music

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.040
 when he was in his late teens.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.880
 - Interesting.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.040
 It must have been in the Tom Allen show.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.880
 - Yeah.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.440
 - Because that's when we met mention that.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.280
 - Yes.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.360
 - And we were talking about, yeah, the dancing.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.880
 - Oh, I see.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.200
 That was what happened.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.640
 I said he had something in common with Alan Titchmars.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.960
 And Dan, I think, said,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.240
 "Oh, they were both in prison or something."

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.400
 Or maybe you also said they were both born in Memphis.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.240
 - Yeah, maybe.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.080
 - Yeah.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.320
 - So it was a joke.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.640
 - Sounds like it.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.960
 - It doesn't, I mean, it doesn't sound like it, but yeah.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.120
 (laughing)

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.200
 - Sounds like a really good one.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.760
 (laughing)

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.600
 - That's fair enough.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 Right, we've all three had one.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.040
 - But there's a bonus hook.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.200
 - Oh, it's a whole hook lurking in the water.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.880
 Dan Latham writes, "Long time listener, first time nitpicker.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.920
 "I was listening to no such thing as an Eton Oyster."

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.840
 Oh, the release at the end of December.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.720
 And in it, I believe it was Andy who said

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.600
 that the Chartres recipe is known by only two monks.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.680
 - I felt it was my duty to correct you,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.360
 especially as I've now been living in this part of France

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.640
 for five years, and I've been on the tour

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.520
 of the Cav de la Chartres twice,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.040
 which are the not caves in the English,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.400
 they're sort of sellers for making it

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.360
 where they aged the alcohol.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.640
 My correction is there are in fact three monks

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.760
 who know the recipe.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.320
 (laughing)

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.080
 - And what's happened is the third monk come in

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.400
 and...

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.400
 - He's walked it out.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.840
 - He's walked it, he's burst in

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.480
 while they're having their secret weekly meeting

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.400
 where they go over the ingredients.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.480
 (laughing)

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.960
 - He says to avoid stalemates in arguments.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.800
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.640
 - Oh, maybe.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.480
 - They just need a third.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.960
 - I don't think they're allowed to change the recipe.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.320
 I don't think if you know the secret recipe,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.480
 you could just put any old shed in it, no.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.000
 But apparently on the tour,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.480
 a downland that in order to protect the recipe, what?

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.480
 - They can't fly on the same flight together.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.640
 - They're not allowed to travel together.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.480
 - Is it?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.320
 - Yeah.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.280
 - But now when there's three of them,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.400
 presumably two of them can go on a nice

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.040
 caravan holiday or something like that

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.440
 because the third one's still there.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.280
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.400
 - So that's maybe the reason why they got a third person.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.600
 - They can go monkey spotting in the pool.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.160
 (laughing)

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.880
 - Yeah, so thank you, Dan.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.880
 - Can I do a thing where it was an error that I said,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.480
 and I want to send you a WhatsApp?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.640
 - Oh, great.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.520
 - So this is Dan mentioned on the podcast.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.600
 Why has a football team never had a sponsor

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.360
 on the inside of the kit?

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.680
 So that when you score and you put your share over your head,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.960
 you can see the advert.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.800
 - Yeah.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.640
 - It's really good.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640
 (laughing)

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.520
 - And the person called Andrew Vazano

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.760
 wrote to us with this catafi kit.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.600
 - Incredible.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.200
 - Where they're sponsored by Burger King.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.440
 And when you pull the shirt over your head,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.760
 you can see the Burger King face

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.440
 where your face would normally be.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.280
 - So good.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.200
 - I wasn't aware there was a Burger King face.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.040
 - Well, you know.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.040
 - No, I didn't know that that was one part of the.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.160
 - I didn't know that was the King.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.000
 - Yeah.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.640
 - So it's the actual Burger King.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.240
 So Macdonald has Ronald Macdonald.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.720
 This is the King of the Vegas.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.560
 - Wow.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.400
 - Well, yeah.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.240
 - Brilliant.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.080
 - Brilliant.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080
 - I think it was from the '90s.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.920
 - Wow.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.760
 - Bring it back.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.600
 - Oh, cool.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.440
 - Bring it back.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.280
 - Brilliant.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.040
 We now come to our regular section.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.880
 Apologies to the armed forces.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.240
 (laughing)

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.320
 Merlin Lewis.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.720
 Merlin Lewis.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.280
 - We've had another Merlin race name.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 Maybe it was the same one.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.120
 - Yeah.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.320
 Merlin's coming back as a name.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.600
 - Or it did 30 or 40 years ago.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.960
 However, this Merlin shell Drake

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.880
 is a big selling answer at the moment.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.560
 - Yeah.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.400
 - No, it's huge.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.240
 - Yeah.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.680
 - You shout Merlin on in any crowded night club.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.000
 And it's a nightmare.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 - You go to the one's I go to.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.840
 - Yeah.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.720
 - The Druid Society in Morgan.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.720
 - Merlin writes, "I'm listening to you talk with Tom Allen

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080
 "and would urge you to reconsider your position

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.280
 "on the artist's rifles."

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.120
 - Do you remember this?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.960
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.800
 - Okay.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.640
 - So Noel Coward.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.000
 Noel Coward briefly served in this regiment

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.360
 in the First World War.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.800
 And then he quickly sort of got a bit ill.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.840
 - And Tom said that actually it was a place

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.240
 where you put the less useful people

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.800
 because they were in the arts and they went straight in there.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.520
 And actually I'd read that as well.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.680
 And I thought it was true.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.320
 - Quite the reverse it turns out.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.000
 'Cause they're better known these days as 21 SAS.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.760
 - Okay.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.080
 - The artist's rifles was Merlin writes

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.000
 an extraordinary regiment in which imaginative

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.480
 outside the box and sometimes flamboyant individuals

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.480
 were embraced by the army to allow genuine innovation.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.560
 And it started in 1860 and all sorts of people.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.160
 Ed Woodburn Jones, William Morris, Frederick Layton,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.200
 Holman Hunt, all sorts of really famous artists were in there.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.560
 And then they were sort of disbanded

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.880
 and then became the SAS in one of those weird ways

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.640
 that regiments kept us banded and then reformed

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.920
 and murdered all that.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.080
 But basically the artist's rifles

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.400
 is now a historical way of referring to the SAS.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.760
 So they're quite tough.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.760
 - Okay, well, come at us.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.480
 - Merlin or the SAS?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.880
 (laughing)

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.760
 - Yeah, but anyway, so they sound very cool.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.800
 I'm gonna read up more about that.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.640
 - Yeah, really good.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.280
 I hadn't heard that.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.440
 - Time for some real life.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.280
 - Really?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.200
 - Real life.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.720
 Matthew Price writes a quick clarification

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.240
 inspired by James Harkin, not a telling off.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.920
 In episode 577, he joked about the idea of getting a barge

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.920
 with his wife in Venice.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.760
 Do you remember that?

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.600
 It was very funny.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.640
 - Yeah, we were talking about getting a gondola

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.600
 and he was like, oh, we got a barge, you know.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.440
 It was funny.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.600
 It was really good.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.440
 - I'm a funny guy.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.880
 - Yeah.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.960
 - Sounds like a joke.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.760
 - It was a good joke.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.760
 (laughing)

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.680
 - We were talking about barges

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.320
 and then James joked about getting a barge.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.560
 It was great.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.400
 - Yeah, to be there.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.800
 - I can't believe you guys have forgotten that.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.240
 It was so good.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.920
 I'm delighted to report, writes Matthew,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.480
 that a hotel barge does operate in Venice.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.320
 - Is that so?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.320
 - So he never say never.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.680
 - It's fully licensed.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.280
 And Matthew is a certified deckhand.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.200
 And you wondered, I think,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.120
 a hundred episodes before that James,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.480
 whether it was a good thing

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.440
 that people had stopped learning how to barge.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.040
 And Matthew says, I feel duty-bound report.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.800
 The barging is still very much taught across Europe.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.640
 - Is that true?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.680
 - Yeah, complete with exams, salty instructors

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.960
 and the traditional shouting at lock gates.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.960
 (laughing)

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.800
 - So good.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.120
 And he works as a tour guide in France

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.720
 on a British First World War munitions carrier

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.520
 that has been converted into a floating hotel.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.360
 - Wow.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.760
 - Yeah, I love barges, really.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.840
 I don't know why I've been so down on them over the years.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840
 - Apparently you have.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.680
 - Yeah.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680
 - And Matthew's kept the receipts.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.920
 (laughing)

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.080
 - And he invited us to do an episode of float on this barge.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.960
 - Where is it again?

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.800
 - France.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.640
 - Sounds good.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.480
 - It does sound good, doesn't it?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.280
 - What about the one in Venice?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.560
 - He doesn't work on that one,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.720
 but it does also sound good, doesn't it?

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.560
 - Yeah.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.520
 - We could just do a barge tour.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.360
 - That'd be great.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.200
 - Oh my god.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.040
 - How many people do you think you can feel on a barge?

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.880
 How many?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.680
 - I think I looked at the one,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.560
 and it's about 20 people on the one that we've been saying.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.120
 - Okay, well, to be honest, when we played Paris,

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.480
 it wasn't that many more than that.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.480
 (laughing)

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.120
 - They won't be swarming the gangplanks trying to get on board.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.960
 (laughing)

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.280
 We might hit 15 to 20 tops.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.800
 - Oh, that was because in our European tour,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.000
 we had a tour booking company who booked it all,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.720
 and we know we're all of our listeners up.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.840
 We know where you are.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.680
 - We know.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.480
 - Because we can see our stats, right?

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.360
 - And they said we don't have many listeners in Paris,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.200
 and we were like, oh, we really want to go to Paris.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.400
 There's a great expat community there,

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.200
 and it turned out they were absolutely right.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.040
 - Yeah.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.600
 - Paris and Berlin, and we were like,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.640
 how is that even possible?

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.640
 - There are two flamboyant cathedrals, you know.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.480
 - Yeah.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.320
 - Well, there's hands out.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320
 People don't have better things to do.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.480
 - Kevin Edge writes,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.600
 (laughing)

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.280
 - I've been in YouTube for many years,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.240
 and no one has ever asked my first name.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.480
 (laughing)

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.120
 - Me either, it says Darrell Bono.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.400
 (laughing)

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.800
 - On your latest podcast,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.520
 you seemed to know whether spoons quite well.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.400
 Good and bad, I think this is pointing at you mostly, Dan.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.800
 Did you know there is a whether spoons top trumps?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.040
 They were on sale before Christmas at my local

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.360
 Colwyn Bay picture house spoons.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.760
 The sort of properties of the things include

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.520
 year-opened pub size, and of course,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.360
 number of steps to the toilet.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.760
 (laughing)

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.560
 - It's famous whether spoons for,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.160
 usually the toilets are an absolute trek away

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.000
 from the bar.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.840
 - Oh, really?

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840
 - Yeah, and lots of them.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.680
 - I've not heard that.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.520
 - I don't know that.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.360
 - I don't know that.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360
 - Maybe it's ones in a North that are like that.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.200
 - No, no, no.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.680
 It is, think about it now.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.520
 - Yeah.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.360
 - But, I mean, surely number of steps to the toilet

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.600
 is a movable property.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.440
 - Yes.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.200
 - If you get there nice and early,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.720
 you can get the table right back right by the toilet.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.120
 - There are no toilets by the,

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.320
 there are no tables by the toilets, right?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.640
 You can get a table by the bottom of the stairs,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.560
 but they have to walk all the way up the stairs

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.360
 through a load of corridors to find the toilet.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.280
 - Oh, just a pristine table for Valentine's Day love.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.120
 (laughing)

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.280
 - That sounds great.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.120
 So it's for two, yes.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.480
 Do you have anything a bit closer to the toilets?

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.560
 (laughing)

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.840
 - I'd be willing to make it worth your while.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.840
 We're gonna be drinking a lot of ruddles.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.640
 (laughing)

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.040
 - And yeah, okay, so thank you Kevin.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.080
 - Well, I don't know if weather spoons

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.560
 are a friend of the podcast or an enemy

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.880
 of the podcast on this show.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.720
 - Yes.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720
 - I think we've got no official position on weather spoons.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.920
 - Well, I think Dan has a very positive position.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.120
 - And the absolute sanders and other members of the team

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.480
 have a more negative position.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.680
 - I feel I have a position on the owner,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.200
 who I'm not a fan of.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.800
 Anytime I go into one, everyone's very nice in there.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.240
 So I feel rude saying anything against them.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.760
 And Ramsgate happens to have an extraordinary one

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.720
 on the beach, and so it's worth it for the location.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.000
 We have talked about it a lot over the years, haven't we?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.320
 The carpets, remember, they've all got

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.680
 at the spot of the interesting carp design.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680
 Is that on the top trump card?

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.520
 - It must be.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.680
 - Yeah.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.680
 - Maybe it would be on the back of the card.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.520
 Oh, that's nice.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.520
 - 'Cause then everyone would know what cards you had.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.760
 - Doesn't matter in top jumps.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.400
 - Does it matter if everyone knows what you've got?

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.240
 - Oh, yeah.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.080
 - The only thing is that you keep on winning

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.320
 and getting more, yeah.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.600
 Anyway, thank you, Kevin.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.360
 - Much like capitalism in that way.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.560
 And so probably why the guy who wants weather spoons

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.840
 likes it so much.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.040
 - Come at us Tim Martin.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:20.480
 Michaela Comperi writes,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.560
 you mentioned recently in the last drop of the line

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.520
 that Tim Hortons doesn't have an apostrophe.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.680
 - Yes.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.800
 - 'Cause of Quebec language laws.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.640
 - That's right.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.120
 It might have been in little fish actually.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.560
 - Oh, you might be right.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.120
 And it reminded me of my favorite

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.160
 French language law story.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.480
 A comedian took out billboards in Quebec

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.160
 that said, quotes,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.800
 "For Christmas, I'd like a complaint

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.840
 "from the office de la langue from says

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.000
 "within 48 hours he received the complaint

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.040
 "and had to change the science

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.320
 "because you're not allowed to put up big signs

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.680
 "in English, I suppose."

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.520
 - Oh, okay.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.160
 - "I had to change the signs to Pornowel,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.000
 "get a complaint de la langue from says."

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.800
 - Do we know who the comic was?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.120
 - No.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.800
 - Michaela Michela has sent a link, which I haven't followed.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.520
 - And is that to get publicity

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.120
 basically for the show in the long run?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.960
 - I guess so.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.800
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.000
 - Is that what I've been in the newspapers?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 - It's an interesting practice.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.720
 I used to work somewhere and I won't say where,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.800
 but they tried to constantly get MPs

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.280
 to sort of ask for the banning of a specific comedy thing

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.560
 in the House of Lords so that it would make the papers.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.720
 They would actively pursue them to talk them into doing it.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.040
 - Oh, we think, James.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040
 Truth or lie?

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.680
 - How interesting.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.160
 I'm just trying to think of all the people

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.840
 I know where you've worked over the years.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.920
 - I know, I can't.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.760
 - I can't.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.600
 - Yeah.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.440
 - It's been two places, QI in here.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.280
 - Yeah.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.840
 - Right.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.680
 But basically, and Evan from Vancouver,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.880
 we've had a lot of correspondence from Canada

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.720
 about the Quebec language police,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.880
 the Okwuf, office quibikwa, Dilla Longfran says,

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.360
 'cause they've done a lot of stuff over the years

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.000
 that's been a bit too outsiders, bananas.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.840
 - Bananas.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.680
 - Bananas.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.760
 - Very good, great point.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.480
 They find a restaurant called the pub Burgundy Lion

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.680
 because it was not French enough,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.560
 despite pub Burgundy and Lion all being French words.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.160
 They told an Italian restaurant they needed

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.240
 to translate pasta into French.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.440
 - I know a French people call like a bar la pub.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.480
 I've seen that in places,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.320
 but I would still say that was an English word, really.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.160
 - I think so.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.120
 I think you can't have the word part of France.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.160
 But basically, one last anecdote that comes from a friend

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.280
 of mine is wife used to earn a shop in Montreal

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.800
 and she does not speak French.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.480
 She received a violation notice from the Okwuf.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.240
 However, she did not know what she violated

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.960
 since they will not correspond in English.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.960
 (all laughing)

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.920
 - It sounds very entertaining.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.120
 So thank you, thank you everyone who wrote in about that.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.760
 That sounds great. - Very good, very good.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.640
 - We've got, we've got ham fish now.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640
 New section.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.480
 - Ham fish. - Oh, new section, okay.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.640
 - Ham fish did.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.480
 - Oh. - Like as in,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.320
 you do something that's really good.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.160
 - Is that what it's about?

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.480
 - Is this in relation to McKellen

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.600
 or the oldest ham?

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.960
 - It's in relation to the oldest ham.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.800
 - Oh, I see.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.920
 - So we mentioned the oldest ham.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.360
 Charlie Tuff has updated us on the oldest ham in Oxford

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.080
 that we talked about, which is not the other oldest ham

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.920
 we talked about, but we did talk about the one

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920
 in the covered market in Oxford.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.640
 - And we were wondering whether it was still there.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.480
 - Yeah.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.960
 - Well, the butchers who displayed it,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.520
 emfeller and daughter,

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.560
 closed their shop in the covered market back in early 2023.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.080
 I can't find any online presence for the butchers after that.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.240
 The fate of the ham is currently unknown.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.600
 - Wow.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.640
 - So let's start a ham hunt.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.480
 - Yeah.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480
 - Yeah.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.360
 If you know where that ham might be, drop us a line.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.200
 - Yeah.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.040
 - Yeah.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.320
 - 'Cause we need to get us out some press, guys,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.040
 and I'm thinking if we find the oldest ham,

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.440
 surely that's good for something.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.440
 - I think we put it up in Quebec

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.760
 with a sign saying oldest ham in English.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.440
 (laughing)

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.720
 - And get down to mention campaign against it

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720
 in the House of Lords.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.560
 - Yeah.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.400
 Interesting.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.240
 Yeah.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.080
 - Yeah.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.920
 - I imagine they just threw it out.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.760
 - Do you?

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.600
 - I do.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600
 - I don't know.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.440
 - No.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440
 - You're crazy.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.000
 It's not gonna be an historical ham.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.680
 Submitted to a museum, surely.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.000
 - Oh, damn.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.320
 I can't believe you've not been in the inbox, still.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.160
 - What?

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.000
 - No.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.400
 - Okay, 'cause this is so exciting.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.000
 And in fact, this is the big Marmalade dropper

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.240
 of this show, I would say.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.080
 - Okay.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.920
 - Ben Murray.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.760
 - What is that?

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.600
 - Marmalade dropper.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.440
 - Yeah.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.680
 - Is it like an exciting news story?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.520
 Have you not heard of that?

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.360
 - No.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.080
 - 'Cause you're eating your breakfast and you've got what?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.920
 - Yeah.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.640
 - It's a newspaper term for a great story.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.480
 - That's great.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.840
 - You would probably call it a cocoa pop splasher.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.680
 (laughing)

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.520
 - Yeah.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.040
 (laughing)

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.880
 - Whoa!

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.320
 (laughing)

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.800
 - Well, Ben Murray writes, long time listen

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.000
 at first time emailer, I've just heard today's episode

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.480
 of Little Fish and was extremely surprised to hear the fact

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.320
 about the world's oldest ham only being dated 1902.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.800
 - This is because I look after museum collections

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 in Hampshire, Hampshire, and have both seen and smelt

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.880
 what I believe is a much older ham currently sat

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.280
 in one of our stores.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.120
 - Wow.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.280
 - Please see the picture attached.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.360
 Our record for this ham states that it was one

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.440
 of a pair of ham's cured in 1875,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.880
 one of which got eaten to celebrate Queen Victoria's

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.520
 golden Jubilee in 1877.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520
 - Yeah.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.520
 - No, 1830 golden Jubilee, 1887 would have been, yeah.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.200
 The other made its way to the Hampshire museum service

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.640
 in 1971, and here it is.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.440
 - I mean, it's a very old ham.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.840
 - That's an old ham.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.760
 - Ben writes, I thought it was worth correcting this fact

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.880
 from years ago because I believe the world deserves to know

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.280
 about factually correct old ham's.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.760
 - I think you should go there and do a video

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.160
 like an Instagram video.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.160
 - I'd love to.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 I'd really love to.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.920
 I hope it, I hope it's still there, of course it's still there.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.560
 (laughing)

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.280
 - I'm so sorry, we just, we just had it.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.640
 (laughing)

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.480
 - Honestly, it was a bit stale.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.560
 - Glad to be with Broken D.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.800
 (laughing)

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.960
 - Who ate the oldest ham?

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.080
 (laughing)

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.920
 - Oh dear, anyway, thank you very much, lovely.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.680
 So that's the ham fist section.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.480
 Right, now, get those headphones back in.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.240
 We're going back to Jonas.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.320
 Who has produced a rodeo clown jingle.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.480
 One, two, three, go.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.320
 - Okay.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.640
 - It's rodeo clown time.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.220
 (upbeat music)

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.800
 - Right, it's good, we're rodeo clown.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.200
 rodeo clown of the week.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.520
 - Yeah, I mean.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.560
 - No, no. - No, it's Yihar.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.400
 - Is that me?

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.240
 - I think it's you.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.800
 - Am I just making sounds?

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.640
 - All the way through.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.960
 - All the way through, I podcast, I'm not aware of it.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.800
 - I mean, James does the edit.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.480
 I'll defer to him on this.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.240
 - Again, interesting that I'm not at all.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.200
 (laughing)

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.160
 I do want the Yoda Siff.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.480
 You've had some forgotten about a member of the team.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.840
 A crucial member of the team.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.440
 (laughing)

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.280
 - That's true.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.680
 (laughing)

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.240
 - He doesn't say in his email.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.920
 I've tried to cover everybody.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.960
 (laughing)

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.360
 - I don't think you not being in it

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.480
 is worse than me being the guy who just goes,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480
 "Are you hot?"

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.480
 (laughing)

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.320
 (screaming)

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.600
 - Showing our episodes.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.160
 (laughing)

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.360
 - You've got to give Yoda something to work with, James.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.600
 You need to make some silly noises.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.600
 'Cause it's easy for me,

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.160
 'cause I'm the guy who says rodeo clown.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.440
 So he's got a sample me.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.280
 - Yeah.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.120
 - Okay.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.960
 - Ham.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.960
 That's for a future one.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.800
 - Right.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.720
 - He's really good.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.880
 (laughing)

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.120
 I'll be honest, guys.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.400
 I'm not sure how frequently Ham fished it.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.160
 It's going to be part of the regular lineup.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.240
 I think it's going to be more like the incessant zone,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.080
 which is an occasional friend.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.800
 Does anyone in your family listen to this show?

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.720
 - They do, and it's why I've stopped telling those stories.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.240
 (laughing)

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.960
 - I mean, they're not stories, sorry.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.880
 (laughing)

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.760
 It's why I stopped making up fake.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.600
 (laughing)

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.880
 I think that's going on further with this.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.080
 - It is, in fact, yet again, true.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.600
 (laughing)

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.360
 - Right.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.840
 The rodeo clown of the week is about

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.120
 something we said in the Newdy Code, was he called?

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.280
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.080
 So again, this was the Tom Allen episode.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.480
 And Newdy is the guy who made suits.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.320
 - Yeah.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.040
 - Rhyne stones, he put rhyne stones on clothes.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.520
 - Rhyme, also.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.360
 - The song Rhyne Stone Cowboy is off the back.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.120
 It's a tribute to Newdy Cohen and the clothes he designed.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.360
 - Can you guys remember what he said?

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.520
 He started his career doing.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520
 - Lost right?

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.880
 - Oh, I know what it is.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.160
 I said, because I'm from the north, that he made pasties.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.520
 - Selling pasties to strippers?

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.360
 - Yeah.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.960
 - Well, Mabel Syrup writes.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.200
 - Maybe not a real name, I guess.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.720
 - Thrilled to hear you talk a bit about rhyne stones

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.440
 and pasties, both topics close to my heart,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.360
 but I need to clarify, is definitely pronounced pasties

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.440
 when you're referring to the nipple covering.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.880
 Although you wouldn't be the first to notice

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.080
 the glorious possibilities of pasty themed pasties.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.000
 - Micredentials, seven years of wearing pasties

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.120
 as a burlesque performer.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.440
 Do let me know if you'd like some fish-themed ones.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.280
 - Yes, please.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.280
 - Obviously.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.960
 - Or any tips on twirling.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.200
 I'm sure I could make that happen.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.880
 - I think we could get a lot more people to our French shows

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.520
 if we all came up wearing burlesque.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.360
 - Yes.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.200
 - Absolutely.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.800
 - Yeah, my friend Chris Buddle, he wrote to me saying,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.480
 he'd made a lot of pasties in his time

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.560
 and that we pronounced that wrong, yeah.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.080
 Well anyway, this has been the Radio Canal of the Week.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.960
 Thanks also to Indiana Split, another burlesque artist

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.320
 who said it is pronounced pasties

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.800
 and is a big faux pas among the burlesque community

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800
 to mispronounce it.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.640
 - Oh really?

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.480
 - Fair enough.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.080
 Big shimmies, Indiana Split.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.480
 So thanks to Lizzie B. Elaine, Mary, and Colorado

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:20.480
 and John Petra, who have all had the moment in the inbox.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.840
 - I do like, we get to discover

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.440
 not only you love locations of people.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.280
 - I love locations.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280
 - I love a location.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.080
 I love a territory of work that we suddenly have

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.920
 a huge fan base in that we might not know about.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.600
 So burlesque dancers as a merge now is,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.440
 that's really cool.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.160
 We should say more wrong things about people's industries,

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.440
 just so we can discover who's listening

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.480
 to us through the complaints.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.320
 - Good to hear that.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.160
 - Great idea.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.680
 - If you are from an industry that we mentioned,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.640
 but you just want to write in and say,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.160
 we got everything right,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.640
 then that will be equally fine.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.400
 - That happens, but it's more rare

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.680
 than people writing in saying,

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.040
 I'm a sailfish farmer and you said it all wrong.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.280
 Yeah.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.160
 Right, I'm gonna ask you one last time to put your,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.480
 put your cans on because we've got another section coming up.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.360
 And I'm excited for you guys to hear this one.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.760
 Okay, I'll count you in.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.840
 Ready?

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.760
 Three, two, one.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.720
 - Spicy.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720
 - Spicy.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.760
 - Here's how we get to the spicy meat.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.280
 - That's just meat.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.640
 - This is spicy, spicy meat.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.480
 - Yeah.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.240
 - If you're spicy meat, Ali.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.080
 - All right.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.080
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.280
 - This is a spicy one, spicy meat.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280
 (laughs)

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.440
 - Spicy meat.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.040
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.480
 - I'm still not sure what spicy meat is.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.360
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.040
 - It's like, I don't need to explain this.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.360
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.480
 - Maybe there's some spicy meat.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.320
 - Looking at it.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.520
 - Spicy, spicy meat.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.720
 - I mean, see how spicy you think there's meat is.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.960
 - So someone that's using that to their sex sound track.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.040
 - That's quite spicy.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.440
 - Oh, that's all we've got time for on today's job.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.280
 - Brilliant.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.120
 - It's great.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.040
 Works for incess corner as well if we need it to.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.360
 (laughs)

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.160
 - That's the only one I'm not on board with, I'm sorry.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.440
 - But you're in it.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.840
 (laughs)

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.080
 - If you want to buy it, you can't be pleased.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.040
 (laughs)

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.240
 - I love it, didn't you hear that the sizzling bacon?

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.520
 - Yeah, no, I didn't like that.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.720
 (laughs)

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.320
 - I thought it was brilliant.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.640
 I thought it was sonically brilliant.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.640
 - I like it, yeah.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.480
 - I thought it was powerfully sexual.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.280
 - I think that was my main problem with it.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.560
 - And that's my main, that's the thing I like about it.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.800
 - I just thought that was stunning.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.440
 Stunning work, thank you.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.760
 There's also an email.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.120
 And this is to do with fish love.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.040
 - Meat cute.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.080
 - Meat cute.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.480
 Liz writes, "I was merrily laughing along

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.480
 "to the recent drop of the line,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.360
 "do bears like listening to fish

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.880
 "and towards the end you invited stories

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.160
 "of anyone who has split up on account

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.280
 "of no such things as a fish.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.800
 "I can supply an anecdote for the new segment.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.840
 "Fish empty love in or dead meat."

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.920
 - I like that meat.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.760
 (laughs)

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.120
 - Dead meat, that's good, that's good.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.240
 - Right, there's some details have been changed,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.440
 but not many.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.560
 My ex and I attended a live performance of fish in 2024.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.720
 The show itself was wonderful, thank you.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.560
 - Thank you.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.560
 (laughs)

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.000
 - A few months before, I had ordered a book,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.800
 which was one of those books you order from sites

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.080
 where you generate an avatar of each family member

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.840
 and it creates a personalized book.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.680
 - Yeah, okay.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.520
 - You can also encounter each of you.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.280
 - Yeah, nice.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.280
 - I chose features relevant to my ex-husband

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.040
 who looks very different to Dan.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.200
 However, the book inexplicably arrived

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.240
 with a likeness of Dan on the cover instead of my husband.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.200
 - That's the picture.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.520
 (laughs)

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.320
 - That is you, Dan.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.160
 - Wow.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.280
 - As you can see from the image, it just generated Dan.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.480
 My ex didn't even wear glasses.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.640
 I thought it would have been brilliant

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.160
 for Dan to sign the book.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.840
 My ex didn't think this was funny, he was wrong,

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.720
 and didn't endorse the signing, so I didn't attempt it.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.600
 This incident was far from the singular calls

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.800
 of our seven year relationship breaking down,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.320
 but it really didn't help.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.600
 The story has a very happy ending

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.840
 in that I've been gleefully single for more than a year now

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.200
 and co-parenting is going as well as can be expected.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.040
 - Okay. - Wow.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.640
 - So that's our first fish divorce.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.920
 - I don't think we can be blamed wholly for this.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.760
 - Not wholly.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.600
 She says it's only part of the,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.320
 she says it was probably the straw that broke the cows.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.480
 - Honestly.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.480
 - No, no, no, no, I'm paraphrasing, but like.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.480
 - But we didn't create this.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.120
 The only input we have at all is that Dan has

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.520
 quite a generic male face with glasses.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.960
 Like that's all we can be held responsible for.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.520
 I know it looks like that.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.200
 - Dan's hacked his way into this company

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.560
 that makes personalized books,

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.360
 and it's on hundreds of thousands of books

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.440
 all over the world now.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.520
 - He's like, you know when they find like a sperm doughnut?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.800
 - He's been (laughing)

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.720
 giving the sperm to like thousands of different people.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.680
 It's like that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.800
 - Well, I'm glad she's thriving in her new life.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800
 - Sounds like it. - Yeah.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.480
 - Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.920
 - Yeah, and I'm happy to sign the book, you know,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.360
 if she wants to send it in.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.000
 - So there you go.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.120
 Congratulations Liz.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.520
 And thank you for listening to the podcast.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.560
 - All right, now it's time for a few quick fire,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.000
 nominative determinism corners.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.320
 - Oh great.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.720
 - Finley Chope writes in,

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.400
 re German chocolate cake.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.360
 - Yes, made by someone called German.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.720
 - Yeah, from Germany.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.440
 - Finley writes,

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.680
 I have another thing that sounds like it's named after something else,

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.280
 but it's actually named after a person.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.760
 Don't remember whether you come up with the name for that.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.320
 I don't think we did actually have a specific name for that.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.800
 Anyway, there's a snake native to my,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.480
 and Dan's homeland of Australia.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.520
 It's the children's python.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.560
 (laughing)

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.040
 Well known for its dose of nature

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.400
 and a great choice for any child wanting a snake for a pet.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.800
 It's actually named after John George children.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.640
 - Brilliant.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.920
 (laughing)

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.760
 - It's not good.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.600
 - I really like it.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.800
 - And I looked it up and I think you can keep them as pets.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.640
 - Really, yeah.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.800
 - You can, yeah.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.280
 - Anyway, so that's a great, that's a great, yeah.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.600
 - That's very good.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.440
 - Very nice.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.280
 - Okay.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280
 - It's a lovely show.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.200
 - Yeah.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.000
 - Nice show.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.200
 - Nice show.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.920
 - Let's see how the ending goes.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.640
 (upbeat music)

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.080
 - Well, thank you everyone for your emails

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.520
 to the podcast@QI.com address.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.360
 And we'll be back in the format with another one of these.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.040
 And I think that's all there is to say on the matter.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.000
 (laughing)

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.840
 - It's good.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.920
 - Thanks, thanks everybody.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.760
 Thank you, bye.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.600
 - Thank you, bye.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.760
 - Thank you.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.880
 (laughing)

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.480
 - It's so unclear when something's going to end, isn't it?

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.560
 - Actually, that's what the word buy is really helpful for.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560
 (laughing)

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.520
 But I tried that and then you people forced me into another.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.800
 - We're not doing nothing and nothing.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.320
 We're just sitting here watching you hang yourself

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.580
 (laughing)

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:15.160
 - See you in two weeks, podcast@QI.com.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.000
 Bye.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.600
 (upbeat music)

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.180
 (upbeat music)

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.760
 (upbeat music)

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.340
