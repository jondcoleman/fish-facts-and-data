1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
 - Can I look at it, put it on like this.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,080
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,880
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,720
 This week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,040
 I'm joined once again by the three other elves.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,120
 Please welcome to the stage.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,280
 It's Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,280
 (audience cheering)

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:37,660
 And once again, we have gathered around

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,260
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,860
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,740
 Starting with my fact this week,

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,460
 my fact this week is that the current French Scrabble Champion

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,440
 doesn't speak a word of French.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,940
 (audience laughing)

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,860
 This was in the news not too long ago,

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,200
 so I feel like some people know it,

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,360
 but I just found that absolutely amazing.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,880
 Did he just randomly play letters

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,720
 which all turned out to be

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,840
 except the French Scrabble dictionary?

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,440
 He memorized the French Scrabble dictionary,

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
 and then he just used that.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
 And even in the finals, he told the French guy,

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
 that's not a word.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,080
 (audience laughing)

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,520
 Yeah, it's amazing character.

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,400
 Yeah, his name's Nigel Richards, he's from New Zealand.

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
 - Oh wow.

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,480
 (audience laughing)

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,080
 - I read an article about him on shortlist.com

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,260
 entitled, "Why Nigel Richards is better than Lionel Messi?"

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,380
 (audience laughing)

37
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,680
 - Well, they do call him the Tiger Woods Scrabble, don't they?

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,760
 'Cause we should stress he is not known to be an adulterer.

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,600
 (audience laughing)

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,720
 I've read a thing a guy who's written a book about Scrabble,

41
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
 he's a sort of Scrabble expert,

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
 he's called Stefan Fatzis, and he said,

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,960
 "Right now, Richards is," or I'm quoting here,

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,480
 "like Tiger Woods at his peak,"

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,760
 and then Tiger saying, "I think I'll also take up tennis

46
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,160
 "and then winning Wimbledon the next year."

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,520
 - Wow, yeah.

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
 - Did he engulf people call Tiger Woods

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
 the Nigel Richards of golf?

50
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,160
 - Yes.

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,000
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,160
 - What happened?

53
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,960
 - I saw an interview with him on YouTube,

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,840
 and they asked what the secret is,

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
 and he said, "I'm not sure there is a secret,

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,480
 "it's just a matter of learning all the words."

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,000
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,160
 I was not secret anymore.

59
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
 (audience laughing)

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,600
 And apparently he's read the 1,953 page

61
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,480
 Chambers Dictionary five times,

62
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,760
 and memorized every single word in the dictionary.

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,440
 - Wow.

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,600
 Apparently, you're at more of an advantage.

65
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,560
 Scrabble players say, "When you don't speak

66
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
 "the language that you're playing in."

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,080
 - I bet it's the French who said that, is it?

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
 (audience laughing)

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,280
 - No, it's, apparently it's more about memorizing

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
 the coding of it, the mathematics of it.

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
 You look at it, like you look at a,

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
 I don't know, a big--

73
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,680
 - I mean, certainly what you do need to do

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
 is know all the two letter words

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
 'cause they're the most useful ones,

76
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,680
 and most of them aren't really real words.

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,480
 They're just like two letters put together.

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
 - No, no, no, no.

79
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,160
 - Like real is common, too, like a word.

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,480
 I think it's the most common, too, like a word.

81
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
 - Yeah.

82
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,240
 - The most commonly used word in all of Scrabble.

83
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,480
 - Is, is, uh, Chi, which is about QI.

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
 (audience laughing)

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,520
 Do you want to hear a move that Richard's made in 1998?

86
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
 - Yeah.

87
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
 - You do.

88
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
 (audience laughing)

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
 Right.

90
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
 - It's 1998.

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
 (audience laughing)

92
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
 I've set the scene.

93
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,240
 (audience laughing)

94
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
 So he was, he was pretty new at the time

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
 to competitive Scrabble,

96
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 and he had C, D, H, L, R, N, and then a blank tile.

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,640
 - Children.

98
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,480
 - There was an E on the board,

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
 and he could have played that,

100
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
 and he used up all seven letters

101
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,040
 and got a 50 point bonus, like an idiot.

102
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,880
 - Oh.

103
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
 (audience laughing)

104
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,240
 - Instead, he found two O's and an E,

105
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,400
 which were all in line on the board,

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
 not connected to each other,

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,160
 and played all of his letters to make the ten letter

108
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,960
 chloradine.

109
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
 - Oh my God.

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
 - Yeah.

111
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
 - That is like a dream,

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
 'cause you always want to connect all of those

113
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,320
 vertical columns, but it never works.

114
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
 - Wow.

115
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,520
 - And he only loved the game at the age of 28,

116
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,200
 and his mother introduced it to him,

117
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,360
 and she said, this is her words.

118
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,280
 I said, I know a game you're not going to be very good at.

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,960
 (audience laughing)

120
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,400
 Because you can't spell very well,

121
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,520
 and you won't very good at English at school.

122
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
 (audience laughing)

123
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
 Unfortunately, here's a mathematical genius,

124
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,120
 so you can't see all the, you just see it, yeah.

125
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,600
 - But another Scrabble move that's been made

126
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,840
 was in the first ever World Scrabble Championships

127
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,560
 in the early '90s.

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,000
 There was a winner, but the person who was runner up,

129
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,440
 the reason he lost was because one of the last words he played,

130
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,120
 and sometimes, you know, even if you've got a few letters left,

131
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 you take a pun on a word that you hope exists,

132
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,360
 'cause there are lots of weird words,

133
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
 and the first word he played,

134
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 the last word he played was the word "smail",

135
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,520
 as in "snail" with an "m" in the hope that that could

136
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,240
 get him some points, and it couldn't,

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
 but now that "smail" is an anagram of another word,

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,320
 which gets points.

139
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,160
 - Mails?

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,120
 - Yeah, so he couldn't have played males,

141
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,040
 and he lost the Scrabble Championship,

142
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
 because he played "smail" instead.

143
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,480
 (laughter)

144
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
 - You want to do it?

145
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
 - You want to do it?

146
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 - You want to do it?

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
 - It's like, that's awful.

148
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,360
 - He's very much the today's Tiger Woods of Scrabble.

149
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,080
 (laughter)

150
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,880
 - Do you guys know about the inventor of Scrabble?

151
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,040
 - He was cut.

152
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,720
 - Yes, Alfred Butts, which is just a lovely surname.

153
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,200
 - Alfred Mosher Butts was his middle name, not his nickname, right?

154
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,080
 - Yeah, and he only revealed a few days before

155
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
 he died.

156
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,320
 He lived until quite old.

157
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,040
 He was 93, I think.

158
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,800
 He said that he was a bad speller, and everyone was like,

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
 "That's hilarious," and then he died.

160
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,120
 It was less hilarious.

161
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
 (laughter)

162
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
 But on his tombstone, it said, "R.P.I."

163
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
 (laughter)

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
 - Mm-hmm.

165
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,880
 - Yeah, so he invented Scrabble.

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
 He called it it originally.

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,080
 I had another name for it, and then someone bought it off him

168
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,520
 and turned it into Scrabble, so when we use this word,

169
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,760
 and so he had that whole thing of the difficult second album,

170
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,040
 and he actually released the game, and it was called...

171
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,280
 Oh, sorry, I've lost it now.

172
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,680
 - I know what it was called. - Yeah, what's it called?

173
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
 - Alfred's Other Game.

174
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
 - That's it.

175
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,680
 - His follow-up to Scrabble was called Alfred's Other Game.

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
 - No one knew who Alfred was. - No one knew who Alfred was.

177
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
 - To know anything about it, because no one's ever bought it

178
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,480
 as far as I can tell, except four reviewers

179
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,360
 who reviewed it online, all of them say,

180
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,880
 "It's like Solitaire, but it involves two players,

181
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,160
 "but the two players don't interact with each other at all."

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
 So I think it's basically two Solitaire sets,

183
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,920
 and you're just supposed to sit next to someone

184
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,600
 while you do them. - Right.

185
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,000
 - Yeah, he wasted a lot of his talent on the first one, I think.

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,360
 So he decided the points for Scrabble, based on...

187
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,320
 He studied the front page of the New York Times

188
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
 over a series of months, didn't he?

189
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
 And then logged the frequency of certain letters

190
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
 in the New York Times that appeared,

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,960
 and decided the point scores based on that.

192
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
 So a lot of people now think we should change it.

193
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,200
 - I wonder if he counted the letters in New York Times,

194
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,920
 which appeared every single day.

195
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,200
 That is such a good point. - Yeah.

196
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,120
 - And that's why why isn't worth as much as it should be.

197
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

198
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
 - That's probably why I'm so bad at Scrabble.

199
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,280
 Yeah, and actually, if you're playing it in another language,

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,320
 it's not just the words, it's also the letters

201
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,040
 of worth different amounts, so that must be pretty hard.

202
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,960
 In Polish, a Z is worth one point.

203
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,720
 Although a Z with an accent on it is worth 10 points.

204
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,000
 - Really? - Yeah, that's weird.

205
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,920
 In Ukrainian, an apostrophe is worth 10 points.

206
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,160
 (laughing)

207
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,680
 But in Armenian, the board is 17 by 17,

208
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,560
 instead of 15 by 15, 'cause they have longer words.

209
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,840
 And they also have loads of letters that I've never heard of.

210
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,480
 So for one point, the letters "yeck" and "khen".

211
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,280
 For two points, the letter "men".

212
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,760
 For three points, the letter "ben".

213
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,400
 And for four points, the letter "ra".

214
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,680
 (laughing)

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,520
 I assume that's how you pronounce these "ra".

216
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,120
 - Well, did you see the "gur" has been added

217
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
 to the official Scrabble Dictionary in the last update,

218
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,600
 which was made in 2011.

219
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,240
 The words "gur" "thang" and "blingy" have been added

220
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,640
 to the Scrabble Dictionary.

221
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,920
 You can now play those.

222
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,800
 There's this huge wall between the Americans

223
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,880
 and everyone else, because...

224
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,040
 - Classic wall there, probably.

225
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,760
 - So, we'll, as you guys know, use the OSPD,

226
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,320
 the official Scrabble Dictionary, when we're playing Scrabble,

227
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
 and we've actually combined that with the OSW,

228
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,840
 the official Scrabble word list.

229
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,800
 But the US refuses to do that,

230
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 and keeps on using its own dictionary, the tournament word list,

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
 which is a completely different list of what...

232
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,480
 I mean, there's probably some overlap.

233
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,320
 (laughing)

234
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,120
 - I mean, as long as both have "thang", I'm happy.

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,080
 (laughing)

236
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,960
 - But yeah, people get very angry about this.

237
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,440
 - Well, they don't like swear words in the American one.

238
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
 - I don't know, they've banned this.

239
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
 - Yeah, they've banned all swear words,

240
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,440
 and ESPN decided to put the Scrabble Championships

241
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 onto their channel.

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
 But they had a thing where they said, "These are the lists."

243
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,440
 I think it was about 170 words.

244
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,360
 They said, "You can't say this on television.

245
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
 "You can do this in normal Scrabble competition,

246
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,240
 "but you can't do this on television."

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
 But so, what they did was the first 30 rounds

248
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
 of the competition, they could use all the rude words

249
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
 that were banned.

250
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
 And then when it got to the televised bit,

251
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
 they couldn't do it anymore.

252
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,320
 - That's pretty bad that they were allowed it

253
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
 for half of the tournament, and then not afterwards.

254
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
 'Cause what about someone like me

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
 who only ever plays rude words in Scrabble?

256
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
 (laughing)

257
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,360
 I'm gonna be nailing it halfway through,

258
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,920
 and then I'm gonna be absolutely useless

259
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
 as on TV as well.

260
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,200
 I will be using a lot of those words,

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
 but not on the board.

262
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
 (laughing)

263
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,960
 - I'm gonna have to move it on in a few minutes.

264
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,680
 So if anyone's got anything else,

265
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,800
 there's a very cool thing about Scrabble in Senegal

266
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,120
 where it's an official sport,

267
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,480
 and they take it so seriously,

268
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
 and Senegal hosted the French Scrabble World Championship

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,760
 in 2008.

270
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,920
 So this was before Richard's won.

271
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,320
 But the Senegalese government composed

272
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,880
 an official song to mark the occasion,

273
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
 and I read this in an article about it

274
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,160
 that in Senegal, you can buy a set of Scrabble

275
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,760
 on most street corners,

276
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
 (laughing)

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
 which I can't quite believe, but I want to believe.

278
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
 And I'm never gonna go to Senegal

279
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
 in case it turns out not to be true.

280
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
 (laughing)

281
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,000
 - Comes free with your bag of crack.

282
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,080
 Just to Scrabble dials.

283
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
 (laughing)

284
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,600
 I was on some online chat forums,

285
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
 just separate to work.

286
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,240
 And it was one of those,

287
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
 I was just taking a break.

288
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,280
 And it was, you know, it was like a Yahoo,

289
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
 answers thing or something,

290
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
 and it was a parent who said,

291
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,280
 this is literally what it read,

292
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,760
 "Hmm, my seven-year-old just swallowed a Scrabble dial.

293
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,960
 "No, wait, it's a banana-grams-tile."

294
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,720
 He tells me, "Anyone have an experience with this?"

295
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,240
 (laughing)

296
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,680
 I mean, it is exactly the same

297
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,280
 a banana-grams-tile to a Scrabble-tile.

298
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,600
 I guess she meant to specify not--

299
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
 - Probably just like make another tile out of cardboard

300
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,760
 and use that.

301
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,000
 (laughing)

302
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,480
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two,

303
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
 and that is James Harkin.

304
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,080
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the world's only

305
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,400
 venomous frogs headbutt their enemies to death.

306
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,360
 (laughing)

307
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,520
 - They're very little known species from Millwall.

308
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
 (laughing)

309
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,160
 - And you Googled Violent Football Team, didn't you?

310
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,400
 You've got no idea what you just said.

311
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,640
 (laughing)

312
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,280
 - And I'll never go, in case it turns out to be true.

313
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,080
 (laughing)

314
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,560
 - I think that's very safe.

315
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,960
 So yeah, you get a lot of frogs which are poisonous,

316
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,760
 which means if you eat them, you would be sick.

317
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 But these are venomous, so they stick the poison

318
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,680
 into the body of their prey.

319
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,680
 And they are called Apparas Venodon Brunoi

320
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,160
 and Cory Philmante's Greening Eye.

321
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,960
 And they have really flexible necks

322
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,560
 and really pointy skulls, and they have poison on their skulls.

323
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,680
 Actually, a single gram of venom from the first one

324
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,360
 of those frogs would be enough to kill 80 people.

325
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,000
 - Wow, 80, so they're proper hardcore

326
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,760
 and they're only little guys as well.

327
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
 (laughing)

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,600
 - Wow.

329
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
 - And have you heard of the Harry frog?

330
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
 - No.

331
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
 - So the Harry frog does this thing

332
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,680
 that when it's getting to a fight,

333
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
 it will break its toe bones to snap them,

334
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,640
 which is always intimidating to see someone doing that

335
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,560
 when you're in a fight with them.

336
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,760
 And they start breaking themselves before they go for you.

337
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
 So they'll just snap their toes off.

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,400
 And then they push their toe bones through their skin,

339
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,560
 like Wolverine, like, and they just come out

340
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,000
 and they go, do you want some?

341
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,200
 And then it's the most aggressive fighting I've ever heard of.

342
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,840
 - Andy, I don't know if you know this is exactly

343
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,960
 what they do in Millwall.

344
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,880
 (laughing)

345
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
 - Also, sea cucumbers, just while we're

346
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,560
 on the kind of fighting defense thing,

347
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,160
 they shoot their internal organs out through their ass hole.

348
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,320
 - So, sorry, Andy hates what they say

349
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
 where it's like that, I don't know.

350
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,640
 - That's why you two never place grubbles together.

351
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,720
 (laughing)

352
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,920
 - Yeah, imagine that, shooting bits of your body

353
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,560
 out through your ass, that's quite crazy.

354
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
 - Yeah, I can regrow them afterwards.

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,280
 They can regrow them and the idea is

356
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,880
 that the predators will eat the stuff that's come out

357
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,960
 and they won't eat the cucumber themselves.

358
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,880
 But actually, they also have a fish

359
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,640
 that live inside the renaces called slender pearl fish.

360
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,800
 So that must be pretty bad for those fish

361
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,960
 who are just sitting in a nice little home

362
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,840
 and suddenly everything gets ejected out.

363
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,400
 (laughing)

364
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,480
 - A nice little home.

365
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,160
 Oh, we've got it great, haven't we?

366
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 (laughing)

367
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,640
 Look at our anus.

368
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,920
 - We've got a nice two up two down anus.

369
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,280
 (laughing)

370
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,960
 - We're really hoping to move to a bigger anus

371
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,800
 in the country.

372
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,480
 (laughing)

373
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,080
 - So, there's two on a gist, were in Ecuador recently.

374
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
 And they spotted this frog that was obviously

375
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,240
 a new species 'cause it was like covered in spikes

376
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,320
 that they'd never seen before.

377
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,360
 So they're like, this is really exciting.

378
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,640
 And they spotted it around a way.

379
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,400
 So they spent years and years in Ecuador

380
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,680
 looking for this frog again.

381
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
 And they eventually found it.

382
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,240
 I think this year or last year, and they got it

383
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,680
 and they put it in a jar overnight.

384
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
 And I will deal with that tomorrow, you know,

385
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,960
 classified or whatever.

386
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,160
 Came downstairs in the morning

387
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,680
 and all of its spikes had gone.

388
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,760
 And so the geologist, the female geologist said,

389
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,080
 "I thought I must have just picked up the wrong frog."

390
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
 (laughing)

391
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
 And so I was very disappointed.

392
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,960
 But I just, you know, as she said,

393
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,240
 I laid down some moss so it would be comfortable in there.

394
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,960
 And then I decided to take it back out into the wild the next day.

395
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,800
 And then the next day the spikes were back.

396
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,160
 And it became apparent that this is a shape-shifting frog,

397
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,520
 the first known shape-shifting amphibian.

398
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,880
 - Well, do we know if they can turn into princes?

399
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,200
 (audience laughing)

400
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,040
 I read that in a scientific manual.

401
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,120
 (laughing)

402
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,000
 There was, when Disney released the princess and the frog,

403
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,200
 more than 50 children were hospitalised with cell manella

404
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,560
 from trying to kiss frogs.

405
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,400
 - Wow.

406
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,320
 - Just play banana grams with them like normal.

407
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
 Much better.

408
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,080
 In 2008 some scientists found a frog with no lungs.

409
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,760
 So this is really, really cool.

410
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,440
 It's called Barbara Ruler Kalim Mantanensis.

411
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
 Don't write in.

412
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,840
 And it hadn't been dissected before

413
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,760
 because they only had two specimens of it.

414
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,920
 And they didn't want to destroy

415
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,200
 the only two specimens they had.

416
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,640
 So nobody suspected that it wouldn't have lungs.

417
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,240
 And then they found another one and they thought,

418
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,600
 well, let's dissect it.

419
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,840
 - And sucks to be the third frog.

420
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,680
 (laughing)

421
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,800
 - The early bird catches the worm.

422
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,000
 And the second mouse gets the cheating.

423
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,720
 The third frog is dissected.

424
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
 (laughing)

425
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,360
 But it gets all its oxygen through its skin.

426
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,200
 It's so cool.

427
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,280
 And the really, really cool thing is that

428
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,480
 it actively threw away its own lungs.

429
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,880
 As then it used to have lungs

430
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
 and then it thought, I don't need these.

431
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,560
 (laughing)

432
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,560
 And because it saves space on lungs in its body,

433
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,400
 it's a bit slimmer and flatter.

434
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,960
 So it has a bigger surface area.

435
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,440
 So it can absorb more oxygen proportional to its size.

436
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,240
 - Well, that's like there's the scrotum frog,

437
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
 which does quite a similar thing.

438
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,400
 Yeah, the scrotum frog is cool that

439
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,840
 because it just has incredibly floppy skin.

440
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,280
 So it's got these really tiny lungs

441
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,720
 that can't really take much, but it got way too much skin.

442
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,040
 And so it's loads of surface area.

443
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,120
 And so it looks like a scrotum.

444
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,320
 So obviously it's far too much skin, it's kind of gross.

445
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,960
 (laughing)

446
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,520
 But it does help it respire.

447
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,280
 - Can I do some stuff on headbutting?

448
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,800
 - Yes, yeah, yeah.

449
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,000
 - So a Welsh police force has trained its dogs

450
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,640
 to disable their targets by leaping at them

451
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,000
 and delivering a flying headbutt rather than biting them.

452
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,640
 (laughing)

453
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,200
 And this is because people were being bitten by police dogs

454
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,360
 and kind of getting compensation or whatever

455
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,760
 and they thought, well, a better way of doing it

456
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,840
 is just having them attacking the people with their heads.

457
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 - I read that if cats headbutt you,

458
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,040
 this is what the scientist report I saw said.

459
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
 (laughing)

460
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,960
 That when cats headbutt you,

461
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,680
 it's the equivalent of them giving you a high five.

462
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
 (laughing)

463
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,800
 - And that's like the science you say.

464
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,160
 - Yeah, that's from my way.

465
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,960
 They just come over and they're just going,

466
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,640
 "Yeah, man, you're all right."

467
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,720
 - That's a loose definition of the equivalent of a high five.

468
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,040
 I mean, so they rub against you to express affection.

469
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
 - Can I take it up with science, eh?

470
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,360
 (laughing)

471
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
 - My five can signify so much.

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,960
 - Joy, sorrow, affection, sorrow, high five.

473
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,800
 (laughing)

474
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
 - That's the last time I take you to a funeral.

475
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,880
 (laughing)

476
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,520
 - Just one more thing about headbutt's Bedfordshire Council,

477
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,000
 apparently, according to this newspaper article I read,

478
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,800
 they banned local artists from displaying paintings

479
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,840
 behind glass and there were a few different reasons they gave,

480
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,800
 but one of them was that someone might

481
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,240
 headbutt a picture and cut themselves.

482
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,680
 - Who's going around art gallery's headbutting pictures?

483
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,080
 - The Millwall fans day out.

484
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,920
 (laughing)

485
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,200
 - Oh my God, I'm sorry I even mentioned Millwall.

486
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
 (laughing)

487
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,360
 - Actually, have you read that the headbutting record world record

488
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,280
 has recently been set, recently been reset and beaten?

489
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,160
 And by quite some way, so...

490
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,600
 - Wait, wait, wait, what, to do what?

491
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,440
 - Also, this is what you have to do.

492
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,400
 You have to crack walnuts with your head.

493
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,320
 And so the record previously was 44 walnuts,

494
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,920
 so you lay walnuts out on a table.

495
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
 You just bash, bash, bash.

496
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,200
 44 walnuts held by an American.

497
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
 And then this Pakistani guy called Muhammad Rashid

498
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,760
 has reset the record and he cracked 155 walnuts

499
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,480
 within the space of a minute.

500
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,240
 - A minute? - One minute, yeah.

501
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
 - He's the tiger woods, oh.

502
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
 (laughing)

503
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,840
 - Competitive headbutting.

504
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,640
 (laughing)

505
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,040
 - I just like to say that Mr Rashid

506
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 is not an adulterer.

507
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,280
 (laughing)

508
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,760
 - That's what, two and a half, a second?

509
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,600
 Is that right? - Yeah.

510
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,440
 - Can I be right?

511
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,800
 - But is he smashing a big bunch of them

512
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,640
 or are they all in a line?

513
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,480
 - No, no, they're in a line.

514
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
 You're gonna do one at a time.

515
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,400
 - Wow, yeah.

516
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
 - I couldn't do that with a hammer.

517
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,960
 - No, I know, that's why you're not even...

518
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
 - You're not even anywhere near the competition.

519
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,840
 - That's why I failed to place.

520
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,000
 (laughing)

521
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
 - A turned up with a hammer, B.

522
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,160
 (laughing)

523
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
 - It did not break records.

524
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,760
 (laughing)

525
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,160
 - We're gonna have to move on in a minute.

526
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,520
 Any last, before we go?

527
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,160
 - Just, did you hear,

528
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,880
 do you remember reading in 2005

529
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 about the exploding frog freak out in Hamburg?

530
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
 - It's so amazing.

531
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,080
 - It's so weird.

532
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
 So there was suddenly,

533
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,840
 this started happening in Hamburg.

534
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,640
 Thousands of frogs started exploding

535
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,960
 and, you know, spattering their entrails,

536
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,680
 all over the streets and their entrails would spatter up

537
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,240
 to like a meter wide.

538
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,800
 And people didn't know why they were doing this.

539
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 And there were these weird theories flying around

540
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,640
 about what was going on.

541
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,800
 So some of those hot frogs

542
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,080
 were just starting to commit mass suicide

543
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,680
 for no apparent reason.

544
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,280
 Someone else thought they'd caught a virus

545
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,680
 from race horses.

546
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,000
 Go on, James.

547
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,840
 - Just wondering where the horse racing theory came from.

548
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,880
 - Yeah, the horse exploding scandal in Hamburg

549
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,200
 the week before was...

550
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,360
 (laughing)

551
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
 I can't believe I didn't mention that.

552
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
 So what actually happened?

553
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,480
 So what happened was, it turned out it was crows.

554
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,600
 So crows had figured out

555
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,960
 that you can't eat the whole toad

556
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,640
 because it's skin is poisonous.

557
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,320
 And so, you know, you die.

558
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,840
 But you can pierce the skin

559
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
 and the only good bit of a frog,

560
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,440
 any food connoisseur knows is the liver anyway.

561
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,640
 You suck the liver out.

562
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,480
 And then what happens is,

563
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
 the liver of these toads

564
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,400
 is what's keeping all their organs in.

565
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,240
 And so they end up like,

566
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,560
 they puff up in defense

567
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,400
 and all their organs start exploding out of their body.

568
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,240
 - Wow.

569
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,080
 - Yeah.

570
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,520
 - But the crows have a nice bit of foie gras

571
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,680
 and aren't poisoned.

572
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,280
 So it depends who's side you're on.

573
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,480
 (laughing)

574
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,520
 - Okay, we're gonna move on to our next act.

575
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,640
 Time for fact, number three.

576
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 And that is Juzinski.

577
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
 - Oh yeah, my effect is that

578
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
 when the film All Quiet on the Western Front

579
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,520
 was released in Germany,

580
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,880
 Gubbles went to see it at the cinema.

581
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,400
 And within 10 minutes, he'd release stink bombs,

582
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,920
 itching powder and white mice

583
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,360
 in order to scare everyone out of the cinema.

584
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,920
 So this was fun guy, Gubbles.

585
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,160
 (laughing)

586
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,800
 Everyone's favorite clown.

587
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,760
 (laughing)

588
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,720
 - So he did it 10 minutes in.

589
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
 - He started doing it at the start,

590
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,880
 but he wrote in his diary.

591
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,240
 He kept 10,000 pages of diary entries, which my god.

592
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,320
 And one of his pages related how he started doing it.

593
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,240
 Within 10 minutes, the whole cinema was in chaos.

594
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,480
 People were running away, itching themselves,

595
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,520
 you know, fainting with the smell.

596
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,640
 - Yeah, they really didn't like that movie, did they?

597
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,200
 'Cause it was the fact that the German soldiers

598
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,920
 died in a not brave way,

599
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,480
 and the French soldiers did die in a more brave way.

600
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,320
 - Yeah.

601
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,160
 - So it got banned.

602
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,560
 But then ironically in Poland,

603
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,960
 it also got banned because it was pro-German.

604
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
 - Yeah.

605
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,680
 - So Germany banned it for being anti-German

606
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,440
 and Poland banned it for being pro-German.

607
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
 - What's pretty crazy as well?

608
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,640
 So I was reading the IMDB page for it today,

609
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,840
 and in the little trivia bit,

610
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,400
 they were saying that a lot of the extras in the movie

611
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,920
 were actual German soldiers from World War I,

612
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,680
 who had moved over to America,

613
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,120
 who they said were doing this thing,

614
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,800
 and we just want to know about how you would march and so on,

615
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
 and the uniforms, can we have the better look,

616
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,440
 and they all said, "I'd love to be in the film."

617
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,200
 And so a lot of the German soldiers in it,

618
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,880
 are actual German soldiers from World War I.

619
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,800
 Pretty crazy, pretty bold casting.

620
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,240
 So the intervention that was kind of,

621
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
 I think you had a lot of brown shirts or the essay,

622
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,800
 with the brown shirts, to disrupt the...

623
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,720
 - Yeah, to freak people out, yeah.

624
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,960
 - And then it was, I think it was banned

625
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
 shortly afterwards in Germany.

626
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 - It was banned, yes.

627
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,240
 All the Nazis came to power, it was, I think it was 19...

628
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,520
 - Yeah, it was, it was 2030, and so.

629
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
 - 2030.

630
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
 - But you know, they were already a thing.

631
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

632
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
 - So yeah, he brought the brown shirts in,

633
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,800
 and it was banned, and the writer of the original book,

634
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,120
 who was called...

635
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,960
 - Remark.

636
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,480
 - Remark had to leave the country,

637
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,920
 and then he was in fight, so he was told he had to leave,

638
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,400
 'cause he was in this unpatriotic book,

639
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,280
 and turned into an unpatriotic film.

640
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,240
 And then, girl was obviously rethought that,

641
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,840
 and wrote him a few months later,

642
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,480
 and said, "Actually, no, no, honestly, come back.

643
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,320
 "Do come back."

644
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
 But at this point, you know,

645
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
 people were starting to get the hang of the whole Nazis,

646
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,280
 not being good guys idea, and so,

647
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,360
 Remark wrote back and said, "What, 65 million people

648
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 "want to get out of the country,

649
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,680
 "and I'm supposed to come back of my own free will,

650
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,280
 "not on your life," and he never returned,

651
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,160
 which is probably a good move.

652
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,120
 He was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for that.

653
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,960
 - Who was?

654
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,320
 - Remark, for the film.

655
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,920
 So, it's quite cool.

656
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,160
 You can go on the Nobel Peace Prize website,

657
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,120
 and look at all the nominations that were more than 50 years ago

658
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,240
 when they've been released.

659
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,880
 And that saved me in 1931,

660
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,720
 he was nominated for writing all quiet on the Western Front.

661
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
 Also, the government of Finland was nominated.

662
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
 - That's it. - I don't know why.

663
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,880
 Yeah.

664
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,360
 Just really peace-loving guys back then.

665
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
 Yeah.

666
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,120
 - Not like now when we're all living out of the Finnish jackboot.

667
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,120
 (all laughing)

668
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,520
 - I have a few things about censorship and stuff.

669
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,360
 - Yeah.

670
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 - There was a British council

671
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,960
 who banned the life of Brian,

672
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,640
 even though they had no cinemas in their boundaries.

673
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,240
 (all laughing)

674
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,240
 - And in 1999, the censors in Bournemouth

675
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,400
 asked to see a sexually explicit French film

676
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,960
 with a view to banning it,

677
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,120
 even though no cinema had expressed any interest in showing it.

678
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,880
 (all laughing)

679
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,520
 - Wasn't the first everything not banned,

680
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 but censored in the film industry in this country

681
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,960
 was the cheese board.

682
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,800
 - Yeah.

683
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,360
 - Sorry, it's not an actual cheese board.

684
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,200
 It's like a group of people who talk about cheese a lot.

685
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,760
 And there was a movie that came out where they showed,

686
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,000
 I think it was close up on cheese and all the bacteria and stuff,

687
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,480
 so they asked for it to be censored.

688
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,800
 And it was censored.

689
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,800
 It was the first to ask and get of censorship in cinemas.

690
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,640
 - Yeah.

691
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,360
 - What a movie though, it sounds great, hey.

692
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,440
 - Imagine ordering the cheese board at a restaurant

693
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,440
 and you get 12 folks who just love cheese to live at your table.

694
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,040
 (all laughing)

695
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,640
 - I wish I had had the pudding.

696
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,640
 (all laughing)

697
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,560
 - On Monty Python's Life of Brian.

698
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,720
 - Oh yeah.

699
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,960
 - 'Cause it was banned in lots of different local burrows

700
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
 in the UK as James says.

701
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,120
 And in "Thanit" in "Cent" the ban was overturned

702
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,640
 and there were local avas placed in the newspaper saying,

703
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,840
 "Have you seen Monty Python's Life of Brian?"

704
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
 "Thanit District Council have."

705
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,600
 Because they'd had to see it in order to overturn the ban.

706
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,200
 (all laughing)

707
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,920
 I think every film should be avid.

708
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,800
 (all laughing)

709
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,880
 - I was looking at pranking.

710
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,200
 And in the 19th century, electricity-based pranks

711
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
 were really fashionable.

712
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,040
 'Cause they just discovered how to how to sort of wield electricity.

713
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,000
 There were things on sale like electric hammocks.

714
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,520
 You could buy, you lie in a hammock,

715
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,440
 it'd electrocute someone, that's quite fun.

716
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,680
 (all laughing)

717
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,360
 Electric carpets, so someone's walking of your carpet

718
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,720
 and then you could, it's the same idea.

719
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
 - Yeah.

720
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,400
 (all laughing)

721
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,440
 - I read one that was called The Wireless Trick Telephone.

722
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,280
 Did you hear about this one?

723
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
 - Yeah.

724
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,960
 - Okay, The Wireless Trick Telephone.

725
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,120
 This is the description for it.

726
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,560
 When the candidate attempts to answer this phone,

727
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,360
 a 32 caliber blank cartridge will explode

728
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,480
 with a loud report, and at the same time,

729
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,840
 white powder will be blown with a strong blast

730
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
 from the transmitter into his face.

731
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,000
 (all laughing)

732
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,320
 That's a full-on prank.

733
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,440
 And then check this one out.

734
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,320
 The pledge alter, right?

735
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,280
 This, if you bought it, is an alter.

736
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,600
 It's the size of, like, we've all got alters in our home.

737
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,440
 - Exactly.

738
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,280
 (all laughing)

739
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,400
 - A very practical prank that you'd almost do daily.

740
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
 - Is it for Vickers making pranks?

741
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,040
 - It must be right, who's using the pledge alter?

742
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,160
 (all laughing)

743
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,000
 Okay, well, let's picture it as there

744
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,240
 and that it is in the church.

745
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,160
 This is what happens.

746
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,000
 This is the description.

747
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,480
 The candidate kneels before the alter in a darkened room

748
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 and when low, up before him jumps a skeleton

749
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,920
 with large illuminated glaring eyes,

750
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,760
 a blank cartridge is exploding.

751
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,120
 (all laughing)

752
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,600
 A stream of water hits him in the face.

753
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,640
 - An electric shock is shot through his knees.

754
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,440
 (all laughing)

755
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,480
 - April Fool's Day, pretty wild in the 1800s.

756
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
 That's amazing.

757
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,440
 The original thing was about itching powder, wasn't it?

758
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,280
 - Yeah.

759
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,640
 - And in World War II, the British put itching powder

760
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,040
 into German uniforms to try and, you know.

761
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,520
 - I think this isn't the early days

762
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
 when we weren't sure we wanted to go all out.

763
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
 (all laughing)

764
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,720
 - I'm sure we wanted to pull the full pledge alter drink

765
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
 on the Germans.

766
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,400
 (all laughing)

767
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,560
 - Yeah, they called it itchkrieg, I believe, in the business.

768
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,600
 (all laughing)

769
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
 No, they did call it that.

770
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
 - No way.

771
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
 (all laughing)

772
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,800
 - That's amazing.

773
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
 But how do we get access to German uniforms

774
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
 to put itching powder in them?

775
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,040
 - They infiltrated laundries.

776
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,000
 So they had members of the resistance in Germany

777
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,520
 who would go into laundries and then, you know,

778
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,080
 that, well, it's obvious from there.

779
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,600
 (all laughing)

780
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
 But another thing that happened.

781
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,760
 So in Norway, the Norwegian resistance,

782
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,200
 when Norway was taken by the Nazis,

783
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,680
 the resistance coated condoms in itching powder

784
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,760
 and sold them to the Nazis.

785
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,840
 - Wow.

786
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,560
 - Which I think caused problems.

787
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,400
 - Yeah.

788
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
 (all laughing)

789
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,640
 - Be very stimulating for a second.

790
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,280
 (all laughing)

791
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,200
 You're so positive about everything that.

792
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,440
 (all laughing)

793
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,600
 - You know the seven year rich, it's a saying for,

794
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,120
 after seven years in relationship,

795
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,960
 it all goes sour or whatever.

796
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,000
 It seems to be a thing that a lot of scientists

797
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,520
 do studies on to see when the actual time is,

798
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,640
 it's not seven years, it's another time.

799
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,600
 And obviously the newspapers pick up on it.

800
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,160
 There was an article in the Daily Telegraph

801
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,720
 a couple of years ago that said it's actually

802
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,240
 a four year rich, not a seven year rich.

803
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,120
 The Daily Mail seems to go for this almost weekly.

804
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
 (all laughing)

805
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
 They have had various articles over the last few years

806
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,800
 that say, actually, rather than the seven year rich,

807
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,120
 humans have either a 12 year rich, a five year rich,

808
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,400
 an 11 year rich, a 25 year rich, a three year rich,

809
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,480
 an 11 month age, or the most recent one I found

810
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,240
 was a two year six month and 25 day rich.

811
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,480
 (all laughing)

812
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,800
 - I think someone has been supplying the mail HQ

813
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,720
 with these condoms that they've done in the describing.

814
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,120
 It's been a very exciting few years for itch science,

815
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,960
 I think.

816
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,800
 (all laughing)

817
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,960
 I've seen a number of, we've cracked a lot of mysteries

818
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,560
 in the last few years, 2011, they worked out

819
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,320
 why, they've worked out that itching is contagious.

820
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,720
 So that's a big moment. - Yeah.

821
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,080
 - And in 2014, they've worked out

822
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,000
 that scratching makes you want to scratch more.

823
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
 - So when is that contagious?

824
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 Do you mean from one person to another?

825
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,160
 - Yeah, so if I, if you start itching,

826
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,360
 I'll be like, oh, that looks good.

827
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 And then I'll just do it.

828
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,520
 - We've already established your itching fettish.

829
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,520
 (all laughing)

830
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,280
 - The only reason Dan knows so much about itch science

831
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,760
 in the last few years is he subscribes to itch monthly.

832
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,480
 (all laughing)

833
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,320
 Itch good.

834
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,840
 (all laughing)

835
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,120
 You know, in cinemas, I don't know if anyone here

836
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,760
 knows about them, but I'd certainly never heard

837
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,240
 the cinemas used to have crying rooms.

838
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,480
 Do you know about that?

839
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,320
 Yeah, I know.

840
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,840
 So immediately I thought it was for any sort of like

841
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,040
 the wall fans go, I'm not gonna cry here.

842
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,520
 And then suddenly the notebook is really getting to them

843
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,600
 and they're just like, I'm just gonna be gone for a minute

844
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,840
 and they go into this room.

845
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,040
 It turns out it's for babies.

846
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,680
 It's mothers with babies.

847
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
 They would go in there if it was crying.

848
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,720
 So they could continue to watch the movie.

849
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,600
 And it would be just a soundproof room.

850
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,840
 They would have speakers coming in,

851
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
 but they could watch it from in there

852
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,240
 and not have to miss the movie themselves.

853
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,040
 Or fathers, that was really sexist of me,

854
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,480
 fathers and babies.

855
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
 That sounds like such a fantastic thing.

856
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,840
 I quite like the idea of just being individual booths

857
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
 for everyone, so I don't have to be there

858
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,840
 anyone else in the cinemas.

859
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,600
 I think that's called just your bedroom.

860
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,440
 Yeah.

861
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
 Or the CD or parts of Soho.

862
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,600
 There are places where you can do that in.

863
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 We're gonna have to move on.

864
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 We're gonna have to move on.

865
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 We're gonna have to move on.

866
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,080
 (all laughing)

867
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show

868
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,360
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

869
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,720
 My fact this week is that

870
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,240
 defunct sports from the early 20th century

871
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,400
 include archery golf, boxing on horseback

872
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,520
 and competitive flag pole sitting.

873
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,080
 (all laughing)

874
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,280
 This is from a book I read recently

875
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,560
 and it's such a good book.

876
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,400
 I loved it so much.

877
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,160
 It's called Fox Tossing Octopus Wrestling

878
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
 and Other Forgotten Sports

879
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,840
 by Edward Brook Hitching.

880
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,480
 And it is electric.

881
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,120
 It is sort of this list of incredible sports

882
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,560
 that we've forgotten about, so.

883
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,880
 An archery golf just to confirm is archery hyphen golf,

884
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,360
 not archery, comma, golf.

885
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,720
 All right, 'cause you still have those.

886
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,560
 Ah, yes, yes, yes.

887
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,240
 This is where you have golfers and archers

888
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,160
 on the same course at the same time.

889
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
 That's amazing.

890
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,720
 (all laughing)

891
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,960
 'Cause I read an article where there was one person

892
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,000
 the archer was playing against the golfer

893
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,480
 is that there was that the standard way

894
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,880
 you'd have an archer versus a golfer.

895
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,960
 If you archers take a 10-point handicap against golfers,

896
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,840
 'cause obviously they've got a bow and arrow.

897
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
 (all laughing)

898
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,600
 So the archers fire their shots

899
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,120
 and everyone tees off from the same spot except

900
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,640
 the archers are firing towards the,

901
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
 what was it called?

902
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,640
 (all laughing)

903
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,800
 Don't get all technical.

904
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,200
 (all laughing)

905
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,120
 And so for the archers, the hole is something

906
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,320
 like a tennis ball balanced on a tink and you have to hit it.

907
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,240
 And you have three different kinds of arrow that you use.

908
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,480
 You have a light one for the first drive

909
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,120
 and then a really heavy one for the putting.

910
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,520
 Yeah, and people played it until the 1970s as a sport.

911
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,640
 Sounds great.

912
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,560
 How about horse boxing?

913
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,400
 Talk us through that.

914
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,280
 Is that boxing against a horse?

915
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,360
 Yeah, no.

916
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
 Is two guys sitting on the horseback and boxing each other

917
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,000
 and you lose if the other guy knocks you off your horse

918
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,360
 and you're unable to get back on within 10 seconds?

919
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,200
 (all laughing)

920
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,560
 Well, it's similar to chess boxing, right?

921
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,440
 People like to inject boxing, I think,

922
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,240
 into other sports to make other sports more exciting.

923
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,560
 Like chess boxing where you play a round of chess

924
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,720
 and then you do a round of boxing.

925
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,320
 And I think the winner is the person either

926
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,000
 who manages to checkmate the other person

927
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
 or to knock them unconscious.

928
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
 I don't really, it doesn't sound fair that, does it?

929
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,680
 'Cause I'm okay at chess,

930
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,360
 but probably would get knocked out immediately in boxing.

931
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,160
 So you have to get checkedmate pretty fast.

932
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,120
 Well, that's, you've got to be multi-talented.

933
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
 And also, you probably get increasingly worse at chess

934
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,360
 than all you are concussed.

935
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,800
 (all laughing)

936
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,160
 Yeah, but then the other person

937
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,320
 doesn't get worse at boxing the more I put him closer to that area.

938
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,480
 (all laughing)

939
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,120
 If anything, it'll only make him angry.

940
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,120
 (all laughing)

941
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,520
 Just on the horseboxing thing,

942
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,080
 you had to wear boxing gloves, obviously,

943
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,240
 'cause they played by Queen's B rules,

944
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,280
 but that made it very hard to grip the reins.

945
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,120
 So most of the round involved lining your horse up next

946
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,280
 to the other guy's horse.

947
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,480
 (all laughing)

948
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,720
 It's really hard to do with boxing gloves on.

949
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
 Yeah.

950
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,960
 (all laughing)

951
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,440
 So a few other of the sports that was in that book,

952
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,280
 I did have a look through the book and it's amazing.

953
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,720
 Ice tennis, which seems really cool,

954
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,080
 is literally what it says, it is.

955
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,560
 Phone booth stuffing.

956
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,920
 (all laughing)

957
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,840
 And the record is 25,

958
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
 just if anyone wants to go against it.

959
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,920
 Yeah, and flag pole sitting, that's my favorite one.

960
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,760
 Oh, yeah.

961
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,760
 Yeah, because they produced huge celebrities off the back of it.

962
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,600
 (all laughing)

963
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,520
 No, honestly, so there was one guy, in particular,

964
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,280
 called Alvin Shipwreck Kelly.

965
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,160
 So no one's quite sure why he's called Shipwreck,

966
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,640
 other than he claimed to be involved in five shipwrecks.

967
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
 And...

968
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,320
 That's probably why.

969
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
 Well, no, but...

970
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,320
 (all laughing)

971
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,760
 He claimed he'd been on the Titanic.

972
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,680
 Yeah, but people aren't sure about that,

973
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,200
 'cause the passenger records seem to not indicate a hint.

974
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,480
 Yes, yeah.

975
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,960
 His, I don't think you'd let someone

976
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
 call Shipwreck on the Titanic.

977
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,880
 (all laughing)

978
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,400
 He probably gave him a false name.

979
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,560
 John Iceberg Smith, welcome on board.

980
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
 (all laughing)

981
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
 They're all good, mate.

982
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
 Nice to see you.

983
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,840
 But pole sitting genuinely was, I think,

984
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,520
 a proper fad in the 1920s and 30s.

985
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,040
 In America, people were really into it

986
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,560
 and constantly breaking records for it.

987
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,880
 And so I was looking into the British newspaper archive

988
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,000
 during that time and we really disapproved of it.

989
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,680
 Like every single article that references pole sitting

990
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,280
 in America talks about this degrading exhibition

991
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,320
 has now reached the dangerous stage.

992
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,400
 So basically, I mean, the competition is you just sit

993
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
 at the top of a pole for as long as you possibly can

994
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,160
 until it gets uncomfortable and then you come back down.

995
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,240
 We thought poles would be quite spiky at the top.

996
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,400
 They opened up a platform.

997
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,920
 I mean, I don't know what to do with that.

998
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,240
 It's really, really tiny, you know?

999
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,000
 Yeah, but, you know...

1000
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 (all laughing)

1001
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,160
 Frozen balls, guys.

1002
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
 (all laughing)

1003
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,040
 71 hours was the record in the Don D'Courier

1004
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,320
 that was reported.

1005
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,720
 Well, Shipwreck Kelly supposedly sat on it

1006
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,200
 for 49 days and one hour.

1007
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,040
 Yeah, that's good.

1008
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

1009
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,280
 It's very much the Tiger Woods of pole sitting there.

1010
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,520
 (all laughing)

1011
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,800
 He did a 28 city tour of sitting on poles.

1012
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,840
 And he did a tour and he charged people with roof access

1013
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,680
 so that they could see him at the top of his pole.

1014
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,000
 So you bought tickets to the roof of buildings

1015
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,600
 and you could watch him doing it.

1016
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,800
 He did it all through his life.

1017
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,960
 That's it, David Blaney, isn't it?

1018
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
 Yeah, exactly.

1019
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,800
 Yeah.

1020
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
 And he, for sleeping, obviously,

1021
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
 'cause you would have to sleep a bit.

1022
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,240
 He would cut holes into the side of the flagpole

1023
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,840
 and put his fingers in there.

1024
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,600
 And then if he slept and he started to sag right down,

1025
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,400
 it would hurt his fingers and he'd sort of, you know,

1026
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,560
 stay up there.

1027
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,400
 Like that.

1028
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,240
 Yeah, keep him up.

1029
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,080
 Keep him up there.

1030
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
 It's a not career choice, isn't it?

1031
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
 It is, yeah.

1032
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,640
 He died, you know, broke many years after the glory days.

1033
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 Yeah, exactly.

1034
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 His career went downhill.

1035
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,160
 He got hit by a car.

1036
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,720
 And he, so he died from being hit by this car

1037
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,960
 and they found on him a scrapbook of his life.

1038
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,320
 And it was called, the title was, "The luckiest fool on earth."

1039
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,800
 Ooh, ironic.

1040
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
 Yeah.

1041
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,360
 I want to know, the name of this book

1042
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,840
 was octopus, something, and fox tossing.

1043
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,600
 What's fox tossing?

1044
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,040
 You have an arena, right?

1045
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,440
 And you get men and women lined up opposite each other.

1046
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,800
 And you're all holding long, long strips of cloth,

1047
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,440
 loose and slack on the ground.

1048
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,160
 You release a load of foxes into the arena.

1049
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,320
 When they run over the bit that you're holding,

1050
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,800
 you and your partner pull it taut,

1051
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,080
 and the fox flies into the air.

1052
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,440
 That was a genuine sport that the aristocracy played

1053
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,600
 in the 17th century in Europe.

1054
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,040
 And the fun was in seeing the foxes die.

1055
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,520
 The fun was in seeing the foxes fly through the air.

1056
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,160
 I think that's biostroporting.

1057
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,720
 Well, we're not all as wholesome as you, Anna.

1058
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,920
 I read an article about that, and the end of the article

1059
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,200
 said it was not unknown for the terrified animals

1060
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,560
 to turn on the tosses.

1061
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1062
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,640
 There was a spot in ancient Egypt called Fisherman's

1063
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,600
 Jousting.

1064
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,080
 It was really popular.

1065
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,040
 And you would basically get people in boats,

1066
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
 and they were joust against each other,

1067
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,560
 trying to knock each other off the boat.

1068
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,320
 And it took place on the Nile.

1069
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,880
 But of course, the worst thing about the Nile

1070
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,920
 is it's full of crocodiles.

1071
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
 And because the crocodiles were sacred,

1072
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,600
 it was illegal to fight back.

1073
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,520
 [LAUGHTER]

1074
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,640
 That'll get you anywhere.

1075
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,000
 You'll be in big trouble, mister,

1076
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,120
 if you fight back against the crocodile that's eating you.

1077
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,240
 [LAUGHTER]

1078
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,920
 What legal sanction exactly can we work?

1079
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
 It's true.

1080
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,720
 It's a very much a no-win situation, isn't it?

1081
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1082
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,360
 Do you know the national sport of Afghanistan?

1083
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,320
 No.

1084
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,840
 Is goat dragging?

1085
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,200
 But Buzz Cashy, which is played in countries

1086
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,320
 across Central Asia, but it's like Polo,

1087
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,400
 but with instead of a ball, a headless goat.

1088
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,560
 So the goat's been stied already, and you've removed the head.

1089
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,040
 Yeah, it's been stied already once you've removed the head.

1090
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1091
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,360
 I know.

1092
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,720
 I said that in the right order, I think.

1093
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,680
 It died, then you removed the head.

1094
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
 And then you have to drag it towards a goal,

1095
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,800
 and then throw it through a goal.

1096
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,360
 I don't know why you'd use a goat instead of a ball,

1097
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,400
 maybe they're short and balls.

1098
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,160
 But that's the national sport of Afghanistan.

1099
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,680
 They love it.

1100
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,120
 Well, we would have used a pig splatter for soccer,

1101
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,840
 and black in the old days.

1102
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,040
 Not an entire pig, though.

1103
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,840
 No.

1104
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,800
 It's much more unwieldy.

1105
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,480
 And mill all, apparently, they do, though.

1106
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,040
 I don't know if you know about that.

1107
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
 Can I tell you a bit more about flag poles?

1108
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,560
 Yeah.

1109
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,280
 Just the flag-positing thing.

1110
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
 So I think the all-time champion of flag-pole setting

1111
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,320
 was a saint called Simion Stylites, who lived up a pole

1112
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,680
 for 36 years.

1113
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,800
 And he started with a flag-pole six feet off the ground.

1114
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,120
 Oh, sorry, not a flag-pole, but just

1115
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,240
 a little platform on a pole.

1116
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,360
 And then he went to a higher one, until he eventually

1117
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,160
 was 60 feet up in the air.

1118
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,840
 Why aren't you just--

1119
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,640
 He lived up there.

1120
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,000
 And I read a book about early Christianity

1121
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,600
 about this guy, and as it says, what was he doing?

1122
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,080
 There are lots of theories as to why he did it.

1123
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,640
 Either he found the crowds who approached him asking

1124
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,720
 for wisdom and advice to exhausting.

1125
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,520
 Or he-- I read one theory that he wanted to be physically

1126
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,360
 closer to Christ, because Christ is in the sky.

1127
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,680
 Or he wanted just a more Spartan existence

1128
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,040
 than he could get in a monastery.

1129
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,240
 And his Wikipedia page says, "It has been stated that,

1130
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,720
 as he seemed to be unable to avoid escaping the world horizontally,

1131
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,920
 he may have thought to attempt to try to escape it vertically."

1132
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,160
 Nobody says what he did with his poo, though.

1133
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,000
 Because he'd have to drop it off, wouldn't he?

1134
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,800
 He just threw it, held it at those irritating people,

1135
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,000
 constantly asking him for advice down at the bottom.

1136
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,960
 Because he still has followers, doesn't he?

1137
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,520
 I think his most well-known followers,

1138
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,960
 guy called Maxime Cav Taradze, and he's a 59-year-old monk,

1139
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,160
 and he's been living on a stone pillar in Georgia,

1140
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,720
 and he comes down once a week.

1141
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,280
 But he spends basically his entire life up on top of this pillar.

1142
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,920
 He climbs his hundred and thirty-one foot ladder.

1143
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,200
 He has to have staff who pull by a pulley system his food

1144
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,520
 and supplies up to him.

1145
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,200
 So these people need to be well-stuffed.

1146
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,480
 And yeah, he dropped down twice a week to give some advice

1147
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,880
 to his following message, and then he pops back up onto the pillar

1148
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
 and hangs out there.

1149
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,200
 What a good man.

1150
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,480
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

1151
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,120
 So have we got anything thrown in before we go?

1152
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,760
 The current setting up a poll competition record

1153
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
 is held by a poll.

1154
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,320
 That's all.

1155
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,400
 [LAUGHTER]

1156
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,000
 His name is Daniel Baraniuk, and he is from Poland.

1157
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,280
 [LAUGHTER]

1158
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,760
 196 days for fans who are in.

1159
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
 OK, we are going to have to wrap up.

1160
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,040
 That is it.

1161
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
 That is all of our facts.

1162
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,280
