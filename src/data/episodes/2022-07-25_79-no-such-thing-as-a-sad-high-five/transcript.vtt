00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 (phone ringing)

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.500
 - Can I look at it, put it on like this.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.080
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.880
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.720
 This week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.080
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.040
 I'm joined once again by the three other elves.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.120
 Please welcome to the stage.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.280
 It's Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.280
 (audience cheering)

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.660
 And once again, we have gathered around

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.740
 Starting with my fact this week,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.460
 my fact this week is that the current French Scrabble Champion

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.440
 doesn't speak a word of French.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.940
 (audience laughing)

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.860
 This was in the news not too long ago,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.200
 so I feel like some people know it,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.360
 but I just found that absolutely amazing.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880
 Did he just randomly play letters

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.720
 which all turned out to be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.840
 except the French Scrabble dictionary?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.440
 He memorized the French Scrabble dictionary,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 and then he just used that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.520
 And even in the finals, he told the French guy,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 that's not a word.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 (audience laughing)

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 Yeah, it's amazing character.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.400
 Yeah, his name's Nigel Richards, he's from New Zealand.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 - Oh wow.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480
 (audience laughing)

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.080
 - I read an article about him on shortlist.com

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.260
 entitled, "Why Nigel Richards is better than Lionel Messi?"

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.380
 (audience laughing)

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.680
 - Well, they do call him the Tiger Woods Scrabble, don't they?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 'Cause we should stress he is not known to be an adulterer.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.600
 (audience laughing)

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 I've read a thing a guy who's written a book about Scrabble,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 he's a sort of Scrabble expert,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.920
 he's called Stefan Fatzis, and he said,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.960
 "Right now, Richards is," or I'm quoting here,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.480
 "like Tiger Woods at his peak,"

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.760
 and then Tiger saying, "I think I'll also take up tennis

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.160
 "and then winning Wimbledon the next year."

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.520
 - Wow, yeah.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 - Did he engulf people call Tiger Woods

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.320
 the Nigel Richards of golf?

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.160
 - Yes.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.000
 (audience laughing)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.160
 - What happened?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.960
 - I saw an interview with him on YouTube,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840
 and they asked what the secret is,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.600
 and he said, "I'm not sure there is a secret,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.480
 "it's just a matter of learning all the words."

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.000
 (audience laughing)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.160
 I was not secret anymore.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 (audience laughing)

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.600
 And apparently he's read the 1,953 page

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.480
 Chambers Dictionary five times,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.760
 and memorized every single word in the dictionary.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.440
 - Wow.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.600
 Apparently, you're at more of an advantage.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.560
 Scrabble players say, "When you don't speak

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.360
 "the language that you're playing in."

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.080
 - I bet it's the French who said that, is it?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.320
 (audience laughing)

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.280
 - No, it's, apparently it's more about memorizing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 the coding of it, the mathematics of it.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 You look at it, like you look at a,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.320
 I don't know, a big--

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.680
 - I mean, certainly what you do need to do

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.200
 is know all the two letter words

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.440
 'cause they're the most useful ones,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.680
 and most of them aren't really real words.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.480
 They're just like two letters put together.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.320
 - No, no, no, no.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.160
 - Like real is common, too, like a word.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.480
 I think it's the most common, too, like a word.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.320
 - Yeah.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.240
 - The most commonly used word in all of Scrabble.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.480
 - Is, is, uh, Chi, which is about QI.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840
 (audience laughing)

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.520
 Do you want to hear a move that Richard's made in 1998?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
 - Yeah.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.400
 - You do.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 (audience laughing)

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.240
 Right.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.400
 - It's 1998.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.320
 (audience laughing)

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320
 I've set the scene.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.240
 (audience laughing)

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.800
 So he was, he was pretty new at the time

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 to competitive Scrabble,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 and he had C, D, H, L, R, N, and then a blank tile.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.640
 - Children.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.480
 - There was an E on the board,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.400
 and he could have played that,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 and he used up all seven letters

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.040
 and got a 50 point bonus, like an idiot.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.880
 - Oh.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880
 (audience laughing)

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.240
 - Instead, he found two O's and an E,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.400
 which were all in line on the board,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.680
 not connected to each other,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.160
 and played all of his letters to make the ten letter

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.960
 chloradine.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.760
 - Oh my God.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.600
 - Yeah.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.440
 - That is like a dream,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.280
 'cause you always want to connect all of those

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.320
 vertical columns, but it never works.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.160
 - Wow.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.520
 - And he only loved the game at the age of 28,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.200
 and his mother introduced it to him,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.360
 and she said, this is her words.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.280
 I said, I know a game you're not going to be very good at.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.960
 (audience laughing)

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.400
 Because you can't spell very well,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.520
 and you won't very good at English at school.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.520
 (audience laughing)

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520
 Unfortunately, here's a mathematical genius,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.120
 so you can't see all the, you just see it, yeah.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.600
 - But another Scrabble move that's been made

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.840
 was in the first ever World Scrabble Championships

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.560
 in the early '90s.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.000
 There was a winner, but the person who was runner up,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.440
 the reason he lost was because one of the last words he played,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.120
 and sometimes, you know, even if you've got a few letters left,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 you take a pun on a word that you hope exists,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.360
 'cause there are lots of weird words,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.520
 and the first word he played,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 the last word he played was the word "smail",

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 as in "snail" with an "m" in the hope that that could

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.240
 get him some points, and it couldn't,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.080
 but now that "smail" is an anagram of another word,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.320
 which gets points.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.160
 - Mails?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.120
 - Yeah, so he couldn't have played males,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.040
 and he lost the Scrabble Championship,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.040
 because he played "smail" instead.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.480
 (laughter)

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480
 - You want to do it?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.320
 - You want to do it?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320
 - You want to do it?

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.840
 - It's like, that's awful.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.360
 - He's very much the today's Tiger Woods of Scrabble.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.080
 (laughter)

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.880
 - Do you guys know about the inventor of Scrabble?

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.040
 - He was cut.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.720
 - Yes, Alfred Butts, which is just a lovely surname.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.200
 - Alfred Mosher Butts was his middle name, not his nickname, right?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.080
 - Yeah, and he only revealed a few days before

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 he died.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.320
 He lived until quite old.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.040
 He was 93, I think.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.800
 He said that he was a bad speller, and everyone was like,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.760
 "That's hilarious," and then he died.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.120
 It was less hilarious.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120
 (laughter)

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 But on his tombstone, it said, "R.P.I."

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.120
 (laughter)

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.280
 - Mm-hmm.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.880
 - Yeah, so he invented Scrabble.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.720
 He called it it originally.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.080
 I had another name for it, and then someone bought it off him

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.520
 and turned it into Scrabble, so when we use this word,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.760
 and so he had that whole thing of the difficult second album,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.040
 and he actually released the game, and it was called...

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.280
 Oh, sorry, I've lost it now.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.680
 - I know what it was called. - Yeah, what's it called?

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.200
 - Alfred's Other Game.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.600
 - That's it.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.680
 - His follow-up to Scrabble was called Alfred's Other Game.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.280
 - No one knew who Alfred was. - No one knew who Alfred was.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.680
 - To know anything about it, because no one's ever bought it

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.480
 as far as I can tell, except four reviewers

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.360
 who reviewed it online, all of them say,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.880
 "It's like Solitaire, but it involves two players,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.160
 "but the two players don't interact with each other at all."

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.440
 So I think it's basically two Solitaire sets,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.920
 and you're just supposed to sit next to someone

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.600
 while you do them. - Right.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.000
 - Yeah, he wasted a lot of his talent on the first one, I think.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.360
 So he decided the points for Scrabble, based on...

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.320
 He studied the front page of the New York Times

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520
 over a series of months, didn't he?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.560
 And then logged the frequency of certain letters

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.000
 in the New York Times that appeared,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.960
 and decided the point scores based on that.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.800
 So a lot of people now think we should change it.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.200
 - I wonder if he counted the letters in New York Times,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.920
 which appeared every single day.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.200
 That is such a good point. - Yeah.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.120
 - And that's why why isn't worth as much as it should be.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.200
 - That's probably why I'm so bad at Scrabble.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.280
 Yeah, and actually, if you're playing it in another language,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.320
 it's not just the words, it's also the letters

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.040
 of worth different amounts, so that must be pretty hard.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.960
 In Polish, a Z is worth one point.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.720
 Although a Z with an accent on it is worth 10 points.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.000
 - Really? - Yeah, that's weird.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.920
 In Ukrainian, an apostrophe is worth 10 points.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.160
 (laughing)

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.680
 But in Armenian, the board is 17 by 17,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.560
 instead of 15 by 15, 'cause they have longer words.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.840
 And they also have loads of letters that I've never heard of.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.480
 So for one point, the letters "yeck" and "khen".

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.280
 For two points, the letter "men".

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.760
 For three points, the letter "ben".

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.400
 And for four points, the letter "ra".

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.680
 (laughing)

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.520
 I assume that's how you pronounce these "ra".

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.120
 - Well, did you see the "gur" has been added

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.360
 to the official Scrabble Dictionary in the last update,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.600
 which was made in 2011.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.240
 The words "gur" "thang" and "blingy" have been added

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.640
 to the Scrabble Dictionary.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.920
 You can now play those.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.800
 There's this huge wall between the Americans

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.880
 and everyone else, because...

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.040
 - Classic wall there, probably.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.760
 - So, we'll, as you guys know, use the OSPD,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.320
 the official Scrabble Dictionary, when we're playing Scrabble,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.320
 and we've actually combined that with the OSW,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.840
 the official Scrabble word list.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.800
 But the US refuses to do that,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.800
 and keeps on using its own dictionary, the tournament word list,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.720
 which is a completely different list of what...

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.480
 I mean, there's probably some overlap.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.320
 (laughing)

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.120
 - I mean, as long as both have "thang", I'm happy.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.080
 (laughing)

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.960
 - But yeah, people get very angry about this.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.440
 - Well, they don't like swear words in the American one.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.640
 - I don't know, they've banned this.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.240
 - Yeah, they've banned all swear words,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.440
 and ESPN decided to put the Scrabble Championships

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.440
 onto their channel.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.880
 But they had a thing where they said, "These are the lists."

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.440
 I think it was about 170 words.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.360
 They said, "You can't say this on television.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.440
 "You can do this in normal Scrabble competition,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.240
 "but you can't do this on television."

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.480
 But so, what they did was the first 30 rounds

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.720
 of the competition, they could use all the rude words

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.760
 that were banned.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.600
 And then when it got to the televised bit,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.800
 they couldn't do it anymore.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.320
 - That's pretty bad that they were allowed it

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.560
 for half of the tournament, and then not afterwards.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.600
 'Cause what about someone like me

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.520
 who only ever plays rude words in Scrabble?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520
 (laughing)

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.360
 I'm gonna be nailing it halfway through,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.920
 and then I'm gonna be absolutely useless

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.680
 as on TV as well.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.200
 I will be using a lot of those words,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.040
 but not on the board.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 (laughing)

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.960
 - I'm gonna have to move it on in a few minutes.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.680
 So if anyone's got anything else,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.800
 there's a very cool thing about Scrabble in Senegal

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.120
 where it's an official sport,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.480
 and they take it so seriously,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.600
 and Senegal hosted the French Scrabble World Championship

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.760
 in 2008.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.920
 So this was before Richard's won.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.320
 But the Senegalese government composed

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.880
 an official song to mark the occasion,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.800
 and I read this in an article about it

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.160
 that in Senegal, you can buy a set of Scrabble

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.760
 on most street corners,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.000
 (laughing)

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.600
 which I can't quite believe, but I want to believe.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.800
 And I'm never gonna go to Senegal

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.200
 in case it turns out not to be true.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.320
 (laughing)

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.000
 - Comes free with your bag of crack.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.080
 Just to Scrabble dials.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080
 (laughing)

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.600
 I was on some online chat forums,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.000
 just separate to work.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.240
 And it was one of those,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.320
 I was just taking a break.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.280
 And it was, you know, it was like a Yahoo,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.320
 answers thing or something,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.120
 and it was a parent who said,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.280
 this is literally what it read,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.760
 "Hmm, my seven-year-old just swallowed a Scrabble dial.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.960
 "No, wait, it's a banana-grams-tile."

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.720
 He tells me, "Anyone have an experience with this?"

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.240
 (laughing)

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.680
 I mean, it is exactly the same

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.280
 a banana-grams-tile to a Scrabble-tile.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.600
 I guess she meant to specify not--

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.920
 - Probably just like make another tile out of cardboard

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.760
 and use that.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.000
 (laughing)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.480
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.160
 and that is James Harkin.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.080
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the world's only

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.400
 venomous frogs headbutt their enemies to death.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.360
 (laughing)

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.520
 - They're very little known species from Millwall.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.280
 (laughing)

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.160
 - And you Googled Violent Football Team, didn't you?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.400
 You've got no idea what you just said.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.640
 (laughing)

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.280
 - And I'll never go, in case it turns out to be true.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.080
 (laughing)

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.560
 - I think that's very safe.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.960
 So yeah, you get a lot of frogs which are poisonous,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.760
 which means if you eat them, you would be sick.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.760
 But these are venomous, so they stick the poison

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.680
 into the body of their prey.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.680
 And they are called Apparas Venodon Brunoi

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.160
 and Cory Philmante's Greening Eye.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.960
 And they have really flexible necks

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.560
 and really pointy skulls, and they have poison on their skulls.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.680
 Actually, a single gram of venom from the first one

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.360
 of those frogs would be enough to kill 80 people.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.000
 - Wow, 80, so they're proper hardcore

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.760
 and they're only little guys as well.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.760
 (laughing)

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.600
 - Wow.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.240
 - And have you heard of the Harry frog?

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.080
 - No.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080
 - So the Harry frog does this thing

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.680
 that when it's getting to a fight,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.200
 it will break its toe bones to snap them,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.640
 which is always intimidating to see someone doing that

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.560
 when you're in a fight with them.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.760
 And they start breaking themselves before they go for you.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.320
 So they'll just snap their toes off.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.400
 And then they push their toe bones through their skin,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.560
 like Wolverine, like, and they just come out

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.000
 and they go, do you want some?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.200
 And then it's the most aggressive fighting I've ever heard of.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.840
 - Andy, I don't know if you know this is exactly

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.960
 what they do in Millwall.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.880
 (laughing)

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.600
 - Also, sea cucumbers, just while we're

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.560
 on the kind of fighting defense thing,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.160
 they shoot their internal organs out through their ass hole.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.320
 - So, sorry, Andy hates what they say

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.560
 where it's like that, I don't know.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.640
 - That's why you two never place grubbles together.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.720
 (laughing)

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.920
 - Yeah, imagine that, shooting bits of your body

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.560
 out through your ass, that's quite crazy.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.600
 - Yeah, I can regrow them afterwards.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.280
 They can regrow them and the idea is

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.880
 that the predators will eat the stuff that's come out

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.960
 and they won't eat the cucumber themselves.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.880
 But actually, they also have a fish

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.640
 that live inside the renaces called slender pearl fish.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.800
 So that must be pretty bad for those fish

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.960
 who are just sitting in a nice little home

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.840
 and suddenly everything gets ejected out.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.400
 (laughing)

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.480
 - A nice little home.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.160
 Oh, we've got it great, haven't we?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
 (laughing)

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.640
 Look at our anus.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.920
 - We've got a nice two up two down anus.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.280
 (laughing)

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.960
 - We're really hoping to move to a bigger anus

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.800
 in the country.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.480
 (laughing)

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.080
 - So, there's two on a gist, were in Ecuador recently.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.360
 And they spotted this frog that was obviously

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.240
 a new species 'cause it was like covered in spikes

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.320
 that they'd never seen before.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.360
 So they're like, this is really exciting.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.640
 And they spotted it around a way.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.400
 So they spent years and years in Ecuador

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.680
 looking for this frog again.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.600
 And they eventually found it.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.240
 I think this year or last year, and they got it

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.680
 and they put it in a jar overnight.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.880
 And I will deal with that tomorrow, you know,

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.960
 classified or whatever.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.160
 Came downstairs in the morning

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.680
 and all of its spikes had gone.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.760
 And so the geologist, the female geologist said,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.080
 "I thought I must have just picked up the wrong frog."

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.920
 (laughing)

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.600
 And so I was very disappointed.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.960
 But I just, you know, as she said,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.240
 I laid down some moss so it would be comfortable in there.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.960
 And then I decided to take it back out into the wild the next day.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.800
 And then the next day the spikes were back.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.160
 And it became apparent that this is a shape-shifting frog,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.520
 the first known shape-shifting amphibian.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.880
 - Well, do we know if they can turn into princes?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.200
 (audience laughing)

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.040
 I read that in a scientific manual.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.120
 (laughing)

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.000
 There was, when Disney released the princess and the frog,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.200
 more than 50 children were hospitalised with cell manella

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.560
 from trying to kiss frogs.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.400
 - Wow.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.320
 - Just play banana grams with them like normal.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.160
 Much better.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:25.080
 In 2008 some scientists found a frog with no lungs.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.760
 So this is really, really cool.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.440
 It's called Barbara Ruler Kalim Mantanensis.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.280
 Don't write in.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.840
 And it hadn't been dissected before

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.760
 because they only had two specimens of it.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.920
 And they didn't want to destroy

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.200
 the only two specimens they had.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.640
 So nobody suspected that it wouldn't have lungs.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.240
 And then they found another one and they thought,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.600
 well, let's dissect it.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.840
 - And sucks to be the third frog.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.680
 (laughing)

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.800
 - The early bird catches the worm.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.000
 And the second mouse gets the cheating.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.720
 The third frog is dissected.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.200
 (laughing)

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.360
 But it gets all its oxygen through its skin.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.200
 It's so cool.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.280
 And the really, really cool thing is that

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.480
 it actively threw away its own lungs.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.880
 As then it used to have lungs

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.120
 and then it thought, I don't need these.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.560
 (laughing)

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.560
 And because it saves space on lungs in its body,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.400
 it's a bit slimmer and flatter.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.960
 So it has a bigger surface area.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.440
 So it can absorb more oxygen proportional to its size.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.240
 - Well, that's like there's the scrotum frog,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.160
 which does quite a similar thing.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.400
 Yeah, the scrotum frog is cool that

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.840
 because it just has incredibly floppy skin.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.280
 So it's got these really tiny lungs

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.720
 that can't really take much, but it got way too much skin.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.040
 And so it's loads of surface area.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.120
 And so it looks like a scrotum.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.320
 So obviously it's far too much skin, it's kind of gross.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.960
 (laughing)

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.520
 But it does help it respire.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.280
 - Can I do some stuff on headbutting?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.800
 - Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.000
 - So a Welsh police force has trained its dogs

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.640
 to disable their targets by leaping at them

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.000
 and delivering a flying headbutt rather than biting them.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.640
 (laughing)

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.200
 And this is because people were being bitten by police dogs

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.360
 and kind of getting compensation or whatever

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.760
 and they thought, well, a better way of doing it

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.840
 is just having them attacking the people with their heads.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.840
 - I read that if cats headbutt you,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.040
 this is what the scientist report I saw said.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.720
 (laughing)

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.960
 That when cats headbutt you,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.680
 it's the equivalent of them giving you a high five.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.680
 (laughing)

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.800
 - And that's like the science you say.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.160
 - Yeah, that's from my way.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.960
 They just come over and they're just going,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.640
 "Yeah, man, you're all right."

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.720
 - That's a loose definition of the equivalent of a high five.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.040
 I mean, so they rub against you to express affection.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.760
 - Can I take it up with science, eh?

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.360
 (laughing)

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.000
 - My five can signify so much.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.960
 - Joy, sorrow, affection, sorrow, high five.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.800
 (laughing)

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.120
 - That's the last time I take you to a funeral.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.880
 (laughing)

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.520
 - Just one more thing about headbutt's Bedfordshire Council,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.000
 apparently, according to this newspaper article I read,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.800
 they banned local artists from displaying paintings

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.840
 behind glass and there were a few different reasons they gave,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.800
 but one of them was that someone might

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.240
 headbutt a picture and cut themselves.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.680
 - Who's going around art gallery's headbutting pictures?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.080
 - The Millwall fans day out.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.920
 (laughing)

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.200
 - Oh my God, I'm sorry I even mentioned Millwall.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.200
 (laughing)

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.360
 - Actually, have you read that the headbutting record world record

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.280
 has recently been set, recently been reset and beaten?

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.160
 And by quite some way, so...

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.600
 - Wait, wait, wait, what, to do what?

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.440
 - Also, this is what you have to do.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.400
 You have to crack walnuts with your head.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.320
 And so the record previously was 44 walnuts,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.920
 so you lay walnuts out on a table.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.640
 You just bash, bash, bash.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.200
 44 walnuts held by an American.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.600
 And then this Pakistani guy called Muhammad Rashid

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.760
 has reset the record and he cracked 155 walnuts

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.480
 within the space of a minute.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.240
 - A minute? - One minute, yeah.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.600
 - He's the tiger woods, oh.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.440
 (laughing)

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.840
 - Competitive headbutting.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.640
 (laughing)

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.040
 - I just like to say that Mr Rashid

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040
 is not an adulterer.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.280
 (laughing)

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.760
 - That's what, two and a half, a second?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.600
 Is that right? - Yeah.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.440
 - Can I be right?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.800
 - But is he smashing a big bunch of them

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.640
 or are they all in a line?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.480
 - No, no, they're in a line.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.320
 You're gonna do one at a time.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.400
 - Wow, yeah.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.160
 - I couldn't do that with a hammer.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.960
 - No, I know, that's why you're not even...

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.400
 - You're not even anywhere near the competition.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.840
 - That's why I failed to place.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.000
 (laughing)

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.280
 - A turned up with a hammer, B.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.160
 (laughing)

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160
 - It did not break records.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.760
 (laughing)

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.160
 - We're gonna have to move on in a minute.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.520
 Any last, before we go?

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.160
 - Just, did you hear,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.880
 do you remember reading in 2005

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.880
 about the exploding frog freak out in Hamburg?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.000
 - It's so amazing.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.080
 - It's so weird.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.600
 So there was suddenly,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.840
 this started happening in Hamburg.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.640
 Thousands of frogs started exploding

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.960
 and, you know, spattering their entrails,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.680
 all over the streets and their entrails would spatter up

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.240
 to like a meter wide.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.800
 And people didn't know why they were doing this.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.800
 And there were these weird theories flying around

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.640
 about what was going on.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.800
 So some of those hot frogs

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.080
 were just starting to commit mass suicide

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.680
 for no apparent reason.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.280
 Someone else thought they'd caught a virus

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.680
 from race horses.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.000
 Go on, James.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.840
 - Just wondering where the horse racing theory came from.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.880
 - Yeah, the horse exploding scandal in Hamburg

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.200
 the week before was...

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.360
 (laughing)

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.840
 I can't believe I didn't mention that.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.360
 So what actually happened?

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.480
 So what happened was, it turned out it was crows.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.600
 So crows had figured out

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.960
 that you can't eat the whole toad

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.640
 because it's skin is poisonous.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.320
 And so, you know, you die.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.840
 But you can pierce the skin

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.120
 and the only good bit of a frog,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.440
 any food connoisseur knows is the liver anyway.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.640
 You suck the liver out.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.480
 And then what happens is,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.480
 the liver of these toads

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.400
 is what's keeping all their organs in.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.240
 And so they end up like,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.560
 they puff up in defense

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.400
 and all their organs start exploding out of their body.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.240
 - Wow.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.080
 - Yeah.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.520
 - But the crows have a nice bit of foie gras

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.680
 and aren't poisoned.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.280
 So it depends who's side you're on.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.480
 (laughing)

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.520
 - Okay, we're gonna move on to our next act.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.640
 Time for fact, number three.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.640
 And that is Juzinski.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.840
 - Oh yeah, my effect is that

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.080
 when the film All Quiet on the Western Front

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.520
 was released in Germany,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.880
 Gubbles went to see it at the cinema.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.400
 And within 10 minutes, he'd release stink bombs,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.920
 itching powder and white mice

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.360
 in order to scare everyone out of the cinema.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.920
 So this was fun guy, Gubbles.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.160
 (laughing)

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.800
 Everyone's favorite clown.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.760
 (laughing)

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.720
 - So he did it 10 minutes in.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.960
 - He started doing it at the start,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.880
 but he wrote in his diary.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.240
 He kept 10,000 pages of diary entries, which my god.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.320
 And one of his pages related how he started doing it.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.240
 Within 10 minutes, the whole cinema was in chaos.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.480
 People were running away, itching themselves,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.520
 you know, fainting with the smell.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.640
 - Yeah, they really didn't like that movie, did they?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.200
 'Cause it was the fact that the German soldiers

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.920
 died in a not brave way,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.480
 and the French soldiers did die in a more brave way.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.320
 - Yeah.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.160
 - So it got banned.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.560
 But then ironically in Poland,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.960
 it also got banned because it was pro-German.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.800
 - Yeah.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.680
 - So Germany banned it for being anti-German

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.440
 and Poland banned it for being pro-German.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440
 - What's pretty crazy as well?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.640
 So I was reading the IMDB page for it today,

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.840
 and in the little trivia bit,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.400
 they were saying that a lot of the extras in the movie

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.920
 were actual German soldiers from World War I,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.680
 who had moved over to America,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.120
 who they said were doing this thing,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.800
 and we just want to know about how you would march and so on,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.600
 and the uniforms, can we have the better look,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.440
 and they all said, "I'd love to be in the film."

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.200
 And so a lot of the German soldiers in it,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.880
 are actual German soldiers from World War I.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.800
 Pretty crazy, pretty bold casting.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.240
 So the intervention that was kind of,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.240
 I think you had a lot of brown shirts or the essay,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.800
 with the brown shirts, to disrupt the...

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.720
 - Yeah, to freak people out, yeah.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.960
 - And then it was, I think it was banned

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.160
 shortly afterwards in Germany.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160
 - It was banned, yes.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.240
 All the Nazis came to power, it was, I think it was 19...

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.520
 - Yeah, it was, it was 2030, and so.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520
 - 2030.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.200
 - But you know, they were already a thing.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.320
 - So yeah, he brought the brown shirts in,

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.800
 and it was banned, and the writer of the original book,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.120
 who was called...

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.960
 - Remark.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.480
 - Remark had to leave the country,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.920
 and then he was in fight, so he was told he had to leave,

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.400
 'cause he was in this unpatriotic book,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.280
 and turned into an unpatriotic film.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.240
 And then, girl was obviously rethought that,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.840
 and wrote him a few months later,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.480
 and said, "Actually, no, no, honestly, come back.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.320
 "Do come back."

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320
 But at this point, you know,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.240
 people were starting to get the hang of the whole Nazis,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.280
 not being good guys idea, and so,

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.360
 Remark wrote back and said, "What, 65 million people

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 "want to get out of the country,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.680
 "and I'm supposed to come back of my own free will,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.280
 "not on your life," and he never returned,

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.160
 which is probably a good move.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.120
 He was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for that.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.960
 - Who was?

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.320
 - Remark, for the film.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.920
 So, it's quite cool.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.160
 You can go on the Nobel Peace Prize website,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.120
 and look at all the nominations that were more than 50 years ago

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.240
 when they've been released.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.880
 And that saved me in 1931,

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.720
 he was nominated for writing all quiet on the Western Front.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.720
 Also, the government of Finland was nominated.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.240
 - That's it. - I don't know why.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.880
 Yeah.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.360
 Just really peace-loving guys back then.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.200
 Yeah.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.120
 - Not like now when we're all living out of the Finnish jackboot.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.120
 (all laughing)

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.520
 - I have a few things about censorship and stuff.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.360
 - Yeah.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.360
 - There was a British council

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.960
 who banned the life of Brian,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.640
 even though they had no cinemas in their boundaries.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.240
 (all laughing)

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.240
 - And in 1999, the censors in Bournemouth

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.400
 asked to see a sexually explicit French film

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.960
 with a view to banning it,

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.120
 even though no cinema had expressed any interest in showing it.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.880
 (all laughing)

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.520
 - Wasn't the first everything not banned,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.520
 but censored in the film industry in this country

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.960
 was the cheese board.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.800
 - Yeah.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.360
 - Sorry, it's not an actual cheese board.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.200
 It's like a group of people who talk about cheese a lot.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.760
 And there was a movie that came out where they showed,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.000
 I think it was close up on cheese and all the bacteria and stuff,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.480
 so they asked for it to be censored.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.800
 And it was censored.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.800
 It was the first to ask and get of censorship in cinemas.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.640
 - Yeah.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.360
 - What a movie though, it sounds great, hey.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.440
 - Imagine ordering the cheese board at a restaurant

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.440
 and you get 12 folks who just love cheese to live at your table.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.040
 (all laughing)

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.640
 - I wish I had had the pudding.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.640
 (all laughing)

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.560
 - On Monty Python's Life of Brian.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.960
 - 'Cause it was banned in lots of different local burrows

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.760
 in the UK as James says.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.120
 And in "Thanit" in "Cent" the ban was overturned

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.640
 and there were local avas placed in the newspaper saying,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.840
 "Have you seen Monty Python's Life of Brian?"

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.240
 "Thanit District Council have."

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.600
 Because they'd had to see it in order to overturn the ban.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.200
 (all laughing)

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.920
 I think every film should be avid.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.800
 (all laughing)

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.880
 - I was looking at pranking.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.200
 And in the 19th century, electricity-based pranks

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.880
 were really fashionable.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.040
 'Cause they just discovered how to how to sort of wield electricity.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.000
 There were things on sale like electric hammocks.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.520
 You could buy, you lie in a hammock,

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.440
 it'd electrocute someone, that's quite fun.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.680
 (all laughing)

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.360
 Electric carpets, so someone's walking of your carpet

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.720
 and then you could, it's the same idea.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.560
 - Yeah.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.400
 (all laughing)

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.440
 - I read one that was called The Wireless Trick Telephone.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.280
 Did you hear about this one?

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.120
 - Yeah.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.960
 - Okay, The Wireless Trick Telephone.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.120
 This is the description for it.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.560
 When the candidate attempts to answer this phone,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.360
 a 32 caliber blank cartridge will explode

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.480
 with a loud report, and at the same time,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.840
 white powder will be blown with a strong blast

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.840
 from the transmitter into his face.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.000
 (all laughing)

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.320
 That's a full-on prank.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.440
 And then check this one out.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.320
 The pledge alter, right?

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.280
 This, if you bought it, is an alter.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.600
 It's the size of, like, we've all got alters in our home.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.440
 - Exactly.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.280
 (all laughing)

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.400
 - A very practical prank that you'd almost do daily.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.920
 - Is it for Vickers making pranks?

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.040
 - It must be right, who's using the pledge alter?

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.160
 (all laughing)

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.000
 Okay, well, let's picture it as there

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.240
 and that it is in the church.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.160
 This is what happens.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.000
 This is the description.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.480
 The candidate kneels before the alter in a darkened room

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 and when low, up before him jumps a skeleton

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.920
 with large illuminated glaring eyes,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.760
 a blank cartridge is exploding.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.120
 (all laughing)

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.600
 A stream of water hits him in the face.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.640
 - An electric shock is shot through his knees.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.440
 (all laughing)

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.480
 - April Fool's Day, pretty wild in the 1800s.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480
 That's amazing.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.440
 The original thing was about itching powder, wasn't it?

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.280
 - Yeah.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.640
 - And in World War II, the British put itching powder

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.040
 into German uniforms to try and, you know.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.520
 - I think this isn't the early days

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.440
 when we weren't sure we wanted to go all out.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.440
 (all laughing)

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.720
 - I'm sure we wanted to pull the full pledge alter drink

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.560
 on the Germans.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.400
 (all laughing)

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.560
 - Yeah, they called it itchkrieg, I believe, in the business.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.600
 (all laughing)

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.600
 No, they did call it that.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.440
 - No way.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.960
 (all laughing)

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.800
 - That's amazing.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.600
 But how do we get access to German uniforms

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600
 to put itching powder in them?

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.040
 - They infiltrated laundries.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.000
 So they had members of the resistance in Germany

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.520
 who would go into laundries and then, you know,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.080
 that, well, it's obvious from there.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.600
 (all laughing)

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.720
 But another thing that happened.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.760
 So in Norway, the Norwegian resistance,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.200
 when Norway was taken by the Nazis,

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.680
 the resistance coated condoms in itching powder

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.760
 and sold them to the Nazis.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.840
 - Wow.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.560
 - Which I think caused problems.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.400
 - Yeah.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.840
 (all laughing)

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.640
 - Be very stimulating for a second.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.280
 (all laughing)

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.200
 You're so positive about everything that.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.440
 (all laughing)

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.600
 - You know the seven year rich, it's a saying for,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.120
 after seven years in relationship,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.960
 it all goes sour or whatever.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.000
 It seems to be a thing that a lot of scientists

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.520
 do studies on to see when the actual time is,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.640
 it's not seven years, it's another time.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.600
 And obviously the newspapers pick up on it.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.160
 There was an article in the Daily Telegraph

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.720
 a couple of years ago that said it's actually

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.240
 a four year rich, not a seven year rich.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.120
 The Daily Mail seems to go for this almost weekly.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.120
 (all laughing)

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.520
 They have had various articles over the last few years

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.800
 that say, actually, rather than the seven year rich,

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.120
 humans have either a 12 year rich, a five year rich,

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.400
 an 11 year rich, a 25 year rich, a three year rich,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.480
 an 11 month age, or the most recent one I found

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.240
 was a two year six month and 25 day rich.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.480
 (all laughing)

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.800
 - I think someone has been supplying the mail HQ

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.720
 with these condoms that they've done in the describing.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.120
 It's been a very exciting few years for itch science,

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.960
 I think.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.800
 (all laughing)

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.960
 I've seen a number of, we've cracked a lot of mysteries

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.560
 in the last few years, 2011, they worked out

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.320
 why, they've worked out that itching is contagious.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.720
 So that's a big moment. - Yeah.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.080
 - And in 2014, they've worked out

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.000
 that scratching makes you want to scratch more.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.840
 - So when is that contagious?

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.840
 Do you mean from one person to another?

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.160
 - Yeah, so if I, if you start itching,

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.360
 I'll be like, oh, that looks good.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360
 And then I'll just do it.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.520
 - We've already established your itching fettish.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.520
 (all laughing)

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.280
 - The only reason Dan knows so much about itch science

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.760
 in the last few years is he subscribes to itch monthly.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.480
 (all laughing)

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.320
 Itch good.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.840
 (all laughing)

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:40.120
 You know, in cinemas, I don't know if anyone here

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.760
 knows about them, but I'd certainly never heard

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.240
 the cinemas used to have crying rooms.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.480
 Do you know about that?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.320
 Yeah, I know.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.840
 So immediately I thought it was for any sort of like

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.040
 the wall fans go, I'm not gonna cry here.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.520
 And then suddenly the notebook is really getting to them

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.600
 and they're just like, I'm just gonna be gone for a minute

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.840
 and they go into this room.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.040
 It turns out it's for babies.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.680
 It's mothers with babies.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.760
 They would go in there if it was crying.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.720
 So they could continue to watch the movie.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.600
 And it would be just a soundproof room.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.840
 They would have speakers coming in,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.840
 but they could watch it from in there

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.240
 and not have to miss the movie themselves.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.040
 Or fathers, that was really sexist of me,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.480
 fathers and babies.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.120
 That sounds like such a fantastic thing.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.840
 I quite like the idea of just being individual booths

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.680
 for everyone, so I don't have to be there

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.840
 anyone else in the cinemas.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.600
 I think that's called just your bedroom.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.440
 Yeah.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.960
 Or the CD or parts of Soho.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.600
 There are places where you can do that in.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 We're gonna have to move on.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.600
 We're gonna have to move on.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 We're gonna have to move on.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.080
 (all laughing)

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.240
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.360
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.720
 My fact this week is that

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.240
 defunct sports from the early 20th century

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.400
 include archery golf, boxing on horseback

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.520
 and competitive flag pole sitting.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.080
 (all laughing)

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.280
 This is from a book I read recently

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.560
 and it's such a good book.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.400
 I loved it so much.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.160
 It's called Fox Tossing Octopus Wrestling

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.560
 and Other Forgotten Sports

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.840
 by Edward Brook Hitching.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.480
 And it is electric.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.120
 It is sort of this list of incredible sports

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.560
 that we've forgotten about, so.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.880
 An archery golf just to confirm is archery hyphen golf,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.360
 not archery, comma, golf.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.720
 All right, 'cause you still have those.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.560
 Ah, yes, yes, yes.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.240
 This is where you have golfers and archers

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.160
 on the same course at the same time.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.000
 That's amazing.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.720
 (all laughing)

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.960
 'Cause I read an article where there was one person

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.000
 the archer was playing against the golfer

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.480
 is that there was that the standard way

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.880
 you'd have an archer versus a golfer.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.960
 If you archers take a 10-point handicap against golfers,

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.840
 'cause obviously they've got a bow and arrow.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.360
 (all laughing)

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.600
 So the archers fire their shots

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.120
 and everyone tees off from the same spot except

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.640
 the archers are firing towards the,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.480
 what was it called?

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.640
 (all laughing)

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.800
 Don't get all technical.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.200
 (all laughing)

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.120
 And so for the archers, the hole is something

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.320
 like a tennis ball balanced on a tink and you have to hit it.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.240
 And you have three different kinds of arrow that you use.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.480
 You have a light one for the first drive

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.120
 and then a really heavy one for the putting.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.520
 Yeah, and people played it until the 1970s as a sport.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.640
 Sounds great.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.560
 How about horse boxing?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.400
 Talk us through that.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.280
 Is that boxing against a horse?

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.360
 Yeah, no.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.120
 Is two guys sitting on the horseback and boxing each other

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.000
 and you lose if the other guy knocks you off your horse

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.360
 and you're unable to get back on within 10 seconds?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.200
 (all laughing)

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.560
 Well, it's similar to chess boxing, right?

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.440
 People like to inject boxing, I think,

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.240
 into other sports to make other sports more exciting.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.560
 Like chess boxing where you play a round of chess

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.720
 and then you do a round of boxing.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.320
 And I think the winner is the person either

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.000
 who manages to checkmate the other person

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.200
 or to knock them unconscious.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.360
 I don't really, it doesn't sound fair that, does it?

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.680
 'Cause I'm okay at chess,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.360
 but probably would get knocked out immediately in boxing.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.160
 So you have to get checkedmate pretty fast.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.120
 Well, that's, you've got to be multi-talented.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.120
 And also, you probably get increasingly worse at chess

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.360
 than all you are concussed.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.800
 (all laughing)

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.160
 Yeah, but then the other person

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.320
 doesn't get worse at boxing the more I put him closer to that area.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.480
 (all laughing)

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.120
 If anything, it'll only make him angry.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.120
 (all laughing)

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.520
 Just on the horseboxing thing,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.080
 you had to wear boxing gloves, obviously,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.240
 'cause they played by Queen's B rules,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.280
 but that made it very hard to grip the reins.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.120
 So most of the round involved lining your horse up next

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.280
 to the other guy's horse.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.480
 (all laughing)

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.720
 It's really hard to do with boxing gloves on.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720
 Yeah.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.960
 (all laughing)

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.440
 So a few other of the sports that was in that book,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.280
 I did have a look through the book and it's amazing.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.720
 Ice tennis, which seems really cool,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.080
 is literally what it says, it is.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.560
 Phone booth stuffing.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.920
 (all laughing)

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.840
 And the record is 25,

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.000
 just if anyone wants to go against it.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.920
 Yeah, and flag pole sitting, that's my favorite one.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.760
 Yeah, because they produced huge celebrities off the back of it.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.600
 (all laughing)

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.520
 No, honestly, so there was one guy, in particular,

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.280
 called Alvin Shipwreck Kelly.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.160
 So no one's quite sure why he's called Shipwreck,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.640
 other than he claimed to be involved in five shipwrecks.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.480
 And...

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.320
 That's probably why.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.320
 Well, no, but...

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 (all laughing)

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.760
 He claimed he'd been on the Titanic.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.680
 Yeah, but people aren't sure about that,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.200
 'cause the passenger records seem to not indicate a hint.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.480
 Yes, yeah.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.960
 His, I don't think you'd let someone

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.480
 call Shipwreck on the Titanic.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.880
 (all laughing)

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.400
 He probably gave him a false name.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.560
 John Iceberg Smith, welcome on board.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560
 (all laughing)

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.560
 They're all good, mate.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.560
 Nice to see you.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.840
 But pole sitting genuinely was, I think,

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.520
 a proper fad in the 1920s and 30s.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.040
 In America, people were really into it

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.560
 and constantly breaking records for it.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.880
 And so I was looking into the British newspaper archive

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.000
 during that time and we really disapproved of it.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.680
 Like every single article that references pole sitting

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.280
 in America talks about this degrading exhibition

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.320
 has now reached the dangerous stage.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.400
 So basically, I mean, the competition is you just sit

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.400
 at the top of a pole for as long as you possibly can

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.160
 until it gets uncomfortable and then you come back down.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.240
 We thought poles would be quite spiky at the top.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.400
 They opened up a platform.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.920
 I mean, I don't know what to do with that.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.240
 It's really, really tiny, you know?

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.000
 Yeah, but, you know...

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 (all laughing)

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.160
 Frozen balls, guys.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160
 (all laughing)

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.040
 71 hours was the record in the Don D'Courier

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.320
 that was reported.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.720
 Well, Shipwreck Kelly supposedly sat on it

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.200
 for 49 days and one hour.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.040
 Yeah, that's good.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040
 Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.280
 It's very much the Tiger Woods of pole sitting there.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.520
 (all laughing)

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.800
 He did a 28 city tour of sitting on poles.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.840
 And he did a tour and he charged people with roof access

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.680
 so that they could see him at the top of his pole.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.000
 So you bought tickets to the roof of buildings

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.600
 and you could watch him doing it.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.800
 He did it all through his life.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.960
 That's it, David Blaney, isn't it?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.800
 Yeah.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.960
 And he, for sleeping, obviously,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960
 'cause you would have to sleep a bit.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.240
 He would cut holes into the side of the flagpole

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.840
 and put his fingers in there.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.600
 And then if he slept and he started to sag right down,

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.400
 it would hurt his fingers and he'd sort of, you know,

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.560
 stay up there.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.400
 Like that.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.240
 Yeah, keep him up.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.080
 Keep him up there.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080
 It's a not career choice, isn't it?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080
 It is, yeah.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.640
 He died, you know, broke many years after the glory days.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640
 His career went downhill.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.160
 He got hit by a car.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.720
 And he, so he died from being hit by this car

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.960
 and they found on him a scrapbook of his life.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.320
 And it was called, the title was, "The luckiest fool on earth."

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.800
 Ooh, ironic.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.800
 Yeah.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.360
 I want to know, the name of this book

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.840
 was octopus, something, and fox tossing.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.600
 What's fox tossing?

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.040
 You have an arena, right?

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.440
 And you get men and women lined up opposite each other.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.800
 And you're all holding long, long strips of cloth,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.440
 loose and slack on the ground.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.160
 You release a load of foxes into the arena.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.320
 When they run over the bit that you're holding,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.800
 you and your partner pull it taut,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.080
 and the fox flies into the air.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.440
 That was a genuine sport that the aristocracy played

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.600
 in the 17th century in Europe.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.040
 And the fun was in seeing the foxes die.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.520
 The fun was in seeing the foxes fly through the air.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.160
 I think that's biostroporting.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.720
 Well, we're not all as wholesome as you, Anna.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.920
 I read an article about that, and the end of the article

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.200
 said it was not unknown for the terrified animals

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.560
 to turn on the tosses.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.640
 There was a spot in ancient Egypt called Fisherman's

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.600
 Jousting.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.080
 It was really popular.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.040
 And you would basically get people in boats,

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.600
 and they were joust against each other,

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.560
 trying to knock each other off the boat.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.320
 And it took place on the Nile.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.880
 But of course, the worst thing about the Nile

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.920
 is it's full of crocodiles.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.920
 And because the crocodiles were sacred,

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.600
 it was illegal to fight back.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.640
 That'll get you anywhere.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.000
 You'll be in big trouble, mister,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.120
 if you fight back against the crocodile that's eating you.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.920
 What legal sanction exactly can we work?

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920
 It's true.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.720
 It's a very much a no-win situation, isn't it?

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.360
 Do you know the national sport of Afghanistan?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.320
 No.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.840
 Is goat dragging?

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.200
 But Buzz Cashy, which is played in countries

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.320
 across Central Asia, but it's like Polo,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.400
 but with instead of a ball, a headless goat.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.560
 So the goat's been stied already, and you've removed the head.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.040
 Yeah, it's been stied already once you've removed the head.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.360
 I know.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.720
 I said that in the right order, I think.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.680
 It died, then you removed the head.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.680
 And then you have to drag it towards a goal,

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.800
 and then throw it through a goal.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.360
 I don't know why you'd use a goat instead of a ball,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.400
 maybe they're short and balls.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.160
 But that's the national sport of Afghanistan.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.680
 They love it.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.120
 Well, we would have used a pig splatter for soccer,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.840
 and black in the old days.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.040
 Not an entire pig, though.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.840
 No.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.800
 It's much more unwieldy.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.480
 And mill all, apparently, they do, though.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.040
 I don't know if you know about that.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040
 Can I tell you a bit more about flag poles?

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.560
 Yeah.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.280
 Just the flag-positing thing.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.880
 So I think the all-time champion of flag-pole setting

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.320
 was a saint called Simion Stylites, who lived up a pole

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.680
 for 36 years.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.800
 And he started with a flag-pole six feet off the ground.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.120
 Oh, sorry, not a flag-pole, but just

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.240
 a little platform on a pole.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.360
 And then he went to a higher one, until he eventually

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.160
 was 60 feet up in the air.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:44.840
 Why aren't you just--

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.640
 He lived up there.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.000
 And I read a book about early Christianity

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.600
 about this guy, and as it says, what was he doing?

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.080
 There are lots of theories as to why he did it.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.640
 Either he found the crowds who approached him asking

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.720
 for wisdom and advice to exhausting.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.520
 Or he-- I read one theory that he wanted to be physically

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.360
 closer to Christ, because Christ is in the sky.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.680
 Or he wanted just a more Spartan existence

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.040
 than he could get in a monastery.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.240
 And his Wikipedia page says, "It has been stated that,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.720
 as he seemed to be unable to avoid escaping the world horizontally,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.920
 he may have thought to attempt to try to escape it vertically."

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.160
 Nobody says what he did with his poo, though.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.000
 Because he'd have to drop it off, wouldn't he?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.800
 He just threw it, held it at those irritating people,

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.000
 constantly asking him for advice down at the bottom.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.960
 Because he still has followers, doesn't he?

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.520
 I think his most well-known followers,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.960
 guy called Maxime Cav Taradze, and he's a 59-year-old monk,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.160
 and he's been living on a stone pillar in Georgia,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.720
 and he comes down once a week.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.280
 But he spends basically his entire life up on top of this pillar.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.920
 He climbs his hundred and thirty-one foot ladder.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.200
 He has to have staff who pull by a pulley system his food

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.520
 and supplies up to him.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.200
 So these people need to be well-stuffed.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.480
 And yeah, he dropped down twice a week to give some advice

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.880
 to his following message, and then he pops back up onto the pillar

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.480
 and hangs out there.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.200
 What a good man.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.480
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.120
 So have we got anything thrown in before we go?

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.760
 The current setting up a poll competition record

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.760
 is held by a poll.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.320
 That's all.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:25.000
 His name is Daniel Baraniuk, and he is from Poland.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.760
 196 days for fans who are in.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.440
 OK, we are going to have to wrap up.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.040
 That is it.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040
 That is all of our facts.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.280
